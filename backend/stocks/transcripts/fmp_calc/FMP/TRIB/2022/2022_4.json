    "content": " Excluding our COVID focused PCR Viral Transport Media products, full-year 2022 revenues of $71.5 million were 1% lower than in 2021 and in Q4 2022 revenues were less than 0.5% lower than in Q4 of 2021. As highlighted by the 43% growth in sales of high-margin diabetes consumables in Q4 2022 versus Q4 2021, the increased instrument placements position the company for strong recurring revenues in contracted consumables sales over the next several years. In Q4 2022, gross profit was $6.2 million,   gross margin of 34.6%. In Q4 2021, gross profit amounted to $7.2 million and the gross margin of 37.1%. We have started to see the benefit of price increases and cost optimizations implemented in mid-to-late 2022 now starting to be realized, as seen by the fact of the Q4 2022 margin of 34.6% is higher than the adjusted Q3 2022 margin of 34.4% when excluding the significant excess and obsolescence charges related to inventory of $4.7 million reported in Q3. As Iris mentioned in Q4 2022, we saw run rate gross margins, excluding quarter and year-end inventory adjustments of approximately 40%. The majority of the options granted in Q4, 2022 are performance share options and are structured such that they are exercisable only if the company's ADS price increases to certain levels such as $3, $4, and $5 per ADS during the life of the option. In addition, in SG&A expenses we have seen increase in travel costs in Q4 2022, compared to Q4 2021 of approximately $300,000. We have recognized an impairment charge of $3 million in Q4 2022, compared to an impairment charge of $900,000 in Q4 2021. At December 31, 2022, two internally developed COVID-19 tests, one on a rapid lateral flow format and one an ELISA format, which had carrying values of $2.2 million and $0.1 million, respectively, within intangible assets, were reviewed for impairment under IFRS. Operating loss for the quarter was $7.8 million, which represents a decrease in profitability of $8.4 million, compared to Q4 2021 and was attributable to a lower gross profit, lower other operating income, and higher indirect costs. Financial income for Q4 2022 was $0.1 million, compared to $10,000 for Q4 2021. Financial expenses in Q4 2022 were $2.4 million, compared to $3 million in Q4 2021, a decrease of $600,000. The interest expense related to the senior secured term loan and the 7-year convertible note were $1.9 million and $0.3 million, respectively in Q4 2022. In Q4 2021 the cash and non-cash interest expense for the exchangeable notes was $1.2 million, which was reduced to almost zero in Q4 2022, due to the debt re-financing earlier in the year. Starting with revenues, as mentioned by Aris, total revenues for 2022 were $74.8 million, compared to $93 million in 2021. I think you mentioned hitting 40% gross margin adjusted this quarter, wondering if you expect to continue that in 2023 and then operating expenses as a whole, do you think that as you get revenue from TrinScreen and hopefully the diabetes business continues to perform well in the lab in the U.S.?"
