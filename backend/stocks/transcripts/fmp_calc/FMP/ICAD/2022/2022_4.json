Yeah, I mean I think you're right to highlight the sale and what that might mean to you know \u00e2\u0080\u0093 if it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a sale and it generates cash in a sale, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to obviously help our process for determining how much runway we have to get the detection business up and running or keep running and sort of you know follow through on everything that Dana started with. That would be good news right, and we would actually treat it a bit as you know an investment reserve, and assuming we create some really compelling ROI models from some of these areas as I mentioned that we could diversify into from a revenue standpoint, and we're going to be able to deploy right, that cash to bring those additional revenue streams online, so. Your line is live. In fact, I personally probably spend an hour so each day with the team working through details in terms of the architecture, the scaling helping Rad Partners think through how they are going to ramp up their business around it, so that's an exciting area of growth that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll see come online here in 2023 and then really begin to take hold in 2024. Your line is live. Your line is live. Your line is live. Okay, that's good color. Okay, that's good color."
