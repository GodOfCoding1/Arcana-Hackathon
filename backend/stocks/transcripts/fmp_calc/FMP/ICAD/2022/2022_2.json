    "content": " Our Q2 operating loss was $3.1 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2022, representing an increase of $0.2 million, or 6.7% versus $2.9 million last year, the increase of $0.2 million was the result of the $0.2 million increase in operating expenses previously discussed. But one way I think, to measure it is to look at the quotes that we have out there, right, and we have a significant increase in customers who not only are getting quoted ProFound AI, but are also getting the bundle with risk and density attached to it right and right now is we kind of look forward, it's at least half of our overall quotes that are going out the door so that's a really positive trend, right, and we will begin to see results from that in Q3."
