    "content": " Plastics has increased sales prices and decreased freight costs, which led to increased gross profit margins despite higher material costs in the third quarter. The increase in earnings was primarily driven by retail megawatt hour sales were up 18.4% quarter-over-quarter driven by increased volumes from commercial and industrial customers, primarily due to a new commercial customer in North Dakota. Net earnings for the Manufacturing segment increased $2 million from the same quarter a year ago, driven by a 17% increase in sales volumes at BTD as end market demand remains strong and our customers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 supply chains have begun to improve. With multiple resin price reductions and softening new home development during the third quarter, we have lowered our anticipated sales volume in the Plastics segment and are adjusting our 2022 diluted earnings per share guidance range to $6.42 to $6.72 from our previous guidance of $6.83 to $7.13."
