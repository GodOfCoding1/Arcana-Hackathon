    "content": " I think what we are seeing in terms of this extraordinary increase in sales prices is it is the demand that has been driving and if you look back to when these resins shortages started back in February of 2021, when we had the severe cold weather snap in the country and the resin manufacturers declared force majeure and puts constraints on resin supply while the demand never went away and that started to drive sales prices for the PVC pipe up and it just continued throughout 2021 and was even further exacerbated by the hurricane Ida which kind of restarted another concern over supply."
