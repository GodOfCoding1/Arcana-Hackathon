    "content": " So I think if you look at how we have called out the rents by jurisdiction, our annualized in-place rents and think about the inflation in all those various jurisdictions factor out where you are in North America versus Australia and Canada, the fixed components, you're probably running on a present run rate basis today of -- in the 5% range. I think from our perspective it has to be a really, really -- I guess, I may say it this way, the comparison between what we can buy out there versus buying back our stock, we always feel that when we're buying our assets, it's not just about buying inflation. I think for right now the way we view it, it's kind of attention with roughly $500 million of cash that you could call it borrowed at 3.6%. I think the third thing is that when we look at our first year yield and this is where it's hard to explain to investors, but the accountants, the GAAP accounting rules make us expense the origination SG&A, which distorts our EBITDA, when in our mind, it's part and parcel of buying assets, and we view it really as just CapEx. I don't -- right now in terms of sort of our crystal ball, I think we've been really steady for 10-plus years at around 1%, which is, I think, kudos to all of our underwriting and that team, which I'm not actually part of day-to-day, so I give them all the credit. Going forward, we don't see anything that's going to cause that because we tried really hard to make sure we're buying sites that we think will stand the test of time and being mission-critical. Well, first of all, I don't think we would necessarily take pause to wait until rates shake out because, as I mentioned earlier, we've got $500 million of investable cash roughly, at a 3.6% sort of cost of that debt."
