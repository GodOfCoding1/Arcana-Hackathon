    "content": " There are multiple attractive future use cases for hydrogen, and Hyzon is well positioned to facilitate those with our early mover status on trucks and our strong core technology position, enabling other fuel cell applications. When we set out on this journey to accelerate the rate at which heavy duty trucking can decouple from diesel, we were confident then, and we are much more confident now, that hydrogen is the long-term solution for the energy transition and that PEM fuel cells are fundamentally the future of engine replacement. According to industry estimates for Class 8 fuel cell vehicles, 160 kilowatt fuel cell, a 110 kilowatt per hour battery pack and hydrogen storage together cost approximately 30% to 50% lower than a 750 kilowatt hour battery pack used for a Class 8 BEV truck with a similar range and payload. The aforementioned customer-led solution is a great example of a nimble market disrupter that is able to formulate solutions with potential customers, whose demand for hydrogen fuel cell trucks continues to grow despite macro supply chain constraints. Because back to your kind of the basis of your question now, whether or not some of this view around the hydrogen fuel cell solution being kind of the future proof, zero emission versus battery electrification being kind of a stepping stone solution, that definitely has been informed by customer feedback all along. And by creating those tipping points around local hydrogen ecosystems and back to base trucking models, what we're doing is we're bringing low cost fuel to market that can then be used to penetrate adjacent  use cases and can also act as the base kind of nodes in a future network of longer haul trucking."
