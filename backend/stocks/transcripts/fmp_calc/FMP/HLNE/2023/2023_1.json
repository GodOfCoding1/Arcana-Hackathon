    "content": " AUM growth year-over-year, which was $16 billion, or 18%, came from both our specialized funds and customized separate accounts. Stepping back, the total amount raised for the fund now stands at nearly $1.8 billion, a level that surpasses the size of the prior fourth fund and already makes this our largest direct equity fund to date and with which we will still be in market through the fourth quarter of this year. Our specialized funds revenue increased by $10.3 million or 31% compared to the prior year driven primarily by $1.5 billion increased fee-earning AUM at our Evergreen platform, more than $600 million raised from our latest secondary fund in the quarter and over $1.7 billion raised through June from our latest direct equity fund. Moving on to customized separate accounts, revenue increased $3.9 million or 16% compared to the prior year period due to reups from existing clients, the addition of several new accounts and continued investment activity. Your line is open. I think the big picture takeaway is you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got a product that is still relatively young in its infancy sitting at $2.8 billion of capital raised and continuing to drive forward, continues to position us as a real differentiator among certainly our peer group in the space with what we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve done so far. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open."
