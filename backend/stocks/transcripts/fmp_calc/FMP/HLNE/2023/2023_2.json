    "content": " Moving on to our fee earning AUM, at quarter end, total fee earning AUM stood at $52.7 billion and grew $8.1 billion or 18% relative to the prior year, stemming from positive fund flows across both our specialized funds and our customized separate accounts. Taken separately, $4.9 billion of net fee earning AUM came from our customized separate accounts and over the same time period $3.1 billion came from our specialized funds. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve now expanded our efforts on both those fronts by bringing on two new partners to bolster our success and help us grow in the U.S. On October 5th, we announced a partnership with leading digital assets security firm, Securitize, where we will work with them to provide qualified U.S. investors with tokenized access to three Hamilton Lane funds, direct equity, credit and secondaries. Our specialized funds revenue increased by $21.1 million or 30%, compared to the prior year, driven primarily by $1.2 billion increase the fee earning AUM in our Evergreen platform, approximately $450 million raised in our latest secondaries fund in the quarter and approximately $1.8 billion raise to September from our latest direct equity fund. Retro fees for the year were approximately $1.2 million, stemming primarily from our direct equity fund versus a minimal amount in the prior year period. Moving on to customized separate accounts, revenue increased $8.2 million or 17% compared to the prior year period, due to reabsorb from existing clients, the addition of several new accounts and continued investment activity."
