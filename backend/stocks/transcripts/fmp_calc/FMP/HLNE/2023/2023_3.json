Over the past 12 months, we achieved positive net inflows of $4.1 billion, representing growth of 23% relative to the prior year period. Revenue increased $11.9 million or 16% over the prior year period due to  from existing clients, the addition of several accounts and continued investment activity. Revenue from our advisory reporting and other offerings decreased $1.5 million compared to the prior year period due primarily due to a decrease in revenue from our distribution management business, partially offset by increases in fund reimbursement and reporting revenue."
