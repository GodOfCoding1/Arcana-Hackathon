Good morning, and welcome to the Hamilton Lane Q3 fiscal 2022, Earnings Call. Before we discuss the Quarter's results, we want to remind you that we will be making forward-looking statements, based on our current expectations for the business. For a discussion of these risks, please review the risk factors included in Hamilton Lane fiscal 2021 10-K as amended, in subsequent reports, we filed with the SEC. Starting with the financial highlights, year-to-date our management and advisory fee revenue grew by 10%, while our fee-related earnings grew by over 13% versus the prior year period. We have also declared a dividend of $0.35 per share this quarter, which keep us on track for the 12% increase over last fiscal year equating to the targeted $1.40 per share for fiscal year 2022. Let me start by announcing an award won recently and while we have won this nine times prior, it still remains a significant and meaningful accomplishment to our firm. That is for the 10th consecutive year, Hamilton Lane was named a best place to work in money management by pensions and investments. We are extremely proud of this recognition and while the firm has experienced meaningful growth across our product lines, geographies and client base during the past ten years what has remained consistent throughout is our commitment to fostering a culture of excellence, innovation, and inclusion and at all times, striving to do the right thing for our clients, employees, and partners. Our total asset footprint, which we define as the sum of our AUM, assets under management and AUA, assets under advisement, stood at $851 billion, and represents a 30% increase to our footprint year-over-year, continuing our long-term consistent growth trend. AUM growth year-over-year, which was $22 billion or 29%, came from both our specialized funds and customized separate accounts, and continues to be diversified across client type, size of client, and geographic region. Our focus remains on growing and winning across both lines of business, and we are pleased with the continued success. As for our AUA, similar to that of our AUM growth was from across client type and geographic region and came in at $172 billion or 30% year-over-year. As we have mentioned on prior earnings calls, AUA can fluctuate quarter-to-quarter for a variety of reasons, but the revenue associated with AUA does not necessarily move in locksteps with those changes. Identify unique technology solution providers that we believe can help make us and the industry better, and we put our balance sheet capital behind them. And given how successful we've been here, companies now seek us out knowing that the partnership with Hamilton Lane can help speed their development, accelerate their growth, and expand their brand. Aside from implementing cutting-edge technology for our firm, we've also been instrumental in developing technologies that are widely used across the industry today. In addition, we generated attractive returns across our exhibit investments and remain enthused about the current slate of investments that remain on our balance sheet today. Given the continued activities in this area, the firm has decided it's appropriate that going forward, we will be carving off up to 15% of the realized gains to be included in our discretionary bonus pool. While this is a much reduced level from what we do on our carried interest program, we see this as a simpler way to reward employees and align with shareholders while keeping our fixed compensation cost well controlled. Now, let me provide a few specific updates on two strategic investments that have contributed to the quarter's results. As a result of the transaction, we recognized a $20 million unrealized gain on our investment. At this new valuation, our position is valued at nearly $60 million. Our evergreen platform provides private wealth channels and individual investors, with direct and immediate exposure to the private markets, by way of monthly subscriptions, and semi liquidity. For us, it represents perpetual fee-earning, AUM, where we earn management fees on net asset value. And we are able to earn carried interest at a rate of 12.5% over a hurdle of either 6% or 8%, depending on the deal type, and on a deal-by-deal basis. As these vehicles contain no primary fund exposure and are exclusively transaction-oriented, every invested dollar is eligible for carried interest. During the quarter, I'm proud to say that the platform surpassed the $2 billion AUM Mark. For fiscal year 2022, we are averaging nearly $100 million of monthly net inflows. Also noteworthy, flows for the month of January were directly in line with these levels, despite increased public market turbulence. We believe, and our results show, that our vehicles are seen as attractive to this retail market segment and we are well-positioned to benefit from this growing demand and general tailwinds. As a reminder, fee-earning AUM is the combination of our customized separate accounts and our specialized funds with basis point-driven management fees. Relative to the prior year period, total fee-earning AUM grew $5.9 billion or 15% stemming from positive fund flows across both our specialized funds and our customized separate accounts. Taken separately $3.3 billion of net fee-earning AUM came from our customized separate accounts and over the same time period, $2.5 billion came from our specialized funds. Last fiscal year, we benefited from the large amount of retro fees coming primarily from our fifth secondary fund, and that resulted in an elevated blended fee rate for fiscal 2021. Given the limited amount of retro fees, this fiscal year-to-date, our fee rates have trended back to more normalized levels. Fee-earning AUM for the period stood at $28.4 billion, growing 13% over the past 12 months. We continue to see the growth coming across institution type, size, and geography. As it relates to our existing client base, over the last 12 months, more than 80% of the gross inflows into customized separate accounts came from this groups. In addition to re-ups, we continue to expand our client base by winning and adding brand-new relationships, which in turn provide a growing base for future re-up opportunities. We are executing well across our product suite and demand remains robust coming, like the rest of our business, from a diversified set of investors around the globe. Over the past 12 months, we achieved positive net inflows of $2.5 billion resulting in a 17% increase in fee-earning AUM. And with that, I'll now I'll turn it over to Brian Gildea, our Global Head of Investments who will provide an update on some of our current funds in market as well as some detail on our overall AUM base. I'll now provide a few updates on funds currently in market, and I'll start with our direct equity fund, formerly known as our co-investment fund. During the fiscal quarter, we held a fifth close on $142 million of LP commitments, bringing the total capital rates to over $1.2 billion. A closed total of nearly $210 million, and is our largest first close in this product's history. As a reminder, our credit strategy has a relatively unique structure, whereby we are continually raising and deploying dollars simultaneously and earning management fees on invested capital. Therefore, it is less about targeting a set amount of dollars to raise, as you traditionally would see across funds with a multi-year deployment period. And more about ensuring that we sized the products in line with the current opportunity set, which can lead to some size variability from installment to installment. Lastly, is our second impact fund, which immersed directly into companies alongside meeting fund partners with a focus on environmental and to our social impact. During the quarter, we held a second close of nearly $50 million, which brings the total raised to approximately $200 million. This fund is already double the size of our first impact fund, and we're encouraged by the demand you're seeing in this space. It doesn't change dramatically over a quarter or in some cases even a year or more, and (b). Nonetheless, we know that some investors are interested in an update not only around our position, but more importantly, how we're seeing the overall industry growing and evolving. During the past five years,  shown that overall private markets net asset value has grown considerably. During this same timeframe, the mix of total industry, net asset value, has also shifted more to private equity as well, indicating both better relative performance and that investors are proactively shifting more allocated dollars to this strategy. In addition to this, fundraising for private equity, both traditional buyouts, and increasingly venture in growth equity has outpaced the other private market strategies. If we then turn to Hamilton Lane AUM, as of this fiscal third quarter, we have a total of $88.3 billion. This breaks down to $65.4 billion in private equity, $4.1 billion in private credit, and $10.8 billion in real assets. Including our invested AUA dollars, exposure to equity would be over $530 billion, credit would be over $56 billion and real assets would be over $163 billion. Our business today, however, does have a modest overweight relative to the overall market towards private equity. Among our clients\u2019 interest is highest around the private equity strategy as it has offered the most compelling performance, 2. It is, as shown in the fundraising chart, the absolute largest market segment, 3. Because it is the largest market segment, it offers the deepest opportunity set for secondary and co-investments, and finally, because of its return characteristics, are fees in this segment are generally higher than they are in either credit, or real assets. That said, we see all three segments as strategically important for our business. We remained focused as we have been across all three segments, and continuing to grow them all. The fact that we currently have dedicated products, in markets across all three areas speaks directly to that. For the first three quarters of fiscal 2022, we achieved solid growth in our business with management advisory fees of 10% versus the prior year period. And just to reiterate, as many of you are likely aware, investments that come into later closes of the fund raiser for many of our products pay retroactive fees, dating back to the funds first close. So maybe that's time for the quarter, in which subsequent close in the current. Revenue from our reporting and other offerings increased $8.9 million compared to the prior year period, driven by the revenue associated with the pre -existing funds managed by the 361 Capital team that we acquired in April of 2021. In addition, we saw a $4 million increase revenue compared to the prior year period in our distribution management business stemming from continued robust activity in the ICU market. Given the continued positive trend in valuations, the balance is up 114% from the prior year. Although now to some color on our earnings, our fee-related earnings were up 13% versus the prior year period. In regard to our expenses, total expenses increased $14.8 million, compared with the prior year period. Total compensation benefits were essentially flat, while G&A increased $14.7 million. Over the long term, we view these investments as an important component of our continued growth and we'll continue to invest our Balance Sheet capital alongside our clients. That product today includes and allows the ability for us to do not only secondaries, but also equity and credit co-investments. So while our aspirations in the retail side are significant, and we're really pleased with our growth to date, would feel like we are in very, very early innings of that success. I think over time, certainly we have aspirations and I think undoubtedly will launch other products. If I just may add one follow-on question just in terms of secondary market activity year-to-date in a more volatile backdrop, just wondering what you guys are seeing in terms of volumes. I think what you've seen is the secondary market has just been providing record amounts of deal flow, not only traditional deal flow, but as you mentioned GP led deal flow. We would just believe that part of this is just the maturing of the industry segment that people are finding more ways to generate liquidity, more ways to transact. Periods of market volatility also provide different opportunity sets, and so to the extent that you see that you could see additional growth. And I think that if you look at what people want, they want some single-manager structures, and they want some multi-manager restructures, which is what we offer. It is not competing if you will head on with the managers, you cited and there's robust demand for that as you might imagine, people want diversified portfolios and so they will put together different kinds of products in those portfolios. In terms of how that market develops, it's unlikely that it will develop any differently from how other markets have developed, when you think about what matters in any investment area. As you look at these products over some period of time, it will begin to distinguish among those features just as it has in public equity, in public debt. And just maybe quickly on incentive fees, Hamilton Lane generated about $60 million of incentive fees over the last four quarters in calendar '21. As we think about the next four quarters, I know it was Erik who said in his prepared remarks, you guys have no control over the timing and size, but you'll have a better view than we do. I think if you look historically at the data as public markets are more volatile, particularly if they're volatile in the downward direction, you tend to see exits across the private markets slowing. So I think there's no reason to expect that going forward, it will be different than what history has shown us. I think for us, will be not unique to that, but I think I would point back to the sort of massive diversification set of where our carried comes from. So it's coming across different geographies, it's coming across tons of different industries, it's also coming across very different sizes of business, and it's coming across different parts of the capital structure. That makes us a little bit more muted to the market volatility, just because you're able to pick up exits in different market segments depending on what's happening. But again, I wouldn't expect the future to be different from what we've seen historically. I mean, it's obviously very early, that volatility\u2019s only been for suite, so I would say the conversations have not -- people asked about it, but it has not affected behavior in terms of people's willingness or ability to commit and the denominator effect has not been a factor at this point. People are clearly focused on what does it mean in a potentially higher interest rate environment, essentially inflationary environment. And I would say it's interesting, I think it was either today or yesterday, the Future Fund of Australia, you may have seen sovereign wealth fund of Australia said that, they are reducing their commitments to public equity, and are increasing as they phrase it. Commitments to less liquid, skill-based investments, which is essentially private markets. So I think as people look at a public market environment, if it happens, where the returns are not, I'll call it as easy a lot of thoughts suggesting to make money in public markets. But easy in the sense of they're moving up, people do tend to focus, particularly people with experience in private markets on that part of the market. But when you hear something like that and think about how people look at what might happen over the next couple of years, private market has become a little more interesting for many investors. If you think about private credit and real assets in terms of mix, maybe three or five years from now, do you think that that some  would increase relative to where it is today, just given you also mentioned that the private equity industry maybe mature in more as it benefits in the secondary market? Just making guesses, but I would think that private credit and real assets will continue to grow. Private credit, even with the rising rates, remains very attractive, and so I think you will continue to see a migration from public credit into private credit. And real assets driven by things that people have talked about, I think will continue to grow. But again, in an environment where the public equity market is not doing as well as it has over the last few years, the interest in private equity and in liquid equity will continue to increase. So, I would say there's a pretty favorable trend behind all three of those areas. I think as you heard in the tools section, I think we've done a very good job of managing compensation. The rent is now all flowing through, but I think the return to normal is still occurring slowly here. So while we have teams on the road and we're traveling, I think after two years of this, there also a lot of clients who have adopted to a world where they're happy to do things remotely. I don't -- there's not really any trends that we can point to that says, this is happening, either more or less than it has in the past couple of years. I wanted to go back to the Evergreen funds, you were going a little quickly when you were going over how much of months you're raising and kind of want to get a better sense of the trajectory there. I think what you would have heard us say in the script here is that we have been on a very, very steady pace that has been averaging over the last, call it year, about a $100 million of net in-flows per month. I think we made the point that even in January this past month calendar, past month, those flows stayed incredibly -- they were the same. But we view that not as a market sizing issue, but simply as a maturity of the market that the product has simply just had a big head start on its U.S. counterpart. So what our expectation is, is that the product needs to continue to scale in order to attract significant warehouse attention. So we're achieving these flow levels with our own distribution team in-house, targeting a variety of different underlying wealth channels across geographies. We would see that as incredibly good news and also, again, to your point, massive whitespace ahead of us. And next question comes from Finian O'Shea, with Wells Fargo Securities. So I would say the first part of that is we've just launched the product that's been publicly announced, but we intentionally just because, again, it's just hit the market. On the GP led component of that, we're not seeing a lot of stratification and you're seeing GP led across size of fund, size of transactions, you are seeing it across different industries, different geographies but I think to date, it's still largely opportunistic and fund managers like us are kind of handling it that way."
