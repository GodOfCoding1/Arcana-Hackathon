    "content": " Consistent with prior quarters, AUM growth year-over-year, which was $23 billion or 34% came from both our specialized funds and customized separate accounts and continues to be diversified across client type, size of client and geographic region. Relative to the prior year period, total fee-earning AUM grew $3.8 billion or 10%, stemming from positive fund flows across both our specialized funds and our customized separate accounts. As we look forward in terms of what can, kind of, keep it going up or what could sort of pull it back, I think on the keep it going up, obviously, kind of continued growth as we've been experiencing around specialized funds, Evergreen, all of that is a positive driver to margin. So I think we sit here today excited about the fact that coming out of the gate with infra, first close that's already kind of close to $350 million, I think all that just sort of bodes well for the future. I think on the fee pressure, I think if you talk to our hiring managers, if you talk to departmental managers, they would tell you that right now in today's market, there are certain areas, certain skill sets that are just in high demand, whether those are software development or IT oriented or whether they are back-office specialists or valuation experts, things that are kind of designed around people kind of continuing to grow and scale their businesses and needing operational support."
