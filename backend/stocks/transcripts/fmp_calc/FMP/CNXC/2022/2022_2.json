    "content": " Revenue increased 10% compared to last year on an adjusted constant currency basis, pro forma for the impact of businesses acquired and divested since the start of the prior year second quarter. Turning to profitability, non-GAAP operating income was $213 million in the second quarter, compared with $172 million last year. This equates to 7% to 9% revenue growth on an adjusted constant currency basis, pro forma for the impact of businesses acquired and divestitures since the start of the prior year third quarter. We expect interest expense in the third quarter to be approximately $19 million to $20 million, with an effective tax rate of approximately 24% to 25%, and a weighted average share count of approximately 52 million shares. Turning now to our outlook for the entire year, based upon our strong performance year-to-date, while also adjusting for an additional negative foreign exchange impact on reported revenue of about 1%, we now expect 2022 revenue to be in a tightened range of $6.365 billion to $6.415 billion. Our pipeline continues to grow, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re winning the deals that we want to win, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re seeing good cross synergies with our Catalyst business at a pipeline of just in that alone $100 million of net new sort of opportunities that have come into our pipeline and I think that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s reflective of our guidance and confidence that from Q3 to Q4, we can see the increase at that 7% range to get to our midpoint of our guide."
