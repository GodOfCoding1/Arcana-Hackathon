    "content": " Our third quarter non-GAAP operating income improved to $221 million, growing 22% and adjusted EBITDA increased 20% to $258 million compared with last year. We expect interest expense in the fourth quarter to be approximately $28 million, with an effective tax rate of 24% to 25% and a weighted average diluted share count of approximately 51.5 million shares. Chris, I think what you said was the revenue from new economy clients grew about 27% year-on-year in the quarter. And so we expect that the new economy clients still to be very robust growth, still be above our sort of corporate average, and we're super happy with sort of the portfolio of the clients we had because you've got to remember, a chunk of our new economy clients are from different regions and not North American based, which provides some diversification of that revenue flow. If you go back to when we announced the deal, we thought that the integration cost would be roughly $44 million over the process, and we think we're in line with that, having spent what we spent in the third quarter, suggesting we'll spend another $15 million in Q4 and then some still to come in probably in the first half of next year."
