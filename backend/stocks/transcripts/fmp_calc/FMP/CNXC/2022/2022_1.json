    "content": " Our first quarter non-GAAP operating income of $202 million was up 14%, and adjusted EBITDA increased 12% to $238 million compared with last year. New economy client revenue increased 47% to over $350 million in the quarter, positioning us to exceed $1.4 billion in revenue on an annual basis for these clients. Profitability in the first quarter reflects flow-through from revenue growth with existing and new clients; contributions from PK and increased pricing, offset by the surge of COVID cases globally, which impacted staff availability; the Philippines typhoon; investment in new program ramps; and wage inflation."
