    "content": " The pro forma combination of the company is expected to have $9.8 billion in revenue for fiscal year 2023, operate in 70-plus countries, of which over 25 are new to Concentrix and serve more than 320 new economy clients and 155 Fortune Global 500 clients, with approximately 2,000 total clients very nicely distributed globally. Together, the top 5 clients are expected to account for only 20% of the combined company's revenue and the revenue split between our enterprise and new economy companies will stay roughly in similar proportion to what it looks like now at Concentrix. This includes cash and stock as follows: approximately 14.9 million shares of Concentrix stock at closing, EUR 500 million in cash at closing, EUR 700 million in deferred consideration in the form of a note payable to Webhelp shareholders in 2 years, which will bear interest at 2%. From a valuation standpoint, we are paying about 9.5x Webhelp's anticipated 2023 adjusted EBITDA, reflecting the $120 million in run rate synergies we expect to realize. We expect interest expense in the second quarter to be approximately $38 million, with an effective tax rate of 26% and a weighted average diluted share count of approximately 52 million shares."
