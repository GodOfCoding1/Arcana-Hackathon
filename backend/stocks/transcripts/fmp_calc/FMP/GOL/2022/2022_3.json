    "content": " By acting assertively and managing capacity and improving productivity, we maintained the growth of our revenues and our operating results during this period, recording the highest quarterly revenue figures in the Gol's history, reaching BRL4 billion in third quarter, 109% and 80% above of 3Q 2021 and 3Q 2019 figures respectively. Having said, we have, as you've seen, if you compare our consecutive revisions to the fleet plan, over the last couple of years, we have consistently and gradually revised down the portion of the fleet for the next couple of years that will be a MAXs and so we are keeping the NGs, if you're a roll back all the way back to say 2017, 2018 was our fleet plan with the MAX, we would have had, a little over 60 MAXs in the fleet at the end of this year and we're targeting 44. Almost back to pre-pandemic levels, at the 11 hours of utilization, we still need to squeeze another one hour a day out of the aircraft and we expect to start or to be in the first quarter towards the end of the first quarter 2023 with improved above, getting back to that full peak productivity yields going forward are expected to have a more flat behavior versus 2022. Of course, we're going to navigate through the seasonality of next year, but we want to start 2023 by having the, let's say, the levels of productivity at least compared to the -- what we had in 2019. Please go ahead, sir. So it's basically, and it's basically fully financed those new edges can be used in operations which will allow us to also manage our capacity effectively through the high season as I kind of -- been trying to obviously you have to look at how we're managing the company today reflects. Please go ahead, sir."
