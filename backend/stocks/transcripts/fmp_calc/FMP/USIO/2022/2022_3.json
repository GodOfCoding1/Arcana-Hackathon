    "content": " Given the expectation Louis mentioned regarding the recognition of significant spoilage and breakage revenue in the fourth quarter, this will once again be a record year for prepaid and more importantly, a year in which we strengthen our product set, diversify our client base and expand our opportunities to grow in new large markets. Revenues for the quarter ended September 30, 2022, were $16.4 million, an increase of 4% compared to the same period last year. Looking at non-GAAP adjusted operating cash flow, which excludes nonoperational changes in merchant reserve funds, prepaid card load assets, customer deposits and net operating lease assets and liabilities over the first 3 quarters of the year was a use of $1.1 million."
