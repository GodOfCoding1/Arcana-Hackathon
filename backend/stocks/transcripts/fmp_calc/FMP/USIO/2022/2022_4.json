    "content": " For the quarter, we reported $1 million in adjusted EBITDA, though EBITDA was down for the year primarily due to a shift in our revenue mix driven essentially by the decrease of our highly profitable ACH business. We also ended the year in a strong financial condition, with cash on hand of $5.7 million as we generated $1.2 million in cash in the fourth quarter of 2022. Prepaid had a strong fourth quarter with revenue up 31%, which helped us finish the year with record revenue up 39% from 2021. While load and purchase volumes were down in the quarter from a year ago, when our New York City contract was peaking, they were up 46% and 49%, respectfully and sequentially from the third quarter, clearly indicating we have resumed our growth trajectory. Revenues for the quarter ended December 31, 2022 were up 7% compared to the same period in 2021, primarily on the strength of our prepaid and output solutions businesses. Non-GAAP adjusted operating cash flow, which excludes nonoperational changes in merchant reserve funds, prepaid card load assets, customer deposits, and net operating lease assets and liabilities was a positive $0.7 million for the year, down from a positive $2.6 million in 2021. So, assuming no appreciable deterioration in economic conditions, we expect 2023 to be another year of strong growth, with revenue up 18% to 20% and we also expect to generate both, positive operating cash flows and adjusted EBITDA."
