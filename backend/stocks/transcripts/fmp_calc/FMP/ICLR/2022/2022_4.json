    "content": " We continued our progress in reducing our floating-rate debt exposure by making a $200 million payment on our Term Loan B facility in quarter four, bringing total repayments for full year to $800 million and resulted in a ratio of 2.9 times net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA at the end of the quarter. We are reaffirming our full year 2023 financial guidance that was issued in January, with revenue with a range of $7.94 billion to $8.34 billion, representing growth of 2.6% to 7.7% on a year-over-year reported basis; and adjusted earnings per share in the range of $12.40 to $13.05, representing 5.5% to 11.1% growth on a year-over-year basis. Your line is open. Your line is open. In terms of the movement in the mix of backlog year-over-year, let's say end of year '21 to end of year '22, I wouldn't say that we've seen a significant increase in the FSP proportional to the full service outsourcing. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. And we're all long-term contract businesses, so the contracts you're working in Q4 are pretty much the same ones you're working on in Q1, so I think the moral of the story is about the incremental growth obviously, But there's obviously a very, very hard FX comp with the dollar, where it's obviously significantly moved during the summertime of 2022. Your line is open. Your line is open. So while I think you - maybe the margin expansion from Q1 to Q4 of '23 may not be as spectacular as we saw in during '22, the full year-over-year margin profile will have stepped up quite nicely off the back of the work done during '22, kind of delivered in quarter four, 2022 and then sustained and built on in a more - in a smaller way, but still building quarter-over-quarter as we go through '23. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open."
