    "content": " With the addition of the new awards in Quarter 1, our backlog grew to a record $19.6 billion, representing an increase of 2.7% on Quarter 4 of 2021, or an increase of 9.8% year-over-year on a combined company basis. Overall we continue to expect the full-year 2022 adjusted effective tax rate to be approximately 16.5%.Adjusted net income attributable to the group for the quarter was $228 million, a margin of 12%, equating to diluted earnings per share of $2.76, an increase of 27% year-over-year. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. So you've seen a decent performance we feel in the 6 and 7.8% on a constant currency basis in Quarter 1, Quarter 2, is a tough quarter from a comparative perspective given that big bolus of work we saw coming through from the COVID work in Q2 next year, I'll just say once we get through Q2 into Q3 and Q4, we are obviously back to that high single-digit profile and that is how we're thinking about the remainder of the year. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. We see as I said, continued success in winning Biotech and small Pharma work of a large Pharma business was particularly strong in Quarter 1 and it had a very good quarter as did our Biotech business, so I really there's not much to call out in terms of FSP."
