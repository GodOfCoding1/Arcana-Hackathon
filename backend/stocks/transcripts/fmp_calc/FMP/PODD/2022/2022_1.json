    "content": " Despite a shift in U.S. volume into the pharmacy channel, global pod utilization also remained consistent with historical seasonality as we typically see a sequential decrease in the first quarter of the year driven by the U.S. Drug delivery revenue increased 36%, exceeding our guidance range due to production timing. For U.S. Omnipod, we expect to continue to build momentum with growth of 21% to 24%, driven by the benefits of our recurring revenue model and growing Omnipod DASH volume through the U.S. pharmacy channel. We expect Q2 international Omnipod growth of 9% to 12%, driven by continued Omnipod DASH adoption, partially offset by the compounding impact from lower new customer starts in 2021, largely due to the pandemic and competitive AID headwinds. Jeff, we're doing a lot of work now to prepare for the launch of Omnipod 5 outside the U.S. And contrasting it to our DASH launch, if you remember when we got approval for DASH, it was pretty quickly that we rolled out to all of our markets internationally and very quickly got to almost 100% of all new starts on DASH. I guess, one, are you seeing some of the Omnipod 5 excitement starting to build, giving greater visibility that it's coming with the CE mark filing and U.S. approval, so seeing some pull forward as Bret mentioned earlier with U.S. And it would seem that based on the second quarter guidance coming off of this better 1Q that you could be trending towards the high end of your full year range. As you heard today, Insulet is delivering terrific results and is poised for even greater growth and value creation for our shareholders and people with diabetes across the globe as we progress toward the full U.S. commercial launch of Omnipod 5."
