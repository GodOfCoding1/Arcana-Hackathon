    "content": " Operating expenses were slightly higher than our expectations to support higher demand for Omnipod 5 and were higher than Q3 of last year due to continued investments in sales and marketing, such as our Omnipod 5 launch efforts, development work to advance our innovation pipeline and costs to scale our business to support our growth. And for 2023, given the expectation for gross margin and the continued investments to launch Omnipod 5 in the U.S. and international markets as well as ongoing innovation, clinical, commercial and support functions to scale the business and costs associated with our implementing a new enterprise reporting system, we expect operating margins to be similar to 2022."
