Fleet revenue increased 12% year-over-year in the second quarter, driven by strong growth with commercial fleet customers and e-commerce fulfillment sales, together with steady contributions from the U.S. We continue to experience strong demand for aftermarket parts servicing medium and heavy duty fleets across our commercial distribution and e-commerce fulfillment channels."
