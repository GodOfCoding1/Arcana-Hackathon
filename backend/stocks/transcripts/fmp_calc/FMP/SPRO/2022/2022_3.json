    "content": "  Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that some of the information presented on this conference call contains forward-looking statements based on our current expectations including statements about the future development and commercialization of SPR720, SPR206, and tebipenem HBr; and the design initiation timing, progress, and results of the company's preclinical studies and clinical trials and its research and development programs; management's assessment of the results of such preclinical studies and clinical trials; the company's cash forecast and anticipated expenses and its sufficiency of its cash resources. This year-over-year decrease was primarily due to a $4.5 million reduction in direct costs associated with program activity for tebipenem HBr, a $1.2 million decrease due to reduced clinical activity during the period for SPR206 and a decrease in personnel-related costs of $2.7 million related to a reduction in research and development headcount due to the May 2022 strategic restructuring; partially offset by $1.3 million of increased costs due to increased clinical and preclinical activity for SPR720."
