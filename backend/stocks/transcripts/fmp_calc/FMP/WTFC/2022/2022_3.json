    "content": " The overhead ratio was up a little bit, but we expected on an overall basis year-to-date, it's 1.35% but 1.53% this quarter, as Dave will discuss, we had to take some extra compensation because of how well the quarter is going. Loans were up $1 billion or more, up $750 million, if you think of average versus quarter-end. During the quarter, the rise in interest rates resulted in an additional tax adjusted unrealized loss of approximately $142 million on the AFS securities. Second, as we experienced increasing rates, we continue to believe each 25 basis point increase in the Fed funds rate will generate approximately $40 million in pre-tax net interest income on an annualized basis. And as we also discussed last quarter, with higher rates and more typical loan growth, the company's earnings are projected to result in organic improvement to capital levels in the coming quarters. For the third quarter of 2022, net interest income totaled $401.4 million, that was an increase of $63.6 million as compared to the prior quarter, and an increase of $114 million as compared to the third quarter of \u00e2\u0080\u009821. The net interest margin, as -- Ed and Tim referred to improved 42 basis points from the prior quarter to $3.35 million. On the non-interest expense side of the house, non-interest expenses totaled $296.5 million in the third quarter and were up 3%, or approximately $7.8 million when compared to the prior quarter total of $288.7 million. Commercial premium finance also had a very strong quarter with loans of $172 million, C&I loans increased by $212 million, and commercial real estate grew by $171 million. Also, we experienced a $10 million increase in NPLs in our commercial premium finance portfolio, resulting from a handful of loans over 90 days past due at quarter end."
