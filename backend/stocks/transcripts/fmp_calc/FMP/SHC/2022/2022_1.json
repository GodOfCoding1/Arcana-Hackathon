    "content": " Based on the solid start to 2022 and given that it's still early in the year, we are reaffirming the outlook that we communicated in our last call with revenue and adjusted EBITDA growth in the range of 7% to 11% and adjusted EPS growth of 6% to 13%. On a consolidated total company basis for the first quarter of 2022, revenue grew by 12% as compared to the first quarter of last year to $237 million. For Nelson Labs, Q1 revenue declined by approximately 3% to $53 million compared to the first quarter of 2021, and segment income declined by approximately 26% to $17 million. So you're getting -- really, you're going to be getting a full quarter's worth of incremental contribution from RCA, at least through the first three quarters of this year and then a partial in the fourth quarter. So I think you -- as you guided us to expect pricing in Nelson is in the mid-3% range, and that's what you got last year, are you able to kind of get more -- I think that's the more price sensitive of your businesses."
