    "content": " Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on Sotera Health's second quarter 2022 earnings call. For the first half of 2022, Sotera Health has total revenue growth of 8.5% and adjusted EBITDA growth of 4.8% versus the first half of 2021. At this point in the year, we now estimate the risk of potential disruption in Russia supply at 1% or less of Sotera Health's total 2022 revenues. Nelson Labs, our third reporting segment also recorded a strong second quarter, improving upon some operating headwinds that exist in the first quarter 2022. As Michael mentioned, we had a very strong second quarter of 2022, the highest revenue and adjusted EBITDA quarter in our history. On a consolidated total company basis, revenue grew by 6% as compared to the second quarter of last year to $267 million. Adjusted EBITDA margins were 51.1%, representing a 240 basis point decline from second quarter 2021 levels, but still reflective of strong capacity utilization and throughput. The adjusted EBITDA margin decline compared to second quarter 2021 was driven primarily by timing of pricing actions versus realized inflation at Sterigenics, less favorable product mix at Nordion, and an unfavorable, but improving margin profile at Nelson Labs. It's important to note that Nelson Labs did incrementally improve margins by 400 basis points versus first quarter of 2022 margin levels, which I'll discuss in more detail in a moment. Our strong operating performance drove adjusted earnings per share of $0.27, an increase of $0.01 from second quarter of 2021, which again was our highest adjusted EPS period before this quarter. In Q2, Sterigenics delivered 9% revenue growth to $158 million and 7% segment income growth to $85 million as compared to Q2 of last year. Compared to the second quarter of 2021, segment income margins contracted by 90 basis points to 53.9%, driven by foreign currency headwinds and the timing of contractual pricing actions versus realized inflation. Nordion's margins were 59.4%, a 410 basis point decline from second quarter 2021 peak margin levels. For Nelson Labs, Second quarter 2022 revenue improved 1.3% to $58 million compared to the second quarter of 2021."
