    "content": " Year-to-date, including our $21 million acquisition in July, we have closed on 4 communities containing 718 sites for a total purchase price of $38 million. If market conditions allow, we can also redeem our $215 million 6.375% Series D perpetual preferred stock. Normalized FFO, which excludes nonrecurring items, was $8.7 million or $0.16 per diluted share for the second quarter of 2022 compared to $10.3 million or $0.22 per diluted share for 2021. As we had previously announced on July 26, 2022, we redeemed all 9.9 million shares of our 6.75% Series C perpetual preferred stock for a total of $247 million. Additionally, if market conditions allow, we can redeem our $215 million 6.375% Series D perpetual preferred stock. Rental and related income for the quarter was $42.2 million compared to $39.3 million a year ago, representing an increase of 7%. Sales profitability was $943,000 in net profit this quarter compared to $1.2 million a year ago. As we turn to our capital structure, at quarter end, we had approximately $626 million in debt, of which $469 million was community-level mortgage debt, $58 million was loans payable and $99 million was our newly issued 4.72% Series A bonds. At quarter end, UMH had a total of $215 million in perpetual preferred equity, not including the $247 million Series C preferred stock, which was redeemed on July 26. Our preferred stock, combined with an equity market capitalization of $965 million and our $626 million in debt, results in a total market capitalization of approximately $1.8 billion at quarter end. We sold an additional 857,000 shares of common stock through the ATM at a weighted average price of $23.73 per share, generating gross proceeds of $20.3 million and net proceeds of $19.9 million after offering expenses. And so if you look out 5 years and say, we're going to add 4,500 rental units at better than $10,000 per year, we're going to have our 4% rent increases for 5 years, we're going to do 1,000 units per year in acquisitions and we're going to build 400 lots per year for 5 years, the growth in FFO over 5 years at better than a 50% expense ratio, better than meaning that the expenses are less than 50%, gets extremely exciting for what it can do to UMH shareholders. But our sales pipeline at any given time has between $4 million and $5 million in pending deals, and it's really just a function of when we get those homes and when those deals actually close. If I may, because I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been around a long time, I was around for the Volcker years, and we were very surprised what happened then when interest rates went to 12%, 14%, 15%, we had an amazing increase in the demand for manufactured homes."
