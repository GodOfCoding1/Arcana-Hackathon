    "content": " But in those results, the $0.07 per share of earnings from HOS in 2021, was mostly offset in 2022 by the interest income and earnings from the revenue sharing agreements in place as a result of the sale of HOS late last year. As you will recall, the $2.5 billion total capital investment plan for 2022 includes the $235 million anticipated acquisition of the city of York's wastewater system that we're very excited about. As expected, we saw much of that revenue increase related to new rates in the first quarter of 2022, including in Pennsylvania, which recorded a full quarter of the base rate increase from last year, as well as the step increase effective January 1 of this year. Moving on to slide 8, as we announced yesterday, our Board of Directors increased the company's quarterly cash dividend payment from $0.6025 per share to $0.6550 per share, and nearly 9% increase, including this year's expected increase, we have grown our dividend at a compound annual growth rate of 9.6% over the last several years, significantly outpacing most of our utility peers. Next week, we'll also be making an initial filing related to our general rate case in California, which is in keeping with the state's three year cycle, the California case will seek to recover nearly $600 million of forecasted capital investments and will include several closed and pending acquisitions. Turning to slide 14, and the acquisition piece of our growth triangle, we were excited to announce on April 14 that the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission approved our application to purchase the city of York's wastewater system for $235 million, signed just one year ago, York is the largest municipal acquisition in Pennsylvania American Water\u2019s history and as being executed under Pennsylvania's fair market value legislation. Yes, it's a good question. Yes, it's a good question."
