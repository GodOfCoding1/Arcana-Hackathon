On the call with me today are DJ Busch, President and Chief Executive Officer; Mike Phillips, Chief Financial Officer; Christy David, Chief Operating Officer; and Dave Heimberger, Chief Investment Officer. During today's presentation, the team will provide an overview of InvenTrust's first quarter operational and financial highlights, along with an update on our 2022 guidance. Before the team starts with the prepared remarks, I would like to remind everyone that today's discussion may contain forward-looking statements about the company's views on the future of our business and financial performance, including forward-looking earnings guidance and future market conditions. Any forward-looking statements speak only as of today's date, and we assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements made on today's call or that are in the quarterly financial supplemental or press release. The comparable GAAP financial measures are included in this quarter's earnings materials, which are posted on our Investor Relations website. With over 90% of our income coming from the Sun Belt region, InvenTrust is a clear publicly traded shopping center leader in these markets with the goal of further increasing our concentration through strategic capital allocation over time. For investors interested in allocating a portion of their portfolio to a central retail in the Sun Belt, InvenTrust is and will continue to be the natural choice for this investment thesis. One is our disciplined capital allocation as demonstrated by our $100 million Dutch tender completed in November of 2021, where we repurchased 4 million shares at $25 per share. Next, InvenTrust's focus on both internal and external growth continues to be on full display from our solid same-property NOI growth and through the acquisition of additional premier Sun Belt properties. First, the Board authorized and approved a new $150 million share repurchase program. Then in March, as a logical next step following our listing, we established a $250 million ATM offering program providing efficient access to the capital markets. According to the published report, the key drivers for the rating were InvenTrust's conservative balance sheet, Sun Belt concentration, grocery-anchored assets and solid tenant diversification. We are pleased with our investment-grade rating, and we believe that it reflects the quality of our cash flow driven by our simple and focused Sun Belt portfolio strategy and most importantly, our team's dedication to a best-in-class capital structure. Our Sun Belt markets have benefited from in-migration for the last decade, and we have seen these trends only accelerate following the pandemic and should continue for years to come. Our markets have the right components to generate superior risk-adjusted returns above other regions, we believe are centers will provide sustainable rent growth and ultimately, value creation opportunities in the near and long term. Our assets within these markets continue to present significant leasing demand, stable rent with healthy occupancy levels and accretive redevelopment opportunities. For the first quarter, the company produced $31.7 million of NAREIT FFO or $0.47 per share. Our core FFO grew to $29 million or $0.43 per share, a year-over-year increase of 39%. The increase in both NAREIT and core FFO for the first quarter of 2022 was largely driven by an increase in same-property NOI of $0.06 per share, G&A savings of $0.03 due to nonrecurring costs of our succession planning in 2021 and a positive $0.03 impact from our $100 million share repurchase in Q4 of last year. As our first quarter performance shows, our simple and focused strategy is producing strong financial and portfolio results for InvenTrust leading us to adjust our 2022 year-end guidance, which we will talk through momentarily. InvenTrust's pro rata same-property NOI for the quarter reached $38.7 million, growing 12.2%. The increase in pro rata same-property NOI was primarily driven by contractual rent increases, occupancy gains and the timing of collections of cash basis tenants. As of March 31, we had $262 million of total liquidity, including $214 million of capacity remaining on our revolving credit facility and over $48 million of cash on hand. Our leverage targets remain the same, net debt to adjusted EBITDA in the range of 5 to 6x and net leverage in the 25% to 35% range with some quarter-to-quarter fluctuations as we evaluate potential acquisition and portfolio recycling opportunities. As a result of our first quarter performance, InvenTrust is modifying our full year 2022 guidance. We are raising our NAREIT FFO guidance to $1.58 to $1.64 per share, and we are tightening our core FFO range to $1.51 to $1.56 per share. Another point to note, we expect our quarterly FFO growth to moderate as we progress throughout the year. While we anticipate our EBITDA to increase every quarter in 2022, rising interest rates will have an impact on our FFO in the back half of the year. Our G&A will be slightly lower, which results in core FFO growth close to double digits, while prudently putting permanent debt financing in place to further solidify our debt structure. Significant interest is coming from retailers in many different segments, including retailers such as Sephora, MOD Pizza and Athletico Physical Therapy, all of whom are expanding their presence in our Sun Belt markets. InvenTrust's leased occupancy for the first quarter was 94.4%, 50 basis points above Q4 2021 and 150 basis points above Q1 of last year. Our anchor lease percentage increased to 96.6% and our small shop hit 90.5%, increases of 80 basis points and 290 basis points year-over-year, respectively. Our annual base rent as of March 31 for the pro rata combined portfolio was $8.64, an increase of 2.2% compared to the same period in 2021. Not only are we limiting downtime and capital spend, we are also able to push rents on these renewals as evidenced by our 4.4% lease spreads. These healthy retention and occupancy rates demonstrate that our properties are a great place for our tenants to successfully operate their businesses, but we believe the final piece to our success is the relationships and service level our team provides our tenants. Understanding and communicating with our tenants is embedded in our local operating teams, which leads to our ability to quickly respond to our tenants' needs, generate marketing ideas and business-related solutions as well as provide our tenants a wide range of other resources. Outside of normal leasing activity, we have a very modest and manageable redevelopment pipeline that even with these new headwinds should continue to be an accretive and optimal use of capital. Inflation over time may also affect consumer demand for discretionary goods, but our portfolio of necessity-based grocery-anchored centers should continue to perform as necessity items and services have historically proven to be less susceptible to an inflationary environment. Bottom line, we believe the structure of our portfolio and balance sheet allows us to successfully operate in all economic environments and cycles. In conclusion, I continue to be excited in InvenTrust's future. We hope that as more become familiar with our story and strategy, coupled with the potential additional inclusions to important indices and benchmarks, InvenTrust will continue to be an attractive investment alternative for current and new investors. Obviously, Austin is our biggest market by concentration, nearly 20% on a pro forma basis when you look at the 2 properties that we bought earlier this year. Those are markets where our current assets are performing quite well, and we continue to look for new opportunities to the extent that we can find some of those. So the Raleigh-Durham, obviously, the triangle and then even in the Charlotte market as well we continue to see really strong new household formation. As it relates to new markets, we're obviously exclusively focused in the Sun Belt. And I think the way we think about our redevelopment, it's really incremental opportunities to get a strong risk-adjusted return while making the assets better. We like to think about our redevelopment pipeline is very smaller in nature, but manageable and an important driver of incremental NOI growth while reinvesting in the properties and certainly, making them better, improving the merchandise mix over time."
