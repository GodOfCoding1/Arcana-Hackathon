    "content": " So as it relates to Bed, Bath & Beyond, we have four Bed, Bath banners, one buybuy BABY, but from our perspective and from our operations teams' insights as well as conversation with the retailer itself, we feel confident in our ability, either to negotiate if that's the strategy that we undertake or are prepared to take that back and not unlike many of our peers, we've then had many discussions with several retailers that are dying to get more space on the potential of -- or the opportunities to enter these -- enter some of our properties if that opportunity were to arise. So the small shop is really where we're pushing and if you think about comments that I made last quarter and what you saw in the fourth quarter as well as it relates to some of our operating expenses being elevated, it's really some of our pre-leasing efforts getting spaces that haven't been leased in a longtime, making our assets as good as possible, given the demand that we see today, knowing and I think  (ph) said it well on his call that the demand is as strong as it's been, but it's not -- it may not last forever, so what can we do to position ourselves to be ready to take advantage of those opportunities and many of those opportunities will be coming on the small shop side where if you think about your ability to close that spread, you get a lot more juice for lack of a better word because of the types of rents that you can put in those spaces."
