    "content": " I'd like to also start by thanking our team for producing another record quarter driven by strong same-store sales growth, gross margin expansion and great operating leverage. For the quarter, revenue grew 15% to $473 million largely due to same-store sales growth of 9% and the contribution from our various recent acquisitions. Please proceed with your question. Please proceed with your question. It's a great question and we monitor almost all those things you listed literally on a daily basis, website traffic, lead generation, everything going on the website and those numbers continue to be very strong, which is just -- we're watching it close to look to see if, okay, when will this kind of settle down a little bit. Please proceed with your question. Please proceed with your question. Then fundamentally, as we finish the second year, let's say, we finish 2022 with strong margins and we're looking at the different acquisitions we've done, we've got to start thinking, okay, does that 12% to 17% actually now, has it changed because of -- I think Brett said it. The margin profile of the company I think is changing, even if you take away the upside that we're seeing today on new and used product, I think each quarter I say, something like of our margin improvement around a third-ish has been new and used, which means two-thirds have been coming from the changes we've made in the business, whether it's growing up an high end storage or some of the acquisitions that we've done that have a higher profile. Please proceed with your question."
