    "content": " Our exceptional team generated outstanding adjusted earnings per share growth of 33% to $9, which greatly exceeded the high end of our initial fiscal year 2022 guidance. For the quarter, we generated 16% revenue growth gross margins of 36.7% and record earnings per share of $1.90. For the full year, our revenue topped $2.3 billion, our adjusted EBITDA approached $300 million, our operating leverage was 25% and our adjusted EPS of $9 was significantly above the high end of our initial guidance range of $7.50. Given that lead in and the continued supply chain challenges, which we believe will impact the larger and more premium segment for fiscal 2023, keeping our overall unit inventory levels below historical levels along with a modest impact due to Southwest Florida recovering, we think it's prudent to expect our 2023 same-store sales to be flattish. Please proceed with your question. Please proceed with your question. Please proceed with your question. Please proceed with your question. Please proceed with your question. So -- and we're not necessarily, on board with margins return back to the way they used to be so... Mike I was going to add that with a reset to zero inventory, which we've never had in the history of the boating industry, we don't think there's a need to model back to those margin levels for new and used boats. Please proceed with your question."
