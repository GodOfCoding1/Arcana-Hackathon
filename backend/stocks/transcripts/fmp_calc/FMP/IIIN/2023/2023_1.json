    "content": " Our shipping volume for the first quarter which has historically been our slowest period of the year due to the onset of winter weather and holiday schedules, was adversely impacted by the previous-noted inventory management and destocking measures pursued by our customers along with the continued weakness in the residential construction market that first began in the second half of fiscal 2022. Gross profit for the quarter fell $24.6 million from a year ago and gross margin narrowed to 10.7% from 23.7% due to lower spreads between average selling prices and raw material costs, along with a reduction in volume and higher overall plant operating costs resulting from lower production levels. As such, our first quarter spreads and margins have been adversely impacted by the matching of higher-cost inventory purchased in fiscal 2022 against lower average selling prices for our products. SG&A expense for the quarter decreased $5.2 million to $7.2 million or 4.3% of net sales from $12.3 million or 6.9% of net sales last year, mainly due to lower compensation expense under our return on capital-based incentive plan which was driven by weaker results in the current year."
