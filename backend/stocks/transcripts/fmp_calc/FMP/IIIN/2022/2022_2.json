    "content": " Shipments for the quarter decreased 7.2% from last year due to ongoing domestic wire rod availability issues, which was particularly acute at the beginning of the quarter, and not due to any weakness in our end market demand. Moving to cash flow -- to the cash flow statement and balance sheet, cash flow from operations for the quarter generated $6.3 million, increased working capital due to higher inventory levels for raw materials offset the impact of record earnings performance. Market conditions during our second quarter closely resemble those of the previous three quarters characterized by robust demand for our products and limited availability and escalating prices for our primary raw material, hot-rolled steel wire rod."
