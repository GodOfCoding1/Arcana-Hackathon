    "content": " We reported quarterly revenue of $227.2 million or an increase of 41.3% from $160.8 million in the prior year and net earnings of $38.6 million, or $1.96 per diluted share, as compared to $18.4 million or $0.84 per diluted share in the prior year period, representing 109% increase in earnings per share. The combination of the lingering impact of constrained raw material supply in much of Q2, which prevented us from building finished goods inventory into the start of the third quarter, and the previously noted labor-driven production challenges muted our finished goods inventory levels during this period. As we stated in the release, we've experienced no softening in our other welded wire reinforcement or PC strand markets, where our backlogs -- our customer backlogs are at near record levels and there's considerable optimism that demand will continue to be robust into calendar 2023. Our offshore raw material purchases together with the slowdown in activity in the standard welded wire reinforcement market have resulted in elevated inventory balances, although not to levels that are uncomfortable and we expect inventories to remain elevated through the end of the calendar year."
