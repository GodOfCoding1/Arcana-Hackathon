    "content": " Revenues for the second quarter were $68.4 million, an increase of 12.9% over the $60.6 million reported in the second quarter of last year. Services revenues for the second quarter were $27.8 million, up 21.9% over the year ago period. Operating income for the second quarter was $7.9 million or 11.6% of revenues, compared to $10.1 million or 16.7% of revenues in Q2 2021. Non-GAAP operating income for the second quarter was $11.9 million or 17.4% of revenues, compared to $13.6 million or 22.4% of revenues in Q2 2021. No question that in coming quarters, the impact of the decline in Skype for Business will be negligible and we will see the full par of the growth in Teams, which has set it to be 45% year-over-year. We had another record quarter for Microsoft Teams account additions, we added $317 accounts versus $209 million in the year ago period and versus $260 million in the prior quarter, which speaks for the accelerating adoption of Teams in our growing pipeline. Also, Teams new readability here, we look on the new business that's being created every quarter has grown 25% year-over-year, which provides, again, a strong basis for further growth in coming quarters. That just to talk numbers, right, a year ago or Sky for Business at 10 million, 8 million quarter \u00e2\u0080\u0093 in the second quarter, I think it was down to about 2.7% versus the quarter ago, was about 4%. But again, as I've mentioned because it's that low this time, $2.7 million a quarter, less than even 5%."
