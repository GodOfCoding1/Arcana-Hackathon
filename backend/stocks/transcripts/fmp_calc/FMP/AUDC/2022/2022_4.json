    "content": " Revenues for the fourth quarter were $17.7 million, an increase of 6.9% over the $66.1 million reported in the fourth quarter of last year. Full year 2022 revenues were $275.1 million, an increase of 10.5% over the $248.9 million reported in 2021. Services revenues for the fourth quarter were $28.6 million, up 17.2% over the year ago period. Key driver of fourth quarter 2022 came from Microsoft-related business, which was up quarterly 12% year-over-year, a deceleration from prior quarters, as we saw longer sales cycles. Our service provider business CPE grew for the third consecutive quarter and was up 12% year-over-year, and we continue to see a healthy pipeline in this segment in 2023. So, given the global economy business outlook for 2023, our guidance as provided earlier is as follows; our guidance for the full year would be a revenue range of $286 million to $300 million that's about 4% to 9% growth. The business grew18% in the year, we expect another year of growth in 2023 from our Microsoft business, albeit at a more moderate pace than in 2022, given the macroeconomic uncertainty and longer sales cycles as we've been discussing. Thank you very much. Ryan, your line is live. Thank you very much. In terms of your question about the dollar, Q4 versus the Q3, total Microsoft grew by 10% quarter-over-quarter to a level of approximately $41 million out of it, Microsoft Teams is about 90% of this amount. Thank you very much. Even if we will be at the low end of our revenues, which is $286 million, we believe that the operating margin should be at 17% at this level, and that's how we come to the $1.35 low EPS guidance. Thank you very much. Ryan, your line is live. Thank you very much."
