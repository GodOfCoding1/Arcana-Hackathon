    "content": " After market closed yesterday, we reported second quarter financial results with adjusted net investment income per share of $0.42, corresponding to an annualized return on equity based on that adjusted net investment income of 9.9%. Given this unwind is tied primarily to unrealized gains from our investments, consistent with how we've treated this line item in prior periods, we've adjusted this quarter's results to exclude the impact of this noncash expense reversal, which was approximately $0.12 per share. Due to the strength of our historical credit performance and generating cumulative net realized gains in excess of unrealized losses, the remaining $0.09 per share of capital gains incentive fee on our balance sheet will continue to provide a cushion to any negative impact of market spread movements on net asset value. Based on the shape of the forward curve and reset dates of our issuers, we project the remainder of this year that rate movement loan will result in approximately $0.13 per share of incremental net investment income purely from the core earnings power of the portfolio relative to what we experienced in Q2. At quarter end, total investments were $2.5 billion, up slightly from the prior quarter as a result of net funding activity, partially offset by the impact of lower valuation marks on our portfolio. Pro forma for the settlement of these convertible notes early this week and inclusive of the impact of net fundings and broad market credit spread tightening of approximately 50 basis points since quarter end, we estimate our current leverage is 1.04x, with liquidity of approximately $1 billion."
