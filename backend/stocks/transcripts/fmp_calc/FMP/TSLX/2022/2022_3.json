    "content": " After market closed yesterday, we reported third quarter financial results with adjusted net investment income per share of $0.47, corresponding to an annualized return on equity of 11.5%, and adjusted net income per share of $0.43 or an annualized return on equity of 10.6%. After market closed yesterday, we posted third quarter financial results with adjusted net investment income per share of $0.47 corresponding to an annualized return on equity of 11.5% and adjusted net income per share of $0.43 or an annualized return on equity of 10.6%. At the new quarterly base dividend level of $0.45 per share, we expect our core earnings to exceed this level and highlight the significant influence that all-in yields have had in the core earnings generated ability for our portfolio. Turning now to earnings summary the $0.04 per share difference between this quarter's net investment income and net income was due to unrealized losses, primarily from wider market spreads and not as a result of material changes in the underlying credit quality of our investments. Spread widening and lower implied equity values during this quarter resulted in approximately $0.05 per share of unrealized losses, thereby partially offsetting the increase in net asset value we experienced from the combination of accretion within notes conversion and earnings above our base dividend level. As of quarter end, our weighted average mark on Biohaven was 110%, reflecting the impact of the anticipated fees embedded in our underlying exposure to this portfolio company that has since been crystallized in the $0.11 per share of activity-based fees, which will flow through investment income in Q4. Slide 8 contains this quarter's NAV bridge walking through the main drivers of NAV growth, we added $0.47 per share from adjusted net investment income against our base dividend of $0.42 per share."
