    "content": " I want to start this morning with a regulatory note as our revenue results for the fourth quarter were impacted by the cessation of CGuard shipments due to a temporary expiration of our CE Mark on November 12, 2022. Therefore, our fourth quarter CGuard revenue totaled $1,026,000 with a carryforward of approximately $250,000 in backlog, not shipped after the loss of the CE Mark. As Marvin mentioned, this sales decrease was caused by reduced shipments due to the temporary expiration of our CE Mark certification for the second half of the fourth quarter, resulting from the ongoing transition to the MDR regulatory framework from MDD previously."
