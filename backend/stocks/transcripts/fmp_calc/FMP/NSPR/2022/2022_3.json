    "content": " As we indicated last quarter, we currently enjoy greater than 20% share in approximately half of our markets with some territories up to over 80%, which remains the bellwether of our focus in dominating the carotid revascularization space with the CGuard stent system across the broadest vascular specialist treating patients. This presentation adds to the significant body of evidence that we have compiled over the years, including 1,850 patients demonstrating unmatched performance and stroke prevention delivered by CGuard with its proprietary MicroNet mesh protection versus all other Cat stent platforms and surgical treatment options currently available. This increase is predominantly driven by a 38.8% increase in the sales of CGuard EPS to $1,431,000 in the third quarter of 2022 from $1,031,000 in the same period one year ago."
