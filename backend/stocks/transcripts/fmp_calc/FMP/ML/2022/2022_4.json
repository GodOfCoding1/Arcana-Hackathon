And third, MoneyLion reached record quarterly adjusted revenue of $92 million in Q4 2022. In 2022, these channels translated into 115 million total inquiries, which represents the number of submitted consumer applications for the financial products across our marketplace business, MoneyLion app installs, and users who have registered via the MoneyLion website. We added 4.9 million incremental total products by our customers during the year, leading to 12.9 million total products consumed by the end of 2022. Adjusted revenue for the quarter grew 71% year-over-year to $92 million, marking another record quarter for MoneyLion.
