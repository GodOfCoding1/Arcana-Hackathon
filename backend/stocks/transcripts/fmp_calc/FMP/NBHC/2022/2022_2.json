    "content": " I mean the bulk of \u00e2\u0080\u0093 keep in mind, the bulk of our focus is small and medium-sized businesses, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re capturing operating accounts and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen in some cases, some discussion around earnings credit rate pressure, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been nominal. But I do believe that it all comes down to how we approach our deposit gathering efforts, which as Tim mentioned, is very much focused on building a full relationship, obtaining the operating accounts and the rate product that is \u00e2\u0080\u0093 that we offer, whether it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a savings money market or time deposit account or it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an ancillary type of excess liquidity that people leave with us or businesses leave with us. I guess first I'll take another crack at the margin deposit question and wanted to just think about the \u00e2\u0080\u0093 obviously, you're going to have some level of higher deposit betas and the margin expansion, like mini was more than expected maybe in 2Q, but you've got the positives of two solid banks coming on in the back half of the year. And what gives us freedom a little bit more aggressive in terms of not chasing as much, or certainly if we continue to on the pace and on the long originations that we've seen year-to-date, then provides a ton of liquidity to deploy into the loan growth, and which would be obviously the preferred route for anybody or the third option certainly will look at the time of closing and what the rate environment that is then, and, and maybe adding a little bit to the investment portfolio."
