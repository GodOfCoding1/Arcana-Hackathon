    "content": " Our unique ability to offer customers both the best network and the best value across multiple new and underpenetrated segments of the market led to T-Mobile's SaaS growth year ever, with two of our best core system merger coming in the second half, even as market growth began to normalize. Our strong margin expansion also unlocked rapid free cash flow growth, which grew at an industry-best 36% year-over-year to $7.7 billion and that's even after funding our peak CapEx year in 2022. You may proceed with your question. You may proceed with your question. You may proceed with your question. And so that's all on the heels of this massive capacity that's not just in the network, that's still coming and within the run rate of the $9 billion to $10 billion in capital per year. You may proceed with your question. And so, if I look at the second half of the year, what's interesting is T-Mobile was able to deliver 17% more postpaid net additions in the second half of this year versus last year, while the rest of the industry, Verizon, AT&T, Charter and Comcast combined in wireless, delivered 19% less postpaid phone net additions in the second half of this year versus '21. You may proceed with your question. You may proceed with your question. You may proceed with your question. You may proceed with your question."
