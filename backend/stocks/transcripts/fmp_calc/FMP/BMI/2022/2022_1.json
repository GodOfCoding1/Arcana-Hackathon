    "content": " Free cash flow of $8.1 million was lower than the prior year's quarterly record of $28.8 million, as modestly higher earnings were more than offset by higher primary working capital and timing between years. And we remain steadfast in that commitment, I think what's changing is the ability to convert in the 150% or 160% range, because those years of 2019 through 2021, benefited from kind of working capital improvement to drive primary working capital as a percent of sales from what used to be high 20% to now mid to low 20%."
