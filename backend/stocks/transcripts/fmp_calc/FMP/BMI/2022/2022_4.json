    "content": " Our total sales in the fourth quarter were $147.3 million, sequentially similar to last quarter's record level, and 8.5% higher than the $135.7 million in the same period last year. Fourth quarter free cash flow of $28.5 million was higher than the prior year's $26.2 million, the result of our effective working capital management activities. As noted in the release and outlined here, in 2022, we delivered 12% overall sales growth and 14% utility water product line growth, grew orders in backlog to new record levels, generated nearly $34 million in software revenues, grew operating profit 11% in the face of unprecedented inflation and delivered 115% free cash flow conversion of net earnings. We reduced our primary working capital as a percent of sales, freeing up capital by installing a focused continuous improvement mindset to working capital management, all of which enabled us to generate nearly $240 million in free cash flow over the past three years with an average free cash flow conversion of 137%. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. Your line is now open."
