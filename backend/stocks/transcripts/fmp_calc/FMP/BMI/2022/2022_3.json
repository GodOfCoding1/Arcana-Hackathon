And then just thinking through sort of incremental margins, I mean, it would seem that you would generally be seeing a step up versus historical trend as supply chain continues to ease, but then again, maybe you've got a bit of positive mix, maybe that's what you were alluding to there. At the same time, I would point out, and I think this is clearer in the results, at least, if you look to the last three quarters, we've long been talking about the ability to leverage SEA as a percent of sales, and that has played out in spades the last three quarters, and we would expect that ability to exist moving forward."
