    "content": " The recovery that you mentioned obviously started in the latter June 3, and has really didn't have any impact on our Q2 results and as we've talked about in the past, in addition to your comments about less sensitivity to copper exposure, we've always talked about a one quarter lag of how those market price changes in copper as a proxy for our by-alloy ultimately feather into the P&L. So I think we would continue -- we continue to expect to see inflationary pressures moving forward and we'll do the same thing we've done really over the course of the last two years through the combination of our value-based pricing initiatives as well as in some cases, some commodity-based price increases. And so that's not a signal anything other than there may be some capacity expansion projects on the horizon, which would be great in terms of investing in the business and supporting future growth, but may serve as a temporary free cash flow headwind, but no real structural change to our primary working capital philosophy. The thought process here is, as we've been successful in the market and we've grown at mid-single digit utility water growth for the last three quarters as we continue to aspire for international growth with the development and launch of our international meters as well as just the backlog that we have today. And that's one of the examples of -- from an R&D point of view, where we've been out in front in our AMI offering with cellular as well as our developing software BEACON platform to really enable communities to do a much better job with their water use."
