    "content": " So I don't -- I think that we still have more runway for the clubs gaining to the 2019-2020 -- early 2020 prior to closure -- our revenues and margins and then get beyond that as they are still, as I've mentioned, they're still ramping. And I don't know how to really reconcile your question mathematically right now, but I think it's just -- there's quite a bit -- when we said these clubs -- I don't think the clubs when you call it mature, you're talking about like they have ramped up to a level that they can't keep going. So I think to be clear, we -- all the programs I mentioned, area, small group training, personal training is having an amazing come back and recovery for us under new programming DPT, and that obviously generates more customers the sort of revenue margins are up and the number of people doing personal training has increased. That's just a function of -- relative to our initial guidance, some of the sale-leaseback proceeds received and completion will be a little bit later in the year versus evenly distributed, but we're still very much on track to deliver the $300 million. So if we charge, call it $660 and seeing that for a number and the customer was -- member for average which i 33 months, we're only taking $20 of that in revenue per month over the first -- for that 33 months. On -- I think earlier on the call, you mentioned that memberships, the 2019 center commentary, I think you said 3% is where they're above at this point---\n Let me take that really accurate."
