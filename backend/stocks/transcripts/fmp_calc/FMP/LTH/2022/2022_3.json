    "content": "  Average monthly dues per center membership increased 17% to $157 from $134 in the third quarter last year, driven by both the continued successful execution of our pricing strategy and the opening of higher priced new clubs. Third quarter center operations expense of $295 million increased 27% versus the prior year, primarily driven by added staffing to support increased center usage and expanded programming, the opening of new centers and labor and utility cost inflation."
