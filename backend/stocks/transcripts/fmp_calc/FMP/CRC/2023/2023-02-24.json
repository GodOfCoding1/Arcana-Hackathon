    "content": " Over the past 2-plus years, following the company's emergence from its financial restructuring, we have evolved CRC into an enterprise focused on generating the highest cash flow from our assets and returning that cash to shareholders. In addition to the revisions to our operating plan, we're also pursuing ways to increase our financial flexibility to bolster the company's ongoing shareholder return program and enable a potential future separation of the company. I am really excited about the future of CRC and look forward to working with our talented team to take the steps to separate our quality, low decline, low carbon intensity and high cash flow generating E&P business in our California leading Carbon TerraVault, which we will unlock -- which will help unlock the company's full potential for delivering value to shareholders. In the year where we don't have all the permits, we think we can deliver a plan for 1.5 rigs this year unless we get some -- a good outcome in the near term with the appeals process, but it's a 1.5 rig. It's not going to be enough to hold production, but you can see the cash flow generation of the business is extremely high, and we're going to take every dollar to buy back shares. So by backing on the activity for new drilling, that's the capital needed to be able to fully offset the decline, and that's we're, right now, looking to more of a 5% to 7% decline year-over-year. And it doesn't mean that another rig at Wilmington would not be attractive, it's just relative to where we thought we wanted to be for the year and what are the returns that we're getting for putting dollars in OpEx and capital workovers."
