    "content": " During the third quarter, we continued to deliver strong results by producing 92,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day and $128 million of after-tax free cash flow. Until recently, we had a stated long-term capital allocation framework of recycling approximately 50% or less of our operating free cash flow to maintain our oil production, and then we would split the remaining free cash flow 50-50 between shareholder returns and investment in our carbon management business. During the third quarter, CRC generated $234 million of adjusted EBITDAX and quarterly operating cash flow of $235 million, demonstrating CRC's significant cash generation capability."
