    "content": " Before I discuss the progress, we made this quarter, I would like to address the capital raise we completed in October where we have added an additional $30 million to our balance sheet through the combined Registered Direct and a Private offering. Along with the expected $7.5 million milestone payments from Vericel upon the BLA approval plan in January 2023, and NexoBrid commercial sales growth, we believe that we have sufficient funding to support our EscharEx clinical development program. Gross profit for the third quarter of 2022 was $2.4 million, or 42% of net revenues, compared to a gross profit of $2.5 million or 39% of net revenues. The company posted a net loss for the third quarter of 2022 of $4.2 million or $0.13 per share, compared to a net loss of $3.3 million, or $0.12 per share."
