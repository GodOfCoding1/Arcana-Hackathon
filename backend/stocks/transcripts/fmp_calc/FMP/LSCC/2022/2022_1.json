    "content": " Yeah, again, as I said, we\u2019re just really pleased with the progress in that segment, the strong growth that we saw last year and into Q1 of this year. What we\u2019re seeing is customers in the Industrial and Automotive segment and, again, industrial thing of applications like industrial automation, robotics, automotive electronics is \u2013 first of all those customers are seeing the portfolio that we have today and the roadmap moving forward, and they\u2019re just seeing that as an incredibly competitive, strong product offering that we have today in a very, very strong product roadmap moving forward. And I actually want to take the opportunity to really thank our supply chain operations team, because I think over the last 2 years, they\u2019ve done a really great job of supporting our customers. As I mentioned in the prepared remarks, Avant is on track to launch in the second half of this year, and what Avant brings to the market is, if you compare it to the Nexus devices that we have in production today, Avant capacity or capability is about 5 times the capability of Nexus, and so it\u2019ll allow us to address applications in the mid range portion of the FPGA market and that\u2019ll roughly double our addressable market. Actually, if you look over the last 3 years, that segment has grown double-digits in each in the last 3 years, and a lot of that growth has been driven by our continued expansion in the server segment, where we\u2019re expanding our average dollars of kind of dollars of content per system and we see that continuing to grow."
