    "content": " But given everybody is thinking about a downturn and really nobody knows ultimately what's going to happen over the next year, I think it would be helpful for us if you could talk about how you think the model performs in a downturn because I think you guys have invested a lot in service, there's obviously a big correlation between service and your ability to kind of price motif  inflation. We're also -- because of how we've managed the balance sheet and the capital of the company, we are opportunistically always looking for strategic acquisitions, even if it's a market that we're already in, maybe there's an opportunity to buy a facility that's larger, better positioned. I think that what I like about the growth strategy is because it's focused on markets, sort of saturation markets or markets we're adding something on the peripheral, that gives us an opportunity to kind of provide the service but it also provides an efficiency play which even in a slower market may -- we can benefit from. We feel like we do have some -- as the B2C continues to grow and it grows for heavier weighted shipments, I think that is a tailwind for LTL because, again, some of the LTL carriers are making a push to get different equipment to go into the neighborhoods and provide the residential delivery or perhaps even a white glove type of delivery service."
