    "content": " And I think what you're doing when you can provide that, you're providing a new expanded service map for a customer and you can provide great service for it, and you have the opportunity to find a business that operates out of your legacy network into the new coverage that's beneficial. So we would expect -- I don't know if it's going to maintain that rate, but we would expect to continue to negotiate with our customers pointing out the service offering and the underlying costs are inflationary. And -- that's probably -- I don't know what kind of cyclicality is ahead of us over the next few quarters, but I don't think Saia's balance sheet since the spin out 20 years ago has ever been better positioned to thrive in a cyclical industry than it is today. You know, I think that the recruiting environment is a little bit, I mean it's -- if you talk to us at any time over the last seven, eight, 10 years, we've talked it's always challenging to hire drivers and find really skilled doc professionals. And I would say as you add facilities in new markets, one of the benefits you get out of it is you're the new player in town and you're bringing in the new growing dynamic business, and you can offer sort of qualitative benefits to a driver around maybe a shorter commute or maybe it's a the opportunity to pick a start time or something like that. So is there a way to think about the dynamics in terms of where the OR might have been for this quarter, if you hadn't added those additional terminals and kind of what the incremental costs are of carrying additional terminals or is that kind of the wrong way to think about it, especially as we think about the incremental costs associated with adding more terminals next year, if we're looking at an environment where volumes might continue to be flat."
