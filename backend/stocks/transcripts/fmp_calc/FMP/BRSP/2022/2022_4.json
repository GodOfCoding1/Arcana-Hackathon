    "content": " The company reported fourth quarter 2022 GAAP net income attributable to common stockholders of $4.2 million or $0.03 per share, distributable earnings of $34.2 million or $0.27 per share and adjusted distributable earnings of $35 million or $0.27 per share. Subsequent to quarter end, we had a modification to $116 million office loan, the largest office loan in our portfolio. As of December 31, 2022, excluding cash and net assets on the balance sheet, the loan portfolio is comprised of 103 investments with an aggregate gross book value of $3.5 billion and a net book value of $977 million or 86% of the total investment portfolio. Multifamily, the asset class price buyer has the largest exposure too, consists of 59 loans representing 49% of the loan portfolio, or $1.7 billion of aggregate gross book value. Despite these headwinds during the fourth quarter, certain borrowers made critical leasing progress in markets, which include two office loans in San Francisco Proper and one office loan in Baltimore, Maryland. Turning to our fourth quarter results, we reported adjusted distributable earnings at $35 million or $0.27 per share and distributable earnings of $34.2 million or $0.27 per share. Additionally, for the fourth quarter, we reported total company GAAP net income attributable to common stockholders of $4.2 million or $0.03 per share. When adjusting for the full quarterly effect of fourth quarter repayments as well as the beneficial impact rising interest rates continue to have on our portfolio, our adjusted distributable earnings quarterly run-rate is closer to $0.25 per share. We provide more data in our supplemental financial report, but an illustrative 50 basis point increase in the benchmark rates from the December 31 spot rates would add roughly $4.3 million to our annual earnings or about $0.03 per share."
