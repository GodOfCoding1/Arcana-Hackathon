    "content": " We as shareholders look at the $0.38 dividend and the fact that it's 100% of the earnings as a nice and generous on your part, but we would personally like to see you issue like half of that dividend and the rest of it go again to prepayment of debt, because of the things that are going on in the interest rate markets, I don't see interest rates going down, particularly in a hurry again and that this company gets stronger and stronger with the minimum of debt, minimizing the debt, and it will put you in that position you spoke of strategically to move when the time seems right to move, because you have a rich cash position and a balance sheet with very, very little debt."
