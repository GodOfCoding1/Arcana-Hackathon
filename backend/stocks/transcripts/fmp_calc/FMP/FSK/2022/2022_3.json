    "content": " In addition to this EBITDA growth, by continuing to focus on larger companies, we have increased the weighted average EBITDA of our portfolio companies to $207 million as of the end of the third quarter as compared to just $78 million at the end of the second quarter of 2018. During the third quarter, we originated $907 million of investments, which were primarily focused on fundings and add-on financings to existing portfolio companies. Our new investments, combined with $651 million of net sales and repayments, when factoring in sales to our joint venture, equated to a net portfolio increase of $256 million during the quarter. During the third quarter, excluding the impact of merger accounting, we experienced net portfolio depreciation on investments of approximately $376 million. Based on the third quarter's activity, as of September 30, 2022, nonaccruals totaled 5% of our portfolio on a cost basis and 2.5% on a fair value basis, compared to 4.9% on a cost basis and 2.9% on a fair value basis as of June 30, 2022. From a starting point of September 30, a 100 basis point move and higher and short-term rates ultimately will increase our net investment income by approximately $0.25 per share per year, which equates to approximately $0.06 per share per quarter. Our dividend and fee income during the third quarter is summarized as follows: $50 million of recurring dividend income from our joint venture, other dividends from various portfolio companies totaling approximately $17 million and fee income totaling approximately $26 million."
