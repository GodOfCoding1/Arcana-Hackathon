    "content": " In our NAST truckload business, our volume grew 4% year-over-year, and our adjusted gross profit or AGP per shipment, increased 15% versus first quarter of last year and 6.5% sequentially, as we repriced more of our contractual portfolio and continued to focus on profitable market share. I mean, I think that specific to China, here\u2019s what I would say, I forget who asked the question earlier about kind of the makeup of the contracts, but it\u2019s 57% of our large customer contracts that were signing for 12 months forget the percent, 25% at six months and the balance at three. You think about analyzing those numbers and kind of comparing them to some of the other digital platforms in the industry, it\u2019s pretty easy to get to a place where you look at it and say Robinson clearly has the largest digital freight marketplace, across the industry, but Arun mentioned some key input metrics around acquisition and retention and share growth and those are the things we\u2019ll continue to track and communicate in order to drive the output metrics of volume growth and profit improvement. A couple of years ago that we really stopped giving kind of the volume and revenue in the month, in the quarter and so I\u2019ll just say directionally the market conditions in April look very similar to what we experienced on the tail end of March and the model is responding as we would expect it to. We use -- if you look at the low point to -- in kind of mid-2020 to where we\u2019ve sit today and you see whatever, six, seven quarters in a row of increases of AGP per load, if I\u2019m managing my teams in the field, I need them managing that AGP per load up 42%."
