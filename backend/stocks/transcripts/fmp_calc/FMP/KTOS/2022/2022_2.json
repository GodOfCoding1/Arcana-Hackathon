    "content": " Q2 2022 cash flow from operations was a use of $21.6 million with the use including an increase of in receivables of approximately $27.1 million primarily related to future milestone in other contractual payments from customers and an increase in our inventory balances of approximately $10.5 million during the quarter, primarily in our Unmanned Systems, C5ISR, Satellite and Microwave Electronics businesses in anticipation of the ramps and production in the second half of the year and in part to secure additional safety stock and advanced buys in larger lot sizes to gain pricing benefits where possible, and to mitigate the impact of supply chain disruptions. We have assumed that these COVID-19 and supply chain related impact to our business including increased inflationary costs, which significantly impacted our first half 2022 operations will continue to impact the third quarter with an estimated impact of approximately $10 million to $14 million in third quarter revenues and $3 million to $5 million of our adjusted EBITDA. We are adjusting our Fiscal 2022 adjusted EBITDA to $80 million to $85 million with the most significant impact to the forecasted third quarter margins with improvements expected in the fourth quarter, based upon the projected ramp and new large programs, which includes more recent cost, leverage realize on the SG&A and overhead infrastructure and a more favorable revenue mix including more software based revenues driven largely by the three new open space programs that Eric mentioned earlier."
