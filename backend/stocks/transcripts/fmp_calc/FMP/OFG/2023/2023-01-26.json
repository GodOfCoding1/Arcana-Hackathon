    "content": " And, as we've previously reported other capital actions in 2022 included completing $64.1 million of our $100 million buyback authorization plan, and increasing our common stock dividend to $0.20 per share from $0.12 an increase of 66.7%. Of the $9 million, about $11 million came from higher rates on interest earning assets, partially offset by $2.5 million in higher costs of funds. As per net interest expenses totaled $92 million, that's $4 million higher than in the third quarter. That's reflected $5 million for auto loans, $4 million for consumer loans, and $3 million for a commercial loan previously we served. Having said that, we're very cognizant about mid range 50s efficiency ratio and we would like to leverage the higher interest rates and the higher better economy in Puerto Rico to maintain a positive operating leverage as we've had for the last several years."
