    "content": " As you can see on the left, we are still in the early phase of launch for many of these products, including Opzelura in atopic dermatitis, Pemazyre and cholangiocarcinoma, where we are expanding geographically; and Monjuvi, which is just starting to launch in Europe and Jakafi where we recently launched in chronic GVHD in the U.S. On top of that, we have new potential indication that we\u2019ll be providing additional growth opportunities with Opzelura in vitiligo and with our partner product where we have new indication being planned over the next few months for Olumiant, Tabrecta and Jakavi. SG&A expense for the first quarter of $210 million increased 36% from the prior year period\u2019s total SG&A expense or 49%, excluding the $13 million onetime payment recorded in the first quarter of 2021. Your line is now live. Your line is now live. Your line is now live. Your line is now live. Your line is now live. Your line is now live. And going forward with AD and vitiligo, our gross to net will try to keep in that range as we possibly can, but we\u2019re confident going through the year, as we said by the end of the year, second half of the year, 40% to 50% is our goal. Your line is now live. Your line is now live. Your line is now live. As far as the gross to net is concerned, at least for over this year, last couple of quarters, we\u2019ve always said 40% to 50% gross to net is our goal, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re shooting for, particularly as we continue to negotiate with the various payers. Your line is now live."
