    "content": " West Fraser generated $70 million of adjusted EBITDA in the fourth quarter of 2022 as we experienced weakening demand across several key products, particularly in North America, where rising interest rates or rising mortgage rates impacted near-term housing affordability. Overall, however, 2022 is a strong year of performance for West Fraser as we generated $20.86 of diluted earnings per share and over $3.2 billion of adjusted EBITDA, representing a 33% margin. Nonetheless, we remain very attuned to the potential risks that West Fraser faces and will continually and diligently manage our operations accordingly to meet available customer demand with our geographic and product diverse operations, executing on our core strategy to be low cost, to reinvest in our operations and to continue to prioritize financial discipline, which we believe will allow us to be well positioned to capitalize on the more favorable supply and demand fundamentals, we expect to see for our products over the medium and longer term."
