    "content": " For our North American OSB business, given continued constraints to trucking services and signs of slowing demand, we are reducing our annual shipment guidance to a range of $5.9 million to 6.2 million square feet on a 3-inch  basis. I think it's going to be interesting to see what Q3 and Q4 look like for demand, but I do think it's going to take some time to kind of understand what the impact of those sanctions are and to understand how much demand has softened versus potentially a lot of shipments getting out of Eastern block countries and getting into Europe."
