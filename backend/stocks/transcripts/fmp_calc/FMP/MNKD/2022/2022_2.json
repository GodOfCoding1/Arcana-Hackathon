    "content": " Total revenues for the quarter were up 58% in Q1, and we think that as you continue to look out, we'll see more royalties, more manufacturing, more Afrezza, more V-Go. The fact is Afrezza is competing indirectly or directly against those 2 launches, we felt it was good to start measuring our market share and incentivizing our corporate executive management team, all of our employees as well as the frontline sales reps. And you could see that, that had a direct impact in our market share growth over the last 4, 5 months here as we close out the quarter. Looking at revenues for the second quarter of 2022, Afrezza net revenue was $10.6 million versus $10 million in 2021, a growth rate of 7%. So as we continue to grow Afrezza, we continue to grow V-Go, we continue to see Tyvaso contribute to MannKind, I think you're going to see a lot more activity around the pipeline and readouts around the pipeline on safety and some of the animal models we're doing."
