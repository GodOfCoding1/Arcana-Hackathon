    "content": " When looking at the profitability for September 22 year-to-date, Afrezza gross margin of 75% and gross profit of $23.6 million driven by higher sales and lower cost of goods sold mainly due to a decrease in excess manufacturing capacity costs and a $2 million fee incurred on amendment of our insulin supply agreement in the second quarter of 2021. If we have an asset and a franchise that's going to do $80 million to $100 million in growth, 10%, 20% a year for the foreseeable future, that's a good business for MannKind. Those aren't going to happen in the next six months, but those are really the key milestones we're looking at saying, how does Afrezza do in kids, is that really going to be the game changing opportunity to transform growth to 2024, and then data readout in India will be important. But recognizing, you know, there's 1.5 million people live with type one diabetes, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re half the insulin market, we've got to -- the kids opportunity first to get that really foundation bill, work with JDRF a lot more in the patient walks and raising our awareness out there in the society, there's still too many patients not aware in type one, especially that  option. And so we think we just -- when we look at next year, it's really about making sure Afrezza is a choice amongst the doctors that we're targeting. I think on the pipeline, you're going to see really nice progress over the next 12 months of moving assets from preclinical formulation stage in the Phase 1, Phase 2, Phase 3, and we think that's going to be a monumental opportunity for investors to start to really understand that value."
