    "content": " At some point, we believe this product will fail on the market long enough as test and time on fee and the new day we have coming out over the 12 months, we believe sets this in terms of Afrezza's ability to help and solve the mealtime solution challenge that we have, and V-Go will really allow us help those type-2 patients that much better, and that has also demonstrated improvement and they want to see and quality of life. And so the dosing that we're using in INHALE-1 around the 2x round down was put into our pediatric trial, and we believe that's paying off dividends as we look at the first dose ABC results that were just released yesterday, but really showed you in the first two hours when you really care about mealtime control, Afrezza does something amazing versus injectables. I think what's really like this is the first time where we're going to have dosing and Dexcom CGM integrated as we talk about going into type 1, we do think providing those insights to a patient and to a provider are really important, and that's something has pipe from type 2 to type 1 on Afrezza that this is going to be a critical device in the second half, assuming we get positive patient feedback. And I think over time, we've -- Tyvaso is going to be so large as we talk about ideas with UniTher, yes, we want to make sure that, that gets off right book because whether that's assets $1 billion, $2 billion plus, I think that's really UT's purview, we want to make sure we can make supply and be ready for it and not distract our collective teams on that one."
