    "content": " We estimate our adjusted operating margin could range from 14.5% to 15.1% for the third quarter, with the increase versus prior year driven by price and productivity and offset partially by incremental investment spending of $6 million. We think back just a few years ago, you were talking about a margin -- operating margin target of 12%, which I think we interpreted it's like that's the reasonable margin the market will bear for this industry."
