    "content": " We estimate our adjusted operating margin could range from 13.7% to 14.2% for the fourth quarter, with the increase versus the prior year driven by price and productivity and partially offset by incremental investment spending of $8 million. In the third quarter, price/cost was favorable, and we quantified that as an incremental $5 million to $7 million. Clearly, we've had, between the second quarter and the third quarter, if you add the $6 million to $8 million of price/cost favorability and then another $5 million to $7 million in third quarter, we've had about $12 million to $13 million of price/cost favorability."
