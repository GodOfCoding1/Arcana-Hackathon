    "content": " Despite the tougher 2023 macro backdrop, we are continuing to invest in strategic initiatives, including our smart and connected enabled products and expect full year incremental investments of approximately $20 million. We expect consolidated adjusted operating margin for the full year to range from between 15.4% to 16.0%, with both the Americas and APMEA down 60 basis points to flat compared to 2022 as price and productivity do not fully offset inflation, incremental investments and the onetime price cost benefit of $13 million we captured in 2022."
