    "content": " Now looking at Item 1, we are and will continue to be laser-focused on contract administration in regards to the application and accuracy of contract escalation clauses and, in particular, the local oil sands maintenance wage increases and the impact of OEM and vendor equipment parts price increases. On the upside, we see Slide 21 as a reasonable projection of our business based on high demand, modest growth, improved utilization from our expected stronger maintenance workforce and increasing margins as we continue to lower cost and advance operations efficiency. So whether we had a depressed oil price, and we are looking for ways to reduce our costs and pass on to customers, which we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve done, or, in this case, where it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s escalating, we would expect -- at any time we have unusual market conditions, both up or down, either our clients or we -- we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve approached our clients or our clients has approached us for amendments outside of the normal cycle of the contract."
