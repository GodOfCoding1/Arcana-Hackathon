    "content": " For our customers on those annual subscription products, which are defined as products with a duration of 12 months or longer, we retained revenue at an impressive 103%, up 70 basis points from the prior year period. Editorial revenue was $81.8 million in Q3, down 3% year-on-year and up 3.1% on a currency-neutral basis. Our total SG&A expense of $91.6 million, which is inclusive of stock-based compensation of $2.8 million was down $2.9 million this quarter, with our expense rate improving by 20 basis points to 39.7% of revenue from 39.9% last year, primarily driven by higher bonus expense in 2021. We continue to expect currency-neutral revenues of $955 million to $980 million, representing year-on-year growth of 4% to 6.7%. Taking into consideration the estimated impact of the stronger U.S. dollar and broader FX volatility, this equates to total reported revenue guidance of $929 million to $953 million, or a growth of 1.1% to 3.8% over 2021. We continue to expect adjusted EBITDA on a currency-neutral basis of $310 million to $320 million, which translates to year-on-year growth of 0.2% to 3.5%. Including the estimated impact of ongoing FX headwinds, we expect adjusted EBITDA of $297 million to $307 million, or year-on-year decline of 4% to 0.9%."
