Revenues for diagnostic information services declined 15.3% compared to the prior year, reflecting lower revenue from COVID-19 testing services versus the fourth quarter of 2021, partially offset by strong growth in our base testing revenue. The year-over-year decline in adjusted operating income is related primarily to lower COVID-19 testing revenues and to a lesser extent the negative impact of adverse weather on our volume, as well as higher investments to accelerate growth in our base business. We have also taken actions to reduce our SG&A by approximately $100 million in 2023, including workforce reductions of approximately 1.5% primarily in corporate support functions.

The last thing I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d say is, look, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a portfolio of $700 million to $800 million of other businesses in Quest Diagnostics - that can be our Exam One business, our employer solutions business, our employee population health business, and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve pushed for 2% to 3% price increases on that portfolio of business and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve largely gotten those in place for 2023. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open."
