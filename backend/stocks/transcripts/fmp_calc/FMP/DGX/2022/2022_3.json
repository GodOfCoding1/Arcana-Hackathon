Any redistribution, retransmission or rebroadcast of this call in any form without the written consent of Quest Diagnostics is strictly prohibited. Now I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d like to introduce Shawn Bevec, Vice President of Investor Relations for Quest Diagnostics. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m joined by Steve Rusckowski, our Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President; Jim Davis, CEO elect; and Sam Samad, our Chief Financial Officer. During this call, we may make forward-looking statements and then we will discuss non-GAAP measures. Risks and uncertainties, including the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic that may affect Quest Diagnostics\u00e2\u0080\u0099 future results include but are not limited to, those described in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequently filed quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K. The company continues to believe that the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on future operating results, cash flows and/or its financial condition will be primarily driven by the pandemic severity and duration, healthcare insurer, government and client payer reimbursement for COVID-19 molecular test, the pandemic impact on the U.S. health care system and the U.S. economy; and the timing, scope and effectiveness of federal, state and local governmental responses to the pandemic, including the impact of vaccination efforts which are drivers beyond the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s knowledge and control. For this call, references to reported EPS refer to reported diluted EPS and references to adjusted EPS refer to adjusted diluted EPS. Any references to base business, testing revenues or volumes refer to the performance of our business excluding COVID-19 testing. Growth rates associated with our long-term outlook projections, including total revenue growth, revenue growth from acquisitions, organic revenue growth and adjusted earnings growth are compound annual growth rates. Finally, revenue growth rates from acquisitions will be measured against our base business. Thanks, Shawn and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. While we had a strong third quarter, we drove 5% growth in the base business despite the impact of Hurricane Ian and we delivered strong earnings despite inflationary pressures and investments in growth areas. Based on our performance, we have raised our outlook for the remainder of 2022. We also made very good progress on our leadership transition, adding management depth and expertise to help us grow in important areas. As you know, Jim will assume the responsibilities of CEO and President on November 1, and I will remain as Executive Chairman. Before I turn it over to Jim, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d like to say a few words about savings access to Laboratory Services Act Salsa. Based on the efforts of our trade Association, support for Salsa has broadened and continues to strengthen. As you know, we are currently planning for a Medicare fee schedule reduction under PAMA of $80 million to $90 million in 2023 if Congress does not intervene again this year. However, the work we are doing is aimed at reducing or postponing that burden and unfortunately, Congress has already acted three times to stop further cuts from going into place. On behalf of our 50,000 Quest colleagues, I would like to thank you for your leadership of Quest Diagnostics over the last 10 years. In fact, before Hurricane Ian hit in September, we were seeing some of the highest base testing volumes we have ever experienced. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m also grateful to our employees outside of the impacted areas, who stepped up to provide financial support to our colleagues in need. During the quarter, we grew the base business revenues and continue to invest in advanced diagnostics and consumer initiated testing. In the third quarter, total revenues were 2.5 billion. After plateauing in June and July, our COVID-19 molecular testing volumes steadily declined. We expect COVID-19 molecular volumes to average 10,000 to 15,000 per day in the fourth quarter. In the third quarter, we continued to make progress executing our two point strategy to accelerate growth and drive operational excellence. We recently announced an outreach lab purchase from Summa Health, a large integrated healthcare delivery system in Ohio. We also announced a professional lab services relationship with Lee Health, Southwest Florida\u00e2\u0080\u0099s primary community owned health system to provide supply chain expertise for five hospitals owned by Lee health and selected outpatient centers. Our implementation plans have been slightly delayed by Hurricane Ian, though we expect this relationship will have a positive impact on revenue growth in 2023. Not only does this yield benefit for health plans in their members, but also it enables us to gain share. Value based relationships are appealing to health plans because it helps them reduce the overall cost of care, provides insights to better health outcomes and provides an exceptional value to members. Also, as we continue to extend and renegotiate health plan agreements, we see increased volumes and pricing from these contracts. We continued to make investments to strengthen our capabilities to accelerate growth in oncology and hematology, hereditary genetics, genomic sequencing services and pharma services. Just last week, we announced the addition of Mark Gardner, our Senior Vice President of molecular genomics and oncology. In this new position Mark, an established leader in molecular genomics next generation sequencing and oncology diagnostics, is responsible for driving growth and expanding our offerings in these areas. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re encouraged by the early success of the site in the first few weeks of its launch, and we expect to make further progress in the fourth quarter ending in 2023 toward our goal of $250 million of annual consumer initiated testing revenues by 2025. We also launched a new ad campaign to drive broader awareness of our consumer initiated testing offerings which cover everything from women\u00e2\u0080\u0099s health tests to allergy testing, and sexually transmitted infections. We remain focused on improving our operational quality, service and cost, thereby driving productivity gains and improving the customer experience. As COVID-19 volumes have declined, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve begun to repurpose some of our COVID-19 testing platforms to enhance our quality and reduce costs. Today, 75% of our patients are arriving at PSC with an appointment compared to less than 25% just three years ago. This increased number of appointments allows us to flex our workforce to meet demand within a particular geography, which enables us to serve our patients faster. Our average wait time is approximately five minutes, which is roughly half the level since 2019. Finally, we continue to drive the use of automation and artificial intelligence to drive productivity gains to help offset inflationary pressures. In the third quarter, consolidated revenues were $2.5 billion down 10.4% versus the prior year. Base business revenues grew 5.1% to $2.17 billion, while COVID-19 testing revenues declined 55% to $316 million. Our COVID-19 molecular volumes have averaged roughly 17,000 tests per day so far in October. On an adjusted basis, operating income was $423 million or 17% of revenues compared to $694 million or 25% of revenues last year. We were also impacted by a higher portion of COVID-19 molecular testing volume from non-traditional retail channels, which carry additional expenses. Year-to-date, cash provided by operations was $1.38 billion in 2022, versus $1.75 billion in the prior year period. And when you think about our updated guidance, please consider the following. We are assuming COVID-19 molecular volumes to average roughly 10,000 to 15,000 tests per day in the fourth quarter. Last week, the public health emergency was extended another 90 days through mid January. We expect reimbursements to decline when the PHG expires, which we currently assume will happen in January. As a reminder, we are making investments this year to accelerate growth. Finally, before getting to your questions, I wanted to say a few words about 2023. As you might expect, we aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t prepared to provide detailed 2023 guidance today. Well to summarize, we accelerated growth in the base business year-over-year. And we have raised our full year guidance based on our performance in the quarter and our expectations for the remainder of 2022.As Jim mentioned earlier, this will be my last earnings call as CEO and President and I will remain as Executive Chairman. Finally, to the 50,000 Colleagues of Quest Diagnostics, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been the honor of my lifetime to serve as your CEO. Together, we have empowered better health with our insights, grown the business and provide a critical testing capacity through one of the most challenging healthcare crisis in our history. Your line is now open. Okay, Steve, I just want to say congratulate -- and it has been a pleasure working with you all these years. Obviously, it was on top of investor minds, but just for modeling purposes. In fact, it points during the quarter. So feel good about that. Yes, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be a tailwind going into 2023. And then as you know, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve made investments in the business, investing in our advanced diagnostics portfolio, and we expect to get above normal growth rates out of that side of our portfolio. Now we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re dealing with some headwinds, as well as you know. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve built into our plan, a third round of PAMA cuts $80 million to $90 million next year COVID, which we didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t obviously have in 2019. Early part of next year, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be at the 10 to 15 point. I mean, again, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re, going to give guidance in February, we wanted to just capture some of these maybe changed assumptions, or at least varying assumptions. But listen, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nothing that I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen so far that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen so far, that prevents us from meeting the current consensus estimates again, within a reasonable range of outcomes. In terms of share repurchases, we have made share repurchases this year 950 million throughout the first three quarters of the year, and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll provide a lift as well, in terms of earnings next year. Yes let me just make another comment about some of the investments we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve made, because I think there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a little bit of a misunderstanding about that adding to our cost, and not helping us as we get into \u00e2\u0080\u009823 and \u00e2\u0080\u009824. So we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve mentioned that, this year, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be investing about 160 million. One advanced diagnostics and as Jim said, we probably four we have already started to see have faster growth rates because of those investments. And so what you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to see in 2023, is particularly around CIT are starting to get a return for that investment for CIT. And even though we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t report the financials, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll see less of a drain on our earnings in 2023 because of the growth rate we will get from CIT and that will be a tailwind for \u00e2\u0080\u009823. And you asked about 2024, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not going to give exact details, because we will throttle that investment at that a good part of the how fast the market grows, and where we have some capacity to accelerate growth. And so we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll hold back on give you an exact number about profitability, but we are going to get to return from that $250 million. And let me just close by saying that $250 million, some of it is permanent, because we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re building these two businesses, advanced diagnostics, and CIT but some of it was temporal. And so when you think about modeling for through 23, and you look at what you might expect for expenses from us for 2022. Your line is now open. Thanks, actually want to expand on Steve\u00e2\u0080\u0099s comment right there because thinking through this, thinking through the guidance and getting to the numbers, versus sort of what the run rate is coming out, there has to be a pretty meaningful amount of expenses coming out. So of the 160, should we be thinking about that, as is like, half of that goes away to get to sort of, including PAMA we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re talking $80 million to $100 million of expenses that would need to come down unless you think volumes are really accelerate and the incremental margins on us. So Kevin, as you think about next year, I mean, yes, we are taking expenses down. I would not assume right now, strategic investments necessarily coming down. And we also have our invigorate program where we expect up productivity in the business and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an ongoing program that we do, that we have every year. So I think as you look at margins, you have to consider those things. We have maybe a consistent inflationary environment is the assumption wages increasing by salaries, wages and benefits increasing by 3% to 4%. But we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re seeing historically low pricing pressure on our business, which as we said in the quarter was 60 basis points. Your line is now open. As we mentioned in the opening comments, our volumes improved every month through the third quarter. And September, even with the hurricane impact was obviously much better than the average that we reported. Despite a 50 basis point headwind on price, our clinical mix and business mix improved in the quarter, which contributed to that strong base performance. Physician offices appeared to be strong and even our health system segment, which is a combination of our reference testing in PLS was also strong in the quarter. Now in the quarter, we announced the Summa health outreach acquisition. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not a day that goes by that we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t read in one of the journals about health systems reporting, margin pressures and exacerbated by some of the pressures they have with wages, particularly on the nursing side. And so, or monetize their outreach book of business to provide some cash infusion to them. Your line is now open. So our relationships with commercial payers, if you want to measure the output of the relationship, again, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll turn to the pricing environment. We are only down 50 basis points in the quarter and you go back to 2018, 2019, we were losing 100 basis points. We target physicians that are using health, expensive health system labs, and collectively our teams work this day in and day out and yes, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been able to move Rex from high price institutions to better quality lower price labs like Quest Diagnostics. Yes to comments on Jack\u00e2\u0080\u0099s question and Erin first of all, or plan is to gain share. Just want to make sure we remind you that 50 basis points is not exclusive to commercial payer pricing, but all pricing. But we have price pressure with client relationships, with physicians we have price concessions with hospital reference work. But on the commercial payer side, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s less than 50 basis points that much improved of where it was years ago. Hey, good morning, guys. So as I think about just the core testing, obviously COVID is declining here. The way I would think about it is again, COVID, continues to come down. Too early to tell, but obviously, these two new variants, the BQ1 and BQ 1.1 are growing in terms of concern, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s now 11%, 12%, of all new cases, higher in the east, reported to be over 20% in the New York City area. But as of now, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re thinking 10,000 to 15,000 a day, as we go into next year. We reported that our base business, the volumes recovered, as we move through the third quarter, we expect that trend to continue. Again, we feel great about opportunities to help our health system partners whether it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s additional reference testing, or PLS and then we feel great about our acquisition funnel and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re looking at several outreach opportunities. And so as COVID improves, we believe that could help our base business. And we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve clearly started to see that in Q3 and to some extent, as we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve talked before, we have somewhat of a natural hedge, because of COVID goes up and base softens. And as we said before, most of our major markets have recovered, we still have not seen full recovery in New York City. So from an overall perspective, the COVID direction should be favorable to base. Your line is now open. You\u00e2\u0080\u0099re talking about obviously, you did a lot on the share repurchase here today, as you mentioned. So as you think about our position, right now we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve generated 1.38 billion of operating cash flow through three quarters of the year. When you think about our capital deployment philosophy, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s very consistent. And we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to focus on making sure that obviously, we invest in the business that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, we talked about the strategic investments. This year, we expect to make 160 million of strategic we have net of the 400 million of capital, whatever free cash flow that we have, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to return back to shareholders in the form of dividends, in the form of share repurchases and M&A. Now, to the extent that I think we have a robust pipeline of M&A transactions and opportunities, as Jim mentioned, to the extent that we, we are going to be very disciplined about M&A though, I mean, to the extent that we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have a creative deals that we believe really add strategic value to us and produce the meet the ROIC threshold that we have in our accretive then we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to return back that cash in terms of share repurchases. Your line is now open. Hey, good morning, guys. And Steve, thanks for all your help, over the years different questions for the fourth quarter guidance of $1.91 analyzes to 764. And as the good guys, the improved base pricing business as well as strong COVID pricing. So if we put of PAMA in that one, that would be the launch pad in 2023. Is 713, which seems like a pretty big gap versus 850 consensus numbers. Next year, obviously, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve said to percentage, roughly two percentage points of that can come from acquisition. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve said we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got a great list, a good funnel of both tuck ins from outreach, as well as a few what I would call deals that enhance our capabilities, fill in some gaps in our portfolio. So feel good about that. We also feel good about our invigorate program and continuing to work that, as Sam said, reinvigorating our invigorate program to offset some of the margin pressures that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen from inflation. We feel good about the investments that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re making in ADX and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve said that, consumer initiated testing next year should be a tailwind to us. And then finally as Sam and Steve said, we are fine tuning the cost structure, and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll make the necessary rebalances in the cost structure to deliver what we need to deliver next year. So just we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not going to give you obviously guidance right now, but just maybe directionally give you some things also to build into, or to think about as you build your model for next year. And so they will be less dilutive, as you look at next year versus this year. The fact that when you think about pricing it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a definitely improving environment for us as we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve said, 50 basis points in Q3. So that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an additional number that maybe some of you use the 1% pricing negative pricing impact is no longer the case in terms of what we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re seeing, because of all the things that we talked about around value based contracts with the health plans. And then when you think about COVID I mean, COVID is obviously the assumption going into 2023 is that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 10,000 to 15,000. COVID testing is coming down, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an improvement in the base business as a result of that. But also the fact that with the PHE ending, at least our assumption is that it ends in January, even though that average reimburse price comes down, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not a straight impact the margin because we have cost that we incur in the non traditional retail channels right now that will no longer, that we will no longer incur after the end of the PHE emergency. So you can also take you know, the margin on COVID as being completely impacted by that price reimbursed or by that reimbursement decrease. And then secondly, just to underscore Jim\u00e2\u0080\u0099s comments is this company and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll continue under Jim\u00e2\u0080\u0099s and Sam\u00e2\u0080\u0099s leadership has a long track record of productivity improvements. And so Jim, in his prepared remarks talked about our operational excellence program. So when you think about 2023, and you think about potentially getting a PAMA cut you need to think about the expense reduction, base growth, as well as Invigorate offsetting some of the inflationary pressure, as well as potentially. And I can tell you we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve highlighted this before, in our investor presentations, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a lot more room for us to drive productivity, particularly around automation, and digitalization going forward, and Jim will be driving that as he leaves the company. Your line is now open. And then secondarily, kind of on the back of that the supply chain as well, I know, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been a bit of a kind of issues pop up and you guys handle them well. Maybe just a little bit of color, that would be helpful. So what we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re seeing this year is between 3% and 4%, and our plan next year is to have a merit increase of roughly 3%, across the company. So I think from a planning modeling standpoint, that 3% to 4% range still feels good from a labor utilization. But I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll tell you on our employee retention and attrition is that it has stabilized here in the third quarter, albeit, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s stabilized at a higher level than we would like, which obviously affects productivity. So we continue to work really hard on making classes the employer of choice, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not just about wages, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a lot of other things, as you can imagine that go into that. And on that roughly $2 billion, about 80% of it is locked up in terms of it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s under contract. And most of those contracts that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve entered into in previous years, actually do not contain price indexes or price going up. So, we feel good about that, but 20% of roughly 2 billion is a big number that is not completely locked up. In addition to the pre-analytical and analytical supplies we have a lot of, we have roughly $88 million, $900 million of other spend, that is logistics, professional services, janitorial services. We will it get better next year, will it get worse next year. But everything that the Fed is doing, will hopefully slow those inflationary pressures that we are seeing. But again we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re committed, and we work real hard for our Invigorate program to offset as much of this as we possibly can. Your line is now open. Thanks for all your time and patience with me, appreciate it over the years. But are you expecting any sort of relief from you\u00e2\u0080\u0099d expect to solve for the past and sort of like your update in PAMA and then the follow up on that, or another one you know, as we sort of head into a recession and inflation picks up, I mean, are you seeing any increase in debt from your customers. So as we said, for many years now, you should plan on PAMA caught in 2023. And I would expect, if we were successful with Salsa, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be late in this year, that will know that. And also, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to cost money. Now, if we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t, or if we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not successful with Salsa the question is, can we get another year of relief. Again, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not going to indicate that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to get that again. But if we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get Salsa there, obviously will be a pivot to ask for another year of relief. But again, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not planning that during our 2023 planning. In fact, our patient concessions have actually improved rate and has actually improved year-over-year and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to build into next year. So, patient comes into our PSE, we take the requisition and we can literally adjudicate that claim x-the payment coming to us. So we know real time what tests on that requisition are going to be approved or denied, and we know what the patient balance is. And then we provide multiple ways for that patient to pay the bill or give us a form of payment so that when the claim is adjudicated, we know how to charge the patient. So when the patient makes an appointment, and that requisition is already been delivered to us, because physician has sent it to us electronically, we can do that pre-adjudication, if you will, as the patient is making an appointment online. Your line is now open. The base revenue per requisition very, very strong here. I know we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve heard a lot of comments on pricing improving or really being less bad down 50 bibs, which would I think imply that your mix component and other components must have been something more like 4% growth on a per test basis. I know I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m throwing a lot at you, but it feels like that was a pretty big number. So let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s take price per test out, because we already said that was down about 50 basis points. There is clinical mix, business mix and payer mix. First, from a commercial payer standpoint, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a mix of cap and fee for service, and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll just tell you in the quarter fee per service was better and cap was lost. And if cap was less than, obviously, you got to fix payments. And then finally, CIT, our consumer initiated testing business has a higher revenue per rack. The pricing is better in that market, and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re getting some left from our CIT business. Okay, I think that was the last question. I again, thank you for your support over the years, we added up the math and this is my 42nd call.
