Perhaps most notably, MamaMancini's product was named to coveted today's special value dealer on QVC worked on December 8, securing approximately 5 hours of airtime throughout the day, which drove expected sales of 2 million spread throughout fiscal 2022 and 2023, inclusive of auto delivery customers over the year. Revenue for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 increased 38.5% to a record 13.9 million, compared to 10 million in the same year ago quarter. Gross profit decreased 26.8% to 2.4 million, or 17.4% of total revenues, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, compared to $3.3 million, or 32.9% of total revenues, in the same year-ago quarter. Gross profit decreased 6.3% to 11.9 million or 25.2% of total revenue in fiscal 2022, compared to 12.7 million, or 31.1% of total revenues in fiscal 2021. Operating expenses totaled 3.8 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, compared to 2.4 million in the same year-ago quarter. Operating expenses in the fourth quarter increased mainly due to transportation rate increases and fuel surcharges, 0.75 million in acquisition-related expenses, 0.20 million in increased accruals for freight and marketing expenses, as well as costs associated with uplisting to the NASDAQ. Net loss for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 was 1.3 million, or $0.04 per diluted share, as compared to a net income of 1.7 million, or $0.05 per diluted share, in the same year-ago quarter."
