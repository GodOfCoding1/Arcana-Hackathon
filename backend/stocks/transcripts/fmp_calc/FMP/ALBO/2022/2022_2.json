    "content": " In terms of the EU, really the way you need to sort of think about revenue going forward for the remainder of this year is that in sort of Q3, we would expect it to continue to be primarily patients from the countries that have already launched. And then as you know, in the -- there is U.S. patients in that number to that are going through reimbursement and very pleased with our time to fill in the U.S., we're able to quickly get patients through that process of prior authorization and onto drug. And then -- just one additional question, if I look at the total patients growing from 170 in the fourth quarter 207 in the first and 245 this past quarter, those are growth rates of 21.8% and then -- is that a reasonable way to think about the growth trajectory through the remainder of this year and into next year? Well I think, Ed I think, first of all, what we're really excited about is the new capture of patients, right, it's roughly the same quarter-on-quarter, right, is 37% and 38%. And that's the other factor here in the equation, particularly as early on, we have probably more advanced sort of disease heavier patients who were quickly then sort of transitioning to liver transplant, whereas what we're seeing now is more the patient you would expect to get, which is the babies or infants. Yes and I would just add to that Yan, as you think about sort of revenue, when you start at the beginning with a relatively small number of patients, if you get a teenager, there were significantly more obviously with weight-based dosing than if you're starting with a sort of a baby or infant."
