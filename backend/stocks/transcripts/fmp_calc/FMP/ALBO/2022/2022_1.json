    "content": " Moving to the number of patients on Bylvay, patients who have been approved and reimbursed, we have had 87 reimbursed patient initiations since launch, up from 53 at the end of 2021, a 64% increase quarter-over-quarter. As with PFIC, we expect to have a significant number of patients roll over into commercial drug from the ASCERT study and from the early access program by the time we achieve approval and launch Bylvay for Alagille syndrome. I think as you think about the sort of the building blocks to that $30 million, a simple way maybe to take it is, if you recognize that in Q1, we essentially only had revenue from patients in the U.S. and Germany. So going forward, when it's more on a demand basis, obviously, what you would expect to see quarter-by-quarter, and I think a good proxy is the patients who are currently on building and generating revenue are continuing to build."
