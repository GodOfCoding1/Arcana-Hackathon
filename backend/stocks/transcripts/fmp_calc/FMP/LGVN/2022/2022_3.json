    "content": " I'd like to remind you that this Phase 3 trial is a 48 patient, 4-arm, parallel design, randomized clinical trial of Lomecel-B designed to evaluate the safety of single and multiple infusions of two different dose levels compared to placebo in patients with mild-Alzheimer's Disease. Now, such an ASRM approval could enable us to enter the Japanese market based on demonstrated safety in Japanese patients with an expectation of efficacy, which can be established through the conduct of a small well controlled trial, combined with our previous data in aging frailty, and such an approval will allow us to administer Lomecel-B as a treatment for Aging Related Frailty of select clinical sites, addressing a crucial unmet need amongst the Japanese population."
