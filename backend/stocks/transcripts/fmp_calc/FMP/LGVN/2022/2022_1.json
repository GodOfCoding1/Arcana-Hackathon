    "content": " In the first quarter of 2022, we continue to make progress advancing our lead investigational cell therapy product Lomecel-B to clinical development for multiple indications with ongoing trials and Alzheimer's disease hypoplastic left heart syndrome or HLHS and acute respiratory distress syndrome or ARDS. We are continuing to evaluate whether Lomecel-B infusions may prevent slow or even reverse the clinical progression of Alzheimer's disease by reducing disease related brand inflammation, improving the function of blood vessels in the brain and body and thereby potentially decreasing or slowing disease related brain damage. Building on the Phase 1 data in January of this year, we initiated a 48 patient for 4-arm parallel design randomized Phase 2a clinical trial of Lomecel-B infusion in patients with mild Alzheimer's disease."
