    "content": " As a result, we have reevaluated our regulatory strategy in Japan to capitalize on the near-term value-driving market opportunity in collaboration with our clinical partners at the National Center for Geriatrics and Gerontology in Nagoya, and Juntendo University Hospital in Tokyo, we amended our Phase II trial to change the primary objective to one examine the safety of Lomecel-B and Japanese elderly with Aging Frailty. In addition to the immune response, we also evaluated several measurements of aging frailty and found that participants receiving Lomecel-B had an increase at the one-year time point in the Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System or PROMIS physical function instrument compared to a decrease in the placebo group. The difference was due to an increase in clinical trial revenue and grant revenue as follows; clinical trial revenue, which derives from our Bahamas registry trial was $0.3 million in the second quarter of 2022 compared to $0.2 million in the same period in 2021, an increase of $0.1 million or 59%."
