    "content": " Additionally, other important business routes such as Monterrey to Guadalajara, and Ciudad Ju\u00c3\u00a1rez to Mexico City delivered important growth levels versus third quarter of 2019, with an increase of 12% and 34%, respectively. As a result of the strong passenger traffic performance and the increasing aeronautical tariffs in first quarter of 2022 or aero revenue grew 27% in the quarter, versus the third quarter of 2021 to MXN1.9 billion. Commercial revenues increased 34% compared to third quarter of 2021 driven by parking car rentals, restaurants, retail and VIP lounges. OMA Carga had another set of strong results as revenues increased 35% versus the third quarter of 2021, mainly driven by revenues from handling, storage and custody of ground and airport and import cargo. Aeronautical revenues increased 27% relative to 3Q 2021, driven by a 23% increase in passenger traffic and an increase in non-aeronautical tariffs implemented in the first quarter of this year. The cost of airport services and G&A expense increase 16% relative to the third quarter of 2021, mainly due to an increase in payroll expense as a result of increased headcount, higher salaries versus last year and provisions including statutory profit sharing. So we are expecting a further increase in charter flights from Canada to our Mazatl\u00c3\u00a1n airports this winter season that's starting basically tomorrow, starting in November, and we see additional frequencies to capacity to markets such as Detroit and Los Angeles as well on the last quarter, so all these should, should bode well for a strong quarter and for OMA."
