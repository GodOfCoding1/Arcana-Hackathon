    "content": " As a result of our solid performance, 12-month passenger traffic stood at a new record level of 23.2 million passengers which represents a 29% growth as compared to 2021 and has outpaced by 0.2% our 2019 levels. In fourth quarter of '22, OMA's passenger traffic reached 6.5 million, an increase of 20.7% versus fourth quarter of '21 and was 8.7% above the same quarter of 2019. On the aggregate, these routes added 349,000 additional passengers in the quarter, an increase of 33% versus fourth quarter of '21. Primarily as a result of the strongest passenger traffic performance, our aeronautical revenue grew by 26% in the quarter versus the fourth quarter of '21 to MXN2 billion. On the commercial front, revenues increased 35% compared to the fourth quarter of '21, driven by parking, car rental, restaurants, VIP lounges and retail. OMA Carga delivered strong results went more as revenues increased 20% versus fourth quarter of '21, mainly driven by the strong operation of air and ground import cargo. Aeronautical revenues increased 26% versus Fourth quarter of 2021, driven by the 21% increase in passenger traffic and increase in our aeronautical tariffs implemented in the first quarter of last year. The cost of airport services and G&A expense increased 15.9% relative to 4Q '21, mainly due to an increase in payroll expense as a result primarily of increased headcount, higher salaries versus last year and provisions, including statutory profit shares. So in the fourth quarter of the year, our solar parks generated 17% of our total energy consumption and that contributed significantly to the savings that you're seeing in the fourth quarter relative to the fourth quarter of 2021."
