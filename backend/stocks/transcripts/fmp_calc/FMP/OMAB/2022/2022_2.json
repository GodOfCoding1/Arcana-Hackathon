    "content": " First of all, I am pleased to inform that OMA delivered an outstanding performance during the second quarter of 2022 with all-time highs on our aeronautical revenues, non-aeronautical revenues, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin, which reached 77.7%. During the quarter, total passenger traffic reached $5.9 million, an increase of 30% versus the second quarter of '21. As compared to the second quarter of 2019, total passenger traffic stood at 99%. During the quarter, the route that contributed most to passenger traffic growth in volume terms versus the second quarter of 2021 were Monterrey on its Mexico City and Guadalajara routes; and Ciudad Ju\u00c3\u00a1rez, Chihuahua and Durango one the Mexico City route. As a result of the strong passenger traffic performance as well as an increase in our aeronautical tariff earlier this year, aeronautical revenue grew 33% in the quarter versus the second quarter of '21 to MXN1.8 billion. On the commercial front, revenue increased 49% compared to the second quarter of '21. Marketing revenues increased 53% versus 2021, mainly due to higher penetration levels in Chihuahua and Monterrey as a result of higher business travel in those airports. During the second quarter of 2022, occupancy rate at our Terminal 2 NH Collection Hotel was 80% while the Hilton Garden Inn Hotel has an occupancy rate of 75%. These rates compared to 83% and 78%, respectively, in the second quarter of 2019, which reaffirms the strong performance of our hotels during the quarter. OMA Carga continued delivering strong results as revenues increased 43% versus second quarter of '21, mainly driven by revenues from handling, storage and custody of ground and air import cargo. The aforementioned aeronautical and non-aeronautical revenue performance which hit all-time highs along with our cost discipline translated into a record MXN1.8 billion adjusted EBITDA, an increase of 40% versus the second quarter of '21 and a record high margin of 77.7%. Aeronautical revenues increased 33% relative to the second quarter of 2021, driven by a 30% increase in passenger traffic and an increase in analogical tariffs implemented in the first quarter of the year. The cost of airport services and G&A expense increased 12% relative to the second quarter of '21 mainly due to an increase of 16% in payroll expense, which results from the effects of the changes in labor regulations in Mexico that were implemented in the second half of 2021, and the incorporation of new business lines, mainly the operation of the OMA Premium Lounges. Consolidated net income was MXN928 million, an increase of 50% versus the second quarter of 2021. So for example, in the second quarter of 2022, 11% of our passengers were international as compared to 14% in 2Q '21. So for example, versus the same quarter of last year, Monterrey grew 32%, Chihuahua grew 25% and Ciudad Ju\u00c3\u00a1rez grew 45%. And we also had a smaller amount of tour paying passengers in this quarter, around 47.5% of our total passengers who are tour paying passengers as compared to 48.5% in the same quarter of last year."
