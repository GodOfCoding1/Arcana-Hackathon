    "content": " Total revenue for the first quarter was $183.7 million, up 10.4% year-over-year, reflecting substantial growth in both our electricity and product segments. The difference in margin performance is driven primarily by one-time revenue of $5.4 million in the first quarter of 2021 related to the February power crisis in Texas, as well as the impact of the shutdown of the Heber power plant in late February. Adjusted EBITDA of $107.9 million, increased 8.7% in the first quarter, compared to $99.2 million in the first quarter last year, with EBITDA growth being largely driven by Electricity segment. Breaking the revenues down at the segment level, Electricity segment level increased 12.1% to $160.5 million supported by contribution from new asset gain through the TerraGen acquisition, expansion of our McGinness Hills complex and increase in the operation in Puna, which also benefited from higher electricity prices."
