    "content": " In the first quarter of 2023, we expect a slightly higher rate of year-over-year revenue decline as compared to the fourth quarter trend in the U.S. which reflects the current environment and represents some further softening across Manpower, Experis and RPO. Your line is open. Your line is open. But on an overall basis, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d say if you think about the quarter overall, we still grew GP dollars across all brands, so that indicates that the environment still, although it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s choppy and a bit uneven and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re certainly seeing more pressure on the Manpower side, there continues to be very good opportunity in pockets, even in Manpower in pockets, and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve talked about the investment in specialty. Your line is open. I think for the first quarter for GP margin, still holding up very well, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d say, so you can see at the midpoint we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re at 18.1% - that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s still up 70 basis points year-over-year. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. It is one of the countries, one of the few countries where we, as well as the industry never came back to pre-pandemic levels, so I would say the same phenomenon that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re seeing in other markets where there is a slowdown, longer sales cycles, longer times to close recruitment cycles, but still an environment that is constructive to our higher value offerings, our higher skill sets within Manpower and also some very good opportunities in workforce transformation as it relates to Talent Solutions. Your line is open."
