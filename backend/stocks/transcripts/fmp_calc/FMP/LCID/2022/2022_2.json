So I mean, I'm not really going to provide any guidance with respect to how much cash we want to the bank, but I just want you to know that you're going to continue to see from us the same type of proactive kind of opportunistic behavior that you've seen every quarter, we're coming to you, and we're telling you about something interesting that we've done in the capital markets, we did the convertible bond offering."
