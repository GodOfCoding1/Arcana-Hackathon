    "content": " Before handing the call over to Peter, let me remind you that some of the statements on this call, particularly those regarding the future financial performance of the company, production and delivery volumes, macroeconomic and industry trends, company initiatives, supply chain dynamics, expansion of our studios and manufacturing facilities, and other future events are based on the information that we have as of today and constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. So, we think we are extremely well positioned in the technology race, but we need to get Lucid Air\u2019s into the hands of more customers and ramping production of quality vehicles is my top priority. Total reservations grew to 30,000 as of today, which doesn\u2019t include the additional 100,000 units from the agreement with the Government of Saudi Arabia and we believe interest will continue to increase as the number of Lucid Airs on the road grows and as more consumers are able to experience this luxury and performance in-person. We announced pricing for the Grand Touring Performance at $179,000, reflecting our appreciation for our early Lucid Air Dream purchasers, but also reflecting cost increases in the commodity, supply chain and logistics and market. Yes, so the answer to that is yes, in our outlook section of the shareholder presentation, also in my prepared remarks, we said we would have the Air Grand Touring Performance in June and then that\u2019s going to be sequentially followed by the Air Touring and the Air Pure later this year and of course, we still have the production of the Project Gravity SUV starting in the first half of 2024. David, we will take our next question, please. David, we will take our next question, please."
