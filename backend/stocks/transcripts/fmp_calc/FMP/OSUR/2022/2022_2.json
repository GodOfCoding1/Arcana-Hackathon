    "content": " For the second quarter, the overall Diagnostics business unit revenue was $60.4 million and grew 213% relative to the same quarter last year. Additionally, as a reminder, the CDC recently issued a $41 million grant opportunity notification specifically for the mass mailing of HIV self-tests to persons disproportionately affected by HIV in the U.S., renewing the Let's Stop HIV Together program for the next 5 years. Our gross margins for InteliSwab increased over 2,000 basis points sequentially in the quarter and were relatively in line with our overall company margins as we continue to improve our production processes with significant focus on how to optimize efficiency. First, from a top line perspective, we delivered total revenue of $80.2 million in the second quarter which is another new record for the company, representing year-over-year growth of 39%. This quarter, we had only one -- we had a one-time inventory reserve from molecular COVID-19 collection kits with limited shelf life remaining, totaling $3.8 million which negatively impacted the gross margins for our Molecular Solutions business. First, the overall mix shift between our historically lower gross margin Diagnostics business and historically higher gross margin Molecular Solutions business was significant in the quarter, with approximately 75% of revenue coming from Diagnostics in the quarter versus 57% last quarter. For the third quarter, we expect total revenue of $90 million to $95 million, representing 67% to 76% year-over-year growth and 13% to 19% sequential growth as we anticipate sequential growth in both InteliSwab revenue and our core business."
