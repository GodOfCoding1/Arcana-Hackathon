The other things that Ken mentioned that we're focused on, is when you look at the manufacturing side, we still have some significant changes that we're looking at in terms of site consolidation, standardization across products and then also looking at things like some of the learnings from InteliSwab, transferring that to the additional tests, which we think will drive margin improvements over time."
