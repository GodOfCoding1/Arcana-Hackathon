    "content": " I also believe it is important to highlight that this quarter, excluding COVID-19 products, both our Diagnostics and our Molecular Solutions businesses grew at a double-digit rate year-over-year, with Diagnostics up 11% year-over-year and Molecular Solutions growing 28% year-over-year. For the first quarter, the overall Diagnostics business unit revenue was $38.3 million and grew 163% versus last year. Our core domestic diagnostic business, excluding InteliSwab grew 7% in the quarter due primarily to increased employee drug testing as more people returned to work and gains in our grant revenues from the US government versus Q1 of last year. Outside the US, the international diagnostic business grew 20% versus the prior year quarter and grew even faster on a volume basis given the expiration of the Bill and Melinda Gates subsidy in June of 2021. While InteliSwab was clearly a major growth driver on a year-over-year basis, we would also highlight that our non-COVID-19 products actually grew 21% year-over-year, with double-digit core growth in both our Diagnostics and Molecular Solutions business. This quarter, however, we are anticipating continued growth in InteliSwab in the second quarter, but this will be offset to some extent by expected meaningful reduction in our COVID-19 collection kits business, given the decline in laboratory testing in the United States."
