    "content": " Complete opposite day for -- performance hurt our book value, while at the same time, we got great news from our private portfolio, not only in terms of a markup to the portfolio in the quarter, but also the potential and actual monetizations that help us nearly complete the transformation in the mix of assets on our balance sheet that we started five years ago. $16.19 without it, $7.38 with it -- I'm sorry, $7.30 with it, and we do expect to get those proceeds any day, and they couldn't come at a better time for us given what the market has done. Given these dynamics, we subscribe to the rights offering because we believe the stock still has over 100% upside from here, Quantum declined 59% in the quarter and reduced our NAV by $0.50 a share or $5.2 million. And none of this include analysis -- actually includes consideration that, that $12.3 million we're going to receive in cash any day for our sale of Petra milestones, which equates to an additional direct addition to cash of $1.19 per share goes straight onto our balance sheet. I mean if I look at your book net asset value of $981, you're at a 35% plus discount, what better way to use some of your funds and buying at that discount will grow automatically grow the NAV. I've always believed that a company should be buying back stock when it's accretive and a stock that trades at 65% of book value, which we think is well run is a good source of -- a good use of our cash. It's the fact that we also have close to $100 million in operating loss and capital loss carryforwards that allows us to shelter these gains that we're generating on investments, which can help us compound. We should trade at 85% to 90% of book value, if we have some sort of yield, if we can get to $100 million in assets, is it going to kill us if we give back $5 million or $7 million or $10 million to our shareholders."
