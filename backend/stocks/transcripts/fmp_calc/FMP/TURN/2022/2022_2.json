    "content": " Amidst what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been a very difficult 2022, there is some underlying positives that we have to share with you this morning and Daniel will talk a little bit more about that in terms of our transformation from where we were, a business that was filled with private assets on our balance sheet to one where 80% of our balance sheet currently is in cash and public assets. On Slide 6, we show you every quarter since we started, it makes little to no sense to me that the market thought our business was worth $0.65 on the dollar when we had 90% of our assets in private holdings and 65% \u00e2\u0080\u0093 $0.65 on the dollar when we have 80% of our assets in public assets. Skipping to Slide 8, you will see our normal sources of change in assets quarter-to-quarter, where we start with a book value of $9.80, a loss of $1.27 from our public holdings, $0.12 from our privates and $0.07 from our operating expenses to arrive at an $8.35 book value, obviously, disappointing for sure. And if you do that work, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll know that we are \u00e2\u0080\u0093 as I said in our \u00e2\u0080\u0093 that I said and Daniel said, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re meaningfully higher from both a cash and public assets perspective and an NAV perspective than where we were at the June 30 quarter."
