Subscription revenue for the second quarter was $213 million, $5 million above the high end of our guidance, representing an increase of 35% on a year-over-year basis, or 33% in constant currency. As a result, we invested $32 million in R&D this quarter, that's up over 33% from last year and approaching our targeted R&D investment level of 15% of revenue. Moving on to guidance, as I outlined last quarter, we believe the investments we're making in commercial expansion and product innovation will enable us to maintain 120% net expansion and at least 15% to 20% new logo growth over the mid-term. We're raising our subscription revenue guidance, now expected to be between $857.5 million and $862.5 million up 31% to 32% year-over-year or 30% to 31% in constant currency. Your line is now live.

Yes, so we just dropped some of the side data, but think of it as about a 5%, increase in the customer base on a quarter-over-quarter basis, I mean, we're doing extremely well, selling cross selling that module in with the full-stack customers.
