    "content": " In particular, we continue to deliver very strong growth in adjusted ARR of 35% for the fourth quarter and the full fiscal year, marking the second straight year of mid-30s growth for Dynatrace. ARR is a key performance metric of the overall strength of the business, and we delivered 35% adjusted ARR growth for the second year in a row, exceeding the high end of our guidance range by one percentage point, highlighting the resiliency and predictability of our business model. As you think about your models over the course of the year, keep in mind that every 1% movement in non-USD currency equates to roughly $6 million of movement in ARR. Starting with our guidance for the full year, again, with growth rates in constant currency, we expect ARR to be between $1.25 billion and $1.265 billion representing an adjusted ARR growth of 29% to 30%.
