On cloud music, again, a more challenging industry environment and macro headwinds, we maintained strong growth in the second quarter and total revenues improved by 29% year-over-year to RMB 2.2 billion. If we exclude Youdao, our selling and marketing expenses as a percentage of net revenue were 12%, compared with 11% in the same period last year, mainly due to increased spending on certain games promotion during the second quarter."
