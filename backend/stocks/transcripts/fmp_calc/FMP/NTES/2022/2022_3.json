Amid a challenging macro environment, total revenues of Cloud Music grew by 22% year-over-year as we continued to expand our paying user base and optimize our pricing strategy.

The portfolio we have curated of diverse and long-lasting games in China provide a steady base for us to build further upon coupled with our globalization strategy, our prospects are exciting and we believe we are well positioned for continued growth. As we advance each of our businesses with innovative products and services, we will continue to use our strong cash position to buy back shares and pay dividends that directly reward our shareholders. Net revenue totalled for RMB24.4 billion in the third quarter or US$3.4 billion, representing a 10% increase year-over-year. Total net revenues from our games and related VAS services were RMB18.7 billion, up 9% year-over-year. The growth was primarily due to increased revenue contribution from both mobile and PC games, including our existing games such as Fantasy Westward Journey Online series and , as well as newly launched Diablo Immortal. Youdao's net revenues were RMB1.4 billion, a moderate increase from last year. Net revenues of Cloud Music were RMB2.4 billion, up nearly 22% year-over-year. Net revenues for innovative businesses and others were nearly RMB2 billion, up 14% year-over-year, mainly due to increased contribution from Yanxuan in the third quarter. GP margin for Cloud Music continues to improve in the third quarter, climbing to 14.2% versus 2.2% 1 year ago. For our innovative businesses and others, GP margin was 25.5% compared with 27.2% last year. If we look at our cost composition, our selling and marketing expenses as a percentage of total net revenues was 15.4% compared with 14.1% for the same period last year. Additionally, the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar against RMB fluctuating over the last couple of periods also contributed to the accounting gain in other income line. Our non-GAAP net income from continuing operations attributable to shareholders for the third quarter totalled RMB7.5 billion, or US$1.1 billion. As of the quarter end, our net cash position was about RMB95 billion compared with RMB86 billion as of the year-end of last year. Lastly, we continued to buy back shares during the volatile period under our current share repurchase program for up to US$3 billion which expires in March of next year. And today, our Board announced the approval of a new share repurchase program of additionally up to US$5.0 billion of the company's ADS and ordinary shares in open market transactions for a period not to exceed 36 months. In addition, NetEase purchased 0.7 million ordinary shares of NetEase Cloud Music for a total cost of about US$6.9 million during the third quarter. On today's announcement about not renewing certain license related in China, that is still to expire next year. In the third quarter, Infinity obtained approval of multi-devices version, we also know that a car also post multiterminal. NetEase has created some overseas IP games such as Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings and -- so what's the progress of -- approval for the domestic version, except Harry Potter local IPs such as . At the same time, we noticed that in certain regions, many of our users actually own PC and mobile and console all at the same time and they play games on all 3 platforms. But for these players, they would also -- they would like to be able to switch seamlessly between these platforms which is why we are also looking into developing games -- developing cross-platform games. For us, there's no real technical barrier for developing an operating cross-platform games. Therefore, we take into consideration of users' needs, product features, market feedback and other factors before deciding whether we should do a multi-platform version for each of our games. So for these following IPs and our self-developed IP, the ultimate difference is that in a virtual world, we can -- the virtual world we can bring to gamers are different. In the past, we sold a lot of games based on our rental culture, such as FWJ, WJ, Justice and Naraka. But by introducing IPs like Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings, , we can actually diversify and enrich the different world that we can create for our users, allowing them to experience different things. So therefore, the reason for having all those IPs is to further enrich our game pipeline and create different gaming experience for our gamers. So we can find that NetEase has been investing in the overseas markets since the beginning of the year, especially including investing or acquiring a studios. So in the past few years, you've actually seen a number of very successful titles from -- that we've self-developed in innovative regions, such as Identity 5, Knives Out in Japan. And also, we've seen some very successful PC titles in the global market as well, like Naraka: Bladepoint that we launched last year. So over the long term, we would hope to work very closely together with its global studies to create global blockbusters for our worldwide game players. So whether in particular time whether the market is driving, it depends on whether the -- it depends on the game quality themselves. In a certain time, we will have a number of high-quality games available for games to play that will be the market driving. At the same time, if the gaming content available, it's not interesting, is mediocre, is a duplication of previous games then the market is slow. So in our view, is right now, we not about mortgage situation but rather that's been black high-quality games. In the last 1 to 2 years, we have launched many new games overseas. And secondly, about the developments, we're developing more cash flow genres to fit the ties of overseas games about our cost structure. Since we launched Naraka last year and to Xbox in June this year, we've been very closely monitoring the reactions and feedback from the game of community. So from what we've seen, we think the players overall is very satisfied with this -- with our game with this -- it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s very unique mainly combat user experience. So every day, we are having discussions on how to make our users happier within the game. And Alex, for your second question about the overall trend of head count and operating expenses over the last 5, 6 quarters, our overall total head count stays relatively steady at above 30,000 overall head count. More specifically in the last quarter, by the quarter end, we have north of 31,000  overall head count, representing quarter-over-quarter about incremental 1,000 head count which is consistent with our summer recruiting season of campus recruiting. Oftentimes, when you see an increase in R&D, in selling and marketing, that is actually an indication that we are developing a strong pipeline or we are about to launch an exciting new games -- and if we are patient enough, you will see the huge reward that we are planting the seeds today. And currently, we will for -- we actually have a pretty -- plentiful of games to be launched over this market. We have our 3 games in Japan market that include  like PCG, racing and  And we have a cool games in Europe and North American market, in PPS, PCG and combat -- competitive games. I noticed that the Chinese users, a lot of them are people in their 30s or 40s, it's mostly  and tier cities. Going forward, we're going to explore -- discover more game users and promote game to a greater range of audience."
