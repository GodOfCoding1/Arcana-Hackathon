    "content": " Looking more specifically at the second half of the year, we see very robust activity dynamics characterized by distinct acceleration of investments in the international basins and the continued strengthening of offshore activity as all operators, including IOCs, step-up spending. Well Construction revenue of $2.7 million increased 12%, driven by strong growth and improved pricing both internationally and in North America. And as I said, there is an inflection building up in Middle East activity that will materialize in two or three countries visibly into the second half, and will accelerate next year as we will see more offshore shallow activity partially into the VCC environment in Middle East led by the Saudi oil major development that they are accelerating for oil capacity increase towards their 2027 1 million barrel. And we believe that going forward, as we see the inflection of international investment that have started to accelerate in the second half as we anticipate second half international rate of growth will outpace the North America rate of growth, we see that to generate more floor and uplift for the pricing environment going forward. Finally, our confidence in the activity mix outlook for the second half, particularly the rotation of investment internationally, combined with pricing tailwinds, has led us to revise our full year expectation for both the revenue and earnings growth."
