    "content": " With this backdrop, and despite the uncertainty linked to Russia, we believe that the favorable market conditions I outlined should allow us to maintain our full-year ambitions of year-on-year revenue growth in the mid-teens, and adjusted EBITDA margins exiting the year at least 200 basis points higher than the fourth quarter of 2021. You see that there is a set of potential risk of Russia supply dislocation, I think, what is important is that the demand trajectory that is recovering, and it\u2019s set to further increase next year, compared to previous prediction, not only to offset that, but to also respond to the market, I think, will be contributing overall, so it\u2019s very difficult to predict."
