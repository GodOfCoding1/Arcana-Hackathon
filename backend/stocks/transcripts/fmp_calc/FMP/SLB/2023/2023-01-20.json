    "content": " On a full year basis, our ambition is to grow revenue in excess of 15% compared to 2022, supported by the step-up in international and offshore momentum, which will augment growth established in North America. Reservoir Performance revenue increased 7% sequentially, while margins expanded 146 basis points, primarily due to new projects and activity gains internationally, led by the Middle East and the offshore basins. Well Construction revenue of $3.2 billion, increased 5% sequentially, due to strong activity from new projects and solid pricing improvements internationally, particularly in the Middle East and in Latin America. And I believe that the -- with our commitment for capacity expansion and gas development in Middle East is combining with offshore long-cycle, a return of deepwater, which is the operating environment that will see the most activity increase this year and also the return or the acceleration of exploration and appraisal offshore, which would be one of the defining characteristics of the quarters to come. There is not only activity-based growth coming this year not to the same magnitude in land market like last year and still support also pricing, considering the stretch and considering the recognized premium on Fit technology and on performance and part and this is true both on land and on offshore environment. So combining the, what is expected to be the FID and dollar value in offshore environment in 2023 in the last 10 years with a pipeline is still strong going forward, we indeed expect three years to five years follow through on offshore from today and combining with Middle East, the rest, I think, is more related to short-cycle and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s difficult to combine."
