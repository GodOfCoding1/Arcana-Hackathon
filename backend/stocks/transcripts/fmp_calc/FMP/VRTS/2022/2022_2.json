    "content": " Though, we reported lower AUM and earnings per share as adjusted, I would note several important highlights including a highest level of institutional sales and seventh consecutive quarter of positive institutional net flows, positive flows in ETFs and our private client business, solid operating margin, increased capital return to shareholders and a modest level of leverage positioning us for continued balance sheet flexibility. Average assets under management in the quarter were $171.4 billion, down 10% largely due to market performance. Reviewing by product, institutional net flows of $0.4 billion were positive for the seventh consecutive quarter and included a meaningful new global REIT mandate as well as additional funding from an existing global growth client. Turning to Slide 9, investment management fees as adjusted of $175.9 million declined $20.4 million or 10%, reflecting the 10% sequential decline in average assets and a modestly lower average fee rate. Total employment expenses as adjusted of $89.1 million decreased 12% sequentially, primarily reflecting $9.7 million of seasonal items in the prior quarter related to the timing of annual incentives. Turning to Slide 11, other operating expenses as adjusted were $31 million, up 6% on a sequential basis from $29.3 million due to $0.8 million of annual grants to the Board of Directors and an increase in travel and related expenses."
