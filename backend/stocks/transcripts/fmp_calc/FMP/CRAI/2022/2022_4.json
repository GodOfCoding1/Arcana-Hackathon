    "content": " In addition, our antitrust and competition, economics and life sciences practices also expanded revenue year-over-year, which is impressive, given the strong currency headwinds that CRA's largest global practices faced during the fourth quarter. Yes, in aggregate, the practice saw overall project lead flow, growth including both merger and relate -- merger-related and non-merger-related opportunities expanded by more than 15% in the fourth quarter relative to a year ago, partially fueling the practices increase in revenue year-over-year. Looking more broadly, revenue from CRA's legal and regulatory services during the fourth quarter increased 12% year-over-year despite mixed trends in the legal market. Non-GAAP selling, general and administrative expenses, excluding the 2.6% attributable to commissions to non-employee experts was 16.7% of revenue for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 compared with 16.1% a year ago this quarter's ratio."
