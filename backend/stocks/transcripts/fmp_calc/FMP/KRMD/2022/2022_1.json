    "content": " And our efforts to increase penetration in our core business, the U.S. business nearly doubled the pace of the overall SCIg drug market growth, driven by a 40% increase in our pumps as an indicator of new patient starts. Prefilled syringes are rapidly capturing market share and represent 5% of the total SCIg grams infused today, up from 3.4% in the prior quarter and driven by expanded efforts from our label expansion for prefilled syringes in November. I'm pleased to report our second consecutive quarter of double-digit net sales growth, ending the first quarter of 2022 with net sales of $6.2 million a 15% increase from $5.4 million from the same period last year. As we expand our Novel Therapies pipeline, we are also excited to report Novel Therapies sales were $355,000 for the 3 months ended March 31, 2022, a $300,000 increase from the same period of 2021, primarily due to recognition of initial NRE revenues from an innovation milestone achievement for a large SCIg customer, which is expected to continue to generate NRE revenues through 2022 and clinical and commercialization revenues in the years following. For full year 2022, we are tightening our revenue guidance to the top end of the range at $26.5 million to $27 million, previously $26 million to $27 million, due to the Q1 U.S. market growth, which is approaching our high single-digit range prior communicated for the year an expansion in our novel therapies pipeline. So clearly, the rebound in the U.S. market is going to be the biggest thing that drives us back to that 15% plus growth range and the -- what we saw happen in first quarter, I talked about a 7% average on the quarter, but it looked like a 3% growth in January, 7% growth in February and a 10% growth in March."
