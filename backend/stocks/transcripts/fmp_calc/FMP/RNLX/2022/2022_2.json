    "content": " Examples of these statements include without limitation, statements related to KidneyIntelX's ability to lower healthcare costs, improved patient quality of life and set the long-term standard of care, trends in our market and potential benefits of government policy change, the impact of COVID-19 on our business, our expectations for hiring, product development, strategic partnerships and collaborations, reimbursement decisions, clinical studies, and regulatory submissions, and our business strategies and future growth. There are now currently an estimated 180 primary care physicians outside of the Veterans Health Administration System using KidneyIntelX today, a number we plan to grow significantly through the remainder of the calendar year. The cost effectiveness model is really important to us because it looks at the patient population, the way that a integrated health system or the Medicare program where a patient gets in Medicare and stays on Medicare or the Veterans Health Administration would look at those patients and it considers some of the important factors like mortality, patient quality of life. It also gives us an incredible opportunity to gather data, specifically behavioral data to understand how is advanced prognosis affecting quality of care, how are physicians reacting to advanced prognosis, how can we improve KidneyIntelX to make the process better, simpler, faster, especially for the primary care physician so that they can get the care and the understanding around that patient. And we're at advanced planning stages in three other systems for the full integration model, which involves deploying software to extract the data that we need to execute, getting to access and seamlessly deliver the results with obviously all those future pipeline systems looking us using that streamlined model of integration going forward."
