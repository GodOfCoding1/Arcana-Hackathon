    "content": " Third quarter consolidated net sales increased 2% year-over-year to $503 million, driven by strong consumption growth in the U.S., partially offset by declines in the international business unit, resulting from soft total store sales in the UK, the loss of sales from a large non-dairy co-man account, and a decision we made to temporarily halt shipments on selected brands during price negotiations. 17:01 Third quarter adjusted EBITDA decreased, compared to year ago to $58.7 million, primarily driven by accelerating raw material and finished goods inflation and ongoing supply chain disruptions, partially offset by price increases we've taken year to date and supply chain productivity. While the industry-wide supply chain challenges impacted the profitability of the quarter, the year-to-date pricing actions we have taken and our robust productivity pipeline are beginning to catch up with inflation, which was a 740 basis point headwind versus the prior year period. Net sales for the third quarter versus the prior year period decreased 14% on a reported basis, driven by mid-single-digit declines across the UK Grocery store channel, the loss of a major non-dairy beverage customer, and the impact of shipment halts during the price increase negotiations with certain customers in the UK."
