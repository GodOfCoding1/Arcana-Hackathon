    "content": " As you will hopefully have seen from today's press release, we've set out our high-level preliminary fourth quarter 2022 results, which we believe showed a strong end to last year, and a revised 2023 plan aims at rapidly further improving our unit economics and conserving cash. However, in the current economic climate, we believe the right course of action for 2023 is to focus on further improving our unit economics, materially reducing our fixed cost base and preserving cash as we make continued progress towards our goal of reaching profitability without the need to raise further funding over the next 18 to 24 months. But generally, Q4 was a combination, the cash burn of U.K. burn at the old rate of fixed costs, which obviously are materially lower as we go into 2023 following this rightsizing and restructuring plan and also a number of one-off costs related to the wind down of our operations in the EU, which we'll see a little bit more of in Q1."
