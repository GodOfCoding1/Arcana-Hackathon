    "content": " You can see on Slide 5, that we achieved record revenues of \u00c2\u00a3333 million in Q2 up 145% year-on-year with retail unit sales of over 17,000, as we grew our market share significantly despite the tough macroeconomic backdrop. In more recent weeks, I'm particularly pleased that despite the weak economic environment affecting growth in many other businesses and sectors, we've maintained our strong momentum into Q3, with record retail unit sales and revenues in July, whilst continuing to also grow our website inventory further. We're targeting total retail sales of between 70,000 to 80,000 units for 2022, which when combined with the ancillary sales and wholesale business, we believe should drive total revenues of between \u00c2\u00a31.4 billion to \u00c2\u00a31.5 billion with year-on-year growth well over 100%. In addition, as we've detailed in previous calls, we've already put in place further improvements, which we expect will also continue to drive GPU growth during the year such as further optimizing our pricing decisions, increasing the proportion of costs sourced directly from consumers and increasing finance and ancillary revenue streams."
