    "content": " I'd like to start by discussing our Q1 performance, which was a very encouraging quarter in many respects and why we continue to expect strong sequential quarterly growth throughout the rest of the year, despite an uncertain macroeconomic backdrop, then I'll spend some time discussing why we remain highly confident in achieving our long-term targets. Despite a rapidly changing macroeconomic climate, we achieved over 50% sequential quarterly growth in retail units sold during the period, driven by increased inventory available on our website and strongly supporting our fee set that increased reconditioning output and available inventory leads to greater sales. We continue to make good progress in mainland Europe since our launches in France and Germany late last year, and expect to see a positive impact to our unit sales in those markets once we begin our brand marketing campaigns there in the coming weeks. As a reminder, our Q1 2022, and our Q4 2021 UK retail GPUs were heavily impacted by the two big steps we made in the second half of last year to recondition all our cars in-house and to source a large proportion of the cars that we sell directly from consumers. We will be selling more units on a quarterly basis sequentially throughout the year and so on a volume weighted basis, you would expect to see both GPU and unit sales go up throughout the year so Q1 should be a low point both in terms of unit sales volumes and GPU."
