    "quarter": 2,
    "year": 2022,
    "date": "2022-07-30 16:14:02",
    "content": " On today's call, management will refer to non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, non-GAAP income from operations, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP operating income margin, non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA margin, non-GAAP organic sales, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating working capital, non-GAAP net debt, non-GAAP free cash flow and non-GAAP adjusted free cash flow. As an example, during the quarter, we saw strong activity in the medical market with a multimillion dollar order for a new customer in the home health care industry and also secured several prototype orders in the surgical hand tool and medical infusion systems segments, which will generate approximately $5 million in future revenues at full run production rates. Non-GAAP adjusted free cash flow for the quarter was $34.3 million compared with $56 million in the year-ago quarter due to the continued, albeit lower than Q1 and investments in inventory to support our strong underlying demand. Although we removed approximately $194 million of annual revenue from our business with the JVS divestiture, our team's performance has Altra positioned to deliver full year sales equivalent to or higher than what we reported in 2021. We are adjusting our normalized tax rate for the full year to be in the range of 22% to 24%, and we are lowering our adjusted non-GAAP free cash flow range to $100 million to $125 million to reflect our investment to support the strong demand we are experiencing and support growth activities. That said, if you layer in another $25 million of surcharges in the back half of the year, then you would see similar growth as we've seen in the first half of the year around that 12%, 13% range on an overall basis."
