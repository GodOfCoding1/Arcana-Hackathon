I think another way to think about it is basically in Diamondback today is pre-FireBird at a $500 million run rate of capital, I would say, somewhere below 10% increase off of that makes sense. And then as you think about 2024, we think there's going to be pockets of weakness in 2024, certainly easing in the back half of the year when the big pipe Matterhorn comes on, but it's going to be tight from now until then, because some of these expansions, yeah, there are 500 million a day expansion, but I think they're going to be full right away. And I think the curves that we posted on slide 7 proved out that our Midland Basin is certainly top notch, and that's where we're going to be focused."
