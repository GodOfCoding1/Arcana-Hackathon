    "content": " 2022 included hyper growth in our cloud business, significant growth in the number of customers that subscribe to our full software supply chain platform, powered by advanced DevOps and DevSecOps end-to-end solutions, and the higher landing ASP with customers who invested more in digital transformation. In another Q4 example, one of France's most recognizable luxury brands turned to JFrog for complete visibility and security across the software supply chain, saying they could now build once and run everywhere securely across multiple cloud providers. Despite these challenges, we see growing need for DevOps security and edge solutions across the software supply chain in 2023 and beyond, continuing to believe JFrog's software supply chain platform sets industry standards and delivers unmatched value to the market. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. So if we see that the trends of customer migration accelerate or the trend of customer usage optimization in cloud decelerate, that's what could create potential upside on the cloud usage, also, the adoption of our security solution for on-prem customers. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. Your line is now open."
