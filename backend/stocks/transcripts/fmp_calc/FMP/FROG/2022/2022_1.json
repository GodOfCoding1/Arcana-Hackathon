    "content": " Our cloud revenue in the first quarter grew by 63% year-over-year, compared to 52% reported in the previous quarter, driven primarily by increased usage of our security capabilities and growing adoption of our platform subscription through our cloud marketplace channels. As a result of this demand, the number of customers with ARR over $100,000 also grew significantly to $5.99 compared to $5.37 in the previous quarter and our trailing four-quarter net dollar retention expanded to 131% compared to 130% in the previous quarter. JFrog's strategy of enabling a hybrid environment is being validated daily by our customers, who are considering or already moving between cloud and on-prem with their DevOps and security tool set. In partnership with our strategic sales team the manufacturing customer moved to JFrog platform enterprise cloud subscription in the cloud, which led to a net new ARR of $500,000 Moving to security. And to find a zero-day vulnerability and injected into x-ray database as mentioned during the script is a platform for JFrog customers because they are better protected and faster in remediation processes, the security that JFrog x-ray now gives them covers not only the features and the scanning and everything the technology covered, but also a very strong research team that reveal more and more zero days actually more than any other company in the domain."
