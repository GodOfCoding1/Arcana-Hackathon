    "content": " Our cloud revenue grew by 68% year-over-year compared to 63% reported in the previous quarter, demonstrating our cloud-first strategy and driven partly by continued growth in our cloud marketplace channels and customers' cloud migrations. As for larger company deals in the quarter, the number of customers with ARR over $100,000, grew to 647 compared to 599 in the previous quarter, increased 56% year-over-year, and our trailing 4 quarters' net dollar retention grew to 132% compared to 131% reported in the previous quarter. For example, the second major deal this quarter came from 1 of the world's largest financial institutions that migrated part of its IT assets to JFrog's Cloud, grew their adoption and increased their annual spend by 67%. Momentum in our cloud business continued with revenues of $19.2 million, up 68% year-over-year, driven by increased levels of customer usage and continued migration of customers from self-managed to SaaS. In the  quarter, since, we have seen continued acceleration and customer adoption of our cloud solutions and JFrog DevOps platform delivered on our commitment to the market. And I would add to that, Brad, that many times, we see when customers transition to cloud, they also add additional capabilities because they maybe did not have sufficient mobile in-house to use the full DevOps platform. On the expansion, with customers, this is split between 2, a, if you're moving to a new strategy, let's say that you're implementing a hybrid environment, and you're not just now renewing more and taking more of the on-prem assets but you're also subscribing to the cloud, then it requires also technology C-level approval and so on."
