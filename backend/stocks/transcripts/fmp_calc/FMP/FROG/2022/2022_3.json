    "content": " Our customers tell us how they use JFrog platform to import, bid, manage, secure and distribute binaries to production and how vital our solution is to their full software supply chain flow. In Q3, one of the world's top 3 largest automobile manufacturers joined JFrog as a new customer -- this multimillion dollar deal that was completed in partnership with cloud marketplace included a full adoption of the JFrog platform and notably originated through community efforts around Konan. Expansion in our cloud business continued with revenues of $21 million, up 60% year-over-year, representing 29% of total revenues, driven by new customer wins and increased usage within security and DevOp solutions. But we don't see any vendor provide a full platform that is focusing on the binaries and secure your software supply chain, manage your binaries and also the distribution to the edge, more what we see at the front it's homegrown solution that we are replacing and some emerging technologies that are trying to get into this market. And you also see that in the numbers, the number of customers over $100,000 number of customers over $1 million, the number of platform adoption really encourage us that we are taking the right decision at the go-to-market and the technology that leads that. We continue to see that the primary reason for adoption of the platform distribution capabilities, Advanced Security will also be available for enterprise plus customers. Therefore, we keep investing in our infrastructure as the platform but customers that are betting on JFrog, those who chose JFrog this year, those who renewed this year, probably looking at the long run as they set up their security and DevOps, essential infrastructure, cloud or on-prem."
