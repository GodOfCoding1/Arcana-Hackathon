    "content": " Consolidated net sales for the third quarter of fiscal 2022 increased 11.2% to $17.4 million compared to net sales of $15.6 million for the same period last year. Consolidated net sales for the first 9 months of fiscal 2022 were $49 million, an increase of 13.3% compared to net sales of $43.3 million for the same period last year. Gross profit was $13.9 million in the first 9 months of fiscal 2022, an increase of 23.8% compared to $11.2 million in the first 9 months of fiscal 2021. This operating leverage, which is beneficial at higher sales levels, positively impacted our gross profit margins in the third quarter and first 9 months of fiscal year 2022. The increase in SG&A expenses during the third quarter and first 9 months of fiscal 2022 compared to the same period last year was primarily the result of net increases in employee and contracted sales personnel-related costs, as expected, as net sales have increased. OCC recorded a net loss of $372,000 or $0.05 per basic and diluted share for the third quarter of fiscal 2022 compared to net income of $5.4 million or $0.71 per basic and diluted share for the third quarter of fiscal 2021."
