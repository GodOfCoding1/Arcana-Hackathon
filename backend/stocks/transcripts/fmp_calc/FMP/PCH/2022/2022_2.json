    "content": " As expected, lumber prices moderated during the quarter from the extraordinarily high levels we saw in Q1 when the random length framing lumber composite price exceeded $1,300 per thousand board feet. The project will increase the mills annual capacity by 85 million board feet and significantly reduce cash processing costs, which we expect will result in incremental EBITDA of $25 million to $30 million per year and a 22% IRR in a base case. Starting with page five of the slides, adjusted EBITDA was $175 million in the second quarter, while the amount is lower than the $246 million of EBITDA that we generated in the first quarter, it was the second most profitable second quarter in the company's history. Our average lumber price realizations decreased 20% from $1,075 per thousand board feet in the first quarter to $865 per thousand board feet in the second quarter. For modeling purposes, our quarterly Wood Products depreciation will increase approximately $3 million per quarter starting with the third quarter, That's because depreciation is being accelerated on Waldo assets that are being replaced in the modernization and expansion project. Your line is open. It's going to generate, all told, about $7 million of incremental EBITDA, it's going to add about 200,000 tons to 250,000 tons per year to our harvest plan. And the way we think about it is, we spent $101 million and we're going to pick up $7 million of EBITDA and that's the average over the next 10 years. Your line is open. And coincidentally it pencils out at around $500 per thousand board feet, which if you think about that, we're optimistic that lumber prices stayed at relatively high level and as it turns out, that's probably at the lower end of the range of lumber prices that we see going forward. Your line is open. Your line is open."
