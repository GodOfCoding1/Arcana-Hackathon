    "content": " Those sales included what we believe is the industry's first solar deal, comprising 1,760 acres for $13 million or $7,500 per acre. We also closed commercial sales every quarter in 2022, resulting in over $13 million of revenue at an average price of $290,000 per acre. Including the refinance of CatchMark's debt in the third quarter, our annual interest cost run rate has declined nearly $9 million. We used cash to close all three transactions, including $14 million to close the last of the three transactions early in the fourth quarter. As a reminder, a $10 per 1,000 board foot change in lumber price equals approximately $12 million of consolidated EBITDDA for us on an annual basis. We estimate that interest expense will be approximately $2 million in the first quarter and $9 million to $10 million per quarter for the second, third and fourth quarters of 2023. That's probably around the $3 million or so number for the first quarter, and then, additional relief, which could be significant, actually, as the year plays out."
