    "content": " Until then, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m happy to report that our patients proved to be a good strategy for our shareholders as we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re now showing meaningful signs of the net lease market leading more towards our favor and pricing of assets is expected to allow us to more actively grow our company. Lastly, we recently signed a contract to purchase a retail asset occupied by an investment-grade credit tenant at a cap rate that correlates with today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s interest rates and is directly in line with our overall value investment thesis of well-located, high credit and shorter term net lease properties. Net cash generated by financing activities for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 were $5.8 million and $13.6 million, respectively, highlighting our ability to raise capital even in this challenging market."
