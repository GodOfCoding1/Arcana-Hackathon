    "content": " David will provide an overview of the company's growth strategy, business and capital markets activities, third quarter highlights and subsequent events to-date, Allison will review our quarterly financial results. While macroeconomic news is widely prevalent, we're glad to be able to say that we're in a stable position as it relates to our 100% rent collection, our fixed debt rates that are well below today's market interest rates, as well as the high credit worthiness of our tenants. As mentioned, we've continued to be diligent about the internal growth of our portfolio and we're happy to report that we're maintaining the contractual increases of base rents that are within 92% of our portfolios annualized base rent. Net operating income was $1.2 million as compared to $838,000 during the same period last year, a 44% increase driven primarily from natural rent increases through CPI or contractual rent steps in addition to lower building expenses."
