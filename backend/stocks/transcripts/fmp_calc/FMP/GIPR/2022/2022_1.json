    "content": " To-date, our portfolio consists of 92% of annualized base rent having fixed or CPI rent increases during the primary lease term as well as within the tenants\u2019 renewal options, which provides us with approximately 180 basis points of annual same-property rent growth over the same period last year. As of today, GIPR\u2019s gross asset value, including the property held in a tenant in common stands at approximately $61 million based on the acquisition cost and our investment strategy is the driving force to differentiate us from others in our industry."
