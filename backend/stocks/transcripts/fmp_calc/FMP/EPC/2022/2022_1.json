    "content": " In the quarter, we grew organic net sales 2.5% with growth coming from all three segments of the business led by Sun Care, Women's Shave, Feminine Care, and Men's Grooming. In addition to our strong top-line performance, we also executed well on the bottom line, delivering $0.42 of adjusted earnings per share and $69.7 million of adjusted EBITDA in the quarter despite significant cost headwinds resulting from increased inflationary pressure across many commodities, freight and distribution costs, as well as increase in COVID-19 related impacts on our labor force. Looking deeper into our segments, Wet Shave organic net sales increased 2% in the quarter, largely driven by growth in Women's Systems, Disposables, and Private Brands. Our Women's Systems business continues to be the primary catalyst for growth, with organic net sales increasing 9%, driven by Intuition, as well as Private Label, which grew 48% in the quarter despite cycling 51% growth last year in Q1. Men's Grooming organic net sales increased 8% in the quarter, led by Cremo strong growth of nearly 20% on the heels of excellent holiday execution, as the category was up 27%. A&P expense increased $5 million this quarter and was 10% of net sales, reflecting increases in support of the Hydro relaunch in Japan, Sun execution across the globe, and holiday programs in Grooming. As we look to the remainder of the year, we're encouraged by the improving demand environment we see across many of our categories and geographies and are well-positioned as a result of the distribution gains discussed last quarter, most notably in Sun and Women's Shave.
