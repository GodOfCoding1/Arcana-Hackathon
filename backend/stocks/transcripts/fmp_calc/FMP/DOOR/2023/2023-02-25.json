    "content": " Net sales for the year were up 11% due primarily to AUP growth of 18% and partially offset by a 4% decline in volume, a 2% decrease from unfavorable foreign exchange and a 1% decrease from a combination of lower component sales and the impact of a divestiture in the Europe segment in the second quarter of 2021. while gross profit margin declined slightly to 23.3%, down 30 basis points as the benefit of improved gross margins in the North American Residential segment was more than offset by the margin contraction caused by inflation and volume deleveraging in the Europe and architectural segments."
