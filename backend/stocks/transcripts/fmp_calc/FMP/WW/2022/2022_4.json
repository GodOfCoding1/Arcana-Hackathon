    "content": " A behavioral program paired with clinical intervention is critical to help people on medications develop and maintain healthy habits from prioritizing nutrient-dense food, managing against muscle loss to understanding that these medications may be a lifelong commitment, these are the areas where Weight Watchers can provide the guidance and support to ensure members weight loss journeys are done in a healthy, sustainable way. We estimate that charges related to the 2023 restructuring plan will range between $39 million to $46 million in the aggregate, consisting of approximately $15 million to $18 million in organizational restructuring charges of which $13.6 million has been recorded in the fourth quarter of 2022 at the time of management's resolution and approximately $24 million to $28 million in real estate restructuring, consisting of lease terminations and other related costs, the majority of which will be recorded in the first six months of fiscal 2023. In summary, we are focused on improving our sign-up trends and for the second half of the year, returning to year-over-year growth, improving member activation rate, which would drive gains in retention, exercising strong cost discipline throughout the organization and executing on a narrow list of priorities, including our entrance into clinical interventions for weight management, all of which we believe are the critical drivers for returning the Company to a growth trajectory. Again, a lack of holistic care to partner with these medications and we have -- because of our lifestyle programs that you mentioned, because of our behavior change program, our nutritional signs, we have an ability to service these members alongside our program, helping them prioritize nutrient-dense foods, managing against muscle loss, understanding that these medications may be, in some cases, a lifelong commitment and these are areas where Weight Watchers can provide guidance, support and ensure that members weight loss journeys are done in a healthy, sustainable way."
