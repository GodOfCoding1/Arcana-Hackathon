    "content": " With that context, we are looking ahead to 2023 and focus on the following; improving our sign-up trends over the course of the year and returning to a year-over-year growth trajectory in the second half of 2023, improving new member activation, which would translate into gains and retention, shipping key digital product milestones, including new in-app community features in the first half of 2023 and later in the year, our integrated product feature with Abbott, exercising strong cost discipline throughout the organization and executing on a narrow list of clear priorities, which we believe are the critical drivers for returning the company to a growth trajectory."
