    "content": " Year-over-year growth was approximately 1% and quarter-over-quarter revenue was down approximately 4%, which was primarily driven by a $5 million reduction in our fixed license revenue from last quarter. Excluding this deal, our revenue growth was approximately 14% for the same period last year and up about 1% from last quarter after adjusting for the $1.7 million accounting correction that we had in Q4. As previously disclosed, our legacy connected revenue will decline in Q2 from $16 million in Q1 to $8 million in Q2 and is expected to remain at this $8 million per quarter level for the rest of the fiscal year. So with that as background, we are reducing our full year revenue guidance by approximately 9% from the midpoint of the original guidance of $212.5 million and now expect FY \u201822 revenue in the range of $365 million to $385 million. First, we need to remove the revenue from the fitness deal of approximately $5 million since we don\u2019t expect any additional contribution from this margin for the balance of the fiscal year. Your line is open. Your line is open. And so as we\u2019ve mentioned in the past, if we go outside our historical range, which has been typically in the low $40 million to mid $50 million range for these fixed license amounts each year, you go \u2013 if you go on the high end of that range or even outside like we did last year, that does dampen the growth in the future until those licenses get consumed. Your line is open. So if you sort of adjust for that incremental $6 million of consumption, it still gets you not at the 13% for IHS, it\u2019s more \u2013 I think it\u2019s around down 24% year-over-year. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open."
