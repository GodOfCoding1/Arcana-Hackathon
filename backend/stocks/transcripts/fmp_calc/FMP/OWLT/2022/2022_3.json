    "content": " Today, I will share our results for the third quarter of 2022 and provide additional updates on our business, specifically around our three key areas of focus: Our dream product portfolio performance in the marketplace; progress towards regulatory authorizations and operational strides towards profitability. Q3 operating expenses included $1.2 million in severance charges, $850,000 in spend for regulatory submissions, and approximately $1 million in additional  marketing expenses, which we don't expect to see in the fourth quarter. We remain focused on driving our Q4 run rate operating expenses lower sequentially and are planning to exit Q4 at an expense run rate between $15 million to $19 million per quarter, excluding incentive expense and stock-based compensation."
