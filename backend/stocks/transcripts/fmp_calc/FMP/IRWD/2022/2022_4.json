    "content": " We believe the pediatric opportunity, if approved, could expand the market potential for LINZESS as functional constipation affects roughly 6 million 6- to 17-year-old children and adolescents in the U.S. As Tom mentioned, we're thrilled that the FDA granted priority review for the LINZESS sNDA for functional constipation in children and adolescents 6 to 17 years of age, which could potentially lead to a commercial launch in June. While full year net sales growth came in lower than our expectations for 2022, primarily due to inventory fluctuations in the retail channel, we remain confident in the long-term growth potential of LINZESS based on the strong prescription demand that we continue to see. We have a blockbuster brand in LINZESS that continues to deliver impressive demand growth, with the potential to expand the market with a pediatric functional constipation indication beginning this year, if approved; an emerging pipeline with anticipated exciting milestones ahead; a strong balance sheet with over $650 million of cash and cash equivalents; and an accomplished management team with strong GI, commercial, drug development and M&A expertise."
