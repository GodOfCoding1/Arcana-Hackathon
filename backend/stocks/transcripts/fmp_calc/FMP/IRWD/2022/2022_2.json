Since launch, nearly 10 years ago LINZESS continues to experience remarkable prescription demand growth and widespread acceptance among health care practitioners as a leading prescription treatment for adults with IBS-C and chronic idiopathic constipation. In the second quarter, LINZESS prescription demand increased 9%, versus the prior year quarter, and LINZESS achieved an all-time high in new-to-brand prescription volume."
