    "content": " Now, I will say in 2023, as we look at what the effect of higher interest rates are going to be to loan growth and what the looming recession could be to loan growth that we're -- in our budget, we've sort of modeled mid-single digits on the loan side, and we expect our deposits to outpace our loans in 2023. Hey, good morning, guys. But on the same hand, we're doing, as Lance talked about in his prepared remarks, strategic investments in technology, technology that is going to drive efficiency, and I don't want to get into it today, but our bot process and what we're seeing from there and the reduction in costs that we think we'll see, but the technology investments also to drive a superior customer experience. We're also making investments that are included in these numbers in strategic locations, that are going to allow us to not only address making sure that we serve the communities, but put us in a position where I think we will see strong deposit growth in those markets. Hey, good morning, guys. If today, we're sitting at $9.5 billion, and we have $450 million of growth, which in -- from a loan/deposit standpoint and very active in making sure that we continue to keep teams engaged. Hey, good morning, guys."
