    "content": " Total loans held for investment excluding PPP and mortgage warehouse were $4.66 billion, which is a 3.6% increase compared to last quarter and a 14.5% increase on an annualized basis and puts us in a great position to meet our expectations. For the first quarter, total loans held for investment, excluding mortgage warehouse and PSMA, increased $160.5 million or 3.6%. Lastly, annualized net charge-offs for the quarter to average loans held-for-investment came in at 0.14%, reducing 8 basis points from the last quarter levels. Excluding PPP and mortgage warehouse loans, our net interest income increased from $45 million to $46.2 million or 2.6% quarter-over-quarter. The bottom graph shows our NIM quarterly changes excluding PPP and mortgage warehouse loans, with excess liquidity contributing to the largest impact as our average cash balance increased from $442 million in the fourth quarter to $746 million in the first quarter. So, loan betas, Steve, I don't know if you've had a good feel for loan betas overall, but we certainly think that we're at the bottom \u2013 or we're basically going through with the next 25 basis point all our floors, and so we'll have a full impact of the next raise depending on whether it's 25 basis points or 50 basis points. But I'm extremely concerned about inventory, what we're seeing in mortgage production, even though we have significant number of applications to be able to fill those \u2013 because of lack of inventory, I think we'll have maybe a negative impact in the fourth quarter mortgage warehouse, but that's where we stand today."
