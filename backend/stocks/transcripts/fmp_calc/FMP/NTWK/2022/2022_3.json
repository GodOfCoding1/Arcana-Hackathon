    "content": " One final note, before I hand the call back over to Najeeb regarding our financial outlook for fiscal year ending June 30, 2022, the company continues to expect total revenues to increase by at least 10% in subscription and support or recurring revenues to increase by at least 20%. Regarding our European and North American pipelines, these remain exciting new growth areas for NETSOL and we have strategically marketing our cloud and SaaS based offerings in these regions, which is contributing to the growing subscription and support revenues as noted earlier, we have a few large opportunities of our flagship ascent in the US, as well as several new opportunities in Europe specifically, that are making their way through the sales cycles. One is, as company has pivoted almost over a year ago to SaaS model in relation to our license sale, so you'll notice, our SaaS revenue is growing, the recurring revenue is growing at the expense of sometimes large license implementations or contracts, that doesn't mean that we're not going to -- we're not busy with the license opportunities in some regions like the U.S. and Asia that will continue to improve our revenue as well as gross margin. And second thing is, as you noticed, as Roger mentioned, we hired a few people in the last 2 quarters, primarily to support our new initiatives, whether they're innovative related or ongoing businesses, opportunities in North America, particularly, we are in an investment mode in the U.S., in North America, especially both Canada and in U.S. by hiring new people to really position ourselves to be a stronger, an operator in the U.S. market, which we haven't been in the past."
