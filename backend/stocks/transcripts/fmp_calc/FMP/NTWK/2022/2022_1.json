As I've mentioned on previous calls, it's important to point out that included in our net income this quarter was a gain of $1.3 million on foreign currency exchange transactions, compared to a gain of $296,000 in Q1 of last year. Moving to our non-GAAP metrics, our non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter of fiscal 2022 totaled $770,000 or $0.07 per diluted share compared with non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA of $1.6 million or $0.14 per diluted share in the first quarter of last year. With this overview completed, I will now get into operational updates for the quarter Starting in APAC, and with the previously announced 12-country, $110 million contract with Daimler Financial Services, we are continuing to make considerable progress along our multi-year multi-country implementation roadmap."
