    "content": " The 18% increase in total net revenues was primarily driven by an increase in subscription and support revenues of $3.6 million offset by decreases in license revenue of $631,000 and total services revenue of $667,000. The increase in total subscription and support revenues for the quarter was primarily due to the recording of approximately $3.5 million as a onetime, cumulative catch-up due to our amendment to our 10-year contract with Daimler Financial Services. Total cost of revenues was $7.8 million for the second quarter, an increase of $751,000 from $7.1 million for the second quarter 2021. The $1.6 million increase in gross profit for the quarter was primarily due to the $2.4 million increase in net revenue, offset by $751,000 increase in cost of revenues. Our non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter fiscal 2022 totaled $2.1 million or $0.19 per diluted share compared with non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA of $617,000 or $0.05 per diluted share in the second quarter of last year. At an annualized rate, the quarter's performance equates to a nearly $25 million annualized run rate SaaS and support revenue, after accounting for impact for the DFS or Daimler Financial Services contract changes that Roger just mentioned earlier."
