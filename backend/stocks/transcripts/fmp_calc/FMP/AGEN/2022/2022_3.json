    "content": " On today's call, we will provide an update on balstilimab development programs, including our participation at SITC as well as recent initiation of two Phase 2 ACTIVATE trials, in advanced colorectal cancer for one and in melanoma for two to be followed by trial in pancreatic cancer, before the end of the year. And so, Agenus will present translational data from the Phase 1 study and preclinical studies highlighting the mechanisms of underpinning what balstilimab differentiated enhanced anti-tumor immunity as well as new preclinical data demonstrating superior activity than first generation CTLA-4 agents across multiple cold and totally immunogenic tumor models. Building upon the robust responses of drug in our Phase 1 trial, we have already initiated two randomized worldwide Phase 2 ACTIVATE trials in advanced MSS, that is Microsatellite Stable, or it can be also described as non- MSI-CRC patients as well as melanoma.
