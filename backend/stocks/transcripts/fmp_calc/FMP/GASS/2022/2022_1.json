    "content": " In quarter one 2022, voyage revenues came in at $35.9 million, $1.5 million lower than in quarter one 2021, partly as a result of fewer vessels on the spot market and partly due to the fewer number of ships, including the four tankers. We manage this while at the same time increasing our cash and cash equivalents from $31.3 million at the end of last year to $70.4 million at the end of quarter one 2022 or $82.4 million including restricted cash, mainly through the sales we completed and the refinancing of six vessels during the first quarter. Voyage revenues came in at $35.9 million, marking a decrease of $1.5 million, about 4% compared to the same period of last year, partly due to the fewer vessels in the spot market. Our spot market actually decreased by 65% and partly due to the fewer number of vessels, we had 36.5 average vessels in the first quarter of 2022 versus 41.6 average vessels during the first quarter of 2021. Operating expenses saw a significant reduction of $2.2 million, about 15% compared to Q1 2021 due to the fewer number of vessels, where we to exclude this effect, our OpEx would be along the same levels as last year, a positive result given that we continue to face cost pressures, particularly in crew cost due to the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result of all the points analyzed above, we ended the first quarter of 2022 with a net income of $7.6 million, and adjusted net income that is excluding impairment and vessel sales of $8.8 million, corresponding to an earnings per share of $0.23, a ten-fold increase compared to the mega $0.02 of the same period of last year. During the first quarter, the improving LPG market continued its upward trend, and we managed to capitalize, posting improved profits of $7.6 million one of the best quarterly results in many years."
