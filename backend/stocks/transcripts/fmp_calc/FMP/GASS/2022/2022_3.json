    "content": " Net revenues came in at $28.2 million for the quarter, and $94.4 million for the nine months, slightly reduced by 2% over the nine months period as we went from 41 vessels to 34 vessels, roughly a 17% reduction in total fleet days. Operating expenses were at $14.1 million for the quarter and $40.3 million for the nine months, a 13% reduction in the nine months period, a similar trend to what we saw in the previous quarters, due to the reduction in the fleet size. Depreciation is another item that saw a large decrease to $7 million for the quarter and $21 million for the nine month period, that is a 26% decrease year-on-year, mainly due to the decrease in the number of the vessels. As a result of all the points analyzed above, we ended the third quarter of 2022 with net income of $6.7 million and $26.6 million for the nine month period a six-fold increase, compared to last year. We did recently sign a commitment letter with one of our existing financiers for the financing of the two new building vessels, whereby we expect to receive up to $17 million in finance proceeds for the delivery of these vessels, subject to customary closings."
