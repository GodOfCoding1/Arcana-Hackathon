    "content": " We now have 62% of our fleet days secured on period charters for the remainder of 2022, with total fleet employment days for all subsequent periods generating about $72 million, excluding JV vessels in contractors\u00e2\u0080\u0099 revenues. It was a very strong quarter and voyage revenues came in at $39.3 million, $3.4 million higher than the previous quarter, and about the same as last year when we had more vessels in the fleet. Overall, comparing the LPGs in our fleet, we saw a rise in revenues year-on-year, and this is also reflected in the TCE revenues that came in at $34.6 million, a $1.3 million increase from last year, despite having fewer vessels in the fleet. We manage this while at the same time, increasing our cash and cash equivalents from $31.3 million at the end of last year, to approximately $78 million at the end of Q2 \u00e2\u0080\u009922, or $90.2 million, including restricted cash, mainly through the sales we completed, the refinancing of six vessels during Q1, and our internal generated cashflow. Voyage revenues came in at $39.3 million, almost the same as last year, partly due to the fewer vessels in the spot market. The stable revenues and the decrease in cost combined, resulted in net revenues for the period in the order of $34.6 million compared to $33.3 million last year, an increase of 4%. Operating expenses saw a significant reduction of $2.5 million, about 16% compared to the first quarter of last year, due to the fewer number of vessels. As a result of all the points analyzed above, we ended the second quarter of 2022 with a net income of $20.2 million, a six-fold increase compared to last year, and adjusting net income that's excluding vessel impairments and derivatives of $11.3 million, corresponding to an EPS of $0.32.
