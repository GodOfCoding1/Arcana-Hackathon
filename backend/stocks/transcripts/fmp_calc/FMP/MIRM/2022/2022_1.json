    "content": " In the first quarter, we achieved nearly $13 million of revenue, including nearly $11 million in net sales of LIVMARLI, a testament to our team's expertise and execution. As we continue to execute against the greater-than-$500 million U.S. market opportunity in Alagille syndrome, we are progressing our 5 other late-stage LIVMARLI and volixibat clinical programs which will generate multiple data readouts over the next 2 years. Today, I'll share further color about our $10.9 million net LIVMARLI revenue, what we're seeing in the commercial business and why we're so excited about the growth trajectory. And nearly $13 million in revenue we achieved this quarter speaks to not only our team's dedication to ensure this medicine is in the hands of patients, but also to LIVMARLI's impressive safety and efficacy profile and ability to fill an urgent unmet medical need. To what extent is that -- do you expect that to be driven by additional patients in the U.S. compared to contribution from other territories and you're on a fairly toward growth trajectory thus far, in terms of addressing the Alagille unmet medical need, how long do you think you're going to be able to sustain this type of growth? And we're looking at the impact of LIVMARLI analysis in terms of the data we have there, that's really the focus of what we're doing this year, is make sure we roll out and get access for as many patients as possible as urgently as we can and get some of the data that we've generated from LIVMARLI and Alagille syndrome published."
