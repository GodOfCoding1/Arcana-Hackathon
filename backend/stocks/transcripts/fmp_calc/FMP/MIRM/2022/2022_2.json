    "content": " In the second quarter, we achieved $17.5 million in LIVMARLI net sales, which reflects our team's commitment and expertise and the life-changing impact of LIVMARLI for Alagille patients with cholestatic pruritus. And we intend to build on this trajectory in the months and years ahead through continued growth of LIVMARLI in the U.S., potential additional approvals and launches in Europe and beyond and through pipeline opportunities as we look to announce top line data from our MARCH-PFIC Phase 3 study later this year, the first of several key data sets over the coming 18 months.

And in terms of patients available, as Peter mentioned, we already have nearly 100 PFIC patients currently on drug active around the globe with an expanded access program, also open for geographies around the globe as well that will eventually be eligible for commercial rollover once we get to those approvals and reimbursements. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open."
