    "content": "   Please refer to Slide 2, cautioning you that our statements during this call as well as the press release and accompanying slides contain forward-looking statements, including but not limited to, our views regarding the health of the housing market, economic conditions, changes in interest rates, the potential benefits of rate locks, community count and absorption, trends in construction costs, supply chain and labor constraints and cycle times, projected third quarter home closings and revenue, gross margin, tax rates and diluted EPS, potential future disruptions to our business from an epidemic or pandemic such as COVID-19 as well as others. Our second quarter 2022 home closing gross margin was a record 31.6% and the 430 bps improvement from 27.3% a year ago mainly resulted from higher ASPs due to sustained pricing power over the last year, the low cost of land for entry level homes, lower interest burden from our 2021 refinancing and the leveraging of higher revenue on fixed costs, all of which more than offset higher commodity costs."
