    "content": " Home closing revenue grew 25% year-over-year to $1.6 billion in the third quarter of 2022 due to 12% greater home closing volume and 12% higher ASPs compared to prior year, as stronger pricing over the past several quarters worked its way through the P&L. For the fourth quarter of 2022, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re projecting total closings to be between 4,300 and 4,700 units, home closing revenue of $1.85 billion to $2.10 billion, home closing gross margin around 25%, an effective tax rate of approximately 23.5% and diluted EPS in the range of $6.50 to $7.40."
