    "content": " We're also happy to announce that our Q1 adjusted EBITDA grew to $18.9 million, an increase over last year, even after incorporating additional public company costs while continuing to make investments in strategic initiatives. Net revenue retention was a healthy 107% despite significant market volatility in the quarter, and existing clients continue to add new assets to the Clearwater platform. In fact, we're really pleased with the progress we're making internationally, and we're further encouraged by seeing our international revenue growth to 13% of revenues this quarter, compared to 9% in the first quarter of last year. General and administrative expenses in the quarter were $8.3 million or 11.7% of revenue, up 280 basis points year over year as we continue to annualize the impact of incremental public company costs resulting from our IPO last fall. Your line is open. And so we still think we can continue to deliver what we had laid out last year and in the beginning of this year, which is revenue growth in the 20s -- or 20% revenue growth, good solid EBITDA because I think that is really important as you and I have all talked about for many quarters now is we think profitable growth is key and sort of just growth for the sake of growth. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open."
