    "content": " During our Inaugural Clients Award program, we named standout leaders that have achieved growth and have taken an innovative approach with investment operations using Clearwater's platform, including Unum, Mutual of Omaha, Venerable, Performa, CNA Insurance, Markel Corporation, Chimera Investment Corporation, Qualcomm, Morgan Stanley, Reliance Standard Life Insurance, Government Portfolio Advisors and JPMorgan Asset Management. As of September 30, 2022, annualized recurring revenue or ARR reached $303.6 million, a $46.5 million increase over September 30, 2021, representing an 18.1% increase year-over-year, again due primarily to continued strong new client acquisition and additional assets loading onto our platform from existing clients. Sales and marketing expenses in the quarter were $10.2 million or 13.3% of revenue, up 30 basis points year-over-year as we hosted Clearwater Connect in-person in September. General and administrative expenses in the quarter were $8.4 million or 10.9% of revenue, up 70 basis points year-over-year as we continue to annualize the impact of incremental public company costs resulting from our initial public offering last September.
