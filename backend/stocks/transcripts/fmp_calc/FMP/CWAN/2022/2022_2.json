    "content": " As of June 30, 2022, annualized recurring revenue, or ARR, reached $290.4 million, a $45.3 million increase over June 30, 2021, and represent an 18.5% increase year-over-year, again, due primarily to continued strong new client acquisition. General and administrative expenses in the quarter were $8.7 million or 11.9% of revenue, up 20 basis points year-over-year as we continue to annualize the impact of incremental public company costs resulting from our IPO last September. Your line is open. Your line is open. If I look at your SBC, right, it does feel a little high at a shade over -- or 20% of revenue dilution hard to normalize given the recent IPO, but it does seem a little high especially given you have a lot of employees out in Boise and you're talking about overseas expansion in Edinburgh and Noida where you don't have people who are quite as hungry for options and RSUs like they are in the Bay Area. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Jim, obviously, a lot of questions on pricing change because theoretically, there could be a lot of near-term uncertainty regarding the business and obviously, the revenue flow if you can give us a little bit more insights into how you were able to get to your top line guidance, specifically you really didn't expand the top line guidance range."
