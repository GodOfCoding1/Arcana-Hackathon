So we can look at net revenue of the company, BRL 378 million, first 3 months of last year, then we will show tons and prices. When we look at the company's EBITDA, last year, we had BRL 120 million. This year, we're talking about BRL 106 million and the BRL 223 million of last year, BRL 18 million of this EBITDA comes due to the sale of soybean that I mentioned, 60,000 tons that we sold of soybean and the corn that we sold. When we look at the company's profit, net profit last year, BRL 107 million. So we begin to see a drop in this quarter, especially because it's the only product that we're producing, but we should expect during this year to have an EBITDA margin of 60% of what we had last year."
