    "content": " OXXO same-store sales were up 12.7% for the first quarter, driven by an increase of 10.7% in average customer ticket and 1.8% growth in traffic, which reflects the sustained recovery of mobility and gathering consumption during February and March, coupled with a relatively on demanding comparison base in the first quarter of 2021, which was affected still by COVID related restrictions. On an organic basis, total revenues increased 12.2%, reflecting a gradually recovering facility supply segment at Envoy, driven largely by people going back to the office, coupled with good demand dynamics in our operations in Latin America, particularly in the warehousing business. And what we're seeing is not necessarily, I think a strong pickup in traffic, but what we are seeing is that the customers that are using Premia again, the tender as of the first quarter was 6%, at this point we\u2019re closer to 10% giving how fast it's going. I think if you look at store growth and other than what we described in terms of the hiccups maybe coming after very active fourth quarter where we opened, I think something like 450 stores in Mexico and in one quarter, and that has kind of flowed into the start of the year as the pipeline gets rebuilt. If you think about kind of the  debt of FEMSA for the longest time, I think being a multi-business company involved in several different businesses has bode well for us for the longest time, because it has given us in a market where capital was obviously much more difficult to come by there it is today, it has given us access to capital, a lower cost of capital and also it is giving us the umbrella to really be able to incubate initiatives that require patience to play out, such as OXXO and whatnot."
