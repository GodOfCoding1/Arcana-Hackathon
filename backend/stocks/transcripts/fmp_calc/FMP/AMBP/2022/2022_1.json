    "content": " In Europe, new capacity in the U.K. has started production this quarter, as well as in Germany, as part of an expansion project that will also see further capacity addition in the first half of 2023, while our new facility in Northern Ireland is progressing through planning. As well as delivering adjusted EBITDA of $145 million in the first quarter that was in line with our guidance, AMP maintained a strong liquidity position in what is seasonally a quarter of working capital investments. You said there's an additional $25 million, but it would be helpful to understand kind of what the total figure is that's hurting the numbers in the first half and how that kind of progresses into the second half of the year."
