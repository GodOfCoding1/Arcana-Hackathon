    "content": " So look, I think the team has done a lot of work this year and worked very hard to get energy costs recovered both in this year, in which we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re very close to the target we set ourselves and going into next year, and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve had a lot of very constructive conversations with most of our customers. So assuming a big step down in CapEx -- growth CapEx from the $600 million this year, can you talk a little bit about how you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re thinking about maybe other capital allocation priorities between shareholder returns, balance sheet. I think as we said a number of times on the call, we remain very confident in the secular demand trends that support the beverage can, and we see as we come through this difficult macro environment in 2023 that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll see stronger growth into 2024 and beyond."
