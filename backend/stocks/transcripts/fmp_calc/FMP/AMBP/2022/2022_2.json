    "content": " Looking forward, we expect further improvement in shipment growth in the Americas as contracted new capacity additions continue their ramp-up in North America and market growth continues to normalize in Brazil, especially an unrestricted Q4 summer period, which also includes, for the first time, a World Cup. Inflationary pressures remained strong, and second quarter adjusted EBITDA in Europe fell by 20% to $61 million as input cost headwinds were not fully offset by higher volumes. We believe that AMP's approach to shareholder returns represents an attractive investment proposition through: firstly, an attractive, recurring $0.10 quarterly ordinary dividend, currently representing a dividend yield of over 6%; secondly, share buybacks to effectively return capital to shareholders, amplified in scale by the fact that Ardagh Group does not intend to participate; and thirdly, growth investments to support global demand with attractive payback terms backed by customers. And one of the very encouraging data points in all the market data at the moment is the growth in share in beverage cans in the soft drinks category in North America through this whole period, which, I think, shows that it's winning in the pack mix particularly versus plastic. We expect a material step-up in profitability for Europe in 2023 off the back of, as I say, extremely constructive set of conversations with customers around the input cost inflation where I think it's fully understood that it can't be held in the supply chain like this and needs to go through to the consumer."
