    "content": " During the second quarter, total revenues increased 9% year-over-year to $1.2 billion, in line with the top end of our guidance. The outperformance in total revenues for the second quarter was driven by 2 factors: volume, driven by WSEs outperforming our forecast as we once again benefited from strong hiring within our installed base and modest rate growth, benefiting both professional service and insurance revenues. TriNet Zenefits performed in line with our forecast and generated $12 million in HCM cloud services revenue, contributing approximately 8 points to our year-over-year growth. The accelerated growth in expenditures was driven by 2 factors: First, the inclusion of TriNet Zenefits and integration-related expenses was the largest contributor to the incremental growth in expenses; and second, we experienced compensation-related expense growth reflective of current inflation and labor market dynamics. This is due to our improved second half outlook and our first half outperformance, which was driven by continued above-average hiring by our customers, lower-than-forecast insurance cost ratio, appropriate core cost management, the rising interest rate environment on our cash balances and investment portfolio and the benefit of repurchasing shares. Turning to specific third quarter 2022 guidance, we expect total revenue growth to be in the range of 7% to 8% year-over-year and Professional Service revenue growth to be in the range of 18% to 20% year-over-year. We are also raising our full year adjusted net income per diluted share guidance by $0.88 at the midpoint to $5.60 and to $6.20, reflecting a strong first half financial performance and an improved second half outlook."
