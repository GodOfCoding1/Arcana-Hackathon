    "content": " Please note that today's discussion will include our 2022 fourth quarter and full year financial outlook and other statements that are not historical in nature, are predictive in nature or depend upon or refer to future events or conditions such as our expectations, estimates, predictions, strategies, beliefs or other statements that might be considered forward-looking. In the quarter, professional service revenues grew 21% year-over-year to $189 million, beating the top end of our guidance by one point. TriNet Zenefits generated $12 million in HCM Cloud Services revenue, contributing approximately eight points to our year-over-year growth. Given our lower insurance cost ratio year-to-date, we are anticipating the launch of a $50 million credit program contingent on fourth quarter health performance. Turning to our fourth quarter 2022 guidance, we expect total revenue growth to be in the range of down 2% to flat year-over-year, four points lower as a result of the fourth quarter credit program. Our fourth quarter estimate of GAAP net income per diluted share is in the range of negative $0.47 to $0.07 per share, reflecting the cost impact from the Zenefits acquisition, integration activities that are underway and the impact from the credit program."
