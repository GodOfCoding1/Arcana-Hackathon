    "content": " We also continued to disengage from the lowest-margin staffing business, which can be seen in our Non-Strategic Technology Services segment, where revenue decreased $6.2 million in the quarter as compared with the prior year. Consolidated revenue in the first quarter was $89.4 million, down approximately 8% or $7.7 million, of which $6.2 million was attributable to the planned disengagement from our Non-Strategic Technology Services business. First quarter revenue from North America IT Solutions and Services increased nearly 11% to $20.4 million as this segment captured new customers and opportunities in digital IT solutions, including the 5-year contract that Filip previously mentioned. Revenue from our Europe IT Solutions and Services segment was $42.5 million, down $3.5 million, largely due to a client internalizing a project for about 20 resources during the quarter and the continued impact of unfavorable foreign currency translation. SG&A expense in the first quarter of 2022 was $17.4 million or 19.5% of revenue, which represented a nominal increase of 30 basis points versus the year-ago period. So if you could just speak to the broader demand environment you're seeing in Europe given some of the macro noise that's out there and whether you expect to maybe return to growth on a constant currency basis later this year, that would be helpful."
