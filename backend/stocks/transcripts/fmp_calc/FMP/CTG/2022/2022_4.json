    "content": " Our revenue range of $300 million to $350 million includes a reduction of $35 million to $40 million from the prior year as a result of the intentional disengagement from the lowest margin business in our non-strategic technology services segment, slightly offset by a full year of revenue from our acquisition of Eleviant which only had 1 quarter of revenue in 2022 as the acquisition was completed at the end of the third quarter and high single-digit growth for the rest of the business."
