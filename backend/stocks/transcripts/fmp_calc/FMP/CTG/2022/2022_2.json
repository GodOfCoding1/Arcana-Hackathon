    "content": " For the second quarter of 2022, we saw strong top line growth of 21% in our North America segment as our teams continue to win new business from existing and new clients. Consolidated revenue in the second quarter was $82.8 million, down approximately 10% or $9.4 million, of which $6.1 million was our Non-Strategic Technology Services business, primarily resulting from our deliberate disengagement from lower-margin IT staffing services. Second quarter revenue from North American IT Solutions and Services increased 21.3% to $20.3 million, which reflected solid new core business development and opportunities in digital IT solutions with existing clients. For IT Solutions and Services, the North American gross margin decreased 140 basis points to 34.8%, reflecting a change in the mix of existing projects and process during the quarter as compared with the prior year. SG&A expense was $16.6 million or 20% of revenue, which represented an increase of 90 basis points versus the year ago period largely due to the loss of operating leverage from lower revenue. Non-GAAP operating income, which excludes $290,000 of acquisition-related expenses, was $3.5 million or 4.2% of revenue, which was up 100 basis points from the prior year. Talking about the filing for exiting low-margin business, in the last couple of years, we have been exiting approximately $50 million the last 2 years and our plans at this moment is that we estimate approximately $25 million to $35 million in \u00e2\u0080\u009822 and to continue with that kind of a rhythm in the next couple of years."
