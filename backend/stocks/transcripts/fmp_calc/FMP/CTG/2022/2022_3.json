    "content": " Consolidated revenue in the third quarter was $75 million, which reflected an $8.8 million decrease related to the disengagement from lower-margin nonstrategic business and a $5.7 million unfavorable impact to revenue due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Consolidated gross margin was 24.3%, up 190 basis points over last year's third quarter and 220 basis points higher over a 2-year period. For our outlook, we are adjusting our revenue for 2022 to range from $320 million to $330 million, which reflects a reduction of approximately $30 million as a result of the intentional disengagement from the lowest margin business in our Non-Strategic Technology Services segment. First of all, we're focusing on investing in sales, solutions, partnerships, marketing, to drive the organic growth or getting the right talent in the company to grow that digital business because the digital business, higher value, higher margin is going to help us increase that margin."
