    "content": " As it relates to CECL, we increased our total reserve by $19.4 million during the fourth quarter of 2022 and our total CECL reserve stands at $71.3 million or about 3% of our total loan commitments at year-end 2022. Since year-end 2022 driven by some of the broader market dynamics that Bryan mentioned earlier, three additional senior loans experienced maturity defaults including two loans backed by mixed-use properties and one loan collateralized by an office property. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. I think one thing that is important to recognize is that when we look at our CECL reserve, close to $50 million of that $71 million balance that we carry at year-end, is related to four or five level four or five rated loans. But overall, at year-end, just under $50 million or about 70% of the reserve was tied to the four or five rated loans. Again, I think it's too early to really forecast or give you any further insight certainly as of year-end 2022, we do not believe that there was any other basis for specific reserves on any of the four-rated loans or otherwise. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. Just a quick clarification, I think, Rick Shane said, there's $45 million of loans on non-accrual as of year-end."
