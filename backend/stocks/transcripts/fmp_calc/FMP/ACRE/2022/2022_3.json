    "content": " Overall, our distributable earnings for the third quarter were supported by the positive benefits of rising interest rates and the continued contributions from our proactive approach for liability hedging that we put in place in early 2021 when market interest rates were materially lower than they are today and allowed us to lock in one month LIBOR at 21 basis points. For example, on a pro forma basis, if LIBOR was a 100 basis points higher than the actual September 30, 2022 levels and all other aspects of our portfolio remain constant as of the same date, our annualized distributable earnings as of the third quarter of 2022 would have been higher by approximately $11 million or $0.20 per share on a pro forma basis."
