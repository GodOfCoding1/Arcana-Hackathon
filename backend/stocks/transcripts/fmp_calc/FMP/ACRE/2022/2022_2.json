    "content": " As Bryan discussed, our earnings this quarter were supported by the positive benefits of rising interest rates our liability hedging positions and a net increase of $200 million in our loan portfolio. However, as we have put in place fixed rate financing on our recent $150 million term loan and in 2021, entered into a hedge position that currently has a notional balance of over $500 million and locks in LIBOR at 21 basis points only about 2/3rd of our liabilities are sensitive to changes in LIBOR, putting the company in a very positive position to benefit from further increases in interest rate. So for example, on a pro forma basis, if hypothetically, LIBOR was 100 basis points higher than actual June 30, 2022 levels and all other aspects of our portfolio remain the same as of the same date our annual distributable earnings would have been higher by approximately $12 million or $0.24 per share. I think, clearly, it's something we consider because of exactly what you mentioned, the strength of earnings and the benefits that we're seeing in terms of rhythm of repayments as well as just the forward curve being supportive of us plus the hedging that we strategically put in place 12-odd months ago."
