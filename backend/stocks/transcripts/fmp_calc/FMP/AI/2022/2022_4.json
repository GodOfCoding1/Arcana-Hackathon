    "content": " We finished the quarter with $72.3 million in revenue, up 38% year-over-year, exceeding our guidance and exceeding, I believe, all analysts\u2019 expectations. But \u2013 and if you look at our diversification by industry, it\u2019s really becoming increasingly diverse like oil and gas, which is a pretty good market to be in today with oil in excess of a rough order of $100 a barrel, pretty good business. At our users\u2019 group in March, Shell sit up on stage and they realized \u2013 that they realized in front of all of our customers at our users\u2019 group conference and then they realized a $1 billion of economic benefit from their C3 investments last year and they expect to realize $2 billion of economic benefit from our investors this year. With respect to the full year, we are roughly $0.25 billion business, as Tom mentioned, with a 38% year-over-year increase and we\u2019ve been able to maintain really 5 excellent gross margin rates of 79% for the year, which is a 3-point increase from the prior year. Thank you for your question. Thank you for your question. The \u2013 regarding the professional services question, I want to say \u2013 I mean, think about kind of what\u2019s going on and what we do where we are investing \u2013 maybe we have a $1 million deal or a $10 million deal or a $20 million deal with a company that makes it very clear that if we succeed then 60 \u2013 there is $100 million in business there. Thank you for your question. Thank you for your question. Thank you for your question. The initial outlay at a $300 billion oil company was $300,000, which were might seem like a lot \u2013 it\u2019s not a lot for a $300 million company."
