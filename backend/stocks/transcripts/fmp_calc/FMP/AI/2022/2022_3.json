    "content": " Total revenue for the quarter was $69.8 million, an increase of 42% year-over-year. The Department of Defense awarded C3 AI a 5-year $500 million transaction agreement, accelerating the ability for any DoD agency to acquire the company's suite of enterprise AI application products and services basically without an RFP and without competitive bidding. Total revenue for the quarter was $69.8 million, up 42% year-over-year and above our guidance range of $66 million to $68 million. As Tom mentioned earlier, for the third quarter, remaining performance obligations or GAAP RPO, increased by 90% on a year-over-year basis to $469.3 million, up from $247.5 million last year, of which $171.6 million is expected to be recognized over the next 12 months and the remainder thereafter. Gross profit was $55.8 million in the third quarter, an increase of 50% from a year ago, primarily driven by revenue growth from new and existing contracts. For the fourth quarter, we expect total revenue in the range of $71 million to $72 million, representing a growth of 36% to 38% from a year ago. For the full year of fiscal '22, we are increasing our revenue guidance to the range of $251 million to $252 million, representing a growth of 37% to 38%."
