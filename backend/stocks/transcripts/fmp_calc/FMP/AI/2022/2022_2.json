    "content": " As we entered Q3, our increased revenue visibility and improved sales processes lead us to raise revenue guidance to $62 million (sic)  to $68 million for Q3 and $248 million to $251 million for the -- for fiscal year \u201822, representing a 35% to 37% growth rate year-over-year, up from a 17% growth rate in fiscal year \u201821. I think, our pipeline that we\u2019re currently working with the Google Cloud team is over 90 transactions, totaling as of today, we identified $58 million in business that we\u2019re working together for the second half of this year. But if I look at the forecast that we\u2019re -- the joint pipeline that we\u2019re working with Microsoft in the second half of this year, looks like roughly 120 transactions that we\u2019re working that total $140 million in business that we\u2019re currently tracking. Now, we are seeing substantial interest from the larger CRM systems integrators in leveraging C3 AI CRM as a complementary adjunct to their customers\u2019 existing installed CRM systems, so they are on top of their existing CRM systems and on top of the customizations and modifications they have made, adding a modern simple, intuitive user experience and making their existing CRM investments instantly predictive, including precise AI revenue forecasting, precise AI product forecasting, AI-enabled customer retention, next best product, next best offer, predictive interrelationship management, customer service optimization, AI-based predictive maintenance and service, et cetera. One, it increased the total contract value by $45 million; two, it extended the JV term by one year; and three, a new pricing model makes it easier for Baker Hughes to further accelerate the sales of C3 AI software. And so now, we\u2019ve gone back to what we did before is for every account, we put together a team of 4 or 5, 6 or 7 people who we think are just the best people in the Company to handle that account; be they from finance, be they from engineering organization, product marketing, from the sales organization or from the office of the CEO, to surround the customer, develop a strategic partnership with the customer, make sure their trial is successful, their implementation is successful, that their production deployments are successful."
