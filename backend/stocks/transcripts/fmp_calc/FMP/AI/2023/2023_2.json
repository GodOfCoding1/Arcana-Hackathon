    "content": " It is now my pleasure to introduce from Investor Relations, Mr. Reuben Gallegos. Thank you, Andrew, and good afternoon, and welcome to C3 AI's earnings call for the second quarter of fiscal year 2023, which ended on October 31, 2022. My name is Reuben Gallegos, and I'm the Vice President of Investor Relations. With me on the call today is Tom Siebel, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Juho Parkkinen, Chief Financial Officer. After the market closed today, we issued a press release with details regarding our second quarter results as well as a supplemental to our results, both of which can be accessed through the Investor Relations section of our website at ir.c3.ai. This call is being webcast, and a replay will be available on our IR website following the conclusion of the call. During today's call, we will make statements related to our business that may be considered forward-looking under federal securities laws that reflect our views only as of today and should not be considered representative of our views as of any subsequent date. For a further discussion of the material risks and other important factors that could affect our actual results, please refer to our filings with the SEC. Also during the course of today's call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Finally, at times in our prepared remarks, in response to your questions, we may discuss metrics that are incremental to our usual presentation to give greater insight into the dynamics of our business or quarterly results. And with that, let me turn the call over to Tom. Thank you, Reuben, and hello, everyone. I'm here with Juho Parkkinen, our Chief Financial Officer, and we are most pleased to share our results for the second quarter for fiscal year '23. Bottom line, it was a solid quarter in which we delivered our stated objectives and met expectations despite the rocky economic situation and the generally morose condition of the markets. In the last earnings call, we described two strategic initiatives to spur faster growth. I will explain these actions in some detail, but first, I'll comment on the financial results and some of the successes that we achieved during the quarter. With large, the quarter was quite solid. Subscription revenue for the quarter was $59.5 million, an increase of 26% year-over-year. The number of completed contracts in the quarter increased to 25, approximately a 100% increase year-over-year. Our average contract value in the second quarter was just over $800,000, down from $19 million a year earlier. We believe the new pricing model will result in a substantially increased number of smaller transactions, providing greater forward visibility in both revenue and bookings. Our new consumption-based pricing model was well-received by our customers, our prospects, our partners and by our sales organization. As these customers continually increase their usage over time, we expect the compound effect on revenue growth to be quite significant. Simultaneously, last quarter, we completed a transition of similar magnitude with the rig composition of our global sales team. We are now growing a team of highly qualified, well-trained technologically expert sales professionals, who are engaging with prospective customers in selling pilots and expanding production usage with existing customers. This has been especially significant in the tech markets that are experiencing a blood bath in equity prices, with significant layoffs at companies, including Amazon, Meta, Salesforce, Google, Snap and many others. The many Series A, B, C and D companies that are hemorrhaging cash will simply not survive. Just like every other tech recession that we're seeing, the human capital at the piece parts companies will be redistributed to those companies that survive. We are confident in our business outlook, especially with the nearly $600 billion addressable market opportunity that we have before us. Our employee base grew last quarter to over 850, a sequential increase of 83, and we continue to hire key engineers, data scientists, sales professionals and other key roles across the organization. Shell has continued to expand their use of our solutions in new areas, and have successfully implemented C3 AI sustainability for manufacturing at two of their key offshore platforms in the Gulf of Mexico. We also have successfully concluded an ESG trial with Shell, this focus on leveraging NLP to generate targeted insights on the rapidly evolving ESG priorities of Shell's key stakeholders. Shell has already addressed and communicated that they are realizing massive economic value annually by deploying our C3 AI applications across the enterprise, upstream, downstream, midstream renewables. There's a large and growing pipeline of enterprise applications that Shell is building, testing and deploying using the C3 AI platform, realizing the strategic value of our partnership and the fulfillment of the digital transformation of one of the largest and most iconic companies in the world. Cargill has continued to expand their use of our solutions and optimizing food production and distribution to meet the dynamic needs of the market and ensuring sustained food value chains in North America, Latin America, Europe, Africa and Asia. This is a critical mission that has enormous humanitarian ramifications, and we are proud to participate with Cargill in this important mission. Lastly, we are proud to say that we've continued to expand our relationship with the United States Air Force, working closely with them to improve aircraft availability and efficiency of readiness programs of the entire fleet of over 3,700 aircraft. In recent weeks, there's been something of a seismic shift in the enterprise AI software space. Traditionally, the primary competition to purchasing C3 AI enterprise applications was the license -- was for a company to -- the alternative of C3 AI was for a company to license a large number of tools from the hyperscalers, piece parts some providers like Cloudera, Pivotal, DataBridge, DataRobot and the many of the scores of other point solution providers, and then engage in a long and expensive science experiment in an attempt to build a custom enterprise AI platform. Now the market is truly changing due to -- changing and demonstrating an increased desire for production, tried, tested, proven enterprise AI solutions. Thomas Kurian at Google Cloud was the leader, announcing the GCP would lead in the market, okay, not with piece parts, but with turnkey production enterprise applications from C3 AI. Then last week, Adam Selipsky, CEO of AWS, announced that their customers were now demanding turnkey applications, not toolkits. This was followed the next day by Scott Guthrie, EVP of Microsoft Azure. All announced that the customers were telling them they no longer wanted toolkits to build applications, they now want functional turnkey AI applications that accrue immediate value. With a growing family of 42 production enterprise C3 AI applications in the market that serve the needs of financial services, utilities, health, manufacturing, defense, intelligence and other industries, C3 AI is well positioned to capitalize on this now clearly recognized market requirement. Last quarter, we closed an expansion with a large transportation company, currently signed one of the top 50 retailers in the world to license our supply chain applications and signed several new deals in the financial services and oil and gas industries. Our GCP joint selling activity is quite brisk, and as a result, GCP is our fastest growing install base. That being said, AWS remains C3 AI's largest installed base, constituting about 56% of our customer base. C3 AI and Microsoft continue to close deals, particularly in the energy and manufacturing sectors. Azure remains our second largest installed base, constituting approximately 27% of our customer base. We announced a number of new product enhancements here in the course of the quarter that I'm not going to review in this call, but we continue to invest in technology leadership. In the second quarter, we received over 23,000 job applications. We interviewed over 2,200 of these applicants, and we hired 90. One of the secular changes of this tech downturn is the increased availability of highly trained professionals who are willing to come into the office, roll up their sleeves and get to work. Our Q3 revenue is expected to be between $63 million and $65 million, and we are reaffirming our full year fiscal year '23 revenue guidance of $255 million to $270 million. For non-GAAP operating loss, we expect in Q3 between $25 million and $29 million. And for the full year, we expect an operating loss between $85 million and $98 million. We have a clear path to top line growth, non-GAAP profitability and a cash positive operations by the end of fiscal year '24. At this time, we did not see our cash balances below -- we did not see our cash balances falling below $700 million before that inflection. If not the largest, we are one of the largest providers of these applications globally. In the short run, we believe tech companies and tech equities will continue to face headwinds, as long as the Fed keeps its foot on the brake. The collateral damage, I think, is going to be more significant than people think. That being said, when the Fed takes its foot off the brake, be that in 2023 or 2024, C3 AI will be bigger, stronger, cash positive, profitable, a clear market leader and well positioned to benefit from the inevitable equity market surge that will ensue. Now let me turn the call over to our CFO, Juho Parkkinen, for a summary of our financials and additional commentary. Now I will provide a recap of our financial results, add some color to the drivers of our financials for the back half of the year and conclude with some additional color related to the consumption-based revenue model we introduced on our last call. As Tom mentioned, we ended the quarter with revenue of $62.4 million, which represents 7% year-over-year growth. Gross profit increased 5% to $47.8 million, and gross margin decreased 122 basis points to 76.6%. The decline is primarily due to a higher mix of trials and pilots, which carry a higher cost required to ensure customer success during this early phase of engagement. Operating loss of $15 million improved $7.6 million year-over-year, and operating loss margin also improved from 39% in the prior year to 24% in Q2. Our customer count increased by 16% year-over-year to 236, and we closed 25 deals during the quarter. We reported RPO of $417.3 million, which met our expectations as we continue to convert to consumption-based deals. Current RPO was $164.5 million, down 8% from last year. We continue to see positive trends in bookings diversity outside of oil and gas, particularly in the Federal, aero and defense sectors, which grew sequentially and year-over-year. Breaking this down, $23.7 million was for the build-out of our new headquarters. As I have mentioned previously, this will be amortized over the term of the lease and will not have a meaningful impact on our path to profitability. Normalizing for this payment, our adjusted free cash flow was an outflow of $54.3 million. As Tom mentioned, we have completed our transition from a subscription-based pricing model to a consumption-based pricing model and are now focused on ramping revenue from consumption-based deals. With respect to gross margin as the number of pilots ramp in the coming quarters and as the proportion of period revenue is more weighted towards pilots, we expect gross margin percentage to decline. However, consistent with the financial model we shared with you as part of the prior quarter earnings call, we expect the gross margin to increase to historical levels by the same time we expect to reach our initial non-GAAP profitability. Looking at our cash reserves, we have sufficient capacity to execute our plan to invest for growth in the coming quarters. We are well capitalized, having approximately $860 million available. With the planned expenditures related to the build-out of our new headquarters and investments in our business, we expect our cash investment balance to bottom out in fiscal '24 before we see improving free cash flow and improving cash balances thereafter. As a reminder, one of our most significant cash usages has been for the build-out of our new headquarters, which unlike many high-tech companies, we actually occupy. We are on track to achieve positive non-GAAP operating margin in the fourth quarter of the next fiscal year, driven by accelerating revenue growth and improving gross margin. Regarding the transition to consumption-based pricing, as a reminder, we do not require existing customers to move to a consumption-based arrangement. As such, we expect the RPO to decline as our new deals will not require a significant upfront non-cancelable arrangement, but rather a consumption-based usage arrangement. In summary, we are focused on delivering profitable growth to our shareholders, and we continue to expect achieving non-GAAP profitability in the fourth quarter of fiscal '24, while growing the top line in excess of 30%. With these remarks, I would like to open the call up for questions. I guess my first one is either for you, Tom, or for Juho. Just as we think about the plan that you've laid out, and it's nice to see the progress relative to what you told us last quarter, but traditional metrics obviously don't tell the full story. In addition to customers, obviously, they eventually translate to dollars, but any insight there is helpful. We'd expect in the other quarters, I mean, this should be in order of magnitude larger than we're doing now. I think we did, what, 13 or 15 last quarter in roughly half a quarter, because we announced the transition to this model about halfway through the quarter, and we did 15 in about half a quarter. So basically, it's really number -- we're really looking at a number of customers, Brad, and then we're looking at how far we -- how rapidly they grow the use of the products. If in fact, we get in order of magnitude more customers, and they continue to grow their use as our customers have in the past, and you know we've modeled this very carefully, I mean, we get out there three, four, five quarters. Brad, just one thing to add to that. We actually closed 13, which was a combination of trials and pilots. So we're quite excited about how this started, this kicked off. Appreciating the accelerated path to profitability and naturally, just given what's going on in the world, you guys are in in a pretty interesting position for sure. Not that you need to, you've got plenty of cash, but I mean, this is clearly the discipline that the world wants to see. I don't think -- I mean, that might make some analysts happy and it might make some shareholder happy, but it's absolutely not in the best interest of the shareholders, employees or the customers. But I mean, it's all we have to do is basically stop our marketing expenses and lost 40% of the people and I don't know whether it's 40% or 50% or 35%. But, I mean, hard stop, it's cash positive and profitable like this quarter. But I don't think that would be responsible, and I don't think it's anybody's interest, but you asked the question we gave you the answer. Only thing, Brad, that we -- the way that we've modeled our path to profitability, we feel confident on that and we stick to that. I mean, you get in the Shell and you get into Koch, Baker Hughes, I mean, these are very, very large relationships now. And then for the follow-up, I did want to -- I guess looking back at what we had spoken about last quarter with deals getting pushed out, just given the current environment. So specifically, you guys had called out 66 deals last quarter getting pushed. Yes, so we did close some of those deals that were pushed out of last quarter. And like we expected from our revenue guidance, the macroeconomic climate, was tougher for the second -- after Q1, but it has stabilized and in particular, with our new consumption-based pricing, I think our customers and potential new customers are reacting well to that strategy. It makes a ton of sense, especially when I think about that average contract value declining from, call it, $19 million to less than $1 million this quarter. I was talking to myself, I want to ask about the subscription revenue outperformance seems like a big outperformance in the quarter. Because even if you have closed some of the deals that got pushed, I wouldn't have thought that you would recognize a ton of revenue from those. Well, I think you kind of got it. So I think you called it accurately, Pinjalim. Tom, on a high level, maybe help us understand what are you hearing from CIOs in terms of IT budgets for next year. I think it's a really good question, and it varies from company to company. And if you saw the defense budget, when he's flying through today, he increased, I think, almost over -- I'm sorry, $200 billion over last year, if I'm not mistaken. And then there's companies that whose name I will not mention, that are just absolutely going to the mat and slashing expenses on everything. And so these two classes of companies out there, those who are investing in savings and those who are just kind of going into a knee jerk, perfectly rational response to an impending significant recession and then just slashing all costs. You guys are the pros of this, whether it's 12 or 24 months. But when it's over, we're going to still be here if you don't plug it away at it. I mean, it is rocky out there. I want to do a couple of sort of financial ones to start with, if that's okay. So gross margin, if I'm looking at it right, non-GAAP was 77%, down from 81% last quarter. The only thing to call out there is the trials and tickets, as Tom mentioned in the opening remarks, there is more higher cost than those than the ongoing subscriptions. So as we see increase of pilots and trials even in the coming quarters, we are expecting some pressure on gross margin before it climbs back up to historical levels. And by the time we are back at Q4 FY '24, we should be back at these rates and higher. And then the subscription fee, but services missed at least my number by a lot and went down sequentially by a lot. Only thing to say, it's -- the services is a direct result of our transition to these pilots in our new consumption-based pricing model. So as we -- as the pilots convert to ongoing license arrangements, we do expect the services component to increase as well. And in the second half of this fiscal year, we actually are expecting services to return back to the 10% to 20% of our total revenues. And then if you look at the subscription revenue of $59 million and change, the footnote says 32% of that is from related parties. So Baker Hughes is our, of course, still a significant shareholder of C3 AI, and any revenues that we interact with Baker Hughes is direct purchases. I'm not sure you have one, but... I don't know how to respond, Pat. We're going to be doing a lot more deals, a lot more customers. We're going to convert a lot more of them into production, and they're going to grow just like Shell, Baker Hughes, Koch and everybody else has grown. And there's -- so right now, things are looking pretty promising. Last one, and this one is probably for you, Tom. So you signed -- it's been a year since you signed that $500 million production, other transaction agreement with the Department of Defense. And then we have  agreement with RSO, and you will announce not in this release, but tomorrow morning as the announcement about a big partnership that we're doing with Booz Allen Hamilton, okay, in all of the Federal, particularly DoD. And our next question, Sanjit Singh with Morgan Stanley. I really just want to touch on sort of the consumption growth that you're seeing, especially with the Ex Machina product. Our CRM product could be an entire separate company, our ESG product could be an entire separate company, stand-alone company. And in all three of those, I think we really need to get full it going, and we haven't done that yet. I mean, your commentary sounds worse than the 270% consumption increase that you're seeing there. And then two, how are you -- in your other products, like trying to enable similar consumption rates, is there anything sort of to highlight that you're doing differently there to get to those kind of trends that you're seeing in this product, although you're not highlighting it specifically? No, I think, let me just kind of add on to that. So for Ex Machina, just what Tom said, we're still very early stages on that. So yes, we see those key customers that started early with us massive increase in consumption. Yes, we're excited about that. But that entire product is completely in its infancy, and we have high expectations on it. So remember, again, we start these targets, the consumption deals start with a six-month pilot and then it moves into consumption. That question, and as we start talking about consumption under all the other deals that we do, we'll start reporting and discussing that more detail probably in Q1 next year. So for Tom, it looks like there's strong traction. In Department of Defense, new and expanded deals with numerous agencies. One more time, please. So for Tom, looks like there was really strong traction in Department of Defense, expanded deals with numerous agencies. And we've been working on that since 2014, okay, at the level of the Secretary of the Army and the Secretary of the Air Force and the joint chiefs and the -- and I mean, we've really been working it hard. I think we have 12 projects, all delivered on time, on budget to spec. And really, what we're finding is the consumption model there is really, really well received. And they're kind of used to seeing these multibillion dollar juggernaut projects from the Lockheed Martins of the world or other providers, and we're coming in where, hey, we bring the project live for $0.5 million, and after that, $0.55 per CPU hour. And then for Juho, I just want to touch again on the services revenue, understandable that it would be lower given some of the trial activity. Well, again, there's a component of the ongoing gradations with our existing customers and potential services engagements with them. So what I was alluding to earlier to Pat's question, we are expecting services activity in the second half of this year. And then separately, in the long-term models, you should expect that as the pilots convert to consumption, there are services deals associated with those as well. And I think on the call, you said there were 13 consumption pilot wins in the quarter, and maybe that was maybe better than you initially expected. So sorry, the second half of your question, it was a bit unclear, but let me address the first one. Yes, while we're excited on the beginning of this, so we did 13 pilot plant trials. So there's still a combination of some of the trials in there, but we do expect them to convert to a consumption-based arrangement at the end of the trial period. So even though we said 5 this quarter and we came in at 13, I want to keep the model as it was that we provided last quarter. In terms of stock-based compensation, I think it's the second consecutive quarter where stock-based compensation as a percentage of sales is above 85%. I think in Q1, we talked about maybe that was a lot to do with share refreshers. I think broadly speaking, you see this across the industry. And as you obviously know, the history of the entire tech sector on C3 AI in the last 1.5 years, we are carrying significant stock-based compensation cost for awards that were granted when the share price was much higher than it is today. So unfortunately, there's nothing we can do about that unless the underlying employee decides to seek for other opportunities. So for now, until the end of these vesting terms for these awards, we are going to be carrying these pretty high stock-based compensation costs. Never, but no time soon. And our next question comes from the line of Adam Bergere, Bank of America. I guess, naturally, we expect it to kind of increase sequentially every quarter given the sequential given the new consumption model. But is there a chance there's still some lumpiness in that, as you know, certain larger customers may renew on kind of like the non-consumption license? Yes, I think the short answer to that is yes. And what we guided last quarter, we beat it for this quarter. Our guidance for next quarter, you see sequential increase and it does have the Q4 as an increase to that with respect to the implied guidance. But as we enter into it, in the short term, and as we enter into FY '24 and especially the second half of FY '24, you should start seeing the graph to get steeper and steeper in line with the presentation we shared last quarter. Well, thank you for the question. So we are expecting pressure on it, but it doesn't change our path to profitability in 1 bit. So I cannot tell you exactly where I think it will dip down to, but I think in your models as you prepare the business back in FY '20 -- sorry, back when we hit FY '24, Q4, we should be back at 77-plus gross margin. But if you're able to do that, that would be great. And so that would be 100%, where we're selling with them. They may bring the executive team over here as Google has, as Baker Hughes has, as Microsoft has in the past like many, many times. But we're actively engaged, okay, in the sales process. We see activity all throughout the quarter, but it's not unusual in this business where as you approach currently, you have slightly more activity. So if your question is relating to the diversification of industries, we see continued diversification, which we're very excited about. Yes, there's deals in energy, but defense, as we discussed, is really exciting for us as many other industries as well. And gentlemen, thank you for your thoughtful questions. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating, and you may now disconnect."
