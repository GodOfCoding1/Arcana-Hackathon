    "content": " We expect that, as a result of this, we expect to see significant licensing expansion of this program in the coming year, leveraging the $100 million and $500 million ATO contract vehicles that we had been awarded to expand this AI predictive maintenance application across many additional aircraft platforms. We believe this will be further accelerated by increased effectiveness of our joint partner selling model and especially by our new agreement with Google Cloud to go sell and fund 50% of the cost of over 100 Tier 1 new customer engagements, making it quite easy for new customers to adopt C3 AI applications. Assuming that we have an average of 60 sales professionals in Q2 and that sales headcount will grow at 10% per quarter, if you run this model with our eight to 12 quarters, you will find that revenue flatness for three quarters and then rapidly accelerates in fiscal year '24 and beyond to growth rates in the top decile of the SaaS software universe. Combining the effectiveness of our new sales organization, the consumption-based pricing model, the power of the Google Cloud joint sales and pilot funding program and our other important marketing partnerships, we expect a substantial increase in new customers and associated increase in SaaS revenue growth rate and market share. and our prospects, and we are confident that this will significantly  function processing ML against actual revenue that we realized from a number of representatives C3 AI customers over the first -- over their initial 10 quarters, and we find it to be license revenue neutral across that customer listed aggregate. Now using this new consumption pricing model, it's basically revenue neutral, except that we didn't have to close -- it's revenue neutral, except basically had to close 10 $0.5 million deals, and after that, it's 55% per CPU hour. So basically, we get the same level of revenue, we're closing 10 deals for $0.5 million, and we have to keep the customers happy, okay?"
