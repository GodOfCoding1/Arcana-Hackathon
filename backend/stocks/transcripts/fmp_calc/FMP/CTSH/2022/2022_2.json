    "content": " We continue to see excellent growth in Products and Resources, where revenue grew 11.6% year-over-year in constant currency, driven in part by strength among automotive, logistics, retail and consumer goods clients. While we continue to have a robust book-to-bill ratio of approximately 1.2x revenue on a trailing 12-month basis, by better balancing the factors just mentioned, we aim to accelerate bookings growth in other quarters, whilst nonetheless achieving our committed margin expansion. Our global growth markets, which includes all revenue outside of North America, grew approximately 12% year-over-year in constant currency, which included a negative 240 basis points impact from the sale of Samlink. For the full year, we are lowering the midpoint of our constant currency revenue growth guidance by about 1 point, which reflects, in part, the impact we have had while navigating the current industry supply-demand imbalances, elevated attrition and softer-than-expected hiring, particularly in North America. The results we announced this quarter, 9.5% constant currency growth with significant margin expansion year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter, unlike the rest of the industry, I think fits within that mode and so too does our guidance."
