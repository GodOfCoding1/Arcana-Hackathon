    "content": " That said, we do expect an increase in operating expenses in the second half of this year versus our first half run rate adjusted for onetime benefits, funding both increased Otrexup sampling and marketing costs.Q2 operating expenses also included $1 million in costs associated with a debt refinancing effort that we chose not to pursue very early in the quarter because it did not provide us with the flexibility that we needed to pursue business development to grow our business. Our updated annual guidance for 2022 summarized on Slide 6 is as follows: Product net sales are now expected to be in the range of $129 million to $137 million compared with our prior expectation of $126 million to $136 million; adjusted EBITDA is expected to be $73 million to $79 million, a considerable step up from our previous guidance of $66 million to $74 million; the updated guidance for 2022 reflects changes in revenue mix, volume and more favorable margins, partially offset by increased net operating expenses for the remainder of 2022."
