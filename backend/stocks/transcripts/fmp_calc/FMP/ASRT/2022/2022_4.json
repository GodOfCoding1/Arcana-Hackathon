    "content": " INDOCIN family net sales in the fourth quarter increased by $15.9 million over the prior year quarter, primarily due to a volume mix shift to more profitable channels and a return to normal customer inventory levels after a reduction in the prior quarter. SPRIX net sales in the fourth quarter were $2.7 million reflecting an increase of $900,000 versus the prior year quarter due to higher volume partially offset by higher commercial rebates and discounts. The year-over-year increase was driven by $17.7 million of additional product net sales and the resulting increase in gross profit, partially offset by higher selling general and administrative expenses due to increased sales and marketing expenses for Otrexup and Sympazan. For net product sales, Cambia loss of exclusivity on January 1, 2023; the addition of SYMPAZAN, which partially offsets the Cambia loss of exclusivity; Indocin net sales growth driven by new commercial and channel strategies, including higher net pricing on Indocin driven by a volume shift to more profitable channels, less the one-time customer inventory benefit of approximately $5 million in Q4, 2022 that returned inventories to normal levels."
