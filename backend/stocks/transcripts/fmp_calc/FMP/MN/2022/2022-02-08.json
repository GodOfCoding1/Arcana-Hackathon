    "content": " Since then, driven by investment excellence and progress on our strategic initiatives, we were able to slash net outflows in half in 2020, and by yet another 75% this year, bringing our total rate of net outflows from $4.5 billion down to just over $0.6 billion n 2021. Fourth-quarter gross client inflows were $685 million, a 12% improvement over last quarter, and included $220 million of wealth management inflows and $460 million into our intermediary and institutional channel. The difference between the decrease in reported wealth management inflows in the improvement in sales productivity stems from transfers between investment strategies, which were about $100 million higher in 2020 than in 2021. Turning to our fourth-quarter P&L, we reported revenue of $37.8 million for the quarter compared to revenue of $37.5 million reported last quarter, with overall revenue margins remaining consistent at 67 basis points. With revenue of $37.8 million and operating expenses of $28.6 million, we finished the quarter with $9.2 million of operating income, 1% off from the $9.3 million reported last quarter, with operating income margins of 24.4%. We reported revenue of $145.6 million, up 15% from $127 million in 2020, with overall revenue margins of 67 basis points for both years. Other operating expenses of $29 million were up by about $760,000 when compared to 2020, the increase is due to increased implementation costs in software subscriptions stemming from our technology overhaul, as well as a $1.2 million gain that offset other operating expenses last year, all of which were partially offset by savings and various other operating costs. Overall, we reported operating income of $33 million in 2021 compared to $14 million for the year ended December 31, 2020."
