    "content": " Private education loans delinquent 30 plus days came in at 3.7% of loans in repayment, up from 3.5% in Q1 '22 and 2.1% in the year ago quarter. Private education loans and forbearance were 1.3% at the end of the quarter, down from 1.4% at the end of Q1 2022 and 3% at the end of the year ago quarter, which you may recall we had not yet implemented our forbearance policy changes. In the quarter, net charge-offs from private education loans were $95.5 million, resulting in an annualized charge-off rate of 2.56%, which exceeded the forecast of 2.25% (ph) we provided in April. As you can see, 1.3% of our loans used forbearance in the second quarter compared to 3% in the year ago quarter. I'm just trying to reconcile, we've seen the allowance ratio as a percent of any loans and repayments sort of settling declining on sort of a quarter-over-quarter basis but also on a year-over0year basis and yet we passed some charge-off guidance going up."
