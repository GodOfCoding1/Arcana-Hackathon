    "content": " Before we get started, I'd like to remind you that our remarks today will include forward-looking statements, such as our financial guidance and expectations, including our long-term objectives and forecasts for our third quarter and fiscal year 2022 regarding our revenue growth, profitability, operating margin and free cash flow as well as our expectations regarding our business, assets, products, strategies, technology, employees, users, demand and markets. We also saw increased adoption of some of our newer products, Dropbox Backup and Capture, and we announced the pricing and packaging update for Standard and Advanced plans in June, delivering more value to our Teams customers around security and data protection. Total revenue for the quarter increased 7.9% year-over-year to $573 million, beating our guidance range of $568 million to $571 million. For the full year 2022, due to the significant strengthening of the U.S. dollar since our last update, we are revising our as-reported revenue guidance range down by $12 million to $2.308 billion to $2.318 billion from our previous guidance range of $2.320 billion to $2.330 billion. As we talked about, we're raising our constant currency revenue guidance for the year by about $8 million or about 8.8% at the midpoint."
