    "content": "  Before we get started, I'd like to remind you that our remarks today will include forward-looking statements such as our financial guidance and expectations, including our long-term objectives and forecast for our first quarter and fiscal year 2023 and our expectations regarding our revenue growth, profitability, operating margin and free cash flow as well as our expectations regarding our business, assets, products, strategies, technology, employees, users, demand and the macroeconomic environment. Total revenue for the fourth quarter increased 5.9% year-over-year to $599 million, beating our guidance range of $592 million to $595 million. Average revenue per paying user for Q4 was $134.53, up slightly compared to Q3, with the benefit from our Teams pricing initiative, partially offset by FX headwinds and the continued mix shift towards Family plan, which is comprised of six seats, and therefore, carries a lower ARPU profile. We now estimate a full year 2023 currency headwind of approximately $35 million or approximately 150 basis points headwind to growth, with the FX headwinds moderating each quarter as we lap the headwinds of last year. This includes approximately $23 million in cash outflows for the 2023 installments of acquisition-related deal consideration holdbacks for DocSend and Command E. Additionally, our free cash flow guidance is inclusive of an approximate $50 million headwind as a result of the R&D tax legislation, which I will elaborate on shortly."
