    "content": " We also drove strong increases in our margins with gross profit up 13% year-over-year, while our diligent cost management resulted in an improvement in operating income and adjusted EBITDA of over $6 million. On our last earnings call, I discussed a number of new strategic customers, including one of the largest wireless carriers and the largest broadband company in the U.S.  As expected, we began shipping to these new customers in the third quarter and expect increased demand from them throughout the calendar year. In Q3, revenue from TESSCO.com increased 3% year-over-year, totaling over $9.3 million engagements, measured in product page views, increased a 160% year-over-year. Third quarter revenues increased 3% year-over-year to a $102.5 million, with growth in both our carrier and commercial markets. We remain focused on cost management, SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenues continued to decline, totaling 18.9% this quarter as compared to 23.8% in last year's third quarter. Last year's third quarter SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenues, would have been 20.8%, excluding the costs associated with the consent solicitation, so still a very significant improvement. Third quarter fiscal 2022 net income was $1.2 million, compared with net loss of $5.7 million a year ago. For fiscal 2022, we're now projecting revenue of $408 million to $425 million, which compares to $373 million in fiscal year 2021, a net loss of $5.5 million to $2.6 million, which compares to a net loss of $14.4 million in fiscal year 2021, and Adjusted EBITDA of between a loss of $2.6 million to a profit of $0.4 million, which compares to a loss of $12.8 million in fiscal year 2021."
