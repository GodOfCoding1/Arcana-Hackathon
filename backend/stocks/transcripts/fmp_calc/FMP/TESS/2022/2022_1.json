    "content": " Our revenue grew 18% sequentially and 9% year-over-year, with gains in both our markets carrier and the commercial business. Our strong execution coupled with the post pandemic recovery across our markets, and the industry-wide adoption and implementation of new technology give us confidence in our operating plan of the following; achieving between $408 million and $442 million in revenue, representing 9% to 18% growth over last year. So we're not planning on adding new warehouses Tim, its existing operations and the focus of Nokia, this is Nokia, as their equivalent of carrier and commercial portfolio focus on the carrier segment, like we do today, plus utilities, transportation, it's much more of the commercial business, as we describe, very specifically, the parts of the portfolio that we're excited about are around small cells, microwave, broadband. Yes, so three things, to reiterate that we said, I mean, it's the same metrics, though from what, if you use from a carrier perspective, it's the bookings growth, which was pretty large this quarter, it's the year-over-year revenue growth that we look at."
