    "content": " Within the Tier 1 Carrier Ecosystems, revenue this quarter grew 28% year-over-year, we achieved this growth with existing customers, as well as new customers. Our Tower significantly grew this quarter, up 39% year-over-year, our largest tower customer awarded us an additional business line that we expect will have steady growth throughout fiscal 2023. We achieved these results despite industry wide disruptions in the global supply chain, which delayed receipt of inventory from vendors, limited our ability to ship product to customers, and contributed to year-over-year fourth quarter sales bookings growth of 11%. As Sandeep mentioned, we ended the quarter with another record level of backlog totaling $75 million at the end of Q4, and up 120% since the start of the fiscal year, and up 10% over Q3. In fiscal 2022, we met or exceeded all of our guidance targets we provided in July of 2021 at the start of our fiscal year, we grew revenue and bookings year-over-year by 12%, and 21%, respectively despite supply chain constraints. And 8% to 14% growth in revenue, and adjusted EBITDA of between $4 million to $7 million, which would be a margin improvement of 400 to 500 basis points from fiscal year 2021 to fiscal year 2023."
