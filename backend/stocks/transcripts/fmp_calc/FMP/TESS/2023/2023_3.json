    "content": " Regarding our sales channels, we continue to sell both direct and online through tessco.com and, in Q3, achieved quarterly revenue of $9.9 million, up 6% year-over-year. As Sandip mentioned, we had another strong revenue quarter for our combined Carrier and Commercial segments, totaling $114.9 million, up 12% year-over-year. Third quarter fiscal '23 selling, general, and administrative expenses increased 17% to $22.7 million. This quarter's variable SG&A as a percentage of revenue was up from 6.1% in last year's third quarter to 6.4% this quarter as we continue to see freight charges from carriers increase, largely due to fuel surcharges and other accessorial charges. For the full fiscal '23 year, we are on pace to meet our guidance ranges, specifically revenue of $450 million to $475 million which would represent a growth of 8% to 14%; adjusted EBITDA of between $4 million to $7 million which compares to a $0.3 million in fiscal year 2022, and a net loss of $5 million to $2.1 million which compares to a net loss of $3.3 million in fiscal year '22. I think as far as the revenues that we're seeing right now, as we sit here today with a strong backlog of $84 million, a lot of projects in the works here that will be shipping this quarter, we're very optimistic about our fourth quarter revenue number."
