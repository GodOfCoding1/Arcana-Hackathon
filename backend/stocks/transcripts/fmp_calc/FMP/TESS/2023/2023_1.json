    "content": " We had record bookings of $137 million, and our backlog increased 32% from the last quarter to $99 million, which is yet another record. Our backlog at the end of Q1 was over $45 million, up 78% year-over-year and 39% sequentially. Our strongest growth within the Carrier segment this quarter came from our tower business, which grew significantly, up 64% year-over-year and 56% sequentially. Bookings were also strong ending Q1 at $76 million, up 16% year-over-year and 18% sequentially. Backlog hit yet another record at quarter end, growing to $54 million, a 144% increase year-over-year and 26% sequentially. As Sandip mentioned, we ended the quarter with another record level of backlog, totaling $99 million at the end of Q1 and up 109% year-over-year and up 32% over last quarter. Accordingly, we are reaffirming our guidance for fiscal year 2023, which is as follows: revenue of $450 million to $475 million, which would reflect growth of 8% to 14% from last year; a net loss of $5 million to $2.1 million, which compares to a net loss of $3.3 million in fiscal year 2022; and adjusted EBITDA of between $4 million and $7 million, which compares to $0.3 million in fiscal year 2022. And lastly, two years ago, in the last first quarter, before the sale of our retail business, our total bookings, including $24 million from retail were $114 million."
