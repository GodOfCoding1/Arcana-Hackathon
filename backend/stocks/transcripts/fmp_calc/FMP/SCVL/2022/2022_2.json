    "content": " While below our original growth ambitions for 2022 top-line, this sales range represents growth of 24% to 29% versus 2019, demonstrating top-tier growth levels in the channel better reflects the challenging inflationary environment our consumer is now facing and includes the short-term disruption to our 2022 athletic supply. While lack of athletic inventory limited our sales potential in the first half of 2022, we delivered excellent gross margins, double-digit operating margins and earnings per share that was more than 43 of 44 prior full year earnings already. In addition, deliveries of new fall nonathletic product are flowing much better than 2021, and we are well positioned from an inventory perspective to deliver on the sales and profit guidance for the remainder of the fiscal year. Year-to-date net sales have increased $107.8 million or 20.6% compared to 2019, with both store banners contributing nearly equally to the year-to-date increase. Sales from the Shoe Station banner stores acquired in December 2021 were opened in 2022, added net sales of $27.2 million for the quarter and $53.4 million year-to-date. With the influx of cash from sales in August, today, our cash balances are more than $100 million with the expectation of positive cash provided by operations in the second half of this year, we should end the year with cash balances a little below last year\u00e2\u0080\u0099s heading balance of $132 million, excluding the effect of any additional share repurchases. Summarizing our expectations for 2022 fiscal year, we expect sales to range from $1.29 billion to $1.34 billion, gross profit margin to range from 36.6% to 36.7%, operating margin to range from 11.4% to 11.6% and diluted earnings per share to range from $3.95 to $4.15."
