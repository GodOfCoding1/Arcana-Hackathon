    "content": " During the first quarter of 2021, the government distributed over $400 billion in consumer stimulus contributing to Shoe Carnival\u2019s growth of over 120% versus the prior year. Against last year's stimulus enhanced Q1, total sales were down 3.3% and comparable store sales declined 10.6%. Against last year's first quarter, our merchandise margin decreased 130 basis points and buying, distribution, and occupancy expense as a percentage of sales increased 280 basis points. With Q1 sales results in line and diluted EPS ahead of our expectations despite higher supply chain costs, we are reiterating our sales guidance for fiscal 2022 of 4% to 7% growth and raising our diluted EPS guidance to $3.95 to $4.15 from previous expectations of $3.80 to $4.10. Your line is open. Your line is open. Just I'm sorry, one more thing with Shoe Station, you originally had guided Shoe Station to do about a $100 million in revenue and at a 10% Op margin, is that -- has anything changed within that number within your guidance or can you just give us any color as to what you're seeing there by getting up earlier on some of the -- on the CRM and with the shoestation.com, will that potentially facilitate more revenue, anything you can give us there? Your line is open. So we're in line, the unusual thing that was in our SG&A offsetting those a little bit was lower incentive compensation compared to last year because if you remember last year, we had such a breakout first quarter, it was higher than the average typically. Your line is open. Your line is open."
