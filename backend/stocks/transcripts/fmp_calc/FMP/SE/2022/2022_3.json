    "content": " During the quarter, our Asian market recorded an adjusted EBITDA loss of $217 million, improving by 31% quarter-on-quarter as a result of profitability improvement across all markets in the region. While our other markets combined, adjusted EBITDA loss was $279 million, improving by 16% quarter-on-quarter as a result of increased monetization and cost savings. Finally, moving on to our digital financial services business, in the third quarter, SeaMoney's GAAP revenue reached $327 million, up 147% year-on-year. In terms of Free Fire, we continue to see headwinds impacting our user number and engagement as well as monetization, which is reflected in our third quarter results, but also reflected in our revised guidance for the full year. In terms of the -- any headwinds on for marketplace revenues, so far, as we increased the take rates across various service offerings and the sellers adopt more of our programs and pay higher advertisement and also some of the opting programs to Shopee, we continue to see sellers a response to remain positive and they continue to invest in the platform that we shared before. Thank you, Piyush, in terms of the gain guidance that we shared, we continue to see headwinds impacting our markets from both the macro environment, in particular, inflation affecting discretionary spending, including spending on games as well as ForEx and overall weakness, I think that's also impacting game industry as a whole. And given currently the losses at a very manageable level, as we continue to improve on cost efficiency and monetization over time, we believe that this business is something that is much of a long-term business that we need to focus on quality as opposed to scale growth as rapidly as possible and rapid monetization."
