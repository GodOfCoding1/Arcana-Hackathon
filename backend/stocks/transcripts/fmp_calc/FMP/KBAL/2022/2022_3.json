    "content": " It particularly underlines the strength of our positioning in the Workplace and Health end markets, where we believe our 41% sales increase indicates that Kimball International continues to gain share, demand in these markets were strong across each vertical led by commercial, education and eBusiness and aligned with our expectations of returning to learning and return to hybrid workplaces. Taking a closer look at our key end markets, Workplace revenue increased 52% in the third quarter, representing growth across all verticals, and orders were up 36%. At Poppin, with increased inventory levels on hand, sales bounced back significantly in the third quarter, up 94% year-on-year and order rates climbed 64%, positioning us to end the year with an $80 million run rate. Net sales in the third quarter of fiscal 2022 were up 30% to $180.9 million compared to the prior year's quarter, reflecting strong demand in our Workplace and Health end markets that accounted for approximately 81% of total revenue. Taking a deeper look into our end markets, sales in Workplace increased 52%, with our commercial, education and government verticals achieving double-digit year-over-year sales increases and also benefited from Poppin generating 94% revenue growth year-over-year. Health experienced an 8% growth in net sales and due to lack of business travel activity in the Hospitality end market remains relatively soft, leading to a 2% revenue decline in the third quarter. Health orders improved 2% year-over-year, and orders in the Hospitality end market represented a 43% increase over a significantly depressed market last year and one that will continue to underperform pre-pandemic levels until the full-scale return of business and international travel, which as Kristie mentioned, we expect to begin in 2023."
