    "content": " Workplace and Health orders combined have increased at double-digit rates in each of the past 3 quarters, indicating the strength and consistency of demand in these 2 markets, which account for 89% of our second quarter net sales. Kimball International's year-to-date performance, together with the robust growth in orders we experienced in the second quarter, continued to support our expectations for fiscal 2022 to be a year of 15% to 20% sales growth, indicating a substantial pickup in the second half of this fiscal year. This caused a pause in the positive sequential momentum in Poppin sales, which we expect to resume in this year's second half as evidenced by Poppin's bookings up 106% versus last year's quarter. If not for the labor and supply chain issues that constrained our production and shipment capabilities in the first half of this year, our revenue for the quarter would have been approximately $18 million higher than reported. Top line growth continues to be led by strength in our workplace and health end markets, offsetting continued expected weakness in the hospitality market and a slightly lower-than-anticipated contribution from Poppin of $13.5 million. Adjusted selling and administrative expenses amounted to $48.5 million compared to $40.7 million in the year ago quarter, primarily related to a full quarter of costs associated with the Poppin acquisition compared to just 3 weeks in the year ago quarter and incremental investments such as the Miami Poppin showroom to support our sales growth and new product introductions. Order activity in the workplace end market was 42% higher compared to the year ago quarter, including the full contribution from Poppin whose orders were up 106% year-over-year and double-digit order growth rates in commercial, finance and education verticals within Workplace."
