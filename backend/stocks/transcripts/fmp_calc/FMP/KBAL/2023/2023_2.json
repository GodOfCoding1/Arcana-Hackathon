    "content": " I'm pleased to share in the second quarter of fiscal 2023, we drove significant year-over-year revenue growth in all our end markets, Workplace, Health and Hospitality. As Kristie mentioned, due to lower demand in major metropolitan areas, which are Poppin's primary markets, we have recognized a onetime $36.7 million noncash goodwill impairment charge associated with the Poppin acquisition, bringing the carrying value to 0. Our ability to execute in the market, combined with our industry-leading gross margins, our ability to scale SG&A expenses with revenues as well as our operational excellence programs continue to drive strong adjusted EBITDA performance totaling $16 million for the quarter, which is 4x higher than last year's comparable quarter. Our total backlog at quarter end of $144.8 million comprised of roughly 2/3 Workplace and Health and 1/3 Hospitality is in line with our expectations as we continue to improve our operational reliability and reduce lead times, which are now back to pre-pandemic levels. And then I think the third bucket will be comprised of really all other being -- whether it's leverage, product, BU mix and just kind of overall moderations in things like inflation, for example, LIFO being an actual income item in this quarter versus an expense in the prior year."
