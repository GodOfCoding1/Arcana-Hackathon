    "content": " As shared on March 15, we dosed our first patient in the Phase III portion of the SYMPHONY 1 study, a confirmatory study assessing tazemetostat in combination with rituximab plus lenalidomide compared with R-square plus placebo in patients with relapsed/refractory follicular lymphoma previously treated with at least one systemic therapy, including those who are rituximab refractory and/or have experienced progression of disease within 2 years of receiving their last treatment. We are proud to share that the randomized Phase III portion of the study is open globally, and we are actively screening and enrolling patients in both Europe and the U.S. We are happy to share the data from the SYMPHONY-1 study has been accepted for a poster presentation at the upcoming American Society of Clinical Oncology Annual Meeting in Chicago in June. The poster will include updated safety and activity data from the Phase Ib portion of the study, specifically updated overall and complete response rate and a subgroup analysis of rituximab refractory and POD24 patients, which, as you know, to present about 30% to 40% of the relapsed/refractory FL population in the real world and in which new more effective treatments are needed. So it's incumbent on us to identify and reach those physicians, so we can ensure they're aware of all the changes in the marketplace and appropriately educate on updates to the NCCN guidelines, as well as our TAZVERIK data."
