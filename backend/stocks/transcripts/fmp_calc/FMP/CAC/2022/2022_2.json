    "content": " Earlier today, we reported net income of $15 million for the second quarter of 2022 or $1.02 per diluted share, which represents a decrease of 11% when compared to the first quarter of 2022 net income and a 10% decrease compared to the first quarter 2022 diluted EPS. This increase in provision helped move our ratio of allowance for credit losses to total loans to 92 basis points at the end of the second quarter of 2022, 2 basis points higher than the end of the first quarter. We reported net income of $15 million for the second quarter of 2022 and diluted EPS of $1.02, which was a decrease of 11% and 10% respectively compared to the first quarter this year. On a non-GAAP basis, adjusted for SBA PPP loan income and excess liquidity, net interest margin for the second quarter was 2.85% compared to 2.84% last quarter. Noninterest income for the second quarter of 2022 was $11.1 million, which was 13% higher than the first quarter of 2022. Noninterest expense for the second quarter of 2022 was $26.6 million, which is 1% higher than the first quarter of 2022. Tangible book value per share decreased 9% during the second quarter to $23.92 at June 30, 2022, while our tangible common equity ratio decreased 74 basis points in the quarter to 6.51%. But in terms of if the Fed gets to call it 3% by the end of the quarter, third quarter, and it keeps moving forward to 3.5% by the end of the year, we're thinking for the third quarter, we're going to see margin expansion in the neighborhood of 3 to 5 basis points and that's off of our 2.85% core margin that we're speaking of."
