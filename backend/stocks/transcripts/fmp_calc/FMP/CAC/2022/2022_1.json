    "content": " I'm pleased to report that we got off to a solid start this year with reported net income for the first quarter of $16.8 million and diluted earnings per share of $1.13, each representing an increase of 2% over last quarter. For the first quarter of 2022, net interest income decreased $432,000 or 1% compared to the fourth quarter of 2021 driven by a decrease in SBA PPP loan income of $1.7 million, as related loan balances continue to run off at an accelerated pace, as borrowers take advantage of loan forgiveness offered. Loan growth for the quarter was centered within our residential mortgage portfolio, which grew $86 million or 7%, and our C&I portfolio which grew $40 million or 11%. Credit quality across our loan portfolio continues to be favorable highlighted by nonperforming loans totaling 19 basis points of total loans as of the end of the first quarter of 2022, compared to 20 basis points at December 31, 2021 and 31 basis points a year ago. At March 31, 2022 our allowance to total loans ratio was 0.9% representing a 7-basis-point decrease from year-end and resulted in a negative provision for the first quarter of 2022 of $1.1 million. Included within our allowance balance of $31.8 million as of March 31, 2022 is another $3.2 million of reserves related to these hospitality loans subject to release over the coming quarters should these loans meet their preestablished internal requirements."
