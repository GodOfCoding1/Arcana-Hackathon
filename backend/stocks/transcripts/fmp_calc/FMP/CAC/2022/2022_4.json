Earlier today, we reported net income for the year ended 2022 of $61.4 million and diluted EPS of $4.17 and down from last year's record earnings, we're certainly pleased with these annual results, particularly in light of the significant change in market dynamics between years.

On a linked quarter basis, we reported net income of $15.4 million and diluted EPS of $1.05 for the fourth quarter, each an increase of 8% over the last quarter. On a non-GAAP basis, pre-tax pre-provision earnings for the fourth quarter were $19.8 million, a 4% percent decrease from the third quarter. Our credit portfolio remains in pristine conditions supported by non-performing loans of 0.13% of total loans at December 31, 2022 consistent with last quarter minimal net charge off and delinquent loans totaling 6 basis points of total loans at December 31, 2022 compared to 12 basis points last quarter.
