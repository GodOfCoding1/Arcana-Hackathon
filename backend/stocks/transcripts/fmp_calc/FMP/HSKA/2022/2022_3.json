    "content": " So far in 2022, we were slower than intended in launching and accelerating traction for things like Rapids internationally, heartworm domestically and Element aim into Europe and into North America corporate contracts as quickly as intended and in time to make a financial impact on 2022 that could overcome the accumulated macro headwinds. But as we shift our thinking towards 2023, what are you thinking about in terms of a potential inflection point in that number, so much of the industry narrative, I guess, has revolved around the idea that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s largely capacity driven, but it seems like there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s other factors that are increasingly beginning to weigh on the return to the normalization in terms of clinic visit trends. And I think those trends are largely in place so when vet visits are off 3, 2.5, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not capturing necessarily 100% of them, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not a direct link, so it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not going to be a ratio where you can say, okay, the visits are of 2.5 apply 0.75 multiple to it and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll get exactly what unit volumes are going to be because I think diagnostics seem to be holding up a little bit better."
