    "content": " Heska teams have set the table for a strong second half, while delivering 4% top line sales growth in constant currency compared to last year's very strong 42% Q2 sales growth. This morning's full guide reflects these results and our expectations in light of the macroeconomic headwinds that are noted in this morning's release, currency inflation, the European situation and a very tight labor market constraining veterinary hospital pet business are all real and they're in or out, outlook that has been updated this morning. But we see that as Heska launches new platforms in 2022, we can overcome and grow quantities and mix of higher-margin consumables in the face of this year's patient business declines, which we do see moderating in the latter part of the back half of 2022 and into 2023. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open."
