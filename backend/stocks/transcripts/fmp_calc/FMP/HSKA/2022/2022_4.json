    "content": " Rounding out our growth drivers for 2023 are Heska's new true rapid series of single use tests, Heska's upcoming release of new cloud-based practice information management software and related software products and our other announced and unannounced projects, which together we see driving profitability, differentiation, scalability, share gains and competitiveness in 2023 and beyond. The decline versus the prior year of 750 basis points was driven mainly by one-time acquisition-related costs and other non-recurring charges, the most significant of which is related to a $10 million payment in the first quarter of 2022 for an exclusive agreement to develop the Heska Nu.Q Vet Cancer Screen test.

So the $10 million that we're excluding from adjusted EBITDA was a payment that had to be immediately expensed from an accounting standpoint in the first quarter of 2022, but it is in relation to the Nu.Q cancer screening and monitoring test and licensing on -- of that product. Please proceed with your question. Please proceed with your question."
