    "content": " We generated $52 million of free cash flow in the first quarter, which is one of the best quarterly performances in the history of the partnership. During the first quarter, we generated $52 million of operating cash flow and $64 million of net income. Our Mineral Rights segment generated $48 million of operating cash flow and $63 million of net income in the first quarter of 2022, an improvement over the prior year quarter of $22 million and $42 million, respectively, driven by stronger demand and pricing for metallurgical coal, which made up 50% of our total coal royalty sales volumes and 80% of our coal royalty revenues during the first quarter of 2022. Net income in the first quarter of 2022 was $15 million, an improvement of $13 million as compared to the previous year quarter primarily due to higher international pricing in 2022. Regarding distributions, in February of 2022, we paid a quarterly $0.45 per common unit distribution and a quarterly cash distribution of $7.5 million to our preferred unitholders for the fourth quarter of 2021. The decision to increase common unit distributions was based on our substantial free cash flow generation, solid liquidity and positive outlook for our business lines, coupled with higher expected common unitholder income tax liability for 2022, resulting from the improved financial performance. It makes sense to me to be holistic because if you annualize the free cash flow generation of the company here relative to your guys' market cap, even though you obviously - the units have performed very well, total shareholder return-wise, like the multiple implied by the free cash flow if you guys think that this type of performance could be sustained, it's not pretty high free cash flow yield on the stock here."
