    "content": " Our second quarter financial results were good with record revenue of $14.3 million compared to $11.8 million in the year ago period, an increase of $2.5 million or 21%. Focusing as we do on results, excluding noncash expenses such as stock comp and depreciation, our total cost of sales was $7.2 million compared to $5.5 million in our second quarter last year, an increase of $1.7 million or 31%. R&D expense was approximately $2.6 million compared to $2.3 million in the year-ago period, an increase of $300,000 or 13%. Our G&A expense was at $2.1 million for the quarter compared to $1.6 million a year ago, a 30% increase. In total, our cash-based expenses were $13.6 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2023 compared to $11 million in the same period last year, an increase of approximately $2.6 million or 23% with the increase primarily stemming from cost of sales as we built in infrastructure to support higher revenue levels. For the quarter, net cash generated from operating activities was approximately $3.3 million, primarily due to positive cash-based operating results and an increase in accounts payable in the ordinary course of business. Certainly, the stuff -- most of the stuff that we book now and in Q4, even if it turns out into Q3 and Q4 go back to our normal projections, it's probably not going to have as much of an effect on the total revenue for the year as what happened to us Q2 in terms of the slowdown in bookings and the greater than expected cancellations."
