    "content": " As we reported last quarter, due to the macroeconomic environment we encountered some headwinds in our services business in 2 main areas: First, during our second quarter, we experienced a decline in quarterly bookings for the first time in over a year as we saw our customers reevaluating their discovery efforts and realigning priorities within their budgets given the new economic reality. As Ronnie mentioned, our previously disclosed  bookings and an uptick in cancellations, as expected, impacted our third quarter financial results, leading to revenue of $12.8 million compared to $13.2 million in the year-ago period, a decline of 420,000 was 3%. For the quarter, we had a loss of $2.5 million compared to income of $829,000 in the year ago period. Focusing as we view on results, excluding noncash expenses such as stock comp and depreciation, our total cost of sales was $7.5 million compared to $6.3 million in our third quarter last year, an increase of $1.2 million or 19%. R&D expense was approximately $3.2 million compared to $2.2 million in the year ago period, an increase of $1 million or 47%. Sales and marketing expense was $1.7 million compared to $1.5 million in the year ago period, an increase of $200,000 or 14%. Our G&A expense was at $1.9 million for the quarter compared to $1.7 million a year ago, a 14% increase. In total, our cash-based expenses were $14.3 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2023 compared to $11.7 million in the same period last year, an increase of approximately $2.7 million or 23%, with the increases primarily stemming from cost of sales to support booking growth and R&D for advancing our discovery efforts. For the quarter, net cash generated from operating activities was approximately $1.6 million primarily due to an increase in deferred revenue, which includes billings from recent bookings."
