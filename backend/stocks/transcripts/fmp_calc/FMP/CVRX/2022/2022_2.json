    "content": " In the U.S., our Heart Failure business generated $3.8 million, an increase of approximately 89% over the second quarter of 2021, resulting from a record number of revenue units sold in the quarter. Total revenue generated in the second quarter was $5.0 million, which is an increase of $1.9 million or 61%, when compared to the same period last year. Revenue generated in the U.S. was $3.9 million in the second quarter, which is an increase of 87% over the same period last year. Revenue generated in Europe was $1.1 million in the second quarter, which is an increase of 7% when compared to the same period last year. Your line is open. And so even though we were able to see 15 net new centers be added in the second quarter, we are still expecting the numbers to be in the high single digits for each quarter, meaning seven, eight, or nine in Q3, seven, eight or nine added in Q4 for the rest of this year. Your line is open. And then again we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re seeing another inflection point around that 18-month mark, where they are starting to reach that long-term goal of almost treating one patient per month per center, and so that continues to be the trend that we saw here in the second quarter of this year, is that the newer centers, the ones that are under 12 months are trying the device, they are seeing how it works on their patients, they are testing what reimbursement are going to come back yet. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open."
