    "content": " We are pleased with the consistent commercial execution and expansion of Barostim, especially progress with our heart failure business in the U.S. Total revenue generated in the third quarter was $6.2 million, which is an increase of $2.8 million or 82% when compared to the same period last year. Revenue generated in the U.S. was $5 million in the third quarter, which is an increase of 96% over the same period last year. Revenue generated in Europe was $1.1 million in the third quarter, which is an increase of 39% when compared to the same period last year. SG&A expenses were $12.7 million for the third quarter, which is an increase of 56% when compared to the same period last year. This was primarily driven by increases in compensation expense due to increased headcount and also due to increases in travel, stock compensation and marketing and advertising expenses related to the investments associated with the commercialization of Barostim in the U.S. Net loss was $9.8 million or $0.48 per share for the third quarter as compared to a net loss of $6.1 million or $0.30 per share for the same period last year. Go ahead, your line is now open. To get to the same level as the first 20 sites, however - this, I would say, a secondary effect of that slowed down after doing one or two patients is that those 20 centers we added in the last - in this Q3 this past quarter, we may not see an impact until middle of next year on those centers. And so we still run into the issues with hospital staffing shortages to get centers active and start treating patients, and that's why we're still guiding towards that high single-digit adds per quarter going forward. Go ahead, your line is now open. Go ahead, your line is now open."
