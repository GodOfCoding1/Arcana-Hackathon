    "content": " I'll begin today\u2019s call by providing an overview of our first quarter performance, followed by an operational update, a review of our financial results by our CFO, Jared Oasheim, and then I will conclude with our thoughts for the rest of 2022 before turning to Q&A s.  Starting with the review of the first quarter, our total revenue was $4.1 million, slightly exceeding the top of the range of our guidance for Q1. These results were driven by continued strong growth within our U.S. heart failure business, which generated $2.9 million, an increase of approximately 133% over the first quarter of 2021. Total revenue generated in the first quarter was $4.1 million, which is an increase of $12 million or 43% when compared to the same period last year. Revenue generated in the U.S. was $3.1 million in the current quarter, which is an increase of 90% over the same period last year. Heart failure revenue in the U.S. totaled $2.9 million in the current quarter on a total of 99 revenue units, as compared to $1.3 million in the first quarter of last year on 44 revenue units. Research and development expenses were $2.3 million for the current quarter, which is an increase of 29% when compared to the same period last year. SG&A expenses were $10.8 million for the current quarter, which is an increase of 142% when compared to the same period last year."
