    "content": " Accordingly, we are forecasting 2023 revenues to be in the range of $105 million to $110 million, and we will continue to invest in our growth initiatives and remain laser-focused on driving internal efficiencies and to bolster our margin expansion objectives. Total company revenues in the quarter were $29.2 million, which included record quarterly health care revenues of $26 million, increases on both a year-over-year and sequential basis. For our first year as a health care-driven company, we had overall revenues of $109.2 million, including health care-specific revenues of $94.7 million, an increase of 22% compared to the 2021 health care revenues. Overall, we are quite pleased with these results, which were also squarely in line with our prescribed annual guidance ranges of $92 million to $96 million for health care revenues and negative $1 million to $1 million for EBITDA. Within health care, claims based, also known as claims auditing revenues in the fourth quarter of 2022 were roughly $12.5 million, which was an increase of nearly 32% compared to the $9.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2021. For 2023, as Sim mentioned, we anticipate health care revenues to be in the range of $105 million to $110 million."
