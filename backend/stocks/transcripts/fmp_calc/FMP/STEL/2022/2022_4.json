    "content": " The fourth quarter provides us with a first look at both our balance sheet adjusted for purchase accounting with market valuations and our income statement, which will provide insight into the expenses associated with our merger along with day 2 provisions. The last significant merger related item I'll note is the Day 2 provision of loan losses for non-PCD loans under CECL, which totaled $28.2 million, along with a $5 million Day 2 provision for unfunded commitments on loans running through the income statement. -- I progress during the quarter, we ended the quarter with $7.75 billion in loans, which after adjusting for the previously mentioned merger related fair value marked on loan reflects an increase in loans over the quarter of around $200 million. Strategically we're really pleased with our balance sheet positioning going into 2023, particularly considering our loan deposit ratio of 83.7% solid capital levels and a strong quarter earnings power to support a healthy go-forward capital bill. But it's important to note that after excluding that pay to PCD provision of $28.2 million on non-PCD loans, and $5 million on provision for unfunded commitments, our quarterly provisioning amounted to $11.6 million, reflective of our more conservative view on credit given an increasing economic uncertainty, loan growth and changes in specific reserves. From an overall performance standpoint, when you after excluding merger related expenses, and non-recurring, the non-recurring gains, purchase accounting accretion and that CDI amortization, we feel very good about where we set the bar for our adjusted pretax, pre-provision earnings power in the fourth quarter at Stellar -- at $53 million. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Okay, thanks for that, Paul. Okay, thanks for that, Paul. Your line is open."
