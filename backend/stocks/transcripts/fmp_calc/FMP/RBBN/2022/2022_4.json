    "content": " Our focus on the faster-growing enterprise market segment showed positive results once again this quarter with revenue growing 67% quarter-over-quarter and 7% year-over-year, reaching 37% of Cloud and Edge, product and service sales in the quarter. In the fourth quarter of 2022, our financial results showed good improvement over the previous quarter and prior year, with revenue growth momentum for our IP Optical Networks business and continued profitability contributions from our Cloud and Edge business. In the fourth quarter of 2022, Ribbon generated revenues of $234 million which is an increase of $3 million or 1.3% from the prior year, driven by a 17% increase in IP Optical Networks that compensated for a 7% decrease in Cloud and Edge. Non-GAAP gross margin was 52.4% which is a 150 basis point decrease from prior year, entirely driven by the increased percentage mix of IP Optical Networks from 36% of total Ribbon revenues in fourth quarter of 2021 to over 41% in fourth quarter of 2022. In our Cloud and Edge business fourth quarter revenue was $137 million, down 7% year-over-year and up 10% quarter-over-quarter. Once again, the Cloud and Edge business contributed robust gross margins of 64%, which led to a $36 million EBITDA or 26% of revenues. Non-GAAP gross margin for IP Optical was 36% which is 170 basis points lower than the previous quarter, but 20 basis points higher than the fourth quarter of 2021. With that backdrop, we expect overall company revenue to grow in 2023, with a range of $840 million to $870 million, with Cloud and Edge revenue relatively flat year-over-year and IP Optical revenue growing greater than 15%. So for the first quarter, we're projecting revenue in the range of $180 million to $190 million, non-GAAP gross margins in the range of 46% to 48% and non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA in the range of minus $6 million to plus $1 million for the quarter."
