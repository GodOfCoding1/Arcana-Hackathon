    "content": " Revenue in the quarter was $564.4 million, which was within our guidance range and grew 18% from a year ago and was essentially flat sequentially. During the third quarter, certain customer programs were delayed by these component requalification efforts, adding an estimated $15 million supply chain-related headwind to the $30 million to $35 million supply chain impact we had previously estimated. As Csaba will detail in a moment, our revenue guidance for the fourth quarter would have been $40 million to $45 million higher, if not for these headwinds, which have grown substantially since the beginning of the year. While demand continues to increase, supply-related headwinds also grew in the third quarter, resulting in a slight sequential decrease in revenue to $564.4 million, which was within our guidance range. By end market, optical communications revenue was $440 million, down 2% from last quarter, but up 22% from a year ago. Within non-optical communications, automotive revenue was $53.3 million, up 13% from last quarter, and industrial laser revenue was $39 million, which grew 9% sequentially. And again, while the requalification is complete, we expect additional headwinds from increased demand will persist into Q4, and probably beyond that, actually, and an impact of -- we've included an impact of $40 million to $45 million in our Q4 guidance due to supply chain headwinds. We're optimistic that as we continue to navigate supply chain constraints impacting the industry, strong demand trends and excellent execution from our team will result in record top and bottom line results in the fourth quarter."
