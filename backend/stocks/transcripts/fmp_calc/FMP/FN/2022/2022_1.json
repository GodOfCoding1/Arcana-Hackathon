    "content": " During our last call, we estimated that we would see a $25 million to $30 million revenue headwind in the first quarter from these constraints. Optical communications revenue was $427.3 million, up 10% from the fourth quarter and made up 79% of total revenue. Within optical communications, telecom revenue increased 9% from the last quarter to $338.6 million, a new record, and datacom revenue of $88.7 million increased 15% from Q4. By technology, silicon photonics products reached a record $135.1 million or 25% of total revenue and was up 23% from the fourth quarter. Revenue from products rated at speed of 400 gig or higher was $173.3 million, up 30% from the fourth quarter and 149% from a year ago. Nonoptical communications revenue was $116 million or 21% of total revenue, representing a 25% increase from a year ago, but a decrease of 5% from the fourth quarter. On this combined basis, automotive revenue was $48.2 million, a decrease of 8% from last quarter. Other nonoptical communications revenue was $30.3 million, up 7% from the fourth quarter. Operating expenses in the quarter were $13.2 million or 2.4% of revenue, resulting in operating income of $52.5 million or 9.7% of revenue. So the current new building, building as is -- as we know, it's finished and is ramping up and will be, I would say, fully occupied by the end of the fiscal year, at which point the new building, Building 9 will be coming online, and that's about 1 million square feet, just over a million square feet of space."
