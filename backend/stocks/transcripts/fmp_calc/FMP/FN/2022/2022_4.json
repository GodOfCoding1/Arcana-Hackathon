    "content": " Strong demand across our key end markets helped drive revenue of $587.9 million, an increase of 15% from a year ago and 4% from Q3. Record non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.68 was a result of strong execution and exceptionally strong margins, with non-GAAP operating margin reaching a new quarterly high of 10.7%. Fiscal 2022 revenue up $2.26 billion increased 20% from the prior year and with non-GAAP operating margin of 10.3% for the year, we generated $6.13 in non-GAAP earnings per share, an increase of 31% from a year ago, reflecting strong execution throughout the year. Still, we managed to achieve revenue that was at the upper end of our guidance range at $587.9 million, representing 15% growth from a year ago and 4% growth from the third quarter. With improving margins, our bottom line grew faster than the top line, with non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.68, which was $0.09 above the top end of our guidance range, and 28% increase from a year ago and 12% increase from Q3. Revenue from product rated at speeds of 400 gig or more was $178.9 million, up 34% from a year ago but down 5% from Q3, as the supply constraint impact increased on some of these products in the quarter. Within non-optical communications automotive revenue reached a record $56 million, up 5% from last quarter assisted by improvement in supply availability. Industrial laser revenue was $37.2 million, down 5% sequentially, but remaining stable with trends over the last two years. Alex Henderson, your line is open. Tim Savageaux, your line is open.
