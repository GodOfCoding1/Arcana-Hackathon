    "content": " Looking at revenue in little more detail, optical communications represented 80% of total revenue at $450.8 million up 5% from the first quarter. By technology, Silicon Photonics products increased 16% sequentially to $157 million, or 28% of total revenue; a new record. Non-optical communications revenue was $115.9 million, essentially flat from the first quarter. Within non-optical automotive revenue was $47 million down 3% from last quarter, and industrial laser revenue of $35.6 million decreased 5%. So the question really is, when you talk about $30 million to $35 million, that's firm orders for the current quarter, that doesn't reflect anything that might be in the backlog on the systems basis at the OEMs that are ultimately the end users of the product."
