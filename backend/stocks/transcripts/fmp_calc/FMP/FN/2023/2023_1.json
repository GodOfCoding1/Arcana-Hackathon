    "content": " Revenue in the quarter about $655.4 million, and represent a strong year-over-year and sequential growth even after backing out the approximately $20 million contribution from the additional week in the first quarter. Growth in non-optical communications was driven primarily from automotive revenue of $86.8 million, up 80% from a year ago and up 55% from last quarter. The second one I did sort of adjust your fiscal first quarter revenue for the extra week, the $20 million that you said. So I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m just wondering, like if you can talk to the sustainability of the non-optical revenue in the quarter is it that you had supply improvement and pulled through a lot of backlog, which is somewhat limiting, sort of the sequential improvement that we see \u00e2\u0080\u0093 sort of sequential growth that we see into 2Q. So as you mentioned, if you back out the extra $20 million from our Q1 revenue year-on-year, you would see about 17% growth in Q1 versus last year."
