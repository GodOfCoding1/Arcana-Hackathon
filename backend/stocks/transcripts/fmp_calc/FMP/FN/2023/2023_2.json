    "content": " In aggregates, the revenue impact of supply constraints during the second quarter was approximately $20 million, a little smaller than anticipated. Our team executed very well in the second quarter, delivering non-GAAP operating margins of 10.9% setting a new quarterly performance record, including the impact of an $0.11 foreign currency loss, non-GAAP EPS of $1.90 was in the upper end of our guidance and would have been well above the range or it not for the foreign exchange impact. Our foreign currency hedging program continues to dampen the impact of FX fluctuation on operating margins, but our bottom-line results were negatively impacted by foreign exchange  (ph) loss of $3.9 million or $0.11 per share in the second quarter. Within optical telecom revenue was $392.9 million, which was up 11% from a year ago, but a decline of 3% from the first quarter, primarily due to increased supply constraints for certain commodity semiconductors used in these products. The impacted telecom products are also primarily newer, faster speed rated products and as a result revenue from products rated at 400 gig or more also declined 11% sequentially to $173.6 million. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open."
