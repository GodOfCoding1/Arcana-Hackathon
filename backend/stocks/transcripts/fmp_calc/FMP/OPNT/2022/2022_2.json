    "content": " On our last earnings call, our Chief Scientific Officer, Dr. Phil Skolnick explained the full set of PD and PK results and OPNT003 is apparent fast action, strength and long duration is well max to address overdoses from illicit synthetic opioids, in particular fentanyl. $4.8 million increase was primarily due to increase in activity on our lead product OPNT003 nasal nalmefene for opioid overdose, as well as personnel and noncash stock-based compensation expense. But in fact, what's within that onset of action, what really makes a big difference is binding affinity, on a molecular level, how hard, how tight the opioid antagonists can bind to the Mu opioid receptor which drives breathing, that's a real key consideration, which is why higher affinity agents, we believe so much more needed today, because of fentanyl having such high affinity the Mu opioid receptor when we compare it to our data, older opioid such as heroin et cetera. And with the high doses of naltrexone that we're delivering in that in that very short timeframe, we are also -- we also believe we have the potential to block what's called the Delta opioid receptors, which are particularly implicated in alcohol use disorder. Yes, and then a follow-up to that is, again given the rapid onset of action, the comparative -- favorable comparison with respect to reversing respiratory depression and longer half-life with 11, I believe it's 11.2 hours, it seems pretty straightforward or logical to think that the public interest markets would adopt 003 as a first line therapeutic right way, I mean, it would be almost unethical not to do so, is that something you would agree with?"
