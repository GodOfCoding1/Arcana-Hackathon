    "content": " We are maintaining our disposition guidance range of $200 million to $300 million this year, and expect our disposition cap rate for the year to be between 4.5% and 5.0%. As part of our underwriting, cost of capital as an input that's in our underwriting model, inclusive of debt costs, forward interest rates, our stock price and because of that, our hurdle rates naturally increase, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, price discovery in this market is real. So you guys adjusted your expected cap rate on acquisitions with your guidance update, but I didn't see any mention of expected pricing on dispositions, which you guys had previously indicated would be around 4.5%. I would say, generally, what we're seeing is anywhere from 25 to 75 basis points in cap rates, in some of our stronger markets with lower vaults, and you've got market rent increasing at a faster pace."
