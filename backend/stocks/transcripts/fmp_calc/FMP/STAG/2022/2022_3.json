    "content": " We have addressed 45% of next year's expected leasing, approximately 6 million square feet, achieving 27% cash re-leasing spreads. But as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, I mean, leasing 45% of our projected leasing 6 million square feet out of approximately $13 million for next year at 27% cash rollover leasing spreads, I mean that's pretty strong fundamentals. I think as a third quarter, you had spreads of 19% and 9% for new and renewal next year's kind of 27% blended. As you noted, it went from 5.4 in place and we're going to stabilize that at what we're looking at today at the 6.6, and generally, our market rent growth assumptions have been -- we've been outperforming those over the years. There's a lot of components with respect to same-store including average downtimes, average occupancy, rollover rents, which we've noted and talked about on the call today being -- taken care of 45% of our rents next year at 27% rollover as well as tenant credit and credit loss."
