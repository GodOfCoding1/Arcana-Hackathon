    "content": " Our 2023 guidance range for cash same-store growth is 4.5% to 5%, anchored by weighted average rental escalators of approximately 2.5%, pretention of 70% at the midpoint of our guidance range and cash leasing spreads ranging between 25% to 30% on approximately 13.7 million square feet of projected leasing for the year. Please proceed with your question. I mean, has it been a mix issue so far this year that's been driving the rent spreads above 30% and what you guys kind of have in your sites for the remaining 40-ish% of leases is different markets or different spaces. Please proceed with your question. Please proceed with your question. Please proceed with your question. I think Bill made the important point there that, one of the biggest building blocks of our guidance for this year are the weighted average escalators across the portfolio, today Those sit at 2.5%. Please proceed with your question. Please proceed with your question. Please proceed with your question. Please proceed with your question. Please proceed with your question."
