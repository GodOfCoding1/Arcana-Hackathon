But that\u2019s we\u2019re probably looking at least five years out before we start to see that, but higher return businesses, we want to make sure we\u2019re doing the right acquisitions and we\u2019re growing it and getting the right returns, which we\u2019ve got line of sight to getting our margins back to where they need to be in both of those segments and feel really good about the prospects for going forward. And then on the used truck side, we said we expect to be flat to up on pricing for the year, again strong in the first half, potentially pricing slowing down in the second half, but net for the full year, certainly flat to up, because we\u2019re at such a high level now even relative to the average of where we were this year."
