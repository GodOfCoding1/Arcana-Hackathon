    "content": " Shifting to the end markets and starting with mobile, the industry-wide inventory correction in smartphones coupled with softer consumer demand in China continued to play out as expected, resulting in lower mobile revenue in the fourth quarter. Combined with two consecutive years of roughly 20% growth, the current consensus among these customers has been to moderate their orders and expectations entering 2023 until they have better visibility into the global macro trends and end market demand More specific to Pixelworks in the fourth quarter, I'm pleased to report that the team successfully completed a significant milestone on our co-development project with our largest projector customer. What we're trying to get these China mobile OEMs to do is take this expertise and differentiation that they've built into their China models, which is unique and market it internationally because that's what differentiates them in many of these international markets because, who they butt up against in the international markets, and I'm talking about Android, they butt up against Samsung. We were already spending a lot of time trying to cultivate more theatrical content because more theatrical content becomes a pool of content for distribution to home entertainment and I would say that the release of Way of the Water put all of our technology put high frame rate 3D out in thousands of theaters globally with there's some people that review it and don't like it, but they're minor."
