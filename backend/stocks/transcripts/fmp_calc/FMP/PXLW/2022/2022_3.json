    "content": " Despite inflationary cost pressure throughout the year and our mobile growth contributing to an increasing portion of our total business, we've maintained healthy gross margins that were at 50% in the third quarter. As expected, mobile business was down sequentially from the record quarter revenue we posted in the second quarter, primarily reflecting the start of a broadly acknowledged inventory correction in smartphones and weaker consumer demand in China. Our topline results for the quarter were driven by a combination of continued strong year-over-year growth and our mobile business and sustained custom more demand in our Projector business, with Projector revenue once again reaching the highest quarterly level since the onset of the pandemic. The breakdown of revenue in the third quarter was as follows; revenue from Mobile increased more than 25% year-over-year to approximately $6 million, which represented just over 34% of total revenue in the third quarter. I can let Haley answer that, but I don't think I'm going to break out exactly how much it is, but she'll give you I think--\n Yes, I think for Video Delivery revenue in the fourth quarter, you can expect it to increase over 100%."
