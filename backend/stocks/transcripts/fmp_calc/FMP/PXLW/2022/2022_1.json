The year-over-year increase was driven by strong growth across all of the company's target end markets, highlighted by the ongoing recovery in the projector market and continued expansion of design wins and customers in the mobile market. Non-GAAP gross profit margin was 53.2% in the first quarter of 2022 compared to 55% in the fourth quarter of 2021, which benefited from higher licensing revenue from mobile software solutions and compared to 43.7% in the first quarter of 2021.
