    "content": " We achieved record fourth quarter net sales, leading to record full year net sales of $2.8 billion, an increase of 15% from 2021. In our North America On-Highway end markets, strong demand and share gains in Class 6, 7, Class 8 straight and Class 8 day cab markets led to net sales $1.4 billion, a 15% increase from 2021. Also driving top line increases in our outside North America On-Highway end market, the South America region saw a 38% increase in net sales year-over-year, led by front engine bus and wheel defense markets. The increase in year-over-year results was led by a 19% increase in the North American On-Highway end market, driven by the continued strength in customer demand for last mile delivery, regional haul and vocational trucks. Year-over-year results were also improved by a 24% increase in net sales in the outside North America On-Highway end market, leading to record quarterly and full year revenue, driven by the continued execution of growth initiatives in Europe, Asia and South America. Finally, a 9% increase in net sales in the service parts, support equipment and other end market, principally driven by price increases on certain products also contributed to the year-over-year increase in Allison's fourth quarter net sales. For 2023, Allison expects net sales to be in the range of $2.825 billion PAUSE to $2.925 billion, reflecting continued strength in demand in all of our end markets, price increases on certain products and the continued execution of growth initiatives, leading to another record net sales year."
