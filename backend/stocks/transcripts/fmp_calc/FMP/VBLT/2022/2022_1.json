    "content": " As set forth in our press release, forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that may affect the company's business and prospects, including those discussed in our filings with the SEC, which include, among other things, our annual report on Form 20-F and Form 6-K. Any forward-looking statements made on today's conference call speak only as of today's date, Tuesday, May 17, 2022, and the company does not intend to update any of these forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that occur after today's date. So, to summarize thus far, we had meaningful progress in 2022, including completing enrollment in the OVAL Phase 3 registration enabling trial, and we are on track for top line results in the second half of the year. Based on our current projections, we expect that this cash position will be sufficient to fund planned operating expenses and capital expenditures for at least 12 months from the date of the readout of top line PFS data from the Phase 3 OVAL trial, which we anticipate receiving in the second half of 2022. You may proceed with your question. You may proceed with your question. You may proceed with your question. You may proceed with your question."
