    "content": " Adjusted operating income was $371 million or 17.2% of revenue for the quarter, up 200 basis points from $338 million or 15.2% of revenue in the same period last year as our growth and expense discipline combined to enhance our profitability in the period. HWC\u2019s operating margin expanded 110 basis points to 20.7% in the first quarter, driven primarily by strong operating leverage from our growth. Excluding a headwind from a book of business gain on sale that was recorded in the prior comparable period, Risk and Broking\u2019s organic revenue growth was 2%. Excluding headwinds from prior year book of business sales, North America led CRB\u2019s growth, where colleague retention rates at senior levels have continued to show significant improvement. Risk and Broking\u2019s organic growth has trailed industry averages, primarily due to elevated colleague departures and reduced hiring during the period when the business combination was pending, 2 factors that we believe are now behind us. And I was wondering if you can -- just on the historical experience you\u2019ve had with Willis Towers Watson, if you could talk about what the levels of hiring and attrition are relative to kind of historical levels that you\u2019d normally see in kind of the first quarter, just to give us some context on a longer-term basis."
