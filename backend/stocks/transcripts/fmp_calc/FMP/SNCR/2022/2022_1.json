    "content": " In the first quarter, invoiced Cloud revenue increased 6.4% year-to-year to $36 million. We expect this growth to accelerate in future quarters, driving continued improvement in our cash flow as subscribers continue to grow, new customers come online and the impact of the legacy Mobile Content Transfer business is behind us. Total revenue in the first quarter increased 1% to $65.9 million from $65.5 million in the prior year period, marking the third straight quarter with year-over-year improvement. Gross profit in the first quarter increased 11% to $41 million, 62.3% of total revenue, from $36.9 million, 56.3% of total revenue, in the comparable year-ago period. Importantly, after adjusting for the pending asset sale in Digital and with the CCMI termination firmly behind Messaging, the revenue for both these businesses is expected to remain stable to growing going forward on a sequential basis from first quarter levels. No, we are seeing growth in the Cloud business and we are expecting to see some solid subscriber growth in the Cloud business driving the Cloud revenue into the second quarter, which will more than compensate for the drop off in the digital revenue related to the asset sale."
