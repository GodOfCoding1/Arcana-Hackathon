    "content": " Underpinning this solid revenue growth is increasing subscriber adoption of our cloud product at existing customers and from successful launches of new operators, which led to 18% year-over-year subscriber growth for the second quarter in a row. Financially, this quarter demonstrated our ability to deliver strong profitability metrics as we achieved unadjusted free cash flow of positive $3.6 million, adjusted free cash flow of positive $6.7 million, and recorded a $5.3 million in net income, which was a vast improvement from our $23.9 million loss in the prior year period. Invoice Cloud revenue, which is a proxy for cash revenue and the best indicator of our Cloud growth increased 10.3% year-over-year to $37.4 million in the second quarter. Looking at revenue by product, cloud revenue of $43.5 million was up 12% on a year-over-year basis and increased to 67% of total revenue in 2022, up from 54% in 2021. We expect continued growth of invoice cloud revenue in future quarters driving improvement in our cash flow, as subscribers continue to grow and new customers come online. Total revenue in the second quarter decreased 9%, or $6.3 million to $65.2 million from $71.5 million in the prior year. The $9 million improvement in operating income was a result of increased high margin cloud revenue, reduced SG&A expenses, greater efficiency of R&D resources and other cost savings initiatives implemented throughout the year. This takes into consideration the impacts from the approximate $2 million of revenue recognized prior to the divestiture of the DXP and Activation assets in the second quarter and not repeating in the third quarter and recognition of approximately $4 million in deferred non-cash revenue from the cloud business, which will also not repeat in the third quarter."
