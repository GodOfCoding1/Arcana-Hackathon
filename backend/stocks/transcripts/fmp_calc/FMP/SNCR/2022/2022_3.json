    "content": " Our continued cloud growth, coupled with focus on profitability, has brought about solid cash flow improvement with adjusted free cash flow coming in at a positive $2.8 million, a $6.6 million increase from the prior year period. As I highlighted, invoice cloud revenue, essentially a proxy for cash revenue and the best indicator of our cloud growth increased 6.8% year-over-year to $37.8 million in the third quarter. Additionally, invoiced cloud revenue, which more clearly illustrates the growth of our core cloud business, grew 6.8% during the third quarter. Cloud revenue of $38.6 million was down 11% on a year-over-year basis and increased to 64% of total revenue in the third quarter of 2022, up from 62% in the same period in 2021 and was down 67% in Q2. We expect continued growth of invoiced cloud revenue in future quarters, driving improvements in cash flow as subscribers continue to grow and new customers come online."
