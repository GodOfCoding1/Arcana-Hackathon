    "content": " In 2022, favorable market conditions combined with these strategic priorities contributed to us achieving one of the best annual financial performances in our history, in terms of net sales, earnings per share, adjusted EBITDA and operating cash flow, even as market conditions began to decline late into the year. We also generated a record $400 million in operating cash flows, of which approximately $170 million was allocated during the year to acquire Vandermeer Forest Products for $67 million, make capital investments that improve the effectiveness for our distribution facilities and fleet, and acquire 9% of our outstanding shares under our share repurchase programs. Adjusted EBITDA for the 12 months was $478 million, up 3% year-over-year or 10.7% of net sales. Through the first seven weeks of 2023, specialty products gross margin was in the range of 18% to 19% with daily sales volumes down approximately 15% compared to prior year, reflecting the challenging macro environment. Gross profit was $27 million, a decline of 50% year-over-year, also primarily resulting from lower commodity prices, and gross margin was 10.4% as compared to 16.1% in the prior year period. As of the end of the year, lumber prices were down to around $380 per thousand board foot and panel prices declined to about 473 per thousand square foot, a 23% and 21% decrease respectively compared to the start of the fourth quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was $63 million or 7.4% of net sales, a strong result given current market conditions. We ended the year with $484 million of inventory, down 10% sequentially from the third quarter as we continue to manage buying decisions and adjust overall inventory levels to market conditions."
