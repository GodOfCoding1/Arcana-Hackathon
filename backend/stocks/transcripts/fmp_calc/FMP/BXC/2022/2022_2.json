    "content": " In Q2, we delivered our third highest quarter ever in three key metrics, with diluted EPS of $7.48 per share, adjusted EBITDA of $112 million and $101 million of operating cash. Gross profit was $201 million and gross margin was 16.3% for the quarter, and over 85% of our gross profit was from specialty product sales. This growth was primarily driven by our disciplined value based pricing offset partially by a modest decline in volume as compared to the second quarter of 2021, which is a difficult comparison given the exceptionally strong demand for building products the industry experienced during this period last year. Thus far in the third quarter through the first four weeks of July, daily volumes for structural products were trending up slightly higher than second quarter levels, and structural gross margin was in the range of 18% to 19%. In closing, we delivered our best first half on record with $2.5 billion in sales and $314 million of adjusted EBITDA, representing 9% sales growth and 15% adjusted EBITDA growth over a very strong first half of 2021. I would echo Dwight's comments and just add to that, that we continue to do analysis that supports the numbers that I've mentioned in the past that we think that 19% to 20% specialty margin is a good margin to think of a normalized margin in a relative downturn environment, and which I think is the macro and that we're looking at right now."
