    "content": " Over the past six quarters, we've averaged net sales growth of 39%, adjusted EBITDA of $117 million, and adjusted EBITDA margins of 10.5%. Through April, specialty products gross margin was in the range of 23% to 24% and sales volumes have stayed consistent with first quarter levels. As we invest for growth, we\u2019ll evaluate both organic and acquisition opportunities that yield a risk adjusted return above our weighted average cost of capital and are consistent with our strategy to increase our mix of higher specialty products."
