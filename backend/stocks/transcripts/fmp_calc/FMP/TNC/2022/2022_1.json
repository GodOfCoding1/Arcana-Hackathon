    "content": " For the first quarter of 2022, Tennant reported net sales of $258.1 million, a 2% decline compared to the prior year, primarily due to an unfavorable foreign exchange effect of 2.2% as well as the divestiture of the Coatings business. Net sales in the Americas were $160.3 million for the first quarter of 2022, an increase of 1.6% from the first quarter of 2021. EMEA net sales were $78.7 million for the first quarter of 2022, a decrease of 2.7% from the first quarter of 2021. APAC net sales were $19.1 million for the first quarter of 2022, a decrease of 22.4% in the first quarter of 2021. In the first quarter of 2022 cash flow used in operations was approximately $10.1 million, which reflects incremental investments in working capital, specifically $29 million of inventory due to rising costs and an increase in inventory levels related to safety stocks and long lead time components. In the first quarter of 2022, we temporarily increased debt outstanding by approximately $14 million and we ended the quarter with net leverage of 1.3 times adjusted EBITDA, which is lower than our stated goal of 1.5 times to 2.5 times."
