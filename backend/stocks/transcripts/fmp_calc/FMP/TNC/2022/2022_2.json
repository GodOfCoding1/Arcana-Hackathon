    "content": " We see robust demand for our innovative products and services as well as growth in many of our end markets, but supply chain challenges and specifically parts availability have constrained our ability to increase production. While inflationary pressures, constrained production volumes and foreign currency headwinds have impacted second quarter margins, our adjusted EBITDA and EBITDA margins are stabilizing and the actions we are taking to increase production provide a foundation for further improvement in the balance of the year. With regard to our secondary of focus, pricing strategies and cost discipline, we have successfully executed pricing increases over the last 12 months that will drive sequential improvement in net sales and gross margin over the next two quarters. For the second quarter of 2022, Tennant reported net sales of $280.2 million, a 0.4% increase compared to the prior year."
