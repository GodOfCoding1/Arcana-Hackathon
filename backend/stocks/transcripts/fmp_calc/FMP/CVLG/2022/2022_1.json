    "content": " With this strong start to the year and the hard work of our team transforming our business to a less cyclical model, we are confident that we will exceed 2021's full-year adjusted earnings per share for the full year of 2022, absent something truly unexpected. Well, I just think first thing is the spot market on the truck side 1% I mean it's very small on the truck side of the business. I guess, when you think about maybe what we saw in the first quarter, how do you break that down between maybe what's more longer term maybe sustained improvement in the contribution from TEL relative to maybe some gains that could be flowing through there. But I believe that we're still happy with what's going on and second quarter's a big quarter from a pricing standpoint, but it's not as big as it used to be for us because our dedicated kind of happens throughout the year if you will."
