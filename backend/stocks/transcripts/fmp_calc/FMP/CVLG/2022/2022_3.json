    "content": " In the right before COVID chapter, they were digesting a transaction that ate up a lot of earnings, and so they were making really good money but they made a decision--collectively we made a decision that had some negative earnings and some tail to it to get out of it on a transaction, and then once that transaction, caught during the COVID times, gets fully out of their system, and the way equipment, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m going to call it, has been rationed the last few years, but they had been on just a massive growth spree in buying trucks and trailers, and the way all these OEMs have worked is, you know, basically it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an average of how many you bought the last three years, two years, five years, and so they were able to add significant amounts of trucks and trailers 18 months ago, 12 months ago, three weeks ago, and into next year with these orders, so it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s allowed them to place a lot--it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s allowed them to continue to grow."
