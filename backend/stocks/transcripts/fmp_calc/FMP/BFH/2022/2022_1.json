    "content": " Total noninterest expenses increased 6% from the first quarter of 2021, largely due to increased employee compensation and benefits costs as we continue to invest in digital talent and technology modernization as well as higher volume-related staffing levels. Overall, income from continuing operations was down 21% for the quarter, driven by a provision expense of $193 million this quarter versus $33 million in the first quarter of 2021, while pretax pre provision earnings, or PPNR, improved 24% year-over-year, as you can see on the graph on the right of the page. Lastly, on the bottom right-hand side of the page, our revolving credit risk distribution remains in line with our expectations as the temporary impact of government stimulus abated in the quarter, from improved risk mix versus pre-pandemic levels and associated delinquency and losses are the result of our ongoing thoughtful management of our book and more balanced product mix. I'm just curious if you're going to sort of let us in on some of the data points that you're -- you and your team are looking at in terms of gauging consumer and health, and then sort of what the playbook would actually be if, in fact, we're headed in that direction because you guys are seeing pretty good growth right now. As I think about our core model, probably the rate would have come down, but then through qualitative overlays in the judgment like you mentioned, that degree of uncertainty of what's happened with inflation and what that means just that -- let's keep a conservative posture for this quarter."
