    "content": " Okay, well just--you know, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s kind of a sad moment to miss a dynamic independent growing company that had been anticipating $250 million in sales in the next three, four year, possible expansions in India and Europe, and last we heard was looking at making some small accretive acquisitions. I know that Mr. Lynn has stated that they used a conservative valuation that represented a 20% premium, and I think Mr. Lynn\u00e2\u0080\u0099s thinking might be a little off because back in March of 2021 when they were looking to do an IPO, they said that the street inadequately valued Leonardo and they pulled their acquisition, and I contend that this same type of valuation disconnect is right in the middle of RADA\u00e2\u0080\u0099s growth plans. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know what the board can do at this particular time, but I would consider this valuation coming off a continuing resolution, looking for substantial growth going out the next three, four years, I think it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just unacceptable and if you have any comments that might opine, that you were shopping the company and this was the best offer you could get, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t understand this but my ears are open."
