    "content": " I have only addressed the US market until now, but as I explained in January at our analyst event and webinar, the rest of the world, which I divide into the Near East Europe/NATO countries and the Indian subcontinent should reach based on our estimation, revenue levels similar to the USA within three to four years and recent events have only made us more confident in this expectation. In terms of geographic breakout expectations of our full year revenues to remind you what we discussed in January, we expect the US market to be about $90 million in revenues, while about 90% of our guidance are already incorporated in the defense budget line items and some already in our backlog. And if we were to add $9 million or so, based on our estimation for the first quarter and actually the street consensus, which estimated $31 million, gross margins and cash generation would have been in-line with our expectations. Beyond what I discussed with you only four months ago, the rest of the world has just had a strong waking up call with the unexpected war in Ukraine, and we believe this will translate to upside in the orders over the coming years, similar to the strong growth we experienced in the US in recent years. We reported an adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter of $1.3 million, which is 6% of revenues versus adjusted EBITDA of $4.8 million or 19% of revenues in the first quarter of last year. I would like to further add that as an additional $9 million of revenues for the street consensus that were shifted to the coming quarters, as explained by Dubi, has actually been delivered in the quarter, our gross margin, operating income and adjusted EBITDA would have been pretty similar to our Q4 numbers."
