    "content": " Our strong performance in the quarter was a result of several factors, including commercial execution leading to expanded extract utilization within our installed base, conversion of additional Pharos excimer lasers customers to our platform and continued growth in equipment sales, particularly in international markets. In the first quarter of 2022, we had 162 high volume accounts that contributed $2.4 million or 48% of the total gross domestic recurring revenues. Revenues for the first quarter of 2022 were $7 million, a 21% increase over the first quarter of 2021. Considering headwinds from Omicron, our first quarter revenue was driven by continued focus on driving usage with XTRAC partners and strong equipment sales internationally to start the new year. Recurring revenues in the first quarter were $5.1 million, an increase -- an 8% increase over the first quarter of 2021. Equipment revenues for the first quarter were $1.9 million, a 72% increase as compared to $1.1 million for the first quarter of 2021. For the first quarter of 2022, non-GAAP gross domestic recurring billings was $5 million, an 8% increase as compared to $4.6 million in the first quarter of 2021. Net loss for the first quarter of 2022 was $2.5 million or a loss of $0.07 per basic and diluted common share as compared to the net loss for the first quarter of 2021 of $2.4 million, or a loss of $0.07 per basic and diluted common share. As we laid out in our last quarter's earnings call, we continue to expect full year 2022 revenues to be in the range of $33 million to $35 million, representing strong double-digit growth."
