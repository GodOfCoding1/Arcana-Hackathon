    "content": " Our revenue for the first quarter was 11% higher than the comparable pre-COVID quarter in 2019 and included $69 of ancillary revenue per passenger, 21% higher than the first quarter of 2019. Accordingly, we expect record revenue in the second quarter with RASM growth of over 20% compared to the second quarter of 2019 and continued strength in our ancillary performance leading to an expectation of a further improvement to $70 per passenger in the second quarter. As we position the airline to be a leader in the post-pandemic recovery, we are focused on balancing capacity in response to elevated fuel prices and the current demand environment to enable the airlines' return to profitability in the second quarter and full year 2022. Looking forward to the second quarter and the balance of 2022, we expect continued strength in demand and resulting passenger yields as the travel recovery progresses and our primary focus is on returning the airline to profitability. Capacity is anticipated to grow by 10% to 12% in the second quarter versus the comparable quarter of 2019, bolstered by continued strength in ancillary revenue per passenger. As Barry mentioned, the benefit of the from the anticipated strength in demand for the balance of the year is expected to more than offset forecast fuel prices and non-fuel expenses, resulting in the company's expectation of profitability for both the second quarter and full year 2022 excluding special items.
