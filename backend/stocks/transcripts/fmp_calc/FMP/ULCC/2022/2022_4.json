    "content": " This has affected our  ancillary performance that we saw throughout 2022 with  achieving our target of $85 per passenger in the fourth quarter of 2023 as well as our long-term target of $100 per passenger by 2026.  utilization improved by approximately 25 per day over the prior quarter to 11.5 hours, on average daytime  to 1,032 miles. I mean, look, the big driving force in our business, as you know, is overcoming the fixed overhead exits and moving utilization to 11.5 hours for the full quarter as it has a big impact on unit cost metrics, if you measure CASM ex-fuel or something like that. And I think Barry talked about it earlier, like we were over $70 a passenger, a lower cost than the industry average in the last quarter, and that's moving higher as your unit costs come down."
