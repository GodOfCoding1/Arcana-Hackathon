    "content": " While public attention was largely centered on the merger, behind the scenes we realized the highest quarterly revenue in history at $909 million, 43% above the comparable 2019 quarter and a record ancillary revenue of $75 per passenger. As we look forward to the third quarter, we expect the demand environment to remain strong, with RASM growth anticipated to be over 20% versus the comparable 2019 quarter, supported by continued strength in our ancillary revenue per passenger. Revenue growth of 43% over the comparable 2019 quarter was driven by a 29% increase in RASM, from $0.0927 to $0.1197, along with a 10% increase in capacity over the 2019 quarter. As we build that capacity, our ASM growth relative to 2019 is expected to accelerate during the current quarter with capacity up 5% in July, 8% to 9% in August and 14% to 16% in September, resulting in a higher proportion of our seats being deployed in an off-peak month and creating an approximate 3% drag on RASM in the quarter. Though our CASM ex-fuel is currently elevated, we're still targeting a return to sub-$.06 during 2023 as our utilization of stage length normalized and seats per departure increased with the planned introduction of the 321neo to help mitigate inflationary pressures on the business. Adjusted nonfuel operating expenses are expected to be between $565 million to $585 million in the third quarter, the increase from the prior quarter due largely to capacity growth. As a standalone entity and potentially America's ultra-low-cost carrier, Frontier has a fantastic platform for profitable growth, underpinned by a strong balance sheet, an unmatched 321neo order book, a clear path to CASM-ex below $0.06 an exceptional ancillary performance with plenty of room to run."
