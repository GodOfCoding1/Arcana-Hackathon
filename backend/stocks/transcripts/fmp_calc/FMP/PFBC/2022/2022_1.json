    "content": " To Mr. Yu's comment earlier about the loan growth coming in lower than previous quarters and within our expectations, I think you touched on something I think we'll see throughout the year. With the M1 supply seemingly going to start shrinking when the Fed ends its QE and also starts to raise rates, we're okay with the lower level of deposit growth and then fully more utilizing the cash in the balance towards the loan portfolio. Inflation is \u2013 you really take a target, you're pre-paying for whatever their earnings are for many, many years and hope you can make it back through efficiency and combined operation, and we must be cognizant that not everyone's going to be perfectly executed. But it's safe to say, just speaking from common sales, in my past experience, in early stage inflation, there's many, many of our customers, astute customer is really trying to acquire real estate because they think over the long term and they have the holding power \u2013 they think over the long term assets is the best protection for the inflationary situation."
