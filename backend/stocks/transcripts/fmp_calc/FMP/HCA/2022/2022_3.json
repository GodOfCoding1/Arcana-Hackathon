    "content": " So, I think when you look at our non-COVID admission activity, which year-to-date has grown 3% and grown a little bit more even in the commercial business, it is actually sequentially growing third quarter to second quarter. Well, I think it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s something we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to have to see that -- the contract labor levels, we feel good about, not only the progress we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve made this year, as you know, we hovered around 9% in the early part in terms of contract labor percent of SWB down to 7%. I think the outpatient of revenue last year was busy during the Delta COVID -- the Delta surge and inpatient capacity was being managed and constrained and potentially, we saw more activity in outpatient of second quarter last year."
