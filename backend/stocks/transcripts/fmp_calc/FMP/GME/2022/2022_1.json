    "content": " Before going over this past quarter's initiatives and results, I also want to once again thank our team for continuing to bring strong focus and intensity to our mission. This will remain key as we pursue sustained sales growth, establish broader offerings in consumer electronics and launch new products aligned to the long-term future of gaming. During Q1, we specifically focused on two main areas: continuing to rebuild and strengthen our commerce business after years of underinvestment, and pursuing growth opportunities in the cryptocurrency, NFT and Web3 gaming verticals, all of which we expect to be increasingly relevant for gamers of the future. With regard to new offerings geared to the future of gaming, our blockchain team continued to drive progress when it comes to advancing new products, deepening partnerships and establishing GameStop's presence in digital asset communities. And output of these efforts was last month's launch of the GameStop Wallet, a digital asset wallet that allows gamers and others to store, send, receive and use cryptocurrencies and NFTs across decentralized apps. Taken together, we believe these investments and initiatives prioritized over the past quarter are positioning us to become a more diversified and technology-centric business. SG&A was $452.2 million or 32.8% of sales compared to $370.3 million or 29% of sales in last year's first quarter. We reported a net loss of $157.9 million or $2.08 per diluted share compared to a net loss of $66.8 million or loss per diluted share of $1.01 in the prior year's first quarter. We ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $1.04 billion, roughly $340 million higher than the end of the first quarter last year. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $10.8 million, down $3.9 million from last year's first quarter. In the first quarter, cash flow from operations was an outflow of $303.9 million compared to an outflow of $18.8 million during the same period last year. This does not include the impact of an additional $76.9 million received in proceeds from digital asset sales, which is included in investing activities. In order to meet customer demand and drive sales growth amidst the tight supply chain, we maintained inventory valued at $917.6 million as of the close of the quarter compared to $570.9 million at the close of the prior year's first quarter. We set out 12 months ago to accomplish something unprecedented in our industry, transform a decaying brick-and-mortar retailer into a technology-led organization that meets customers' needs through stores, through e-commerce properties and through emerging digital marketplaces and online communities. In the quarters and years ahead, we're going to continue embracing change, putting the customer first and focusing on long-term stockholder value."
