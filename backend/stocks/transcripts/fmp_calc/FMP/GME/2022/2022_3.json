    "content": " Similar to last quarter, I'm going to spend some time at the outset of this call, recapping where we've been, where we are now and where we're looking to go. This translated to building a strong balance sheet, modernizing a crumbling infrastructure, and putting together teams that are now able to operate with the nimbleness and efficiency our stockholders and customers expect. Now that the necessary investments have been made and we have identified the aforementioned opportunity set, we're going to be very judicious with respect to how we allocate capital to the core business. We stand to benefit from our strong cash position, lack of debt, healthy inventory mix, shrinking cost structure and disciplined focus on categories where we have competitive positioning. SG&A was $387.9 million or 32.7% of sales compared to $421.5 million or 32.5% of sales, in last year's third quarter. We've also taken additional steps in recent weeks to further reduce SG&A on a go-forward basis, now that significant improvements have been made to the core business. We reported a net loss of $94.7 million or $0.31 per diluted share compared to a net loss of $105.4 million or $0.35 in the prior year's third quarter. We ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $1.042 billion. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $13 million, up $0.5 million from last year's third quarter. In the third quarter, cash flow provided by operations was $177.3 million compared to an outflow of $293.7 million during the same period last year. We're seeking to transform a legacy brick-and-mortar business that was on the brink of bankruptcy into a retailer that meets customers' needs through our stores, e-commerce properties and emerging sales channels."
