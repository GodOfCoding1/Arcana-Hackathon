    "content": " Financially, we delivered third quarter revenue of 2.5 billion, a 14% increase over the third quarter of 2021; adjusted EBIT of 487 million, up 22% year-over-year and adjusted EBITDA of 608 million. Third quarter 2022 adjusted EBIT increased $87 million over the prior year, reaching $487 million and all three segments delivered year-over-year EBIT growth. EBIT for the quarter was $126 million, up $25 million from the same period a year ago, resulting from positive price and favorable mix, which were partially offset by accelerating inflation and the impact of lower volumes. Starting with inflation, we expect revenue growth of approximately 10% versus prior year, driven by a combination of continued price appreciation, partially offset by the ongoing impact of currency headwinds and slightly lower overall volumes. In the fourth quarter, we expect revenues to be relatively flat year-over-year, as price realization and the impact of recent acquisitions are offset by lower volumes, similar to what we saw in Q3, as well as currency headwinds continuing to accelerate and the exit of the DUCS product line. We've also built an incredibly strong balance sheet and plan to leverage our financial strength as great companies do to continue to invest to strengthen the long-term performance of the company through a balanced capital allocation strategy focused on organic growth and productivity investments, acquisitions which leverage our unique material science, manufacturing and market expertise, and returning at least 50% of free cash flow to shareholders over time, through dividends and share repurchases. Mike, your line is open. Mike, your line is open."
