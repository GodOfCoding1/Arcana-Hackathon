    "content": " Earnings expansion, along with continued discipline around management of working capital, operating expenses and capital investments, resulted in strong free cash flow of $361 million for the quarter while beginning to replenish historically low inventory levels. Capital additions for the second quarter were $105 million or 4% of revenue, up $12 million from 2021 as we return to more normal capital spending while we continue prioritizing investments that drive growth and productivity. For the quarter, EBIT was $258 million, up $24 million from the prior year as we continued to service the strong market demand, along with positive pricing more than offsetting accelerating inflation from asphalt, other material and delivery costs. And I think the actual number is -- the $30 million that you see in the Q is probably a little bit closer to the first half number, but we did see somewhere between $16 million and $20 million in the second quarter itself. And as we've talked about the last several quarters on this call, the housing in the U.S. has been underbuilt for so many years that I think that there's going to be continued strong demand and requirements for new construction as we go forward. So we think that we've really driven good operational cost improvements in Insulation through productivity, through automation, through these network changes that if and when a slowdown comes, we think that we are going to be able to produce very good results and stronger margins than the last time we would have seen some volume declines in the business."
