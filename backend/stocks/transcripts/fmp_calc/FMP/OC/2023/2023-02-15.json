    "content": " These results were driven by our team's strong execution in a number of areas to offset inflation, manage needed production and maintenance downtimes and capitalize on the available market opportunity as volumes declined in most of our product lines as customers adjusted to slowing demand and managed end-of-year inventory levels. Earnings expansion, along with continued discipline around management of working capital, operating expenses and capital investments, resulted in strong free cash flow of $535 million for the quarter, bringing full year free cash flow to $1.3 billion, up $227 million from 2021. For the full year, Insulation net sales increased 17% to $3.7 billion compared with 2021 as a result of higher selling prices and favorable mix more than offsetting ongoing currency headwinds and slightly lower volumes. EBIT increased $166 million to $612 million with 16% EBIT margins on higher selling prices which offset energy, material and transportation inflation, planned production downtime and other manufacturing costs. Sales for the quarter were $589 million, down modestly compared to the prior year as lower volumes and continued headwinds from currency translation were largely offset by higher selling prices. For the quarter, EBIT was $168 million, up $17 million with positive price partially offset by ongoing inflation, the impact of other manufacturing costs and lower volumes. For the full year, Roofing sales increased 14% to $3.7 billion compared with 2021 primarily due to higher selling prices, partially offset by lower volumes. We've also built an incredibly strong balance sheet and plan to leverage our financial strength, as great companies do, to continue investing to strengthen the long-term performance of the company through a balanced capital allocation strategy focused on organic growth and productivity investments; acquisitions which leverage our unique material science, manufacturing and market expertise; and returning approximately 50% of free cash flow to shareholders over time through dividends and share repurchases."
