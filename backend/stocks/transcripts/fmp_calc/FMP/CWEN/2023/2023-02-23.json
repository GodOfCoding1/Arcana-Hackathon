    "content": " In summary, Clearway continues to execute its growth plans, so that's well-positioned to fully deploy the thermal proceeds during 2024 and continue to grow beyond the $2.15 of CAFD per share. We achieved year-over-year DPS growth at the high-end of our target, adding capacity contract length at El Segundo and have visibility into deploying 100% of the Thermal access capital and to drop down assets and acquisitions to provide greater certainty around our $2.15 line of sight CAFD per share goal. But I think for us, the fundamental characteristics that we saw that underpinned our estimates were, a, good natural gas price, which has been maintained at the Citygate; b, our assets are still needed for the  , which we definitely don't see going away here in the near-term in terms of their ability to fast start and load pockets and see overall, sort of very robust, kind of overall load growth in terms of California as well with electrification of vehicles and the like."
