    "content": " Adjusted EBITDA increased $8 million or 2%, though adjusted EBITDA margin declined 180 basis points to 14.7%, as we continue to work through the impact of labor issues that we experienced early in the quarter. Favorable comparisons to last year's second quarter which had the impact of winter weather and ransomware event, also benefited adjusted EBITDA by $63 million year-over-year. During the quarter, we generated $213 million in adjusted free cash flow, up significantly from the previous year's levels, as last year was negatively impacted by the ransomware incident. So as we think about sort of the back half of the year, sequentially we're expecting about $130 million of incremental flow-through from previously published pricing. The second point is you'll hear from Pete during our Investor Day next week all of the actions that we're taking within the business to improve both the local mix which will have a significant margin impact, as well as the manufacturing efficiency of the assets which will get us much closer to something, I think, more exciting from a margin standpoint. But -- I think you've kind of answered the point, Adam, is I think we're seeing as, \"hey, a strategy of let's do a lot of M&A, lever the company and focus on free cash flow\" where we're now pivoting to, we're going to get return on invested capital, we're going to drive margin expansion, we're going to take out some SG&A and we're going to drive productivity."
