For the full year ended December 31, 2022, Hudson reported revenue of $325.2 million, an increase of 69% compared to revenues of $192.7 for a full year of 2021. During the fourth quarter of 2022, the Company paid down an incremental $10 million of term loan debt resulting from improved performance and increased cash flow, reducing its leverage ratio to 0.34 times to 1 for the trailing 12 months ended December 31, 2022, declining significantly from a leverage ratio of 1.93 to 1 for the trailing 12 months ended December 31, 2021. In the third quarter, reporting, we noted that in the latter part, like say September of last year, prices started to decline from, let's say a high, generally speaking, HFCs as a category around $14 a pound to around $12."
