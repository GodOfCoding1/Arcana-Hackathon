    "content": " While we continue to believe gross margin performance for the full year will moderate due to increases in inventory costs and anticipated stabilization in sales prices during the balance of the season, with our visibility today, we now believe full year blended gross margin will be at least in the mid-40% range. Assuming further HFC price increases related to HFC phasedown and applying a slower pace to price increases than we saw in 2022, we are targeting an annualized revenue of greater than $400 million by 2025, with gross margins remaining above historical levels, but moderating over the next 3 years to approximately 35%."
