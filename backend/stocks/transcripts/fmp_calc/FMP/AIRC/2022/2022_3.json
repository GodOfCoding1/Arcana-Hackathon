    "content": " For example, John's continuing transformation of the AIR portfolio with average rents up 19% in two years and intentional diversification by geography and price point to target economic growth and reduce volatility. Or Keith's remarkable success managing two distinct portfolios, same-store, where revenues were up year-over-year by almost 10% and up 3.8% sequentially, continuing strong through the end of the year and managing also the acquisition portfolio where the class of '21 and sequential revenue growth of 9.2%, more than twice the growth rate of the same-store portfolio. However, we expect to grow through accretive acquisitions, while at the same time, optimizing our capital allocation, including diversification by market and price point, and continuing to improve the quality of the AIR portfolio as measured by such criteria as expected rent growth, average rents, median household income, customer credit asset age, physical condition and regulatory and political risk. In addition to property acquisitions, year-to-date, we have bought back approximately 7.2 million shares or 4.3% of shares outstanding at the beginning of the year at an average price per share of just under $40 representing a long-term IRR greater than 10%. And then looking forward at year-end without any additional property sales, but incremental share repurchases, that's expected to bump leverage up by about 1/10 of a turn, but we are committed to maintaining our leverage in that 5x to 6x range. John, your line is now open. John, your line is now open."
