    "content": " Let me begin by saying Evaxion continues exciting clinical momentum in the first quarter of 2022, progressing our lead cancer therapy towards a new Phase 2b clinical trial. We also completed recruitment for the Phase 1/2a clinical trial for our second cancer therapy, EVX-02, and we are advancing this product candidate into a dedicated Phase 2b clinical trial in patients with resectable melanoma. Also in January 2022, we completed recruitment for our Phase 1/2a clinical trial for EVX-02, advancing into a dedicated Phase 2b clinical adjuvant trial in patients with resectable melanoma. Net loss was US$5.8 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2022 or US$0.25 loss per basic and diluted share as compared to US$4.1 million, or US$0.23 loss per basic and diluted share for the quarter ended March 31, 2021. So first of all, we, of course be collecting data for our existing trials and future Phase 2b, but we\u2019re also working with different groups that are already running clinical trial, where we could get a lot faster access to that data already and that we expect to materialize during this year. So we can share interesting clinical data, what we will be sharing and already have been sharing and also will share more data around, will be the safety, immunological profiling, et cetera, and our people actually reacting to the therapy by creating a strong T-cell response, which we\u2019ve seen in patients so far."
