    "content": " As we have noted throughout the year, our wireless financials are seeing the positive benefits of multiple drivers including higher roaming revenue as global travel recovers, a larger postpaid and prepaid mobile phone subscriber base, and an overall increase in market activity, including growth in unlimited plans as Canadians return to work and school, further accelerated by immigration and an increase in foreign students and seasonal workers. Wireless adjusted EBITDA was down 1%, but up a solid 7% excluding the impact of the customer credits as we saw excellent flow through from our service revenue growth. Obviously, first quarter was very strong, second quarter as well, but if you look at the underlying EBITDA growth in the second \u00e2\u0080\u0093 in the third quarter, as well as what you're guiding to in the fourth quarter, I mean   slower top line versus what you had been seeing, I think earlier on, as well as higher OpEx. So, you are seeing us move more to investing in hard infrastructure with our capital spend both wireline and wireless yes, you've seen that capital intensity level stay up in the low-to-mid 20% range through this quarter and I expect you'll see that for some quarters to come."
