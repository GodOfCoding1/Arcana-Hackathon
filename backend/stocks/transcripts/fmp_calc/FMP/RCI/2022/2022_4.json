    "content": " Here we see opportunity improve our customer share performance, and we have confidence that our product set and in particular, internet and TV have a competitive advantage across our entire footprint and our recent heightened investments in cable will begin to yield market share growth this year. And against this backdrop of healthy growth, we expect to continue leveraging our execution momentum to drive leading share of customer growth, which will fuel robust organic growth in both total service revenue and adjusted EBITDA as you saw this morning in our full year guidance release. On this time we did the deal, we look at the Canadian population in particular, where Shaw has its primary cable markets and that growth is more than we had expected when we looked at it two years ago, owing to those factors that are driving our own cable market growth that I mentioned earlier. I think, fundamentally, if you look at Shaw communications and how it operated its wireline and its wireless business over the last few years, a significant portion of its capital spend has gone into the wireless side of that balance sheet and investing in their build out of their wireless infrastructure. Now you continue to look at our margins sitting at a strong performance there and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s actually up year-on-year, despite the increase in churn and so when you look at the fundamentals of it I would say our thinking on this is sort of real time matured so that we get the right balance and ultimately It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s net mobile phone market share that we stay focused on."
