    "content": " Lastly, while the business is performing at a very high level, and we are not seeing any fundamental change in the overall demand picture, we simply wanted to remind everyone about the 93% comparable store sales that we are facing in the current second quarter due to the government stimulus, a strong macroeconomic backdrop, and the reemergence of the consumer population that was previously sheltered during Q2 of last year. Against a backdrop of revenue increasing 25% during the quarter, the cost of labor and chemicals increased 26.6% from the first quarter of 2021 to $65.5 million, and included $1.9 million of stock-based compensation expense. Also, in line with our 25% revenue growth, other store operating expenses increased 27.4% from the first quarter of 2021 to $77.8 million, driven primarily by the increase in wash locations. And so, what we\u2019ve seen here recently, it\u2019s really - it feels like it's a combination of both, where that macro piece is having a little bit of a headwind to the retail side of the business, but we're seeing a really strong lap, and that really strong lap was even more pronounced last year on the retail side with some of the macro tailwinds that we had. So, Chris, if you look at the - on a three-year stack, since we're going to introduce a new relatively unused term, it would be about a 9% comp, which is in line with what we've historically delivered when you look at what the business has done over the last 10 years."
