    "content": " Since our beginning, over 25 years ago, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been through various economic cycles, and what we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen throughout is that in good times and in tough times is the American consumer deeply values keeping their car clean and at $10 a wash or $20 for a club membership, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s affordable, convenient and brings people joy. This, coupled with many macroeconomic outlooks, suggesting continued degradation during the second half of 2022 caused us to take a more cautious view on UWC membership growth, comparable store sales growth and total revenue in the second half of the year. And our revised outlook for the full year calls \u00e2\u0080\u0093 the full year 2022 calls for comparable store sales growth of 3% to 5%, net revenues of $860 million to $880 million and adjusted EBITDA of $268 million to $278 million. Michael, from an adjusted EBITDA margin perspective, as we have said before, this \u00e2\u0080\u0093 that mid-to-low 30% range, last year, during the first half, they were exceptionally high just given the high sales and the low variable cost nature of the business."
