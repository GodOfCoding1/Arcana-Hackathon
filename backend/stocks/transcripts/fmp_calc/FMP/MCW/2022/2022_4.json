    "content": " As we barrel into 2023, we have identified 6 pillars that will guide everything we do: number one, expand our footprint while densifying and fortressing the MSAs we are in by accelerating our greenfield development and pursuing strategic M&A; number two, introduce our new premium positioned Titanium 360 retail package and UWC program alongside our new rinse and drying systems; number three, improve our marketing and ad spend by focusing on acquiring new retail customers through more targeted data-driven outreach; number four, continue to focus on growing and strengthening our UWC member base; number five, improve the performance of our existing portfolio by reformatting and reimaging many of our existing stores while continuing to look for ways to improve speed and quality; and number six, never pulling back on the people side of our business by building our leadership bench, which in the end is one of our most distinct competitive advantages."
