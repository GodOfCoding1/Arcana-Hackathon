    "content": " And due to the equity investment that MedMen received concurrent with our transaction, it will be able to further expand this business in key markets including California, Florida, Illinois, Massachusetts, among other growth opportunities across the U.S. And there's so much Tilray can do with MedMen in Canada and learning about their retail sales and their products that can help with some of our innovation and some of our products in the Canadian and the international markets. To illustrate this, if Aphria's cost structure had been applied the legacy Tilray brands during this quarter, we believe the adjusted EBITDA for Q1 would have been closer to $17.6 million. But I think, like other LPs, and like a lot of the U.S. MSOs, if legalization doesn't happen for 18 months, 24 months, we still have lots of runway out there to grow this business and to do acquisitions in adjacent areas, whether it's spirits and alcohol, whether it's hemp, food, and CBD. And with that, we're the number 1 adult-use leader in Canada and that's with a lot of LPs, there's over 500 LPs out there, and everybody wants to stay in business, and everybody wants to bite at your ankles in regards to not all stores opened, not all the market back to place."
