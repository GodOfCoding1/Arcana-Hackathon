    "content": " During the quarter, our international revenue rose to $15.8 million from $0.3 million in the prior year quarter due to the contribution of legacy Tilray\u2019s larger international cannabis businesses as well as newly obtained business-to-business transactions. As the market grows in Canada to a $10 billion, as I\u2019ve said before, I\u2019d like to do other acquisitions in Canada and also their spirits and beverage businesses in Canada. So, that\u2019s from -- 90% of the business in Canada would be cannabis and maybe another 10% from consumer products. In the U.S., what we\u2019ve talked about is to get to $0.5 billion in consumer products in the U.S., today, we\u2019re approximately $150 million and with our current businesses, but the rest would come from upon legalization, MSOs, and we\u2019d like to, one day, own MedMen upon legalization. Now, our margins got affected this quarter by selling off some product to some distributors which Carl\u2026 So, I\u2019d like to see our margins in the high 40s, low 50s as you look at a consolidated margin between our spirits business and our cannabis business. And I think if you come back and look at -- and I was with the team last week and going through some of our new product innovation where we got coming up with Solei and RIFF and Good Supply in regards to our pre-rolls and flower, there\u2019s some pretty exciting stuff, and I think that\u2019s what\u2019s important is getting the message across on our brands. And that\u2019s kind of what we look at, how do we be part of a multistate operator that has brands already that has good growth -- good houses to grow or could we ship product in from Canada into the market in the U.S. One of the biggest costs today is building these different greenhouses and these grow facilities, and if you could eliminate that and just be able to sell into that market."
