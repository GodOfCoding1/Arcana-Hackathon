    "content": " So I think it's true for any quantum computing company that's a very first thing you do is you look to optimize the native gate fidelity, does that's kind of -- is low hanging fruit and the other thing is, it really determines with the overhead that you're going to have to do for error correction. So now the question is, we're starting to think about how can we manufacture more computers, more quantum computers and now it's the natural time to sit down and say let's work on shrinking in, let's start working more on reducing their costs in terms of their -- to manufacture, those haven't been our primary focus really up to this point and now going forward it's -- we were standing up a separate team, who is that with their sole focus is kind of going forward. Yes, these systems actually take a while to build, so we actually have been planning and developing the systems for quite some time, obviously, and I think we -- at this point, we have this Forte actually includes a few new features, one of them is the way that we address this individual items to run logic gates, the beams are actually steerable, I think Peter mentioned about that in one of the conferences at the end of last year, we have that technology. So at this point, we are very, very confident with our ytterbium technology, we can make -- we continue to make a higher performing quantum computers with them, and I we believe that trend will continue with Forte, but I think we also going to making a lot of background understanding, so we can actually transition with barium. So the first question to is, we are actually -- we've actually been on a trend to make sure that our quantum computers become more software configurable, meaning we don't like to eventually get to a point where the number of qubits is really not tied to any of the hardware -- underlying hardware components in the system."
