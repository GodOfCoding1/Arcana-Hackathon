    "content": " In September, we announced our $13.4 million contract with the U.S. Air Force Research Lab, or AFRL, this multi-part contract will supply ARL with cloud access to compute on our cutting-edge trapped ion systems and with hardware components to further their research in quantum networking. As IonQ's commercial momentum picks up steam, we're also focused on making our systems increasingly accessible and usable delivering a full-stack approach to quantum computing. We also exited the quarter with $21.2 million in bookings year-to-date, which puts us on track to hit our previously stated expectation of between $23 million to $27 million for the full year. For Q3 2022, our total operating costs and expenses for the third quarter were $27.7 million, up 156% from $10.8 million in the prior year period, but well within our plan for the year. Our research and development costs for the third quarter were $13.3 million, up 115% from $6.2 million in the prior year period. We already achieved substantial support from the U.S. government this year, but it's worth to note that the DoD alone is expected to increase their investment in Quantum Information Science from $661 million this year to $710 million requested for 2023. We finished the quarter with $7.3 million in revenue and $21.2 million in bookings year-to-date, putting us on track to hit our financial goals for the full year. Yes, I can help with that. So going from algorithmic qubit of 6 means you can actually run algorithms or 36 qubits some level of complexity and algorithmic qubit of 25 as you're actually now using 25 qubits and running on computation with much deeper complexity and the amount of -- if you were to simulate this with a classical computer, the amount of memory space you would need will have to be about 0.5 million times more to be able to do that. Yes, I can help with that."
