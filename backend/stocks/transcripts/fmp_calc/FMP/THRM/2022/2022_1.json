    "content": " In 2021, for most of the year, we were negatively impacted by the shortages at the OEMs, that they would shut us down, then in starting with the end of the fourth quarter, and then things exacerbate in the first, we also started to incur in our own supply gaps with a couple of our suppliers that forced us to cap the deliveries to our customers, and this micromanaging of the supply comes obviously with significant cost in premium freight and spot by so that's the first dynamic that I think is important to remember. The acquisition of Alfmeier\u2019s lumbar and massage business will further expand Gentherm\u2019s value proposition beyond thermal in comfort, health, wellness and energy efficiency, making Gentherm the largest supplier of combined thermal and pneumatic seat comfort solutions in the industry."
