    "content": " Adjusting for foreign currency translation and the Alfmeier acquisition, automotive revenues increased 29% year-over-year in the third quarter, outperforming actual light vehicle production in our key markets by nearly 300 basis points. And more specifically, steering wheel heaters revenue increased 38% year-over-year primarily due to higher sales on multiple GM platforms, as well as continued growth from one of the largest global EV manufacturers. Sequentially gross market rate increase from 22.8% in the second quarter of 24.1% in the third quarter, a 130 basis points sequential improvement was driven by higher fixed costs leverage on higher sales volume, higher cost recoveries from customers, higher productivity at the factories partially offset by the impacts of RGC. But overall given our year-to-date performance, in order to hit the midpoint of our annual guidance we are expected to deliver about similar amount of revenue in the fourth quarter compared to the third, which is maybe a little more conservative, pessimistic that what IHS or S&P Global is currently forecasting for our revenue market in the fourth quarter. And then on the margin, we need to achieve about, a little bit above 11% EBITDA margin in the fourth quarter, which is really in line with what we did in the third, if you adjust for the incentive compensation adjustment that I mentioned in my prepared remarks plus one extra month of OPEX coming from the two acquisitions. So when you adjust for that, also, in the fourth quarter, similar to what we said, in the prior quarters, you really have still about 200 basis points, negative impact in the gross margin, due to the supply chain dynamics that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re still seeing."
