Adjusting for both foreign currency translation and the Alfmeier acquisition, Automotive revenues increased 11% year-over-year in 2022, outperforming actual light vehicle production in our key markets by over 600 basis points. Adjusting for the $58 million contribution from Alfmeier and foreign currency translation, Automotive revenue increased by 23% and this compares to a 2% increase in the actual light vehicle production in our key markets of North America, Europe, China, Japan and Korea. Pneumatic comfort will grow in the range of $75 million to $125 million for two key reasons: first, continued growth with existing Alfmeier customers, such as BMW, VW and Tesla; as well as second, through the extension of pneumatic comfort solutions into the broader Gentherm customer portfolio across Asia and North America."
