    "content": " Now on to Slide 5, where you can see that in the second quarter, we secured $600 million in new program awards on a pro forma basis, including $190 million secured by Alfmeier in the second quarter prior to acquisition closing. We are lowering the adjusted EBITDA margin rate guidance primarily as a result of the second quarter performance as well as the expected continuation of customer demand fluctuations due to the supply chain disruptions, ongoing semiconductor shortages, continued FX headwinds, higher inflation and acquisition impact. This is evidenced by closing 2 strategic acquisitions, winning our second ClimateSense award, securing $600 million in new business awards, expanding our product portfolio for electric vehicles and continued above-market growth."
