    "content": " While we\u2019re disappointed that our first quarter profitability fell short of our expectations, there are elements of our performance that highlight the underlying strength of our business and the products we made capturing market share over the past several years. As Rick highlighted, product margins were strong in all geographies on full price selling this quarter, but the sales mix shift away from our higher margin U.S. business overshadowed this impact as the company\u2019s \u2013 company level resulting in a mixed driven decrease of 20 basis points. SG&A expense was $71.9 million or 32.6% of net sales in the first quarter, compared to $68.9 million or 24.7% of net sales a year ago and $65.5 million or 30.7% of net sales in the pre-pandemic first quarter of 2019. With the first quarter of 2022 behind us, we are more cautious in how we\u2019re looking at the full year and the potential impacts of the current operating environment, including the lingering impacts of the prior year stimulus, inflationary pressures, the continued pressure on consumer discretionary spending and global unrest. I think one thing that we\u2019ve seen over the last couple years is with the stimulus and outsize spend and really actually our results coming into the pandemic in 2017, 2018, 2019 is we\u2019ve run really strong results. But obviously, with what we\u2019ve seen now through the first quarter and the current trend, we are planning that really high, high single-digit in operating profit dollar \u2013 or operating as a percent of overall sales, which again would be as we look back at kind of where we performed here, would be pretty high compared to where we were at pre-pandemic."
