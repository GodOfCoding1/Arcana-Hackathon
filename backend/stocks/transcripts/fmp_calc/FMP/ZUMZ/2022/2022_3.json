We did say margin would be down about 50 basis points, but in relation to what we're seeing in the market, I think that's a pretty strong and definitely strong in relation to kind of a multi-year look, if you were to do a three, four, five-year look at our product margin over time, I think you'd feel really good with kind of where we're standing."
