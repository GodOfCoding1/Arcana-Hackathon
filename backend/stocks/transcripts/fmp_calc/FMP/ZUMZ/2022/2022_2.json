    "content": " Despite the challenges with the business, there were bright spots on the quarter, including Fast Times in Australia performing exceptionally well to our plan, product margins remaining strong, while they're down slightly from the prior year, we have not given back the vast majority of gains we've made over the past few years that our teams are able to mitigate the challenging operating environment, as well as a negative country and product mix impacts. Compared to 2021, the 460 basis point increase in SG&A expense as a % of sales resulted from the following: 290 basis points in our store wages tied to both deleverage on lower sales as well as wage rate increases; 90 basis points related to other store operating costs, primarily impacted by lower sales levels; 90 basis points in corporate costs and 90 basis points in non-store wages. These increases were partially offset by 110 basis point decrease in legal costs, due to a settlement recorded in the second quarter of 2021 operating income in the second quarter of 2022 was $5 million or 2.3% of net sales compared with $32 million or 11.0% of net sales last year. From a regional perspective, net sales for our North America business for the 37-day period ended September 5, 2022 decreased 19.5% over the comparable period last year and were down 15.4% compared to 37-day period ended September 9, 2019. I mean, as we kind of lived through this roller coaster over the last few years and as we're thinking about kind of what's happened here in the back to school time, just with the pressure on the consumer tied to higher levels of inflation and the competition and we're seeing a shift away from our higher priced brands to value."
