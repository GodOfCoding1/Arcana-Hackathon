    "content": " We've already reached the lower end of our year-end target for door-to-door sales head count, and a number of new retail locations is due to ramp up in the end into the end of the year, as we've execute on almost all of the required leases at this point, Turning to Slide 12 on business services, revenue growth of 1.3% in Q2, excluding air strand revenue is in line with Q1, but below last year's level of growth as the year-on-years and year comparisons are normalizing after peak negative impact with soften of the pandemic in 2020. Please state your question. Please state your question. Please state your question. And we'll see that, that, but I think it's, fair to say that if you look at the history of the investments of the group globally, we've never really exited countries but you have to adapt to the topography that you're dealing with and the competitiveness that you're dealing with and the players, and try and maximize shareholder value any which way you can, depending on the different dynamics that change, year-over-year or quarter-over-quarter. Please state your question. Please state your question. I'm just trying to figure out if the growth slowdown is market wide and sort of, regardless of technology that's going to market, or if it really is very specific to technologies and so fiber and things like fiber can continue to kind of have that same penetration pattern that you've historically seen. And I think the only difference that people have paused for is maybe the return characteristics of some of the smaller fiber operators have probably changed dramatically in the last 12 months, whether it be competitive pressures, driving lower ARPUs on the gross adds side, whether it be inflationary pressures on OpEx whether it be supply chain issues in terms of execution which is, I think we know why we feel good about where we are in the fiber rollout, because in size you're able to negate a lot of those, those issues particularly with the cash flow that's being generated from the HFC product as well. But we're confident that we're going to be able to continue to push broadband ARPU growth, but clearly in that, in that more of that lower single digit numbers is what we should be pushing for at this stage, given the mix, given the promotional aspects of business that we're seeing until we get to levels where our churn reduction becomes material, particularly with our fiber product, I think we will, we will sit there and, and continue to fight on a, on a day-to-day basis from a promotional standpoint, which will, which will cap broadband ARPU in the near term, going higher than, than lower single low single digit growth at this stage. And, putting aside FWA and other potentially technologies out there when you've got two fiber players, or even if we believe our fiber is a lot better in terms of our products, that's called, 1.75 fiber players out there that competitive dynamic is something I would sign up for every single one of our markets in the long term."
