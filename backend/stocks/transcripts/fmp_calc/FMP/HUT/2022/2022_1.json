    "content": " With our expanded and efficient mining fleet driving a profitable quarterly performance in our core digital asset mining operation combined with the initial results from our recently acquired high-performance computing business, Hut 8 remains well positioned for continued growth in a dynamic and knowledging market environment. We achieved revenue of $49.3 million from digital asset mining activities as we mined 942 new Bitcoin at an average price of approximately $52,300 per Bitcoin. Our newly acquired data center business contributed an additional $3.3 million of revenue, in line with management's expectation for 2 months of operations, given the January 31 acquisition date. The increased depreciation expense from $5.8 million to $18.4 million was driven by the addition of approximately $130 million of new mining equipment and infrastructure assets over the past 12 months, as well as approximately $25 million of data center fixed assets through the previously mentioned acquisition. In terms of margins, our core digital asset mining operation generated mining margins of approximately 67% versus 57% in the prior year period, reflecting our substantially more efficient fleet, and this is given average quarterly bitcoin price was actually down slightly period-over-period. The data center business contributed $0.7 million of selling, general and admin expenses, and we will continue to refine our expectation of quarterly SG&A going forward. Driven by the strong operating performance, Hut 8 achieved adjusted EBITDA of $27.1 million for Q1 2022 compared to $16.2 million in the prior year quarter. The acquisition of TeraGo's data center business added approximately $30 million of assets to our balance sheet, and we will finalize the purchase price allocation here over the balance of 2022."
