    "content": " In terms of margins, our digital asset mining operation generated mining profit of $9.3 million versus $33.5 million in the prior year period, reflecting the combination of lower Bitcoin price and increased electricity costs. Also impacting the net loss, we recorded a $7.3 million non-cash gain on revaluation of our digital assets, as a result of the increase in price of Bitcoin quarter-end-over-quarter-end, and we incurred a non-cash loss of $2.9 million on revaluation of warrants liability. Reflecting the operating results discussed previously, Hut 8 achieved the adjusted EBITDA of $2.1 million for Q3 2022 compared with $30.7 million in the prior year period."
