    "content": " By a way of evidence, scaled customer quarterly ARPU of 424,000 grew 15% year-to-year, and while ahead of our Zeta 2025 model, what really stood out was ARPU growth within our superscaled cohort. All three of Zeta is use cases acquire, grow, and retain grew double-digits year-over-year, led by acquire and grow, and the number of new scaled customers using more than one use case increased to 46, up from 33% a year ago or 39% year-to-year. Full year GAAP cost of revenue ended at 36.5%, down from 38.1% in 2021 and like many of our Zeta 2025 revenue KPIs, this decrease of 170 basis points from 2022 to 2021 is well ahead of our model of 60 basis points of improvement. Excluding the accelerated expensing related to our IPO, stock-based compensation would have been $57 million and for the year we delivered adjusted EBITDA of $92.2 million, up 46% year-over-year, with adjusted EBITDA margin of 15.6%, up 180 basis points year-to-year. Altogether, our adjusted EBITDA margins have grown from 8% in 2019 to 15.6% in 2022, averaging 260 basis points of expansion per year, well ahead of our Zeta 2025 model of 160 basis points. With respect to full year 2023 revenue, we expect to generate $691 million or 17% year-to-year growth at the midpoint of our range. With that in mind, in the first quarter of 2023, we expect to generate revenue of $150 million, up 19% year-to-year at the midpoint of our range. Cash flow has been a key metric to us internally for many years, and as we look at the current market landscape, we thought adding an additional metric to Zeta 2025 made prudent sense where we believe at least 55% of our EBITDA by 2025 will convert to free cash flow."
