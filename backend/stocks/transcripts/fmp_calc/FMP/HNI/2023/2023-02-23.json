    "content": " Specifically, population migration patterns towards secondary and tertiary geographies, positive employment and demand trends with small to mid-size offices and feedback from large corporate customers regarding return to office plans and adoption of hybrid work models, all align with our strong market coverage and product and price point, breadth and depth, and point to the return of sustained volume growth post 2023. Looking at the segments, we expect the $80 million to $85 million of profit support to drive profit growth in workplace furnishings and offset much of the negative impact from lower volume in residential building products that's being driven by the weakening housing market. In closing, we remain focused on our two primary long-term objectives: improving the profitability of our workplace furnishings segment by driving margin expansion, and delivering strong top-line growth in residential building products by leveraging our differentiated business model. So we're expecting new construction decline like I said, in line with single-family housing activity and the existing home or remodel retrofit activity side of the business be down less expecting a little pressure in both sides that's for sure though. Our expectation right now is that there's a pretty significant decline in residential building products, which is going to even though we're going to offset a good chunk of it with our actions, that the net impact of that is going to be more than the profit growth in workplace furnishings."
