    "content": " We generated revenue growth in both new construction and remodel retrofit with both channels growing at similar rates during that quarter, While third quarter orders were down modestly on a year-over-year basis, and while we expect and prepare -- and are prepared for near-term challenges in the housing market, our category leading positions and favorable housing demographics continue to reinforce our long-term bullishness for this high margin high return business. We remain focused on our two primary long-term objectives, improving the profitability of our workplace furnishing segment by driving margin expansion, and delivering strong top line growth in residential building products by leveraging our differentiated business model. Your line is open. Your line is open. And as I commented earlier as well, on residential side, we are just talking about our efforts to -- that we've put in investments, pretty significant investments last few years to connect to customers, to expand the category, to create awareness, to understand design patterns, to leverage our strong distribution model, those are all point to a really strong opportunistic and outlook, once we kind of get through this near-term headwind. Your line is open. Your line is open. And I'll tell you, we're going to continue to -- you ask a question just a minute ago about residential, we will continue to invest in our core strategies on expanding workplace furnishing margins and driving top line growth, notwithstanding near-term kind of headwinds and housing. Your line is open."
