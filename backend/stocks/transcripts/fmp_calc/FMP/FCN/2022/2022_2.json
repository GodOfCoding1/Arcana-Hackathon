    "content": " Without the negative FX impact from strengthening of the U.S. dollar, revenues grew 9.2% compared to the prior year quarter. Excluding FX, revenues increased $65.5 million or 9.2% compared to the prior year quarter. In Corporate Finance & Restructuring, revenues of $277.1 million increased 20% compared to the prior year quarter. The increase in revenues was primarily due to higher demand and realized rates across our transactions, business transformation and restructuring services as well as an increase in pass-through revenues and higher success fees compared to the prior year quarter. Business transformation and transactions represented 60% of segment revenues, while restructuring represented 40% of segment revenues this quarter. Of note, as I mentioned before, our Economic Consulting segment experienced more than the typical revenue recognition deferrals in the quarter which negatively impacted the segment's performance for revenues and adjusted EBITDA. In Technology, revenues of $77.8 million decreased 1.1% compared to the prior year quarter. Adjusted segment EBITDA declined $5 million which was due to lower revenues, coupled with higher compensation expenses."
