    "content": " ExtraCash experienced a steady increase in origination volume throughout 2022, with record volume of $801 million in Q4, a near 80% increase from the year-ago quarter. We had $801 million of ExtraCash originations during the quarter, up significantly from $451 million during the fourth quarter of last year, while keeping delinquency rates relatively flat and improving approximately 50 basis points sequentially. Marketing and acquisition spend came in at the midpoint of our Q4 guidance, totaling approximately $11.9 million in the fourth quarter compared to $12.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2021 and represented a 50% reduction sequentially. After adjusting for this impact, compensation expense increased approximately $1.6 million or 12% relative to the fourth quarter of 2021, due largely to strategic investments we made in product engineering and marketing personnel needed to execute on our growth initiatives."
