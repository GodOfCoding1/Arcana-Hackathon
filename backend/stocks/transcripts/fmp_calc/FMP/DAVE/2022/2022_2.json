    "content": " During the quarter, we reported non-GAAP total operating revenue of $47 million, representing an increase of 22.4% year-over-year, driven primarily by growth in our ExtraCash active, origination volume growth and higher average revenue per monthly transacting members. There are several tailwinds here that we expect to support efficient new member growth moving forward including the continued rollout of our ExtraCash $500 product, ongoing efficiency gains from our investments in marketing process, and technology and macroeconomic factors, which has created five-year highs in demand for ExtraCash advances and from lowered advertising costs as a result of the pullback in marketing investment by our competition. In terms of topline performance, total non-GAAP operating revenue was $47 million in Q2, representing a 22.4% year-over-year growth compared to the same period last year. Our marketing and acquisition spend totaled $20.8 million in the second quarter compared to $11.9 million in Q2 of 2021, as we begin to ramp our investments behind the ExtraCash $500 marketing campaign."
