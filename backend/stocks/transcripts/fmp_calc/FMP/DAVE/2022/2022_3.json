    "content": " During the quarter, we reported non-GAAP total operating revenue of approximately $58.6 million, representing an increase of approximately 41% year-over-year, driven primarily by growth in multi transacting members based on stronger customer acquisition and retention, as well as impressive growth of our Dave Card interchange revenue. Our transacting members completed a record of 4.6 average transactions per month in Q3, representing 105% growth versus 3Q 2020, which is just prior to our launching of the Dave Card product in late 2020, in an indication of how we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been able to deepen engagement with this added offering within our ecosystem. By way of comparison, our net ExtraCash receivables portfolio totaled approximately $44.9 million as of the end of 3Q 2021, representing approximately 95% growth on a year-over-year basis. As Jason mentioned, our total non-GAAP operating revenue was $58.6 million during the third quarter, representing 41% growth compared to the same period last year. The increase was primarily attributable to the margin driving initiatives we began realizing in the third quarter, including improvements to key vendor costs, increase emphasis on fraud controls related to the Dave Card, and ongoing improvements to ExtraCash risk management and our credit policy, which will better position us to react to potential headwinds in the macro environment."
