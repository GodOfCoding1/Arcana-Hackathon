    "content": " All statements by management other than statements of historical facts, including statements regarding the company's strategies, financial condition, operations, costs, plans, and objectives, as well as anticipated results of development and commercialization efforts, the timing of clinical studies, potential partnership opportunities, and expectations regarding regulatory processes, receipt of required regulatory clearances, and product launches are forward-looking statements. We continue to be focussed on the following four priority areas; number one, building our base of clinical evidence to support our commercial activities and regulatory submissions in the U.S. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re ramping our global clinical evaluation sites, and I'm delighted to announce that we've recently installed another TAEUS clinical study system in the U.S. We are on track to reach our goal of scanning at least 200 patients by year end. Priority number three, in parallel to the clinical evidence that's being generated in key commercial markets, we're accelerating our commercial activities by demonstrating our TAEUS system in over 50% more clinical conferences in 2022 compared to last year, these and other activities will underpin the commercial adoption of TAEUS in those markets, helping to catalyze our growing sales pipeline. Other highly interested stakeholders and clinicians like hepatologists and endocrinologists in Europe tend to use ultrasound more regularly than they do in the U.S. And so said another way, I think we've experienced that there is a more natural learning curve with radiologists than in hepatologists here in the U.S. And part of the process of ramping up a clinical study site is not only training them, which isn't very complicated as Francois described, but making sure that they're effectively collecting data."
