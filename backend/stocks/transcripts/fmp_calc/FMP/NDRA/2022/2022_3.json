Admittedly, it's taken longer than we expected to achieve our clinical milestones, partly because COVID restricted or even halted work at our partner clinical sites for the better part of two years and also, because ENDRA\u00e2\u0080\u0099s developing a completely new and game changing technology, which naturally comes with some challenges. But as you'll hear from Mike Thornton in a minute, we're making strong progress on the clinical data front, and as you'll hear from Renaud Maloberti, we're maintaining an excellent cadence of marketing activities to build awareness of our TAEUS fatty liver technology among prospective customers in Europe and the US. Last week, as part of ENDRA's ongoing marketing activities, Francois and I attended ENDRA 11th Clinical Meeting of the Year, the American Association for the Study of Liver Disease, known as AASLD in Washington, D.C. AASLD is the most important liver disease conference in the US, attracting well over 8,000 clinicians and industry participants."
