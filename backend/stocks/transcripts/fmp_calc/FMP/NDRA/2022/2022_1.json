Good afternoon everyone, and thanks for joining us today for a discussion of ENDRA's 2022 first quarter financial results and an update on our business We are very encouraged by the recent progress we've made and advancing our TAEUS system toward global commercialization. This fundraise bolsters our cash position to fund operations through several important milestones, including ramping up our commercial activities in Europe and advancing the TAEUS system through the regulatory process in the U.S. What's more, I believe our ability to raise capital efficiently in this very challenging macro environment reflects investor confidence in our progress, our technology and our market opportunity. To that end, I'm happy to announce today that we've deployed a TAEUS system, trained the staff and will begin scanning patients next week at a new clinical research collaboration site in Germany that will contribute clinical data, provide usability feedback, and help ENDRA validate new TAEUS product features."
