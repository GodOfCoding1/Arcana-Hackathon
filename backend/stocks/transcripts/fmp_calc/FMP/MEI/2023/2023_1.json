    "content": " First quarter income from operations in fiscal year '23 decreased to $21.8 million from $34.1 million in fiscal year '22, mainly due to lower product sales, lower gross margins, mainly due to higher costs due to material cost inflation spot buys, and other unreimbursed costs. Net debt, a non-GAAP financial measure, increased by $16.3 million to $54.8 million in the first quarter of fiscal year '23, from $38.5 million at the end of fiscal '22, mainly due to the share repurchases of 11.9 million and unfavorable working capital changes, especially related to inventory, which increased significantly due to the ongoing supply chain related challenges."
