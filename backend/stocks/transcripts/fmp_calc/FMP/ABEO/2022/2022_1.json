    "content": " Various factors that could cause actual results to differ include but are not limited to those identified under the section entitled, Risk Factors in the company\u2019s annual report on Form 10-K and other periodic reports filed by the company with the Securities and Exchange Commission. In a joint press release with Ultragenyx issued this morning, we reported an exclusive license agreement where Ultragenyx will assume all further development and commercialization responsibilities for ABO-102 and in return Abeona will be eligible to receive tiered royalties up to 10% on net sales and commercial milestone payments up to $30 million following regulatory approval. We believe that Ultragenyx with its deep expertise in rare genetic diseases, including MPS, is an ideal partner to potentially bring ABO-102 to patients who have been waiting too long for a first treatment. We have now focused our finite resources more narrowly on EB-101\u2019s pivotal Phase III VIITAL study readout, which is our most significant near term clinical milestone. Having completed the accrual of VIITAL, we expect top line results of the study in late third quarter of 2022, which could support filing a biologics license application. In that study, as previously reported, EB-101 demonstrates instantaneous wound healing and pain reduction in the majority of treated wounds up to six years after treatment of large chronic wounds in RDEB patients. Later this week, additional long term follow-up data for up to eight years from the Phase I/II study will be featured during an oral presentation at the Society of Investigative Dermatology - SID Annual Meeting. Remember, in VIITAL as in the Phase I/II study, we treated large chronic wounds that measured greater than 20 centimeters square of body surface area at baseline. Unlike small recurring wounds that can close spontaneously, large chronic wounds rarely close themselves and remain open for more than six months and, in many cases, remain open for years. In VIITAL, we treated 43 randomized large chronic wounds in 11 patients and each of the 43 wounds was paired with an untreated control wound within the same patient. Regarding baseline wound characteristics, the mean body surface area of randomized wounds treated with EB-101 per patients was 156 centimeters square, the range being 80 to 200 centimeters square. If you include the non-randomized wounds, the mean treated body surface area per patient in the study was 207 centimeters square, the range being 120 to 240 centimeters square. Now turning briefly to our pre-clinical eye programs, at the ARVO 2022 annual meeting in early May, we reported non-human primate data for AAV204, a novel AAV capsid from our AIM capsid library. The results showed AAV204\u2019s ability to produce more robust transduction in the macular area of the eye following administration directly into the vitreous of the eye by para-retinal administration, which unlike sub-retinal administration does not create a retinal detachment. Looking ahead, we expect animal proof of concept data beginning in mid-2022 that could potentially support a pre-IND meeting with the FDA in the second half of 2022. I would like to remind everyone that the Form 10-Q is available on our website, which is where you can get additional details on our financial results for the three months ended March 31, 2022. Starting with the financial resources on our balance sheet, we had cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and short term investments of $37.2 million as of March 31, 2022. Net cash used in operating activities was $13.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022. Based on the re-prioritization of portfolio investments, which includes our strategic focus now on EB-101 and the disposition of the AB-102 and AB-101 programs, our estimated runway of current cash resources takes us into the second quarter of 2023. Turning to research and development activities, we spent $10.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022 compared to $8.3 million in the three months ended March 31, 2021. As part of our strategy to regain compliance, we have called a special meeting of stockholders for June 14, 2022 for the approval of a proposal to enact a reverse stock split of the outstanding shares of our common stock. Stockholders as of the record date of May 3, 2022 are entitled to attend the online special meeting, view the proxy statement and vote. The link to participate is included in our first quarter results press release issued last week, which is available on the Press Releases page of our website. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to the Operator for the Q&A session. Please pose your question, your line is live. Congrats on the updates today, and thanks for taking my questions, and also thank you for the details from the RDEB Phase III study. I guess for the 14 non-randomized wounds treated, is it fair to say that those were particularly large wounds, and can you talk more about how the treatment worked for those wounds and also talk about your total RDEB data and how that\u2019s going to fit into the BLA filing and the argument around the BLA. Your first question was about the 14 non-randomized wounds, and the 14 non-randomized wounds, just for avoidance of doubt, will not be part of the primary data set for our efficacy end points. The reason they are non-randomized is mostly inability to find an appropriate control wound, so we have the sheet created so the patient benefits by treating and that\u2019s pretty much the goal of treatment. We will obviously report the results for those wounds in terms of wound healing and pain scoring and such end points., so that\u2019s something about the trial. The 43 randomized wounds that I mentioned first, those are the primary analysis data set. As we announced on March 31 that first quarter we completed treating the last patient who went into VIITAL, and as you know, it\u2019s a six-month data point, so from March through September is our follow-up. Our team is diligently cleaning data real time so there is not a back end lag after database lock in order to report the results, so we feel fairly confident that\u2019s why the end of quarter two, we should have those clinical results. Regarding the BLA filing, our first goal is to get to the clinical results of the study in a very cost efficient way, so we are certainly stage gating capital intensive BLA preparations work after the study reads out so we are careful with the finite resources that we have today. In the base case scenario if we do that, we\u2019re going to look at quarter two - earlier we had, I think, communicated a quarter one, but it will be a quarter two filing of the BLA in 2023. Now that said, there is a scenario, an upside scenario where we may be able to accelerate that if we have a source of non-dilutive funding mainly from a partnership for commercialization, and if such partnership happens prior to the study readout itself, then we may be able to trigger some of these BLA preparation activities early on. That was really helpful perspective, and I guess for the partnership, if you can talk a little bit more about what you\u2019re looking for with a partner and where you\u2019re at with the process of finding a partner. You can consider our role as being a supplier or a transfer of technology, and obviously when we are sitting a positive Phase III study, our expectation for a partnership would be recognition of that result with an upfront payment and potentially royalties on the back end. Please pose your question, your line is live. Yes, there are several indications from our undisclosed eye programs where we are intending to try and leverage AAV-204 via para-retinal administration to use for those indications. The short answer to your first question, is there any upfront payment, is no, but I want to put context for that answer, which is our goal, our primary goal for Abeona is twofold. One is have a partner take over all responsibility for further development as you can appreciate clinical development as well as CMC are pretty capital intensive, and we wanted to reduce our operating expenses, so that was our first goal while still retaining our value from the program in the back end. It\u2019s very premature to comment on that, Maury, only because the follow-up for the study is very early and we did not have the resources to have a lot of items in our portfolio, so we had to de-prioritize that. We have turned the license rights for that program over to NCH, so if the data looks promising at a later date, hopefully there is future development prospects for that asset for MPS IIIB. I also want to thank our shareholders and other stakeholders who have listened to this call today, and we\u2019ll talk to you on the next quarterly call."
