    "content": " Welcome to the JAKKS Pacific First Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call with Management, who will review financial results for the first quarter ended March 31st, 2022. Mr. Berman will provide an overview of the quarter, along with highlights of product lines and current business trends.

Unless otherwise stated, the most directly comparable GAAP financial metric has been reconciled to the associated non-GAAP financial measure within the company's earnings press release issued today or previously. Our net sales for the quarter were $120.9 million, a 44% increase compared to the prior year. Over its first two weeks, the worldwide global box office has exceeded $230 million, the movie and our product line appeals to those new to Sonic as well as those of us who have loved the world of Sonic for over 30 years now. Point of sale at our top three U.S. customers increased over 40% in Q1 compared to last year, while their retail inventory levels started to catch-up from recent quarters, finishing at plus 54%. We feel really good about the cooperation we're getting from customers, working to stay ahead of supply chain constraints, and ensure that everyone has the product our consumers want throughout the year. In total, our Toy Consumer Product segment was up 39% in the quarter, with North America up 37% and international up 52%. Over the past two years, we have gone direct in more Western European markets as well as Mexico. But as we close Q1, we see signs of solid progress, particularly as European retailers had more lockdowns a year ago and our team in Mexico opens more doors, more and more as the weeks go by. Our top five direct toy markets outside of North America, where the U.K., Germany, Mexico, France, and Italy, and that group aggregated grew over 80% in Q1 versus the prior year. Q1 is a small quarter for our Costume business, but nonetheless also performed extremely well. As we've discussed on recent calls, our Costume business in Europe is ramping up along with our Toy growth and we've begun shipping Disney Costumes across Europe in April. The team in Hong Kong and in China are working closely with our counterparts in the U.S., Europe and Southeast Asia to ensure that we are moving products into our warehouses as efficiently and cost effectively as possible. We continue to leverage our long-term vendor relationships to collaborate and developing products that will be market competitive, while dealing with increasing manufacturing costs and above and beyond the aforementioned supply chain challenges. As much as the teams have done a remarkable job in collaborate in a new and different ways remotely, it's been energizing to be able to walk the halls again and have more spontaneous conversations, both on a professional and personal fronts. We're also starting to see business travel return and are eager to see more cross-office collaborations in the months to come, in addition to spending more in-person time with customers and licensors. We are taking advantage of the low shipping season to import our 2022 inventory needs as early as we can as we did last year, and managing our cash tightly to fuel our future growth. So, we're all aware that there's a lot of hard work ahead of us. But when I think back on all the challenges the company and the team has had to work through over the past several years, I couldn't be more excited about where we find ourselves today and the prospects going forward to 2022 and beyond. I will now pass the call over to John for some further discussions around our financials, after which, I'll come back with some more thoughts about the rest of 2022. In the spirit of being a new year and trying new things, we've extended the data and calculations provided in the exhibits of our earnings release to cover the material that I've historically recapped in my section of the narrative. As we discussed last quarter, we're seeing meaningful increases in import costs when it comes to importing product, inclusive of getting products from the factory to the port, ocean passage, getting products out of the receiving ports in a timely manner, and then transporting to our warehouses in the U.S. and Europe. We absorbed a lot higher costs in the back half of 2021 in this area, a portion of which flowed through the P&L when that product was sold in Q1. As much as the spot market continues to whipsaw around early this year, we know that the retrospectively attractive contractual rate we enjoyed in 2021 will soon be gone and we will be absorbing higher contractual cost this year. This is not new news in the context of what we shared last quarter, but it is a bit more explicit about our confidence and projecting how we expect that cost to behave in the calendar year. However, as you can see in recent quarters results, we're currently enjoying fantastic demand for our product. So, we're having to be judicious about meeting that demand, while realizing we're suffering on the margin side, given the current macro events. To that end, our March 31st inventory remains high at $85 million, which is $49 million more than this time prior year. Of the $85 million, $15 million is in transit, where last year, that number was $5 million. You can think of that $85 million in at least four different ways a view towards our short to medium term needs for 2022 sales, more in transit, given the longer supply chain, capitalizing the higher supply chain cost of product value, and doing what we can to pull necessary 2022 inventory forward into our distribution centers ahead of the second half crunch. Moving down the P&L and building on what Stephen said about cost pressures, as the business has retrenched during the pandemic, we've taken the opportunity to reset a bit as it relates to SG&A spending. Certainly benefiting from our strong Q1 topline, we see nice margin improvements in both areas versus prior year, with G&A, the larger of the two buckets, improving by over 400 basis points, which is great. That certainly helps offset some of the aforementioned gross margin squeeze and leads to our closing the quarter just under a 1% operating loss, which represents very strong performance for Q1 at a toy company. In aggregate, our adjusted EBITDA for the quarter is a positive $1.9 million versus a negative $2.4 million last year. Our trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA is now $53.6 million, or 8.1% of net sales, which was $39.5 million and 7.4% of net sales at this time in 2021. Whether you want to use that number or cash balance as of March 31st of $39.2 million, you get a net leverage ratio in the range of 1.0 to 1.1. Given that our debt level has decreased from $161.7 million to $95.4 million over the same time period, we've been rolling forward the results of improved profitability and to reduce debt and increase working capital to drive higher sales. It's our intention to continue to follow that script, deploy cash to secure and expand evergreen brands and categories of business, steadily improve our balance sheet, and explore on strategy acquisition opportunities as appropriate. As we touched upon back in February, we are still locked into our singles and doubles core focus and have a lot of great refreshes innovations, extensions of lines and categories and expansions planned across businesses like Disney Princess, the Star collection, and Perfectly Cute in the Dolls and Roleplay aisles and Super Mario, Black & Decker, Apex Legends in Action and Play Collectible aisles. In addition, we are anticipating a tremendous year in our costume business disguise. And finally, I want to point out that our diligent focus of growing our overall business unit categories of the approach singles and doubles doesn't mean we're out of surprises. We've recently announced a new JAKKS product line of inflatable remote control vehicles called Air Titan, our first-to-market for this line comes in partnership with universal brand development, the Air Titan, Jurassic World Massive Attack T Rex RC is coming to online retail this spring ahead of the theatric release of Jurassic World Dominion in June 2022. Stuff, a European-based toy innovation company for two new product lines. I'd like to end with thanking the global teams and partners for the continued focus and commitment and our investment community for the support and patience as we execute against our plants to continue to deliver greater products, profitability, and greater results. I think you mentioned distribution, I understand you're bringing back some of your international distributor ships in-house, but maybe talk a little bit about some of the new retail wins, how your distribution is changing in the U.S. and internationally? So, besides our main large partnerships with Amazon, Walmart, Target, the Club's, Sam's, Tesco,  and France, all these major ones. We've started about four years ago, five years ago, a three-tiered development -- product development cycle, to make sure that we can all class of trade. And we've seen the penetration really come to fruition over the last 18 months from going into the retailer like Fleet Farm, CVS, Walgreens, Macy's, Burlington, Barnes & Noble, those are just to name a few the Five Below, the dollar trade. So, our distribution has been really penetrated through all the different categories and based off these trade of currency of which the consumer goes in. So, we go from high end to low end and it's really enhanced our increase in sales and enhanced our distribution platform. So, if you see what we've mentioned earlier in the call, our inventory being high, this is all planned as we ended the year with high inventory to make sure we can achieve the numbers that we did this first quarter. It's no different than going forward, we're managing the manufacturing by double tooling and bringing goods in through different various ports to make sure that we have the products. And then we have our FOB side of the business that really benefits a lot of the main retailers and then on the dollar trade and some of the other ones, those are domestic backup inventory. So, we're really getting great penetration both in North America and in EMEA. And then I just want to clarify, in the release, you mentioned that your core business was up mid-single-digits, but your reported revenue was up quite a bit more. So, we mentioned in our release, that disguise was up over double from where it was last year and it's actually the bookings and where we stand with disguise are very similar to going into Q2, the lack of the cost impact of the seasonal business, the Foot-to-Floor Ride-On, the tables did decrease because of the cost to ship those in are excessive based off the carrying cost of the containers. But even if you set those aside, we're still mid-single-digits with the balance of the business. So, we work really strong with the retailers around the world and it's not that they're asking for it, it's they need it based off POS. So, based off of the logistic issues that are happening with bringing goods in the U.S. and in Europe, then on the FOB side, for -- even the retailers to get their containers and then when you hear about the lockdowns and the different ports of congestion in China, it's just mitigating and manage this -- really micromanage it from all of our teams, ensuring that we have the goods appropriately. Even without the formidable Encanto and Sonic, but we are going to make sure that we manage it correctly, we don't have too much inventory. So, it's really just micromanaging and making sure we have the right product that is available for the retail and we're working really, really meticulously with each retailer on the plans by week, the inventories required, in each of their DCs much more than the last 10 years. It's developing the right way to be able to ensure that the retailers have the right inventory, not have too much inventory, and that we have the right manufacturing and we're not utilizing capital to build inventory where not needed. So, for where we stand and we do a tremendous amount of time with our retailers and not just hearing how our industry is doing, it's kind of how the consumer is doing, just the traffic. Retailers don't just get traffic from toy manufacturers, the retailers get it from a various abundance of different categories which are in. What we see today and speaking to retailers both called in North America and EMEA, it's a strong consumer. But where we've seen it this this 27 years, I co-founded JAKKS and prior to that was THQ. I would tell you, if you're in a category that is just there, that's where it's difficult. But when you have products that are really resonated with children, and we call it kidults, the tweens, we are very excited even without stimulus continuing, this pattern of sell-throughs and where we stand with our forward-looking numbers and our categories. As I did mention earlier in the call that are Flip the Foot-to-Floor Ride-on, our Table & Chair, all the bulk items are getting hurt, because of the cost of shipping. But we expect that to be offset next year, hopefully in a much stronger platform, and we also are having great success across the board. So, we see -- we have right now currently in Santa Monica retailers here, major retailers, the clubs are here, the dollar trade and they're buying quite aggressive for the fall and looking into spring. It's our Spring Toy Fair and they're looking to be focused, do many -- do much more with one manufacturer than with many. And we have had one of the best, call it, fall spring -- fall 2022 follow-ups and spring 2023 toy fairs in the history of JAKKS. So far what we're hearing  where there's good product, and when there's not, then there's issues. And I was wondering you've given us breakdown in the past, but your business between basics, roleplay items, everyday kind of stuff, and then what's more hit-driven, and including, but not limited to, entertainment. But our basic evergreen business policy, Black & Decker, the Princess Style collection, the Perfectly Cute, easily looks into exclusive at Target. All that -- this Nintendo, just the general Nintendo business, our skateboard area of business that are called trampolines and ball pit, all are growing very nicely and are strong. But then you have on top of those nice successes that we're having of our everyday core product line, you have the enhancement of the Encanto, the Sonic Classic, the Sonic Movie, we have the new Air Titans, which is launching -- which is really -- I know, Garrett, you're been in the toy world forever. And the breakout is -- core is doing great and they have to break up the categories in which whether it's roleplay and Halloween, and so on. You see that Nintendo yesterday, moved their movie till April, which is very exciting for us because it's a much better time for a manufacturer when it was coming out in December, the kids would not be able to get to resonate with that content, but now that's going to April. Nintendo has grown double-digits almost every year and then having that in April, we have a great new strong movie for Fall next year and other licenses that we haven't come out with. So, I'm not sure if we're going to be able -- I can't tell you where growth is this year. It's really early on, but I do believe we will have growth and profitability . We have exciting things next year, and some of which we can't discuss, but we have a great platform going into 2024."
