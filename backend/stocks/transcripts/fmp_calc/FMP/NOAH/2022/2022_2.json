    "content": " In the second quarter of 2022, Noah achieved net revenues of RMB738 million and a non-GAAP net income attributable to shareholders of RMB365 million, up 5.4% year-on-year and 13.3% quarter-on-quarter. Investor sentiment hasn't fully recovered, evidenced by distribution value of mutual fund products  decreased by 25.8% year-over-year in the quarter and dropped a whopping 57.8% year-over-year for the first half of the year, as well as the savings rate has risen to 34% as of the end of second quarter, compared to only roughly 30% pre-pandemic. Income from operations of the quarter was RMB323 million, a 3.6 decrease year-over-year, but a 3% growth over the last quarter, mainly because of the decreased net revenues for the quarter were partially offset by lower expenses, such as general administrative expenses, marketing and spending, planned activities as well as more government grants received in the second quarter due to the COVID-19 lockdown in parts of China especially in Shanghai. Noticeably, the transaction value of mutual fund products continue to grow against the , with a significant increase of 71.4% quarter-over-quarter, and a 30% year-over-year to RMB12.2 billion. The transaction value of private equity increased 23.2% over the last quarter to RMB3.9 billion, but down 39% year-over-year representing a quarterly recovery that has been expected, while the transaction value of PE products are decreased 40% quarter-over-quarter, and 6% to 8.9% year-over-year due to a volatile market environment and less investor interest in the asset class as expected. Benefiting from continuing strategic investments in our core client groups, diamond and black card clients grew to 8,560, up 3.3% quarter-over-quarter and 8.8% year-over-year, among which the number of black card clients increased by 20% year-over-year. As the transaction value of private equity mutual funds and insurance products recovering in the quarter, our one-time commission more than doubled quarter-over-quarter to RMB207 million, but still down 16.1% year-over-year due to less public securities distributed. Net revenues from other service fees for the second quarter of 2022 were RMB46.4 million, a 44% increase from the corresponding period in 2021 primarily due to more value added services Noah offers to our high net worth clients since the Shanghai lockdown. As for our segmented results, net revenues from the Wealth Management segment were RMB509 million, down 18.7% year-over-year and 12% quarter-over-quarter due to a slowdown in transaction value during the quarter."
