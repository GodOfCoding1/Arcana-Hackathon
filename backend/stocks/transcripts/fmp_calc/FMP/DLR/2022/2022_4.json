    "content": " In the fourth quarter, we experienced nearly 90% customer retention and a further reduction in churn to just 0.8%, marking the lowest level in nearly 3 years, as our customers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 digital infrastructure requirements continue to increase, but the prospect of future availability is decreasing. In terms of earnings growth, we reported fourth quarter core FFO per share of $1.65, consistent with the low end of our implied guidance range for the fourth quarter and down 1% on both a sequential and year-over-year basis, given a seasonal acceleration in operating expenses, a significant uptick in interest rates and a full quarter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s dilution associated with the acquisition of Teraco on August 1. Focusing on top line, data center revenue growth on a constant currency basis improved steadily throughout 2022 increasing by 4% year-over-year in the fourth quarter compared to a 1.8% decline in the first quarter, demonstrating the turn in our core operations that we flagged last quarter. And just to underpin Andy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s kind of position around the broader reach, I think one of the things that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also driving a lot of traction and value to both our enterprise and our hyperscale customers as an open ecosystem that really accelerates the growth of the enterprise and they can solve more use cases and more markets on PlatformDIGITAL."
