    "content": " Second, the improved re-leasing spreads we saw last quarter continued in 2Q, and we remain focused on offsetting the impacts of rising costs throughout our pipeline of new opportunity and development; third, our transformation into a leading global data center solution provider remains on track with our investment in Teraco expected to close within the next two weeks; and finally, our core FFO per share results exceeded consensus for the quarter, though we tempered our expectations for the second half and full year 2022, principally due to continued FX headwinds as we reaffirmed our constant currency core FFO per share guidance for 2022. So I see two possible outcomes there: one being called just a sense of greater pricing power and higher rates tied to the sharp reduction of near-term availability, which should be favorable to Digital given our standing in market; and then also likely to be potentially some winners and losers as it relates to the various developers, including Digital seeking to bring new inventory online in that market."
