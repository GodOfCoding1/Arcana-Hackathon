    "content": " As disclosed in last night's press release, we generated record revenue, record adjusted EBITDA, and year-over-year same-store sales growth of 50% and 9% sequentially. This fiscal year, we generated $14.6 million of adjusted EBITDA, up 17% versus fiscal 2021 and 83% versus fiscal 2020. Adjusted EBITDA for Q4 2022 was a record $5 million, representing our 11th straight quarter of positive adjusted EBITDA, up 18% versus Q3 2022 and up 206% versus Q4 2021, and we are extremely pleased to have set this new record. For $60 a year or $5 a month, ELITE membership offers our customers access to exclusively ELITE flash sales, limited edition and exclusive ELITE branded products, discounts on delivery, and discounts across High Tide's global e-commerce accessories portfolio among other benefits at non-cannabis retailers and restaurant partners across Canada. In the fourth fiscal quarter ended October 31, 2022, the company recorded consolidated revenue of $108.2 million, representing an increase of 101% year over year and 14% sequentially. However, with Q4 results now available, we can look at it on an annual basis and see that non-cash working capital changes represented a use of cash of $4.6 million in fiscal 2022, just less than half the drag compared to fiscal 2021, where it was $9.9 million. For context, I know that our adjusted EBITDA has almost doubled in the past two years from $8 million in fiscal 2020 to $14.6 million in fiscal 2022, and merely annualizing our last quarter puts us at $20 million run rate. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. Your line is now open."
