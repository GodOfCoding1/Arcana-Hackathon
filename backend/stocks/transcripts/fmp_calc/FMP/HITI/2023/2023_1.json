    "content": " As disclosed in Friday's press release, we generated record revenue and adjusted EBITDA for the second consecutive quarter as well as a 64% improvement in free cash flow from our operations. Again, we're tightening up our shift, focusing on optimizing cash flow from operations, slowing down new store expansion and margin enhancing initiatives including Fastendr, ELITE and our white-label program gaining momentum, we expect to once again increase our rate of Canadian store expansion once we have reached our objective of becoming free cash flow positive later this calendar year. In the first quarter ended January 31, 2023, the company recorded consolidated revenue of $118.1 million, representing an increase of 64% year-over-year and 9% sequentially. The good news is being the market leader already in Canada, you know, it's up to us we can practically dictate terms on slowing down and picking up stores when we need or ramping up organic growth like I said in my prepared remarks, we're getting a lot of high quality real estate sites offered to us by some major landlords in the country."
