    "content": " Since we spoke last quarter, we've continued to aggressively execute on our product road map and serve our customers while working hard to get to a leaner operating model, including by slowing our hiring and significantly lowering third-party spend, but the macro environment has continued to soften, inflation is at a four-year high, and our customers are experiencing bare markets and equities and crypto. That is why we like our position with no debt and $6 billion of corporate cash on hand that provides strength, flexibility and financial runway to continue serving our customers, executing on our product roadmap, and evaluating potential acquisitions. Your line is open. Your line is open. And the only thing I would add to that is some of the things on the near-term road map that we've mentioned before, in particular, retirement accounts and making improvements for our more advanced customers we think those will drive meaningful net deposit increases over time as well. Your line is open. Your line is open. Thanks for taking the question. Your line is open. Your line is open. Thanks for taking the question. Thanks for taking the question. Your line is open.
