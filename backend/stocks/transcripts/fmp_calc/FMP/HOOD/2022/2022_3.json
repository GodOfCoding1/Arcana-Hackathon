    "content": " So after building a wait list of more than 1 million people since May, we're excited that we rolled out the beta of the Robinhood Wallet, our self-custody Web 3 wallet to the first 10,000 customers last month. Looking at net interest revenues, which is a growing part of our revenue mix, it reached a new high of $128 million in Q3, up over 70% from Q2 and driving over 35% of total revenue as the Fed continued to increase rates. As we consider what we see today for the forward Fed curve, customer balances and deposit rates,as well as a decrease in our margin book and securities lending so far in the quarter, we anticipate Q4 net interest revenues will be up by roughly $25 million from Q3. But I think the things that we do get to are going to be tremendous, and we're going to continue to have good velocity, and we think if we keep doing both of these things, if we keep improving the product quality of our existing products and rolling out really impactful new products, we're going to deliver a lot of shareholder value over time. It's a variety of types of companies that we might look at, whether it's acquisitions that are focused at kind of rounding out our portfolio of licenses or technology, but then also just with the vision of democratizing finance for all and that being so much more broad than simply trading I think there's a number of ways that we could extend the product offerings that Robinhood offers to customers through M&A."
