    "content": " I think it\u2019s a great way to have customers using us for more than just investing direct depositing their paychecks into Robinhood and using us for anything that they would use their local bank for, except with lower cost and a much better customer experience. So as we continue to add these new products, while also adding more products to investing and crypto, we\u2019re confident in our ability to not only retain our existing customers, but significantly grow new ones over time. We expect to have the acquisition close later this year, and we think it\u2019s a great accelerant we intend to build from that base and roll out an awesome product to our customers in the UK first and then Europe and the rest of the world. This is one of the reasons why we\u2019re rolling out new products that we\u2019re excited about, like the Robinhood Cash Card, for example, that is going to help customers, particularly those that don\u2019t feel like they\u2019re able to really set aside extra money to start investing with roundups and the roundup matches that Robinhood provides is giving them an opportunity to contribute. And the way \u2013 the reason we\u2019re saying that we believe improvements to the experience for advanced customers will help everyone is, whenever there\u2019s an issue since these customers are more engaged, they\u2019re more likely to run into them than a typical customer. And some of the things that we\u2019re doing there on the new Cash Card side, you\u2019ve heard us talk about direct deposits and getting customers to deposit their paychecks into Robinhood."
