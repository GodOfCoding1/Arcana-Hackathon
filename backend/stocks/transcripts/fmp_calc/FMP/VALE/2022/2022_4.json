    "content": " As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, and the recording will be available on the company's website at vale.com at the Investors link. Before proceeding, let me mention that forward-looking statements are being made under the safe harbor of Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1996. Actual performance could differ materially from that anticipated in any forward-looking statements comment as a result of macroeconomic conditions, market risks, and other factors. With us today are Mr. Eduardo De Salles Bartolomeo, Chief Executive Officer; Mr. Gustavo Pimenta, Executive Vice President of Finance and Investor Relations; Mr. Marcello Spinelli, Executive Vice president of Iron Solutions; Mr. Carlos Medeiros, Executive Vice President of Operations; Ms. Deshnee Naidoo, Executive Vice President of Energy Transition Materials. First, Mr. Eduardo Bartolomeo will proceed with the presentation on Vale's fourth quarter 2022 performance. Thank you very much. 2022, we substantially derisked and reshaped Vale. And we are simplifying our business portfolio, enabling a greater focus on our core businesses. On top of that, we drew up a plan for the Vale of the future, a company that promotes sustainable mining, fosters low carbon solutions and remains capital disciplined. Before going to our performance in Q4, let me just reinforce that we just announced a new organization design for Vale's Executive Committee, which will strengthen our core business, broaden technical excellence and improve project execution. I'm also very happy to announce the appointment of J\u00c3\u00a9r\u00c3\u00b4me Guillen as our first Independent Director for our Energy Transition Materials business, in line with the new management model that we had laid out during Vale Day. As well, we continue to make substantial progress on the minority sale, and expect to share additional details with you still in the first half of this year. In iron solutions, we delivered strong results. We find sales up 24%, combined with a strong price realization. On the project side, the Gelado project is now under commissioning, and that help us make us very confident about our production guidance. In our energy transition materials business, our nickel production was steady with sales up 30% and production up by 6%, mainly due to the excellent performance of our Sudbury mines, which delivered the highest production rates since 2019. Also, On\u00c3\u00a7a Puma had the best annual production in the last five years. In copper, it was a quarter of important maintenance activities in Salobo and Sossego to ensure asset integrity, which is paving the way for higher production rates in 2023. We successfully completed the startup of Salobo III, which will add 30 to 40 kilotons per year of copper at peak product. On product strategy, I would highlight Vale's long-term agreement with General Motors to supply battery-grade nickel sulfate. In our quest to become a leader in sustainable mining, we continue to deliver in many of our public commitments such as in human rights, Amazon forest protection and the safety of our Dams. We just announced a $1.8 billion dividend for payment in March, while remaining committed to our buyback program, about 42% completed. Carlos Medeiros now has the challenge of accelerating the implementation of Vale's management model, which will promote greater safety and reliability on Vale's operations. Rafael Bittar was promoted to the Executive Team, implemented with excellence our Tailings & Dams management model, and now he will lead our technical office, which incorporates Safety and Operational Excellence, Mineral Exploration and operational innovation. As you can see, we designed our organizational structure for the efficient management of our operations and the development of innovative solutions for a carbon-neutral society. There is no other company like Vale, which combines volume and quality, innovative products and supply chain to deliver the decarbonization solutions that the steel industry needs. As you can see on the chart, we are projecting a higher average iron content in our iron ore portfolio starting in 2023. Just as a reference of how much value we can generate on quality, each one percentage point increase in average iron content corresponds to around $550 million of incremental EBITDA. The commissioning of the plus 20 project in the S11D and the Gelado project, which I already mentioned, will help us achieve growth, higher quality and better prices. In the Southern Eastern and the Southern Systems, we are increasing concentration process to deliver high-quality feedstock with the four filtration plants in Itabira, Vargem Grande and Brucutu that we delivered recently. And concentration is key to a high-quality, low carbon supply, reason why we signed up for the development of mega hubs in the Middle East. And finally, we are also about to start up our first green briquette plant in the first half of 2023. In our energy transition material business, we have the right assets in the right jurisdictions, making us the ideal partner for delivering high-quality products to our customers. In 2022, we entered into strategic nickel supply agreements with Northvolt and with General Motors, in addition to an MOU for nickel processing between PTVI, Huayou and Ford Motor Company. This project is a natural extension to our business, offering diversified sales with a greater footprint in the North American EV market. Copper production declined by 15% to 253,000 tonnes in 2022 due to extended maintenance at the Sossego mill during the first half of the year and additional maintenance required at Sossego and Salobo. With the maintenance completion and the startup of Salobo III, our copper production should grow materially in 2023. With that, we have the will and the conditions to take Vale to the leadership of a sustainable mining on the critical minerals world. Vale is around 90% adherent to the requirements of the global industry standard for tailings management, which gives us confidence that we will be 100% compliant by 2025. And we will continue to pursue the highest safety standards and operational excellence, making sure safety is incorporated into the company's culture. At Vale, we are making sure that sustainable mining is at the core of all our actions. On our journey to reduce Scope 1 and 2 emissions, we established a natural gas supply agreement for the pelletizing plant in S\u00c3\u00a3o Luis. We are also testing Biochar in our metallurgical and pelletizing processes, while progressing with the conversion of the two pelletizing plants to green briquette in Tubar\u00c3\u00a3o, as mentioned before. We protected and recovered 51,000 hectares in 2022, bringing the total to 172,000 hectares since 2019 or about 34.4% of the long-term goal. On the human rights, 100% of Vale's operations in Brazil are covered by human rights due diligences. In 2023, we will start a pilot project to benefit 30,000 people from areas neighboring Vale's operation and in other locations. In Brumadinho, we delivered 58% of the commitments set by the reparation agreement. In Mariana, the Renova Foundation provided 315 housing solutions in 2022. In conclusion, we have materially derisked Vale, and we are delivering on our commitments to a safer and more sustainable company. With that, I am sure we are building a better Vale. Now I'll pass the floor to Gustavo, who will detail our financial results, and I'll get back to Q&A at the end. As you can see, we delivered a solid $5 billion EBITDA in Q4, $1 billion higher than Q3 2022. Price realization for iron ore fines also contributed to our better performance, and I'll provide more details about that on the next slide. In others, the main driver was the $224 million one-off tax agreement in Para, which I will cover later in my presentation. So, back to iron ore price realization. Our average premium was $1.6 per ton, up $1 versus Q3 as a result of better sales mix. You can see this effect on provisional prices in current quarter, which contributed with $5.3 per ton. Before the adjustments for moisture and FOB sales, price realization was about $107 per ton, 8.5% above the benchmark price. So, in summary, we delivered a realized price of $95.6 per ton, up $3 per ton versus Q3 despite a decrease in benchmark prices of $3.3 per ton. Now, moving to iron ore all-in costs. As you can see at the bottom of the table, our EBITDA breakeven cost came down by $2.8 per ton to $48.5 per ton. This is explained by three main factors; first, the 18% decrease in sales from third-party purchases, which contributed to $1.2 per ton in our C1. Second, our freight performance, which contributed with a cost reduction of $3.6 per ton due to lower bunker prices and better freight rates; and $1 per ton resulting from higher finance premium due to a better mix. On royalties, Vale joint approval with the government of Para in relation to the increase of TFRN, which is a fee to fund the government supervision of mineral production activities. This agreement, which covers the entire 2022 fiscal year, was fully recorded in Q4. Excluding this one-off event, the royalties line in Q4 would have been $2.7 per ton lower with all-in EBITDA breakeven of $45.8 per ton versus the $48.5 per ton reported. For 2023, we forecast a decrease of $2 per ton in the EBITDA breakeven due to higher average quality of our product portfolio and lower fuel costs. Our EBITDA more than doubled quarter-on-quarter, reaching $775 million. This was mainly driven by better price realization for both nickel and copper, as well as a 30% growth in nickel sales and a decrease in nickel unit cost by 16% in the quarter. In nickel, all-in unit costs dropped by $2,600 per ton mainly driven by lower cost of goods sold. As you may recall, in Q3, we had a carryover of high-cost inventories, which was a one-off impact to our Q3 cost of sales. For 2023, we project nickel unit cost to be relatively flat, as we don't expect to change our purchase feed strategy in the short term, despite higher expected productivity in Sudbury. In the midterm, we expect a reduction in nickel costs as we ramp up DBME. Copper all-in unit cost was up due to lower volumes from South Atlantic operations, after maintenance at Salobo and Sossego plants. As you can see, free cash flow generation was largely impacted by working capital and CapEx, which are usually higher in Q4. The working capital variation is largely explained by the $2.1 billion increase in accounts receivable, mainly due to higher accrual sales volume for iron ore, together with the positive effect of $21 per ton on higher iron ore provisional prices. These invoices will be collected in Q1 this year, and we expect the effect on working capital to revert in the following quarters. We also repurchased around $1 billion in Vale shares in Q4, which is aligned with our capital allocation strategy. Since April 2021, we bought back 683 million shares or 13% of the initial number of outstanding shares. Also yesterday, we announced a $1.8 billion in dividends to be paid in March 2023. So before opening up for questions, I would like to reinforce the key takeaways from today's call. As Eduardo mentioned, Vale redesigned its Executive Committee to ensure a fit-for-purpose organization with greater focus on our operations and on delivering solutions for the global energy transition. In that sense, we are taking actions to serve a growing market demand for quality products, leveraging on our unique mineral endowment and innovation capabilities. For example, the high-grade pellets and briquettes, the mega hubs initiatives and the low-carbon nickel products. And finally, we remain highly committed to a disciplined capital allocation process, as evidenced by our highly accretive buyback program and dividend payout. Now, I would like to open the call for questions. We advice that the question should be asked in English  Please, restrict your questions to two at a time. On the note of still of cash returns, right, Gustavo, I mean, Vale has been very active on the buybacks over the past quarters. In this context, I mean, the stock has related as well, right, I mean, versus Australian peers. So in this context, Gustavo, I mean, how do you see the balance, right, of now sustaining this buyback, right, in the context of, let's say, a higher priced share vis-\u00c3\u00a0-vis paying that balance in extraordinary dividend. I mean, looking forward, right, given the deflationary pressures we're seeing, right, I mean, the oil price is still quite depressed. I mean, if you think of freight rates, Brazil to Bay & Long, the number is $16, so still below the freight rate that you guys are booking. Thank you very much. So on the first one, as you know, we have a very attractive dividend policy, right, the 30% EBITDA less sustaining, which is somewhat close to a 50% payout. And on the buyback, as you know, we've been walking the talk, delivering and executing on the buyback, especially when prices are softer. Quite frankly, we continue to believe that even at the current levels, this is probably one of the best, if not the best investment that we have, buying back shares. We continue to believe that, these investments at the current levels is highly accretive for our shareholders. On the cost, I mean, the guidance that we have provided for 2023 is about 47. Certainly, year-to-date, freight rates are better, about $3 altogether, so that could be an upside. Hello, good morning, and thanks for taking my question. So as you mentioned, we expect the start-up this year for the first industrial plant in the first half, second -- in the second half. So this is the year for test, so industrial test in our clients. We've been developing the blast furnace briquette, and we've been testing around Brazil in more than all the kind of size of blast furnace. So we're going to explore the seaborne, all the impact in the vessel. So for this year, it's about test. And for next year, we'll be evolving in our agenda to expand our production to the mega hubs and to our clients in other parts of the world. Rafael, I'll relay the question for Deshnee to go over the performance. I think as we've been continuously saying, we have unique assets and opportunity in the, what I say, revolution energy of the world. He is 10 years in Tesla, he's been true and made what we know what is the EV world today. So he will help us a lot on guiding us, on helping us and the Board together with me and other peers that we're going to construct to unlock the tremendous value that we have inside this business. We are looking for other profiles as well that will help us with underground mining for sure, for -- with the base metals experience. So when we said, let's carve out the business, let's ring fence base metals is exactly to attract talented top people. And again, I'm so glad that he took the challenge to come and extract this unperceived value of the base metals business at Vale. So if I look at nickel and as we guided at Vale Day, nickel will be very similar to the production level that we achieved last year but with two changes. We will take the Onca Puma Furnace 1 down in quarter four, and we will take the Creighton shaft down for overhaul in quarter three. But despite that and because of the productivity gains that Eduardo mentioned in terms of Sudbury, we are still expecting to keep production largely flat in the rest of the business. And outside of Sudbury and after completing the PTVI furnace for rebuild last year, PTVI will give us a delta 10,000 tons in the year. But I think because of the seasonal impacts of P&P that we generally do in the first half, we'd have a similar year for nickel where you see the production back ended to the second half, including sales as well. So copper, there's three changes that will happen this year. The first one is the North Atlantic, where we'll see about a delta 10,000 tons year-on-year, and that's largely from the improved support that we did last year following some of the seismicity events we've had that we've since supported. And it was great to see not only did Eduardo mentioned, nickel had a great quarter last quarter, but so did copper for us out of Sudbury. And turning to Salobo quickly, we've now moved this into a very structured program where we've mapped out not only all of the risk based on loss profile, but the action that we need to follow to both catch up on some of the backlog maintenance, but as well as keep up to the maintenance schedule that we've had. And again, we have had a good January, which tells us that we are on the right plan. That will give us about a delta 45,000 tons from last year's performance across both Salobo I and II plant as well as the Sossego plant. But the real win for us this year is making sure that we can continue on the ramp-up plan of Salobo III plant, which will give us about a delta of 50,000 plus in the year. And again, Rafael, that will be back ended, right, just because of the nature of the ramp-up curve that we have. But we're very happy to report that as of today, both lines are operating in Salobo III. So the way to look at the performance, nickel similar to last year with some of the exceptions I mentioned. Copper, we are targeting the guidance, and it will come from the delta that we're going to get in terms of the maintenance that we are doing because of the Salobo III ramp-up that ended into the second half of the year. If you could share some updates in regards to the process, right, of potentially selling a 10% stake in the division, that would be very helpful, right, especially in regards to the timing of concluding the transaction. On Base Metals, it's moving quite well. Quite frankly, we are expecting to have news in more details as we said before in the first half of 2023 discussing the opportunity with different parties of great parties that we think is going to add a lot of value to this story. This is a business that should be investing in new platforms going forward that I think it's going to be highly accretive, right, good level of returns and so on. I think the new government has been vocal in the sense that they are also reinforcing a desire to settle, which we all think it's a good thing. So, our expectation is that we'll be able to find a resolution and sell the renegotiation this year in a format that works for everybody. Thank you very much. Do you see that more coming from a multiple re-rating, or do you think that it's more really the performance of the business that unfortunately, even though in the last few months, it has improved, over the last several years it hasn't been stellar. And then the other question if I may, Gustavo, has to do with the CSLL recent decision by the FDF. Potentially, the government will be able to get the money on tax disputes before the process or the disputes come to an end on an exhaust on the legal avenues. And also continuing with the tax situation, there was a proposal, provisional measure that would change the transfer pricing practices in Brazil. Thank you very much. Carlos, I'll let Gustavo go to the second one. But again, maybe all the above that you mentioned because let's be frank. I think the name of the game here, I've been saying that for a long time, it's execution. Because we believe that doing the right incentives, the right motivations will allow us to improve our performance. It's happening, by the way. The governance that we are building together is around attracting people like I just mentioned, Jerome and others that you see in the next months as we evolve in the design of this governance. That's a good question, a fair question to answer. So, just bear in mind that if eventually we don't have a right proposal because what we want with this is an anchor to promote the acceleration of the execution. So if I'm able to bring somebody that shares the same perception of value, of -- like I mentioned that J\u00c3\u00a9r\u00c3\u00b4me did as a Board member, or Ensca  as a partner, a financial partner, a strategic partner that can help us, again, accelerate the execution. We want to make this business really, really excel. It's not only because Vale has re-rated, as I think Leo mentioned. And not evidently, if I move the green metals, copper, nickel, cobalt to a separate entity, that makes it easier to people understand the criticality and the growth that is coming. That's the next reason why we're doing that, because if you understand the needs of cash for this business, we are talking huge amount of money. So sorry for the long answer, Carlos, but it's all of the above. It's unacceptable to be re-rated like -- rated everybody, I'm talking about Vale. So, long answer, sorry, but that's a fundamental thing for us. I will ask Gustavo to go over the -- \n So, Carlos, just to complement quickly here. On the tax, the CSLL, we've booked 100% of the potential impact on Vale in Q4, which was $150 million. So that's fully provisioned, including the interest and penalties. So you probably heard there has been discussions around giving some relief on penalties, which we are following closely. But at this point, it's fully reserved, $150 million of impact in Q4. On the transfer pricing, we saw it very positively, actually, because I think the view here is that the regulation will follow the OECD principles, which is what Vale already follows. So I think to a certain extent, it gives transparency and clarity on the regulation that Vale has been already following so far, was a positive move. And the second one, just to add on the question about Base Metals, we've seen and we heard that potential partners could be either a player in the automotive sector or a financial partner. So short-term pellet business, agglomerated business now is pellet. But actually, blast furnace pellet in the last quarter, we had some adjustment in the demand because of all the problems in the energy in Europe. So far they have some adjustments in their price, but the demand is there when you see the demand and the production and the level that we announced in our guidance. And one thing is they are \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and it's funny, because I expected that Europeans will come in the first moment for the mega hubs, all the strategy that we have to improve the production for pellets, and they are really interested in that. And so far, they are already investing in some places in the \u00e2\u0080\u0093 where we have Duqm that is in Oman, also Household Care in Saudi Arabia. Here just on your second question, look, we are keeping this certainly close to us in terms of details of potential interested parties. What I can say at this point is we are looking at potential partners that believe on the energy transition, believe on what Eduardo highlighted earlier in terms of electrification of everything, EV transition, that sees the long-term value of base metals, right, and is willing to support our strategy. My first is, I think, a hard one, but I would like to hear your thoughts. What I'm hearing from this call is there is a big change happening at Vale, and you're positioning the company to be a key player in a world that's going to be very different. And indeed, the company has very unique assets, both in the base metals and in the iron ore space to kind of deliver that. But we are still a few -- I don't know, there is a gap of time until we get there. And in the meantime, we're, of course, looking at what's happening. And the other question was -- sorry, it's going to be a bit more boring. If you look at this iron solutions business is there's a fundamental shift that we are trying to push on everybody's mind and ourselves, by the way. That's why we redesigned the organization, taking Spinelli completely focused on the marketing and the strategy, bringing mid-year to face the most immediate challenge that you mentioned. That will bring exactly that percentage point that I mentioned to our -- to the model that you model because, of course, we have to be on the lowest quartile. We are -- we have the bad assets with some cost pressures, but we're doing final cost. That's -- and if we dilute for 340 as you model, obviously, we will help. But fundamentally, it's a percentage of iron ore quality. Remember the slide on the presentation that we showed that this year, we improved like 0.7 percentage points, but we want to improve like two-point percentage. Like I know if you remember Vale Day, we put Caraj\u00c3\u00a1s being able to concentrate to 67. And we're going to do a webinar about that, by the way, just -- it's not a place to announce these kind of things, but we're doing a webinar to give even more details about that for you, because people are not factoring that. We mentioned that in Vale Day, and we're going to talk a little bit more. Second one, I'll try not to repeat my whole spiel about Base Metals. But that's -- it's ridiculous undervalued, everybody, not only us. The kind of demand that's coming over us of nickel and copper or cobalt and everything, on lithium, et cetera, it's not priced. So I think if you asked me where the key points are, delivering the guidance, delivering the effectiveness of our current operations, because we still have great assets that are under -- that could perform better, I would say, perform, but they could perform better. They are getting better performance like in copper, as Deshnee mentioned, on nickel and the growth, because that is the growth. Those kind of assets are the ones that are going to bring growth to the market, and people are going to stop appreciating that. And you look at -- when you look at the percentage of the participation of Base Metals in our cash generation, and you can go back to your model, we do it, because you're underestimating the size of cash generation that we're going to be able to bring if we execute the projects. So that's why, again, we -- especially we focus our organization in that sense. So conceptually speaking, it's that. That's another extremely high avenue of growth, and you do much more better calculation than I do. It's a marathon, and people that believe in the marathon is going to make a lot of money as we are doing already, right. I think Vale has been really accretive, and it has a lot much to do. Eduardo, just complement Rodolfo's question on the second one on the cost. So Rodolfo, we are taking certainly the benefit of byproducts based on market prices. For 2023, we had guided copper at 3,200. It's better than last year as we're bringing Salobo online, resuming capacity at Salobo I and II and bringing Salobo III online. If I'm not wrong, they basically Para was trying to triple the taxes that they charged, and you actually reported higher royalties or higher expenses with royalties in your iron ore business this quarter. But then again, we're now seeing lower bunker prices as you mentioned, lower freight rates. On the TFIM, the increase is when -- it's in real, actually, it's around BRL8. So, in dollars, about $1.6 per ton from the north, right? Part of the increase will be dedicated for local investments that we're planning to do, social related and others. So, that's the impact you're going to see from now on. Daniel, it's Spinelli here. So, you're right, there is a movement that for us, it's better than our competitors. And what we believe today is that our long-term price is -- for the last -- the 70 that used to be in the past, now is 90 despite all those ups and downs in terms of cost. So, -- and again, it's important to say we were the benchmark last year in terms of all-in costs because of our high-grade ores. And that mid to long-term strategy that we see, the premiums will play a very important role to be -- to make Vale in the first quartile of the cost rate -- of the cost curve. So, I just had one question on Base Metals. I'm just concerned, I guess, around potential for a conflict of interest as in the low nickel and copper prices, but Vale shareholders want high prices. I think, I'm going to push on Gustavo's remarks in the end. The organization, after the reshaping, as we exit all the assets that were draining cash inside Vale, we were able to repurpose our people. In Base Metals, energy transition, now, we need to educate ourselves with any transition materials. It's -- the opportunities are huge, as we discussed during the call, and execution of the projects and the operations are key. I think if any of our -- the check box list is, we've been very critical to assign value to our shareholders and to our stakeholders. This is a society, as we discussed before, has to perceive Vale as desired, not only Vale, I mean, mining, we're not in this game alone. And when that does happen, I would truly believe that not only Vale, but the whole sector will be re-rated. So, with that, I would like to thank you for your attention and your questions."
