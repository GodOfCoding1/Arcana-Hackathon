    "content": " It still our relationship with the Supreme head controversies, we have now begun a new stage in this relationship. After 18 months of negotiations, we closed an agreement with the Supreme community ending a 15 years dispute. To own our relationship, we visited the village of the Supreme and it was a moment of mutual respect and trust. We also believe that all activities that may directly interfere in these territories must strictly respect pre, prior and informed consent. In July, we concluded the de-characterization of two structures, Baixo Jo\u00c3\u00a3o Pereira dam and Dike 4 were the first ones of the five dams to be eliminated this year. Since 2019, we have eliminated nine structures. And by the end of 2022, we will eliminate three more reaching 40% of the program. And in some cases, pioneering, this is the case of B3/B4 dam currently at emergency level 3, using only remotely operated equipment. We have already removed close to 40% of the tails, much faster than our plan. By then, we expect value to have no dam on the critical safety conditions. We had an operationally challenging second quarter, which made us revise our iron ore and copper guidance for the year. In iron ore, while our systems in the south had a solid performance. In the Northern system, we were impacted by one-off moisture issues and the ongoing restrictions in licensing. In Base Metals, essential maintenance works affected nickel and copper operations. In our climate change agenda, we reached important milestones towards meeting our targets. As part of our Powershift program, we received our second 100%-electric locomotive. In April, we signed an MoU with Nippon Steel Corporation to pursue ironmaking solutions, including the usage of green briquettes. Since 2021, we engaged with clients representing almost 50% of our Scope 3 emissions. In portfolio optimization, we have progress with those two divestments that I have already mentioned. Finally, in capital allocation, we remain committed to returning cash to our shareholders, and I'll give you more details in the next slide. Yesterday, we announced the distribution of $3 billion in dividend in line with our policy. Last quarter, we announced the third buyback program for up to 500 million shares. After the completion of the third buyback program, you will have repurchased almost 20% of the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s outstanding shares. Now I turn the floor over to our Vice President of Base Metals, Deshnee for her remarks. Thank you, Eduardo, and good morning, everyone. That said, in the quarter, our overall base metals production was impacted by major maintenance works both planned and unplanned. Most of the planned maintenance related to the backlog, we are catching up on following the two years of deferrals as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic restrictions and controls. In nickel, we have planned major maintenance at our refineries and smelters across Canada, the UK and Indonesia. And our sales for the quarter were covered by inventories we built in quarter one, in anticipation of this. In copper, we completed the extended major maintenance at Sossego. At Salobo, additional plant maintenance work was performed during the quarter with additional preventative maintenance being scheduled in the second half to address poorer than expected asset conditions discovered after key maintenance activities performed in the quarter. It is for these reasons we have revised our copper guidance to the 270,000 to 285,000 tons. I would like to mention, however, that maintenance works at Salobo I and Salobo II plant do not change the plans for Salobo III, which is still scheduled for commissioning by the end of this year. For quarter three, we continue with our planned major mine and mill maintenance programs across Canada. Whilst our nickel refineries will be running with nickel concentrate inventories, largely built up already. Canadian copper production should be temporarily affected though, as we produce and sell concentrates in a much shorter cycle than nickel. Looking at our financial performance in particular price, you will see that despite relatively flat sales volumes quarter-over-quarter, our price realization lagged market, especially in copper. As you can see in the graft in the left side, copper price realization was largely impacted by provisional pricing, as a result of the copper forward curve price falling in the quarter. By the end of quarter one, we had some 44,000 tons of copper marked at $10,400 per ton. At the end of quarter two, we had just under 32,000 tons of copper marked at $8,300 per ton. This represents a negative effect of about $3,000 per ton of copper. In nickel, we had a positive balance of premium from product mix with a strong price realization achieved for our Class I products and a positive effect from our quotational period. The nickel price lag was primarily due to fixed pricing, specifically our hedging program. In the first quarter, we started the implementation of the nickel revenue hedging program for 2023. While the nickel realized price for the second quarter was impacted by the strike price of circa $20,200 per ton, which reflected in the quarter's results. The average price for the complete hedge position was increased from circa $21,400 to just over $23,000 per ton. This quarter, we have made good progress in our strategic agenda. With an expected annual production of 25,000 tons of contained nickel to produce over 110,000 tons of nickel sulfate, this offers us both diversified sales and an accelerated entry point into North America's burgeoning electric vehicle supply chain, as we are seeing from the growing demand of battery production across the continent. Together with TISCO and Xinhai, we expect to start up the 73,000 ton ferronickel facility in 2025 and in line with our overall EV strategy. We have signed last week, two key MoUs with Ford, one for a three-way partnership with PTVI and Huayou in the Pomalaa project in Indonesia and the other to explore opportunities with Vale across the EV value chain. First, I'd like to remind you our journey since , remember that we lost 25% of our capacity. We always talk about capacity, volume, but I want to emphasize the word flexibility here today. The main actions to review the flexibility were based on the resumption itself, the new licenses with anticipation of projects, what were, and what are the main challenges that we are considering in these actions. So regarding the resumption plan, dam safety was the key issue. Remember all the saga of the vibration tests, the blasting, backlogs coming from the stoppage. So we've been overcoming month by month and we brought back all sites, not in the full capacity yet, but all operations are on. The answer is no and yes, the license process is getting more sophisticated. We have higher level details in the south, in the north of Brazil. Finally, regarding projects we had impacts due to COVID and the macro conditions as we are anticipating some project, we may have some adjustment during the implementation. So in summary, we evolve it a lot, reducing the first impact of Brumadinho, risking the dams and the impact of the production. On the other hand, we still have to deal with the license process. In the north, Gelado project is almost accomplished. We expect a startup for Q4, new ore bodies, we overcame an important milestone for in three projects. And this, there is a room for improvement in this area also. In S11D, Abon crusher is done, plus 20, I want to drag your attention here. In the Southeastern system, Itabira suit is on time, we expect to bring in Q4, total dam construction is done and we are expecting the final permits by the end of Q3. It's in, we've been losing some flexibility during the first half of this year. In the beginning of the year, remember the heavy rain season. Secondly, we had to change this stockpile formation process in the north due to the moisture management. It was a consequence of a new front in the mining S11D, all related to safety issues that brought restriction to the system. The decision to produce or to sell more or less, involve several elements, including price, premiums and freight cost. This product high-silica, we can sell early in the chain as a standalone product. Recently, we announced a partnership with Shagang a new port to develop the pre-blending facilities in China. Looking forward in Q3, we expect Vale\u00e2\u0080\u0099s average premium will increase considering the higher volumes from Northern System and additional $30 per ton higher pallet premiums already negotiated. Thanks, Marcello and good morning, everyone. As you can see our second quarter pro forma EBITDA was $5.5 billion, $804 million lower than Q1 2022. The decline was caused mainly by the $28 per ton decrease on iron ore fines realized price and $4,400 per to decrease in corporate realized prices, following the decline reference prices during the quarter, which I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll discussion in more detail later. Excluding external factors, our EBITDA performance was impacted by $118 million cost increase, mostly explained by corrective maintenances at our base metals business. Despite the high inflationary pressure globally, it is important to highlight that we are on track to deliver our cost efficiency goal for the year, which is to keep our fixed cost plus sustaining CapEx flat versus 2021 levels in local currencies. Now, focusing on price realization. Vale\u00e2\u0080\u0099s C1 cash cost ex-third-party purchases increased by US$2.2 per ton for the first quarter, mainly driven by BRL average appreciation, higher fuel costs and the sale of inventories produced at higher cost in Q1, a carryover effect. Another important cost component is freight, which went from $18.1 per ton to $21.3 per ton, mainly reflecting the increase in bunker prices. As a result in Q2, Vale\u00e2\u0080\u0099s average freight cost was 30% lower than average to buy down Qingdao spot prices. In Q3, we expect additional improvement as premiums were negotiated close to $90 per ton. With that we maturely advanced our liability management program, extending the average tender of the portfolio with no relevant debt amortization in the next five years. As you can see in the next slide, we converted 41% of our EBITDA into free cash and use it as incremental liquidity to accelerate our share buyback program. To date, we have already executed 23% of our latest share repurchase program of 500 million shares. So before opening up the call for Q&A, I would like to reinforce the key takeaways from today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s call. Our reshaping program is mostly completed with the yesterday\u00e2\u0080\u0099s announcement of the sale of our stake at CSP, allowing management to focus on core assets that will benefit substantially from the energy transition trend. On production, we remain very disciplined on our value of our volume strategy. Finally, we remain highly committed to a disciplined capital location process as advanced by the announcement of a $3 billion dividend payment should be made in September and our continuous progress on the highly accretive share buyback program. Mr. Caio, your audio is available. So my first question is, given this worsening macro outlook that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re seeing with recessionary here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s building and your debt levels closer to the top of your expanded net debt range. And then secondly, on provisions associated with Renova, given some recent press articles that the President of the Brazilian Supreme Court wants to renegotiate values. Thank you very much. So if you look at last year, this year, so that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what we should expect us to continue to do. Regarding Renova and provision, look based on the information we have today we believe we have the right amount of provisions in our books. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve done this in the Q1, so we are feeling good about what we have. As you know, we are going through the revision of each one of the programs as we speak. Gustavo, if I can add just I think on the extraordinary dividend, because Caio asked that about specifically. As you said, we are walking the talk. You see the volatility in iron ore is huge, but we have to bear in mind that second semester is a very strong semester for third and fourth quarter. So we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to assess if there is a \u00e2\u0080\u0093 remember the bucket idea, first bucket safe, the second bucket growth, third bucket policy, fourth bucket buybacks. And if there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s any additional, we can pay an extraordinary dividend, yes. And third, if there is \u00e2\u0080\u0093 market comes better than we expect on the second semester, eventually there will be extraordinary dividend. Mr. Carlos, your audio is available. Thank you very much. Given the cost pressures that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re seeing across the industry and commodity price still elevated, any prices, certainly high. So as you guys saw in this quarter, we came above the levels that we are pointing to the end of the year. We continue to feel optimistic about what we had presented before, which means a C1 between $18.5 and $19 by the end of the year. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a lot of benefits already accruing, and they will accrue even more in the second half regarding the $1 billion savings program that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve announced last year. And they all lean, as we said, we expected to be very much in line with what we had last year. So this quarter was tighter in terms of premiums, as you saw, given the strategy that Spinelli laid out. But in the second half of the year with more volumes \u00e2\u0080\u0093 likely more volume coming from the north, we should expect all link to normalize towards what we had very much in line with last year. Carlos, thank you for the question. Let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s firstly, emphasize one thing. So when you say that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going after 400 million tons of level, and I want to emphasize another word that I mentioned of flexibility. And regarding the 400 million tons level two points here, the base to reach this is related to the margin of a volume if the market needs or not. So despite, we have a variation or deviation in the short-term 5 million tons or even 10 million tons and the mid-term strategy is on. So, we need the long-term strategy is, on and the pace, it depends on the market. So again it may take a longer time, but we will be connected to the necessity of the market. Imagine if you have, if you bring 30 million tons to this market today, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no necessity for that. We have logistics, we have a great jurisdiction to work, no institutional problems or even commercial problems with our clients, the opposite we have a very committed and strength relationship with our clients. So, we are the best choice to increase the capacitor in your future, but we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to behave as the leader of the market as we are, and don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t bring nothing more than the market needs. Mr. Leonardo, your audio is available. So, bringing Eduardo back to the discussion, Eduardo base metals for you has been a, let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s say a pet project and a super important angle, you know, the business very well. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been, I mean, Vale has been very vocal right on the turnaround of base metals for the past quarters. I mean, it was a very weak quarter, and in an all furnace several non-recurring issues impacting like maintenance, which are probably going to be reversed. So no one better than you to try to help us out, and understand. And the second point here on my side, maybe Spinelli can help. Unfortunately what we saw over the past quarter or so is quality premiums have been declining, and let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s say, Vale has been losing this relative advantage, and these negative effects have been impacting all around on pricing in iron ore delivered costs. Thank you very much. Leonardo, thanks for the question. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s my pet, petty project, that I 100% agree. Well, let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s start with the fundamentals. We have the best assets in nickel in the world, in Canada, Indonesia, in On\u00c3\u00a7a Puma for 60 years of life in On\u00c3\u00a7a Puma. Salobo III, as Deshnee just mentioned is coming on time on budget on this next quarter. So, we are pretty confident, we are delivering voices. Short term, we should be very concerned about what we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re talking, because people look at the bumps going to be bit harder. Sossego had a four month one-time stoppage, because we stayed two years to start to stop the plant. And we \u00e2\u0080\u0093 when we start to execute the maintenance, we discovered that we had to change a trunnion. So it was a four, five day stoppage that ended up being a four month. So again, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not concerned on the turnaround, on operational turnaround specifically on Sossego. Salobo had these issues, but as mentioned by Deshnee, we have \u00e2\u0080\u0093 we operate very well the mine. So, when the plant gets stable, we are going to be able to through that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s why our \u00e2\u0080\u0093 if you look at our second quarter or second semester, guidance is pretty strong on copper. We operate extremely well on the surface plants, because they even have idle capacity. We did a restoration in PTVI for the four months in the Furnace 4 extremely complex, first time ever that we do that, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s up and running already as we speak. So, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not really concerned about the turnaround specifically, because as we said, and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been repeating that we are going to extract value one or another, even if we have to bring a partner to operate to us, if we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not able to complete the turnaround, then I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m very confident. So, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not thinking that we have an issue to turn around copper initially speaking. What you mentioned, I think is important with stress. And that might answer a lot of questions that people has, is that we believe, and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a true \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a fact that base metal has a better life in its own. And there are always, I mentioned that I think might on the last call, on the last presentation that I did. That we have options like, first option, just keep doing, keep executing and market we appreciate the value that this business has, is not reflecting in our share price or in our value, in our market cap. Second, why don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you bring the private investor that sees value even in the downturn, because fundamentals of business didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t change, the business didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t change at all. So, but people that understand the business now that we have a job, that we have a real, real big asset or a real nice reserve. So, I can bring the private. We need first, execute; second, grow; third, structure; fourth, captured opportunity, but I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m pretty confident that Deshnee and her team are doing a great job to stabilize the business. You saw two years waiting for the maintenance, say with two years waiting for the maintenance in the third burden is smelter, not two years, but the Furnace 4 had to be done in pit in Indonesia. So, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m pretty confident that we are going to be able to extract the turnaround. The growth projects are coming on online, and on budget besides VBME that we had overrun. We are coming with news with Bahodopi as mentioned today, Indonesia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a great place. Formalize there, we are going to bring On\u00c3\u00a7a Puma to very soon to the board. We, as you \u00e2\u0080\u0093 as I mentioned at the beginning, we have a very good relationship with  now. So, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m really, really, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re right, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s my petty project. So, the market needs for quality and our strategy. We have pellet premiums for direct reduction $100, almost a $100 over $65. For blast furnace pellets over $65, $90, $100 almost at $90, $100 today. Low alumina, we have a lack of competitors with low alumina in the market with premium high premium. When you said about the margins in China it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a temporary situation, due to all the downstream uncertainties that we have. But we are confident that with all the air force of the government that view stabilized this demand, the downstream demand, and by the end of the year we have with a lack of competitor of high grade ores, and also the cost of the coke debt is not low, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not in the lower level, as we saw in the past that we can recover also the IOCJ premium level. So again, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a trend, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no return, but we can have some volatility in short term. And regarding our strategy, definitely we are the company that is investing in products, and in mine to bring high grade ores. We could increase the stockpiles in China, and press the whole portfolio of our company and also the market, but we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not doing that. So, we are sticked to the Vale over volume, and it is based in higher ore \u00e2\u0080\u0093 high grade ores. Our next question comes from Tiago Lofiego, with Bradesco BBI. Mr. Tiago, your audio is available. And then the second question also you commented about premiums, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re expecting improvement in the coming quarters. Tiago, thanks for the question. So, iron ore demand, let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s start with China. I think, we started to talk; we rely on the last question. So what we see, the first half, we had a huge problem with the COVID strategy, the small business, actually we see in few in our business more regarding the properties, regarding the constructions. Even production goal, as we had last year, we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have any Olympics in the first quarter of next year, and we have a economy in total different curve if you compare with last year. So, we have a delay in the infrastructure investment, they are committed to that. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been here about the 60% GDP the second half in China that can happen, infrastructure can support, manufacturing can also support. And what we see, they are talking this week about property as a security problem in China, because they can bring this to a problem there economy. So there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s another level of commitment, at least that that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s our forecast. Yes, but there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a support if you compare to last year in terms of demand. So we expect the downstream demand to be here by the end of this year, and especially in the first quarter or next year. So \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and also we can adjust the value of the volume Tiago, as we mentioned. Next China when we see our clients today, they're already booked in the third quarter. We talk about recession, but we don't see recession in their sales at least yet, but in the fourth quarter, they are in a more short term view. The main concerns are related to any restriction regarding the cost and the availability of energy and the coke, the thermal coal. So energy is a key issue by the end of the year in Europe, in part of the world that with the problem of the war. So again, that will be \u00e2\u0080\u0093 is still a problem. But on the other hand, in terms of premium, if you combine a better market in China, better margins and price supporting the growth, the late growth that will come by the end of the year in China and the necessity to save the Coke in the part of the world, that they don't have availability or the price will be high, that'll be the \u00e2\u0080\u0093 but what we expect a consumption of better products, so product-by-product. Today pellets, we see a good level for the direct reduction. So we see by the end of the almost the same level that we see today probably in pellet, in blast furnace pellet there's a downstream risk, but not that much. So there'll be wider gap between the pellets and then we've been developing a third way for the pellets to swing if we have more demand for direct reduction, can swing part of our production to feed this market or swing to blast furnace though. And BRBF, as I mentioned, the key point is competition and today as I mentioned, we see a support for upstream risk by the end of the year and the next quarter. Mr. Daniel, your audio is available. My first question is on the asset divestment front, you've done a tremendous job on diversifying away or actually focusing more on your car businesses after selling your co-operations, VNC, CSP, California Steel and so on, so forth. And on the same lines can you elaborate a bit on the potential on the merit of a potential IPO of the base metal division in \u00e2\u0080\u0093 I mean, given that you don't really need, you are in a solid balance sheet position, and you don't really need to raise capital to do the growth portion that is what commented on this business, right. We are perceived as iron ore company, so that's, we want to unlock that value, it's not unlock value. And you're exactly right, when we have this structure, we will be able to do different things that we cannot do today, but I'd like Gustav to speak a little bit more because he's having the discussion, together additioning\n Sure. So, on the potential transaction, we haven't decided that as Eduardo said if it's an IPO, non-IPO, but I think fundamentally what we are trying to achieve here is a more dedicated governance for base metals which we see a lot of merits for. But as I think you pointed out, we are cash story. Today, we appreciate that. And we are happy with that, and we continue to pursue that strategy. But base metals is different, it's a growth business. There's tremendous amount of momentum for EV transition, for electrification of the world, so all of that calls for different strategy. The final format we'll see, but that's how we are thinking about, and that's what we should expect us to pursue. Certainly the market today is not appreciative of a transaction, but we'll continue to look into that and bring that to you guys once we feel good about it. It's like a growth call and a youth call, but probably never going to let go the base metal business. If we want to bring partners, even its private, even if we go public, it's going to be a Vale\u00e2\u0080\u0099s and it's going to be a growth goal, raise currency, nobody has this front end commodities like we do. It's a matter of, because we believe better governance, we believe better partners would help us grow, but we don't want to lose our growth, of course, there's a huge amount of opportunities in the electric world, the transition \u00e2\u0080\u0093 the energy transition world. And we can do that by, with the timely manner. So just remember those two things yield core, growth core, but they're all valid core. So Daniel, let's talk more about the China market, Chinese marketing also European, in the big view \u00e2\u0080\u0093 a wider view about the world demand. So in China, what we expect for this next half. So we have the seasonality, don't forget the famous golden September that we restart the downstream demand. Usually there is a peak for the construction, many stimulus coming from the government. Lagging demand coming from infrastructure by the end of the year in Q1 2023 without any effect of the elections, they have the elections by the end of the year in November. So again, we see a trend, the COVID risk is there. But even after the elections, we see more power. In China, they have power, they have capacity to boost their production. So Europe, yes, they're well, so they have good prices, different level from last half, but in a very healthy way for Q3 sold out, Q4 some concerns about the energy, but let's bring the other about the word demand Southeast Asia blooming going really well, India, they are back. So we have a balanced market for the Q3 and we will produce more in the Q4, but not more than we had in the last years. Mr. Alex, your audio is available. First question on iron ore, any comments on China's plan to create some centralized buying entity. And then on the power, if I remember correct it  be power using gas, the cold, the carbon footprint, is that still the case, even with all the volatility in gas prices recently. Thank you very much. Well, thank you Alex. Well regarding this announcement, I think it's important to valley is a long term part of China. We just announced that naturally we are strength in this relationship, and we announce that the pre-blended strategy we are in more than 17 ports in China and blending facilities. We are concentrating ores in China, so we're expanding our relationship with the Chinese. So we truly believe that, always the market reflects the supply, the demand balance in a timely manner. And regarding the potentiality to invest in iron ore, they are deploying their strategy, put it in perhaps the strategy to secure the resource. And in this point we see as an opportunity for Vale, because we have the best asset in the world and the best possibility to bring capacity to the market in a very safe environment and with the logistics in place. Alex, thank you for the question on the Bahodopi project, so this project as guided earlier is an archive project, and we will produce 73,000 tonnes of ferro nickel in addition to the current PTVI production of around 70,000 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 I will say, now, 76,000 to 78,000 tons on the back of the furnace four rebuild that we have just completed. In terms of the of the structure of the project, we will build 100% of the mine. And then in terms of off-take for the first five years, this will be all the off-take will go to China co and after that PTVI will get to market its 49% of the share. And your question around LNG, that is still the plan. The solution hasn't been fully stitched but just this morning, Alex, we've got word from the government that this project will get into the President's National Strategic Projects, which means that this project will be prioritized in terms of the overall energy support as well. So, we still sticking with LNG. We know it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s might be a little difficult to source, the plant itself will be built by Xinhai. And yes, we will give you a further update on the next results call. Mr. Rodolfo, your audio is available. So, I guess most of my key questions, which I think were mostly on what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s happened on the cost side and the turnaround of these matters were already fully discussed. Well, the environmental process, the license process in Brazil and actually in all part of the world is getting, more sophisticated that I think is the best word here. So, we are bringing the best analysis to guarantee that we have protection and sustainable development in our area of action in Amazonia. So again, we have just an example, although we have the ITVs, our institution, I think we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been investing more than $140 million the last 10 years to bring genome analysis DNA to bring a faster analysis to guarantee that we are doing the right thing and working together with the agencies. Again, we could blame against that, but that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a reality, and we need to work hard and actually work together with agencies. We are, we had an delay in our, what we call this, this role in license is all the time we are, we have some small license that opened the pit, especially in the North Range had delays. So, we already in our guidance, we have this September, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going well. The other good thing that we already have, the plus 20, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a huge achievement. We have a space for the construction, and we can bring huge capacity to bring flexibility to this area of our business. So again, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a trend, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the level of the game now and need to be good. Mr. Liam, your audio is available. So we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen Semeando, is it looks like it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s finally getting off the ground. And we could see first production, perhaps in four years; given this is a direct competitor to your product suite. And then link to the short-term link to the previous question around kind of the iron ore licensing challenges, you previously told us that you wanted to get a 370 capacity at the end of this year, what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the latest sort of target for the end of this year. And if I could ask one final one just on base metals, lot of moving parts in Q2 and costs were quite a bit higher. Again the, projects that we have around the world that we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t comment we have some, but we considered in part of in our models that they will come, that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s part of the game, but don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t forget. And we can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t reinforce that the challenge that we have are regarding the license in the mine side, but we already have in place a infrastructure for logistics and ports in the environment that we really know and know how to manage. And also don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have any \u00e2\u0080\u0093 how can I say the institutional issues, so again, we are the best place to bring capacity in a structural mode. Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t forget that quality is the game, is the name of the game for the near year future in the future. So that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a lack of quality in terms of supply and even if you bring more supply coming from Semeando, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no risk for the strategy in near future. When you see the demand for high grade ore\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a huge demand. And the other point about the base to reach any number 370 or 400, it depends on the market, depends on the market. And when you talk about our capacity to produce, I appointed that we have three main areas to work. And we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been, evolving in a great journey. We are expecting the, two dams that are coming by the end of the year Itabiru\u00c3\u00a7u and Torto. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s okay, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s on track. The license can be, license delay can be an adjustment that we can do and also the projects adjustments. So, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not going to bring products that are not with the demand for them. Liam, just regarding your question on base metals cost, absolutely agree that, this was a, so not a good quarter. But I think the team and I are very happy about the tough decisions we took in terms of trying to get some of the foundations, right, with regards to the asset integrity. If I then turn to cost, I mean on the copper side, what was driving the copper cost in the quarter was, of course, the additional maintenance that we had to put both into Sossego and Salobo that affected our unit cost quite materially in the quarter, so a good number for us. And if I look at quarter one, on an all-in basis for copper, we would just over $4,5000 per ton in this quarter $6,300 as Eduardo advised as well. So, we are hoping by year end, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll get to at least that $4,000, just over $4,000 per ton in terms of the all-in cost for copper. So just so that we all are clear, the all-in excludes capital. So, if I look at nickel on quarter one and quarter two, we are around $8,500 in the first quarter, all-in and for quarter two, $12,500 per ton, which is a respectable number, because on nickel, we get to offset a lot of the byproducts. The byproducts in quarter two, let us down a bit, because not only did we have some challenges in copper in the South Atlantic operations, but we also lost a bit of copper from Coleman from an incident that we had in quarter one, which I also reported on, in the quarter. So, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve lost a bit of byproduct credits that we would typically get. But again, as Eduardo mentioned, in terms of all of the initiatives underway, we are currently at the downstream capacity that we need to maintain, the nickel guidance and hence the almost 25% increase half-on-half of nickel as well. So, when it all comes together, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re anticipating around an $11,500 to $11,700 per ton, in terms of the full year nickel, nickel all-in cost. Mr. Eduardo Bartolomeo at this time, you may proceed with your closing statements. Well first of all, thanks a lot for the interest in our call. A lot of questions, Good questions. I want to just reemphasize what the Gustavo mentioning here, Deshnee Naidoo  initial remarks. So, we mitigating the risk value with three years and a half after Brumadinho. Our ESG agenda in the top, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s embedded in our business. We did, our team did a really great job and reshaping, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s made us really proud. We cashed like $2 billion in drains, you know the numbers. Now, we have to focus on the core assets and we have extremely good reserves and reserve and resources and market is in our favor. As leaders in nickel, as leaders in iron ore, we are going to do what it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s needed with safety. And we are going to focus that we, I used to say, we have a Ferrari. Now we have to run it, run it like one, and we are going to do it. And later, just to reemphasize, we really trust the fundamentals of the industry. The energy transition is here, besides all the short term hiccups. We are building the Vale of a hundred years, not as the Vale for 81 years. But we are really, truly believing that we have the right moment. So do like us by Vale, the best investment that you can do it because we are extremely, extremely disciplined since day one. When we said we are going to, we have to capital location, we are doing what we say so best, investment, best growth opportunity effort that you can have in your hands."
