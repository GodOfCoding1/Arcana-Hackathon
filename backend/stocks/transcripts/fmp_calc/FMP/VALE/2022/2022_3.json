    "content": " I'm happy to announce and as Eduardo mentioned, we have approved our On\u00c3\u00a7a Puma's 2nd furnace project this quarter, which will see our nickel production grow by 15,000 tons on average per year in South Atlantic. So I think it just, it's a great movement, because somebody with track record that can offer obviously, within our Board of shareholders can help us see opportunities, help us unlock value, and see the value, as I mentioned before on my base metals discussion, it's only positive."
