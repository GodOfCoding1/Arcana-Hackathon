    "content": " You may now go ahead. You may now go ahead. We\u2019ve really focused on go-to-market resources as well as R&D, although I\u2019d say there is growth really across all elements of the business as we scale into the revenue growth that you\u2019ve seen us report the last few quarters. You may now go ahead. You may now go ahead. I think also, the land-and-expand strategy that we\u2019ve taken that has allowed us to show that we can actually generate incremental revenues from our client relationships across all of our products and in education really gives us a lot of comfort and optimism around what Q3 will look like. You may now go ahead. You may now go ahead. You may now go ahead. You may now go ahead. You may now go ahead."
