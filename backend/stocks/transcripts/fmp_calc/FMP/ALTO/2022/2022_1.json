    "content": " We expect the protein enhancements to be completed by early 2023, producing an additional $5 million annually in EBITDA based on current market prices. Subject to supply chain constraint delays, we plan to complete our improvements before fourth quarter contract negotiations began, producing an additional $5 million in EBITDA annually beginning in 2023. This year, we will spend approximately $6 million to complete the storage installation and expect this project to provide over $2 million of EBITDA annually with the payback in less than three years beginning in Q1 2023. For the first quarter of 2022, net sales were $308 million, up from $219 million in the first quarter of 2021, due to an increase in specialty alcohol gallons sold, higher average sales price per gallon and the addition of Magic Valley production. In the first quarter of 2022, 72 million production gallons were sold, of which 23 million gallons consisted of specialty alcohols in line with our previously stated 90 million gallons of annual contracted volume anticipated for all of 2022. SG&A expenses in the quarter were $7.6 million compared to $7 million in the first quarter of 2021, with a slight increase year-over-year being attributable to our acquisition-related accrual for future contingent payments for the Eagle acquisition of $800,000. This compares to a net income of $4.4 million, or $0.06 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2021. Finally, our balance sheet remains clean and strong with cash and cash equivalents totaling $36 million as of March 31, 2022, down approximately $15 million from December 31, 2021, largely reflecting our acquisition of our specialty alcohol distribution facility."
