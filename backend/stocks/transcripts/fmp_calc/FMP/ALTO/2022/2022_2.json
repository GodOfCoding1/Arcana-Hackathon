    "content": " Before I update you on our progress, I'll note we recorded positive net income and adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter of 2022, which included $22.7 million in cash from the USDA\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Biofuel Producer Program. As Mike mentioned, during the quarter, we recording income related to a $22.7 million cash grant from the USDA, which was part of the CARES Act to support companies that experience renewable fuel losses related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Increases include the USDA grant, higher accounts receivable and inventory balances, which were offset by $15 million invested in Eagle Alcohol, and over $15 million in capital improvements and repair and maintenance expenses already incurred for the six month \u00e2\u0080\u0093 first six months of 2022. And then, I mean, should we look at that as I think you've laid out $50 million in incremental EBITDA as part of these projects, should we just look at that, as you've pulled that forward two quarters or something along those lines. Yes, I would expect that there'd probably be well, it's difficult to say, because we actually had a number of interruptions, as you say, if you look on the total production rate that we had, as compared to capacity for the quarter, we were down a little bit, quarter-over-quarter, railroad interruptions or like, particularly for our western plants."
