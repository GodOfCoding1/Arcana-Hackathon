    "content": " We entered into a six-year term loan for up to $125 million announced today, recognizing the importance of accelerating our diversification growth strategies including carbon capture, sequestration, corn oil, protein and yeast expansion as well as RNG and natural gas pipeline installations. Bryon will review the financial details later, yet I'll highlight year-to-date through September 30, 2022, we have capitalized over $25 million of infrastructure improvements and spent an additional $3 million, in related costs that flowed through cost of goods sold further impacting both the operating margins and our bottom line results. For the third quarter of 2022, net sales were $337 million, up from $306 million in the third quarter of 2021, reflecting primarily the addition of our Idaho plant production. Specialty alcohol contributed 23 million gallons, increasing 18% over the third quarter 2021 due to expanded capacity and increased demand and we expect to exceed our contracted volume of 90 million gallons for 2022 by year-end. SG&A expenses were $7 million including expenses related to our Eagle Alcohol acquisition and higher stock compensation expenses, compared to $6 million in the third quarter of 2021. While fuel demand typically slows in late fall in the winter periods in comparison to the rest of the year, we are encouraged by recent crush margin improvements over the September lows, particularly in the last half of October, November month-to-date, which began with the corn harvest and resulting improvements in corn basis. With funding from the new term loan and associated accelerated investment in further diversification of our specialty alcohol and essential ingredient products, we expect to add over $20 million annually in EBITDA growth by the end of 2023, an additional $30 million annually by 2025."
