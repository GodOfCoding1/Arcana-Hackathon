    "content": " With the completion of our current projects, we expect to increase annualized EBITDA by over $65 million by the end of 2025 and by over $125 million in 2026 when our carbon capture, cogeneration and other initiatives are fully realized. When combined with the high protein enhancement system, we expect to reach 50% or better increased yield, generating approximately $4.5 million annually of additional EBITDA based on current market pricing. We expect to reach full production in Q3 '23 and, with both corn oil and high-quality protein installed, we anticipate, on a combined basis, an additional annual EBITDA run rate of approximately $9 million based on current market pricing for the Magic Valley facility. We believe once converted to renewable natural gas, or RNG, we could use the natural gas pipeline to monetize the value of this current waste stream and produce RNG for an additional $3 million in EBITDA annually. In our drive to invest in a better future, we spent $12.5 million in the fourth quarter and $37.7 million for the year on the initiatives Mike discussed earlier, as well as on various improvements to reduce our high operating costs and increase reliability. While it's difficult to speak to our -- pardon me, while it's difficult to speak to or forecast ethanol margins in 2023, we expect to benefit from approximately $10 million in additional EBITDA generated from the capital projects we have already completed or will complete this year. As stated earlier, the projects that we are contemplating, we expect to generate EBITDA of roughly $65 million by the end of '25 -- 2025, and to increase to $125 million in 2026 when our carbon capture, cogeneration and other initiatives are complete."
