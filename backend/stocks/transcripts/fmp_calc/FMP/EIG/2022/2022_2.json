    "content": " Cerity's enforced premium at quarter end was $2.7 million, which represents an increase of 250% over the last four quarters and was supported by its recent collaboration with Intuit's QuickBooks. Since the pandemic, lower wage workers, especially in our focus industry of leisure and hospitality, have seen the sharpest increase in wages, up 15% for the first quarter of 2022, relative to the prior year and that has led to robust audit premium recognition. Gross premiums written were $179 million versus $147 million a year ago, an increase of 22%. Net premiums earned were $165 million versus $137 million a year ago, an increase of 21%. From a reporting segment perspective, our Employer segment had an underwriting income of $13 million versus $2 million a year ago, and its results in calendar year combined ratios were 92% and 99%, respectively. Our net income this quarter was unfavorably impacted by $33 million of net after-tax unrealized losses from our equity securities and other investments, which are reflected on our income statement and our stockholders' equity and book value per share this quarter were each unfavorably impacted by $74 million of after-tax unrealized losses from our fixed maturity securities, which are reflected on our balance sheet. The combination of lower rates and appetite expansion and the improved economy has increased in California, our submissions, quotes, and binds and that's led to about a 13% increase in the second quarter of 2022 California new business premium relative to what we saw in the second quarter of 2021."
