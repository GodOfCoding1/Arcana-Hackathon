    "content": " The increase was due to higher earned premium, a higher concentration of partnership and alliance business, which is subject to a higher commission rate and an increase in commission rates on new business writings, as well as a reversal of commissions relating to non-compliant and uncollectible premium recorded in the first quarter of 2021. From a reporting segment perspective, Employers had breakeven underwriting results this quarter versus underwriting income of $8 million a year ago, and its resulting combined ratios were 100% and 94% respectively. So recall that the last quarter, fourth quarter of 2021, we recognize over $24 million of favorable development and that take-down was mostly attributable to accident years 2018 and prior and we did a full analysis at year end."
