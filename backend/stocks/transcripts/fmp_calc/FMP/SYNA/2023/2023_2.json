    "content": " At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Munjal Shah, Vice President, Investor Relations. Good afternoon, everyone and thank you for joining us today on Synaptics\u00e2\u0080\u0099 second quarter, fiscal 2023 conference call. With me on today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s call are Michael Hurlston, our President and CEO, and Dean Butler, our CFO. In addition to a supplemental slide presentation, we have also posted a copy of these prepared remarks on our investor relations website. In addition to the Company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s GAAP results, management will also provide supplementary results on a non-GAAP basis, which excludes share-based compensation, acquisition related costs, and certain other non-cash or recurring or non-recurring items. Please refer to the press release issued after market close today for a detailed reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP results, which can be accessed from the investor relations section of the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s website at synaptics.com. Additionally, we would like to remind you that during the course of this conference call, Synaptics will make forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements give our current expectations and projections relating to our financial condition, results of operations, plans, objectives, future performance and business. Although Synaptics believes our estimates and assumptions to be reasonable, they are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties beyond our control and may prove to be inaccurate. We refer you to the Company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s current and periodic reports filed with the SEC, including our most recent 10-K - Annual Report on Form 10-K and current report on Form 10-Q, for important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statement. Our fiscal second quarter financial results were within our guidance range, a good outcome given the dynamic macroeconomic conditions. Given our exposure to a wide range of end markets, we have seen different facets of our business experience headwinds at different times. We first saw weakness in mobile phones, followed by PC, then consumer and are now beginning to see softness in our enterprise business which is now our second largest end market. While we remain uncertain as to the precise timing of recovery, our best estimate at this time is calendar Q3 given current rates of inventory bleed off. With that said, we continue to innovate and focus on our three biggest market opportunities all of which are in our IoT product area. At this year\u00e2\u0080\u0099s CES, we showcased the first wireless docking station from our partner, Lenovo. The product features our Wi-Fi, video conversion, and video decoding ICs. In addition, we can enable advanced video conferencing hubs where the base system is connected to monitors wirelessly, saving corporate IT departments time and money. While wireless workspaces represent the future, our present is also strong as we continue to dominate the current generation of docking stations and are already beginning our move into video conferencing systems. Our latest chip, Navarro, will bring a new level of performance to universal docking stations, enabling two 8k or four 4k monitors simultaneously. In addition, we recently introduced our latest video conversion device, Carrera, with industry leading SerDes technology, optimized for USB4 Version 2 and DisplayPort 2.1, that brings both video and graphics to high-definition monitors. As an early sign of success in video conferencing, we had a key $10 plus design win in HP\u00e2\u0080\u0099s new Presence system that was named one of the best inventions of 2022 by Time Magazine. Our design wins and pipeline of opportunities continue to increase, giving us confidence to target $1 billion in annual sales over the next three to five years. We offer the broadest portfolio of wireless technologies among all our IoT competitors, including Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Thread/Zigbee, ULE and GNSS. Our latest combo chip design wins encompass large customers such as Amazon and Google, kitchen appliances, and wearable cameras. Our Wi- Fi, Bluetooth combos have also started to see success in new market segments such as enterprise, operator, health care and even smart cities. Our ULE technology has been an entr\u00c3\u00a9e into customers such as ADT, Vivint, and Verisure, where we are able to sell a litany of products including video decoders for hubs, Wi-Fi for security cameras, and edge AI devices for glass break detectors. In GNSS, we recently announced the availability of the 4778, a chip designed in 7 nanometer CMOS that offers customers up to 80% more power efficiency. Despite a recent speedbump in terms of significant inventory buildup, we remain confident in our wireless business and expect it to return to outsized growth in the calendar year. Local dimming greatly increases the contrast ratio in automotive displays, making a typical LCD display look and perform like OLED. In addition, we continue to benefit from the rapid conversion of discrete touch and display circuits to TDDI in the infotainment display. In enterprise telephony, we continue to expand content with both wireless and video decoding for small screen conferencing. In audio headsets, we continue to dominate in enterprise class products, particularly with DECT connectivity. Turning to PCs, revenues were in line with our expectations but down sequentially as customers work through their inventories. As it stands, we expect the March quarter to mark the low water mark for revenue and measured improvement thereafter. In fact, all major customers are engaging with us for this technology which saves battery life by using AI algorithms to determine when a user is not actively engaged with the laptop. In conclusion, we are working with our customers to reduce inventories in the channel. We will focus on things we can control such as timely new product introductions, innovative roadmaps, and design win conversions. Together, this gives me confidence in our long-term growth potential. Revenue for the December quarter was $353 million, toward the low end of our previous guidance. December quarter revenue from IoT, PC, and Mobile were 68%, 16% and 16%, respectively. Year-over-year, consolidated December quarter revenue was down 16%, driven by double-digit declines in our Mobile and PC products. Outside of the single deal that was delayed, all other customers performed in line with our prior forecasts. In PC, our December quarter revenue was down 13% sequentially and down 32% year-over-year, in line with our expectations, reflecting a weaker PC market as customers drive to reduce inventory. Our higher commercial mix generally leads to a more stable performance, but it is not immune to economic downturns when enterprise IT spending is curtailed. The December quarter outperformed our expectations as customers took delivery of products before the calendar year end, which likely comes at the expense of our March quarter forecast. During the quarter, we had one customer greater than 10% of revenue, at approximately 11%, a distributor servicing multiple OEMs. For the December quarter, our GAAP gross margin was 52.9%, which includes $23.3 million of intangible asset amortization and $1 million of share-based compensation costs. GAAP operating expenses in the December quarter were $140.6 million, which includes share-based compensation of $29 million, intangibles amortization of $8.9 million, amortization of prepaid development costs of $2.5 million, and transaction related costs of $1.8 million. Our GAAP tax rate was 44.2% for the quarter, and non-GAAP tax rate was 17%. In the December quarter, we had GAAP net income of $22 million or GAAP net income of $0.55 per diluted share. Our non-GAAP net income in the December quarter was $88.5 million, a decrease of 38% from the prior quarter and a 33% decrease from the same quarter a year ago. We ended the quarter with $859 million of cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments on hand; a decline of $53 million from the preceding quarter with cash flow from operations of $48 million, offset by $18 million of cash used for payroll taxes related to our equity compensation program, $16 million used for acquisitions, and $61 million of cash used under our share repurchase program. Receivables at the end of December were $255 million and days of sales outstanding were 65, consistent with the prior year, but up from 57 last quarter. Days of inventory were 112, above 96 days last quarter and ending inventory balance of $177.5 million was down slightly from 179.4 last quarter. During the last quarter, we have actively reduced orders to our suppliers and expect our inventory next quarter to decline further as we work to bring our inventory down to normal levels. Since restarting our buyback program in September and through today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s call, we have repurchased approximately 1 million shares for $100 million and have an additional $477 million available under our current authorization. Now, let me turn to our March quarter outlook. We anticipate revenue for the March quarter to be in the range of $310 million to $340 million, a sequential decline of approximately 8% at the mid-point. We expect our revenue mix from IoT, PC, and Mobile products in the March quarter to be approximately 72%, 15% and 13%, respectively. As previously communicated, we expect to maintain our strong gross margin profile, with GAAP gross margin for the March quarter expected to be in the range of 52% to 55%. We expect non-GAAP gross margin in the range of 60% to 62%, an improvement from the previous quarter as we expect to close the previously delayed deal during the March quarter adding approximately 100 basis points. We expect GAAP operating expenses in the March quarter to be in the range of $139 million to $144 million, which includes intangibles amortization, prepaid development cost amortization, and share-based compensation. As a result, GAAP net income per diluted share for our March quarter is expected to be in the range of $0.20 to $0.50. And, non-GAAP net income per diluted share is anticipated to be in the range of $1.65 to $2.05 per share, on an estimated 40 million fully diluted shares. As a result of an increase in the interest rate on the variable portion of our debt, and partially offset by an increase in interest income on our invested cash, we expect non-GAAP net interest expense in the March quarter to be approximately $9 million. Finally, we expect our fiscal 2023 and long-term non-GAAP tax rate to remain unchanged in the range of 16% to 18%. But I guess I'll ask the obvious question first, and the processor customer. No, I don't think it was any more complicated, Kevin, than you are just completing the deliverables that were due. And can you say for your IoT business, that seems to be - that's of course, your biggest portion, but a little harder to track exactly where your exposures are. Yes, I think we sort of see it as a bit in ways. I mean, I think the products that are closest to call it retail consumers saw some of the corrections first, meaning some corrections in demand, a build up an inventory. But also we think those are the first set of markets that likely come out of it as they sort of reacted first, if you will, on the timeline. So the more consumer facing applications have seen sort of the bigger impact, and therefore, some more of the inventory. And then now only recently a few of the other markets such as enterprise that we talked about corporate enterprises, that's just starting to roll out. You see sort of corporate IT departments cutting some budgets as people sort of tighten the belt, and that's affecting a few of those products that we didn't see prior. One moment for questions. So the margins, you guided a 61% to factor in that benefit that got pushed down to the March quarter. But Dean you're kind of also indicating that margins will kind of drift to a floor of 57% throughout the year, if I read that correctly. Yes, what I would say Raj, one, I think we've been pretty clear over the last several quarters. Last quarter, December is essentially 60% guiding 61% here. I think over time, I do think that that's probably the right target for the company to continue to operate sort of consistently. And so, I think sort of the -- likely a sort of a gradual move in that direction, Raji. And on the shape of the recovery, you talked about potentially in the third quarter, starting to see a recovery. And then, as Dean said, with inventory bleed off, with some early signs in Mobile and PC that we're coming off the bottom, I think Dean characterized it well in his comments in Mobile. We saw a nice bounce in our Mobile business, but I wouldn't yet call that a trend line. And so, I would say that although everybody - nobody has a perfect crystal ball, I would say, our best guess continues to be that things get better in the back half of this kind of local minimum that you're seeing. One moment for questions. Michael, love to hear your thoughts on if there is any particular geographic area that's more weak than others and also lot of the other semis have been taking about China stabilizing, maybe not really moving up. I'm curious, your view on your sales into China and then I had to follow-up after that. Anthony, I mean, I think our comments would be consistent with others that we've seen. China is driving a big portion of our mobile business, as you know, and our mobile business definitely saw a bit of bounce here. And I still think that we're coming off kind of low water mark in our mobile business, as you know. I think we - as Dean said in his remarks, it's sort of - we definitely saw a little bit of a balance, but again too early to call. I do think that we have limited exposure in the rest of China, outside of mobile, our business there is relatively concentrated. I think that where we're starting to see sort of early weakness as we indicated is our enterprise business, which is now a pretty big part of what we do, and that's primarily U.S. customers. And then as a follow-up, I'm curious if you've seen any change in behavior from your competitors on price. And then, secondly, maybe you guys haven't talked about this in a while, but I think you've got a pretty decent roster of VR design wins. I mean, I think, on the VR piece, unfortunately, that's where we've seen a lot - I think Raji asked a question before, a lot of weakness in our VR business. And from a design win perspective, we're still doing great. I mean, we're winning virtually every goggle that's out there. The problem is, that particular consumer facing segment just isn't selling through. So - as well as we did in 2022, we're simply not seeing those results in 2023, despite continuing to win almost everything that there is. Dean, I don't know if you want to comment on the first part of the question. No, but maybe just let me add on to VR for a second, Tony, I think we're - Synaptics is in a great position. So I think when VR comes back, you'll see Synaptics as a big participator on that. Eddie I would say, I mean input cost is definitely a factor. I mean without precise quantification, input cost is not insignificant, we are in the face of rising input cost, which I think in a place we're probably a little bit more limited than we were the last couple of years on be able to pass all of that along. As far as competitive pressure, I mean, certainly there is some, but it differs by technology area. There are certain areas that we complete very heavily, there are certain areas we have a pretty dominant technology lead, where we don't have to deal with such competitive pressures. So we continue to evolve the mix, push the portfolio forward, a lot of our designs come in both consumer facing, and then also enterprise facing. So as we continue to move the portfolio forward, balancing the mix between the two, you do see different growth rates between those two different dynamics. I wanted to know about your opportunity in AR, whether you think you have one and the size of that, or if you could potentially size that for us. And display drivers, it's a different type and it's relatively simple. There is opportunity in Wi-Fi and audio in those AR glasses, but the core business and where we've been very dominant in VR not so much. And we would expect a very similar opportunity, again, depending on that market size, we would expect to do relatively well in kind of mixed AR,VR goggles. I mean, I think the good news for us with the wireless asset that we got some time back, we've been able to increase content per box, that actually story has gone relatively well. But generally speaking, I would say that we're not doing as well in terms of picking up share as we would have anticipated two years ago had you asked the question. I always think that was a good - yes, sorry, go ahead. The other thing I would I would share, Chris, I mean, we talked about this set of deliverables on a processor piece of business, that's actually engaging with an operator end market. I think, what we find ourselves, and you hear some of our comments, it just doesn't grow as fast as some of our other opportunities in automotive, in wireless, in some of the video interface devices. I mean, I think we highlighted this in the last call, our wireless business - in our IoT area, I'd say right now, we've talked about two problems. One is VR, demand just simply isn't there. As Dean said, I think we're positioned well when that recovers. And remember in our business, we depend on module partners to service a long tail. So we have an extra step in our supply chain, we go from ours to a distributor to a module guy to an end customer. I think we're less subject to some of the pricing pressures because remember our products compete in this very high end, where we're doing video transfer, where \u00e2\u0080\u0093 in power sensitive applications like wearables. We've heard to list  like you are that wireless is seeing competitive pricing challenges, but we have a bit of a safe harbor there, but inventory very much is part of our story. Just - when talking about your suppliers, when you first came over to Synaptics and start making the changes. One of the things you're going to do is consolidate your number of suppliers, and of course, we had the shortage hit. I think that what we've done Kevin is, we basically concentrated all our starts with one supplier. So any new product is essentially going to the largest manufacturer in the world, and for the most part we've stopped engaging with the long tail of suppliers that we have. Now, that said, it takes a long time, and we still, I think we've gone from 10 wafer partners to nine. And as we become a diminishing part of these supply chain, these various suppliers, we're obviously subject to pricing increases because we were just not meaningful to them. So when Dean says, hey, the big part of what we forecast out in the next x quarters is a glide path down to this 57% gross margin, that's very reflective of input prices more than anything. As we concentrate, right now, we're not seeing that pricing benefit that we would get from the one supplier where our starts are concentrated. I'm optimistic that we're going to get some help there, and if that does happen, then perhaps our outlook changes. But right now, what we are seeing and what we're forecasting is serious increases from places where de minimis customer and not a lot of help from the place where meaningful - very meaningful customer on a go-forward basis. Michael, I have a question regarding your wireless roadmap at the time of acquisition from Broadcom, you did have - I mentioned to the back has two road map products. So on the two roadmap products, both are sampling and one is nearing production. Both are in 16-nanometer, which we think gives us a pretty good competitive footing particularly on a power - from a power standpoint. So we've actually taped out our first set of products that are done with our internal engineering team, and we expect that part of the vision that I am outlining here is, we really want to become a major player. Today, we've got a very small share, I would say in this IoT landscape as it relates to wireless. And I think part of what you're going to see is very targeted ships, a litany of very targeted ships coming from different segments of this IoT market that will be done by our internal team. So we've adjusted our spend to make sure that our wireless opportunity is well served, because we believe this is actually the biggest TAM that we have in front of us. And if we execute to, what I believe we can, I think we're going to be in really, really good shape. So wireless is a big part of our story, we've had this bridge that we got from these Broadcom designs, but we're beginning to really hit the ground running with our internal capability and I'm pretty optimistic that we have a plan to really make this thing into big, big business for us. So the thing that we have, Martin, I mean we have, as you know, being around the company for some time, our big opportunity is in TDDI. That's converting to TDDI, where you have integrated touch and integrated display in one circuit. So now there is an additional chip that takes input from the applications processor, converts it from EDP is kind of a standard format that it gets sent to the display to LVDS, Low-Voltage Differential, that goes into the display. So this is a chip that's there today, since in almost every car to convert from the applications processor up to the display. What's unique, what we've been able to add is this technology called local dimming. And in local dimming, that's where this backlighting comes into play. We're actually able to make the contrast ratio much, much sharper. Your blacks are very deep, your whites are much brighter, and that's a differentiator. As we think about this is a great opportunity for us, because there is additional content that we can gain. And we actually see more and more of our focus as we go forward, playing into the SmartBridge area, where we think there are different pieces of puzzle we can bring to bear over the next couple of years. I like that opportunity and I think for us automotive, as we said, it's one of our three focus areas. And I think that if we play our cards right, we can really increase our content over time. Just looking at it, it sounds like it's about a $30 million pushout. Let me give you just a little bit more about this customer engagement that pushed out from December, we got delayed into March now. It depending on sort of the milestones and various deliverables, it's sort of between sort of 10 and 30. We said it's kind of about 100 basis points and sort of margin impact, depending on what quarter is that - the deal actually ends up getting completed and the major deliverables done. On the IoT side, basically this is where a lot of the inventory consumption really is happening, this is where sell through is highly dependent on our sell-in. So what we're looking at is, you're really trying to let our customer base sort of consume on their side, on the OEM side, which then needs to eat their inventory or put it on a distributor side. I mean, I think the thing to remember here Jamison is largely, this is a work known as inventory, and there hasn't really been any fundamental shift in the business and sort of what we're pursuing and the growth drivers around it. And then I guess just following-up with this maybe the best visibility just to rank order for your - I guess, to your best ability for inventory, I guess in channel drain would be PC first, it sounds like mobile second in IoT is kind of a little bit more murky. We're just comparing notes here and it matched exactly what you said, yes. And we have - part of our IoT business is sort of attached to PC indirectly, I think that's getting better, mobile sort of second, and IoT third. And to your point, I mean, we expect to get back to sort of normal IoT levels, timing is a question as Dean said, but I don't expect this to be a persistent problem."
