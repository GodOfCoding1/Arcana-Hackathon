    "content": " Year-over-year, March quarter revenue was up 44%, driven by significant growth in IoT, where we continue to see strong customer demand and the inclusion of our first full quarter results related to the acquisition of DSP Group. For the March quarter, our GAAP gross margin was a new company record at 54%, which includes $25.2 million of intangible asset amortization, $7.2 million of inventory fair value adjustment and $900,000 of share-based compensation costs. Now for our non-GAAP outlook for the June quarter, we expect non-GAAP gross margin to be in the range of 60.5% to 61.5%, which at the midpoint of 61% would be approximately 350 basis points higher than the same quarter one year ago as the strength of our product profile and diversification strategy bears tangible results. We expect our non-GAAP operating expenses in the June quarter to be in the range of $107 million to $111 million, an increase from the March quarter as the synergies from our DSPG Group acquisition are offset by continued investments in our organic growth opportunities such as wireless connectivity, virtual reality, video interface and automotive applications. Your line is open. DSPG, we had said last quarter, which is true on the results now and also how we're thinking about the June quarter, is in line with the announced \u2013 revenue trajectory when we announced with DSPG, which is sort of roughly $140 million per year. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. I think you talked about within wireless connectivity might be DSP about 35 million, I\u2019d say 10% of that IoT, but if you could just give the four buckets and what the growth rates were that would be great. Your line is open."
