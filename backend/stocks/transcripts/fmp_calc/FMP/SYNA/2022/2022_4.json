    "content": " In that three-year period, our IoT business has grown from $78 million in Q4 2019 to $332 million in Q4 2022, a 62% compound annual growth rate with most every line of business contributing. For the full-year fiscal 2022, net revenue of $1.74 billion was a new company record and up 30% compared to $1.34 billion in the prior year, largely due to an 80% year-over-year growth in our IoT products, partially offset by our Mobile products, which saw a 20% year-over-year decline. For the June quarter, our GAAP gross margin was a new company record at 55.9%, which includes $22.8 million of intangible asset amortization, $900,000 of inventory fair value adjustment, and $1 million of share-based compensation costs.
