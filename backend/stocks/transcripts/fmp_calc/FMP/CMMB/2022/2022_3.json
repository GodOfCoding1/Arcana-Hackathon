    "content": " This rationale includes multiple convergent lines of evidence, including demonstration of CCL-24 expression and relevant physiology in the skin, vasculature and lung, demonstration that genetic deletion of CCL-24 in rodents attenuates manifestations of skin and lung disease in a bleomycin challenge model of SSC and translational data suggesting that patients with SSC have high serum levels of CCL-24 and that higher levels of CCL-24 in these patients are correlated with a greater likelihood of developing pulmonary disease."
