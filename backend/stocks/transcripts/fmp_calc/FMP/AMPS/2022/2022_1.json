    "content": " The additional projects that as -- from the script Dustin explained, are either operating assets that are in the process of being onboarded, so they're basically due diligenced and purchased by Altus, and the preponderance of the new construction projects that are in late stage construction and that we expect will contribute to revenue this year have modules identified. And one of the reasons that we're so happy to have now been able to begin the process of delivering insights into our process, into our pipeline and into the stages of deals in that pipeline to you guys, and then also prepare thoughts around the current timing of a project, is so that we can let you have an opinion and form an opinion on when these engagements with people like Trammell Crow, Blackstone, CBRE Investment Management, and all the other large customers that we've begun engagement with, when that will filter through our pipeline coming to preconstruction, construction and then ultimately be added to our client service desk and our books."
