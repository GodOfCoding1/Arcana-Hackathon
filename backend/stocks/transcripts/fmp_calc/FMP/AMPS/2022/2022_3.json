    "content": " And, Chris, this is Lars, as a general matter, when we sign up corporate customers, or enterprises or communities, because our preferred contract structure is to sell clean electricity at a discount, call it 15% give or take against some avoidable costs, or apparent power tariff, that those customers buy power from their grid app, we tend to generally in gradually escalate during the time that we're constructing that assets, because we are sort of, to some extent floating with that power price. And as we've talked about, before, in the commercial scale segment of the market, particularly with all of the policy initiatives, there's a variety of ways to create incremental value on commercial scale assets, broadening relationships with those customers, adding additional solar or adding storage or adding electric vehicle charging. We think of it as front and center issue, which, which comes about because one of the key differentiators is going to be Altus's ability to bring its intellectual property in designing and constructing solar and storage and fleet charging in basically every single market where CBRE already exists, and CBRE, PMG group or the Project Management Group basically exist everywhere."
