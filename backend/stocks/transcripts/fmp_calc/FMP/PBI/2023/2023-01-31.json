    "content": " Presort revenues were 158 million in the quarter, which is a 1% improvement from last year. SendTech reported revenues of 341 million in the quarter, which was down fractionally compared to prior year on a comparable basis. On the other hand, in-spite of these improvements, we fell short of our EBITDA positive goal by 5.5 million, especially in December, the mix of volumes skewed toward lighter parcel rates, resulting in lower revenue and margin per parcel than we anticipated."
