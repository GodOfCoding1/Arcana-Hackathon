    "content": " Our first quarter was very good, and the trends that we experienced most of last year continued, improvement in global e-commerce business, our GEC margins and strong performance in our SendTech Financial Services and Presort businesses. Total revenue for the quarter was $927 million, which is a 2% improvement year-over-year. Total EBITDA was $95 million and EBIT was $53 million, both of which were 6% higher than first quarter 2021. Presort revenues were $161 million in the quarter, which is 12% better than last year, driven by new customer additions and increased revenue per piece. SendTech reported revenues of $348 million in the quarter, down 2% from the same period last year. EBIT was $105 million compared to $114 million and EBIT margin was 30.1%, down 180 basis points from first quarter 2021. Within global e-commerce, revenue in the quarter increased 1% to $419 million. As a percent of segment revenues, gross margin was 12% in the quarter, much better than last year's 7%. So 26% off of business that's $140 million, $150 million is starting to be real growth in the absolute terms. In terms of ultimate profitability, it's still kind of in the 24% or might be 25 time frame, but it's not - if things have changed a little bit, which is not terribly surprising on the minimum wage is - our wages have gone from $14 an hour or close to 20 unit transportation has gone from $0.65 a unit over double that. I'll just remind everyone that global e-commerce at a $2 billion business, and we think it will be higher than that at the completion of the long-term plan with 8% EBIT margins is $160 million of incremental EBIT from zero and close to $250 million of incremental EBIT from where we are."
