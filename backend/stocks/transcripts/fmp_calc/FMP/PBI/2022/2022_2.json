SendTech reported revenues of $339 million in the quarter, a slight increase over prior year, which, as Marc noted, is a significant accomplishment for a business that has natural headwinds. EBIT was $96 million, compared to $107 million and EBIT margin was 28%, down 270 basis points from second quarter 2021. While total volumes in the quarter decreased from $44 million to $39 million, if you exclude parcels that originate in China and are processed by our Domestic Parcel network, volumes grew 4%. The decline in parcels originating in China, and again, processed by our Domestic Parcel network was roughly $6 million in the quarter and was driven largely by the well-reported lockdowns that country experienced in the second quarter. Our next question comes from the line of Ananda Baruah, Loop Capital. Our next question comes from the line of Ananda Baruah, Loop Capital. And one of the things that Ana said, and I will just kind of highlighted is, $0.35 per parcel improvement in gross margin, $0.35 across 200 million parcels or 300 million parcels is $70 million to $100 million of profit improvement going forward."
