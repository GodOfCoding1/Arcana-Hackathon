    "content": " And I'm sure everyone knows on this call, that is an all-time market share record in mortgage and it's truly amazing accomplishment for the broker channel and for UWM as their partner. If you actually look at the market, with brokers being about 20% and us being about 54%, like we're about 11% of the overall mortgage market which is crazy to think about while we only are in the wholesale channel. He's done great work since joining us over two years ago, and I'm excited for him to continue to take this next step in his career and continue to help UWM grow and be more successful. Your line is open. But what I told you back then, 40% of the broker channel, 30% of the overall channel -- of the overall industry's brokers would be about 12% of our market share. Your line is open. Your line is open. Help the loan officer in the broker channel get new realties, build relationships, win more loans, continue to educate consumers that -- and educate the markets, what you guys have it be happy to road, it's $9,400 cheaper to go through a mortgage broker than a retail lender or a mega bank. Your line is open. We will maintain that and continue to grow and dominate, take the market share, continue to help brokers win and help consumers across the board and UWM and our investors are going to be excited about it with the dividend and all the great things we've got going."
