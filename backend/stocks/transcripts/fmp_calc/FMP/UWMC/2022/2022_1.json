    "content": " We look forward to seeing many of you here at UWM headquarters for our UWM Live where about 5,000 of our clients will be out here at UWM, talking about growth, working on how to build their business, and we\u2019re going to be here excited. I think actually one of the analysts at Wells Fargo even made a comment and showed how the broker channel loan officers have grown were back in 2007, 208, how they dipped down and how they\u2019re coming back up to maybe the highest levels of all time. And obviously the first quarter shows that will we make $1 billion plus, I mean, it seems like that\u2019s where it\u2019s trending. And you\u2019re going to see the whole year that way, because we feel really confident in what our business has done in the past and what we\u2019ve built for the future and where other companies might not be ready for a purchase focused environment with these margins we are. In addition to that we look at all different reasons and ways to use our cash in the most beneficial way for our company, our shareholders, our clients and there\u2019s a lot of things on the horizon that we\u2019re looking at doing to continue to build going forward. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open."
