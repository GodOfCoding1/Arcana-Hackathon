    "content": "  We are ecstatic to report that we had record earnings in fiscal year 2022, achieving our guidance for daily average comparable store sales growth and diluted earnings per share. Since fiscal 2019 or pre-pandemic levels, our daily average comparable store sales have increased 15.7%, the basket is up over 20% and diluted earnings per share have grown 124%, demonstrating the relevance and the enduring strength of our business model. During the fiscal year, total inventory increased 13%, driven by product in-stock levels returning to pre-pandemic levels, product cost inflation and inventory additions for new and relocated stores. For fiscal year 2023, we expect to open four to six new stores, relocate one to two stores, achieve daily average comparable store sales growth between negative 2% and positive 1%, achieve diluted earnings per share between $0.70 and $0.90 and direct $28 million to $35 million towards capital expenditures to support our growth initiatives."
