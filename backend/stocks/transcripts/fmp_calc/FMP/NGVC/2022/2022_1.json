    "content": " Our first quarter results included net sales of $277.3 million and diluted earnings per share of $0.39, increases of 4.6% and 143.8% respectively. On a 2-year stack basis, daily average comparable store sales increased 16.5% in the first quarter. Customers continue to be drawn to our Natural Grocers branded products, which accounted for 7.5% of total sales in the first quarter, up from 7.1% in the fourth quarter. Our guidance includes the following: open four to six new stores; relocate or remodel three to four stores, achieve daily average comparable store sales growth between 0% and 2%, achieve diluted earnings per share between $0.75 to $0.87 and direct $28 million to $35 million towards capital expenditures to support our growth initiatives. It will be \u2013 I mean for the first \u2013 for January, I would expect it to be February and March, it\u2019s much more difficult because  we were taking on a 2-year stack basis, we may get comp, we expect to have a positive comp this March compared to last March, similar to what we experienced in the last quarter."
