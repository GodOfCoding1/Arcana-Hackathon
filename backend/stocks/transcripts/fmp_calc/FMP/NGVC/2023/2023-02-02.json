    "content": " Actual results could differ materially from those described in forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors, including the risks and uncertainties detailed in the company's most recently filed Forms 10-Q and 10-K. Our first quarter daily average comparable store sales growth was 0.5% as we cycled the lift from strong pandemic trends in the prior year. In the first quarter, our Natural Grocers-branded products accounted for 7.9% of total sales, up from 7.5% a year ago, reflecting heightened customer interest in the quality and value of our entire offering as well as continued expansion of our Natural Grocers-branded assortment. Store expenses as a percentage of sales in the first quarter increased 130 basis points, primarily driven by higher labor expense as a result of increased wage rates. During the first quarter, we generated cash from operations of $21.2 million and invested $11.3 million in net capital expenditures, primarily for new and relocated stores, resulting in free cash flow of $9.9 million. Our guidance includes the following; open four to six new stores, relocate or remodel one to two stores, achieve daily average comparable store sales growth between negative 2% and positive 1%, achieve diluted earnings per share between $0.70 and $0.90, and direct $28 million to $35 million towards capital expenditures to support our growth initiatives."
