    "content": "  Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Amkor First Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. I would now like to turn the call over to Jennifer Jue, Head of Investor Relations. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us for Amkor's first quarter 2022 earnings conference call. Our earnings press release was filed with the SEC this afternoon and is available on the Investor Relations page of our website, along with the presentation slides that accompany today's call. Please refer to our press release and other SEC filings for information on risk factors, uncertainties and exceptions that could cause actual results to differ materially from these expectations. Revenue of $1.6 billion and EPS of $0.69, our first quarter records, reflecting year-on-year increases of 20% and 40% respectively. Continued strong demand for our advanced packaging solutions, particularly in the communication and market through better than expected results. Now, let me review the current dynamics in our end markets. Our communications business grew 22% year-on-year, driven by demand for advanced SiP and flip chip technology for the latest 5G processors and peripheral devices in new smartphone models. Some weakness in the China market was offset by strength in the high-end smartphones, as well as the spring launch of new models. With Amkor\u2019s leadership position across multiple semiconductor devices in 5G phones, we expect the ongoing proliferation of 5G to remain an important growth driver. With Amkor\u2019s manufacturing lines in the main automotive geographies, we are well positioned to support our customers in implementing these changes. In Korea, we have a strong automotive manufacturing hub for advanced packaging. In Japan, we offer a well-established manufacturing base supporting a broad range of automotive solutions, including emerging silicon carbide power products for EV. And in Europe we are expanding our technology portfolio in our Portugal factory, where we have started production of automotive sensors using wafer level fan out and MEMS technology. In all locations, we are working with lead automotive customers on the next generation products, and we have multiple new product introductions ramping this year. With our global manufacturing footprint and broad technology offering, we expect ongoing strength in this market, ADAS, electrification and infotainment and telematics will drive continued expansion of semiconductor content per car. As the leading automotive outset, Amkor has a strong track record of partnering with customers who demand automotive grade quality and supply reliability. Automotive qualified manufacturing lines are a critical differentiator, and we are proud to have received recognition from top automotive companies for our commitment to quality and supplier reliability. We expect the consumer market to further expand, and overall product and customer pipeline remains strong. Although we expect that this emerging product category is more prone to quarterly variability, due to supply chain constraints and varying product life cycles. In data centers, introduction of AI, as well as the trends of increased data traffic is driving investments in high performance computing. We see similar technology requirements in the wired and wireless infrastructure markets, notably in support of 5G infrastructure. Although the PC market is softening, we observe the trends to ARM-based PC architectures. In this emerging PC segment, Amkor is able to support our customers with a proven multi-chip modular solution. With our broad advanced packaging portfolio and established partnerships with lead customers and foundries, we believe we are well positioned to capitalize on opportunities in these growing computing applications. Finally, our test business grew 14% compared to first quarter 2021. Through early engagement in customers product life cycles, we are able to define test strategies and intelligent equipment selection to provide differentiated test solutions. We are broadening the scope of our test services in areas like 5G communications, computing and system level testing to enhance this turnkey support to our customers. The ongoing semiconductor supply challenges require diligence and flexibility from our global organization to meet customer requirements, while maintaining industry-leading quality standards and high factory utilization. In late March, the Chinese government mandated the COVID-19 lockdown of our Shanghai factory. In addition to managing the supply chain challenges, the Amkor team continues to expand our global manufacturing footprint to ensure we can capture future growth opportunities and meet expanding customer requirements. Besides supporting a changing automotive supply chain, we are also expanding our footprint to offer customers a broader geographical diversification. In November 2021, we announced our plans to expand our global factory footprint by building a state-of-the-art factory in Bac Ninh, Vietnam. When completed our Bac Ninh manufacturing campus, we will offer our customers an attractive large-scale cost-effective manufacturing location with a diversified technology portfolio. Including this impact, we are expecting second quarter revenue of $1.52 billion at the midpoint of our guidance. Amkor delivered strong financial results in Q1, setting first quarter records for revenue, gross profit, operating income, EPS and EBITDA. We continue to successfully manage the ongoing supply chain constraints on wafers, substrates, lead frames and components to support robust customer demand. Demand for advanced SiP and flip chip solutions within the computing, automotive and industrial and communications end markets is strong and is driving this significant growth. Operating expenses for the quarter were in line with expectations at $115 million, resulting in operating income margin for the quarter. Net income for the quarter was $171 million, resulting in record Q1 EPS of $0.69. Our balance sheet is solid, we ended the quarter with $1.2 billion of cash and short-term investments. During the first quarter, we executed a new $600 million revolving credit facility, replacing a $250 million revolving credit facility. Total liquidity increased to $1.9 billion, providing us with financial flexibility. As Giel mentioned, a government mandated COVID-19 lockdown impacted our Shanghai facility beginning in late March. With the reduced Shanghai factory output included and assuming that the lockdown ends as currently anticipated, we expect revenue to be between $1.47 billion and $1.57 billion. The Shanghai lockdown is estimated to have an approximately 300 basis point impact on gross margin, reflecting underutilization and incremental COVID lockdown costs. Q2 net income is expected to be between $90 million and $140 million, resulting in EPS of $0.37 to $0.57. Please state your question. I think, first, just it seems like it's been different by supplier. First of all, on the lockdown in Shanghai, and why this is different across multiple companies. I mean, currently, we see that, for example, we are in Pudong that there are very strict measures in the Pudong area. And that forced, actually the local authorities to go to a lockdown of most of the manufacturing locations in Pudong. Now we do a couple of things, of course, we work with customers very closely, because with many of the customers, we have long-term supply agreements, where we utilize our global manufacturing footprint to shift volume to other factories in areas outside of Shanghai. So we have a bit of excess capacity, and our customers have a bit more flexibility there. So we expect that on an annual basis, the impact will be able to compensate for a large extent, Randy, maybe not to the full extent, but to the large extent. Currently, we're working with customers, and we feel that we have a way forward where we meet all of the conditions. And if we think in a worst case, the 120 million for -- it's about first half of the quarter. In a worst case if it extended if that's the way to think about it like half a quarter that much revenue impact if say another -- the outbreak gets worse again, or as we move on over time, you have more time to shift order. I wanted to ask on the demand side, if you could talk -- since we last had the results with the Russia, Ukraine, there's been a demand side in China from these lockdowns and inflation has been persistent. Well, that's a good question, Randy. I mean, currently we are very alert on demand changes, but we have not seen demand changes, actually, we still see upsides that we cannot fulfill because of hiccups in the supply chain, materials supply or certain components supply. So we still believe that the end markets are strong, even in the communication market, where there is some weakness in the China communication market. But on the other hand, we see upside on the premium tier Android smartphones, where we hold a strong position. So all in all, we believe that the sheer demand side is still very strong. What we're watching it clearly, we're also watching the inventory in the chain when it comes to distributors, or inventory at our customers. To follow up on the inventory, it seems like the IDM's are still relatively okay, or a bit low. had built up some in the past couple quarters, like from some mismatch, but the absolute level is a bit higher. Well, the wafer bank in the foundry share sites, we have limited exposure, what the share inventory level is there, Randy. I mean, on the distributor side, we see a slight increase, but still below their target level on the IDM side, we believe that the inventory levels at both our fab-less customers as well as the IDM customers is still below their target. If we start to pass that if you see the leverage, we could start pushing back into low 20s again. From the revenue perspective, and also from the margin perspective, it should be very positive that we hear we can make up the loss in the second quarter in the remaining part of the year, maybe not in the exact portfolio elements. I think on the mainstream side we still see constraints on the on the lead frame sides, a little bit on the on the substrate side, but that's the lower end of substrates or less than in the advanced side. So mainly its lead frame on the mainstream side, which is still a significant impact. On the advanced product sides, it is a couple of things. If you look to SiP, it's still the more mature silicon nodes and related components that are a bottleneck in the industry, and that force end customers to make decisions on their portfolio. Then when it comes to substrates specifically in the high-end substrates sides, we see constraints in the compute segment. Certainly on the infrastructure side, as well as on certain parts of the automotive market. Please state your question. Yes, I think the Shanghai factory on a revenue base is about 15% of Amkor factory -- Amkor revenue. Let me try to repeat the question, Krish, so your question is related to the share premium tier smartphones and our position there and strengthen the segment's where the debt would be a positive impact to our gross margin over average gross margin. So I would consider that a positive because we deliver their full turnkey solutions, that includes both this, the bump, the  , the assembly and the final test. And if we add that business up, that would be a positive contribution to our average gross margin. I'm kind of curious on the auto side, your exposure, if I'm right, it's more on the wire bonder side. Actually, we see that more pronounced on the advanced package side. I mean, the driver behind the diversification of the supply chain in automotive is driven by security of supplies, IP protection and more control on the factory base by Tier 1 semiconductor companies, but also end customers. So if you look to where that's most prominently available, then that will be in the advanced product side. So that also includes automotive sensors, which is a very broad product category. Then with respect to automotive in the second half of the year, I mean, we're very confident that the automotive market will go through a strong year, the volumes in the produced cars. And I understand there are some hiccups because of the Ukraine disruption, but overall, the industry expects that are 6% more cars being built this year versus last year. So with that, we expect that this will be a solid year with a good second half of the year, and that's what we factor into our numbers, Krish. I remember last year, we said $100 million goes into Vietnam. So out of our $950 million, there's about 30% of that is for infrastructure, and that does include the incremental $100 million for Vietnam that you mentioned. So then there's about 5% -- 3% to 5% for quality and R&D, leaving about 65% for capacity and capability that you just mentioned. And the majority of that, I would say, 90% of that equipment CapEx is geared towards advanced SiP flip chip wafer services and about 10% is allocated for wirebond mainstream business. Please state your question. I think we still maintain about 1,000 people on site, facilities keep on running, we make sure that equipment is maintained, all of that continues, but there is no effective production going through. And currently, we go through a process where we bring more people in to ramp up while we're ramping production that more people get on board. On the PC market, we see a broader weakness more in the traditional PC market. The point we're making is that within the PC market, where there's a little bit slowness in this part of the year, I think that's public knowledge, we see a trend from the traditional PC architecture to an ARM-based architecture. In the traditional PC market, it is very much for a large part, a vertically integrated supply chain. If we -- if the market moves to an ARM-based architecture than the companies that are playing there are actually utilizing an outsource of supply chain, which is good for Amkor. So when we look at the constraints that we've had in the quarter, it's very difficult to quantify, one, on the top line, because both Amkor and our customers are working to refine their forecasts, both with our material supply and their downstream. So without having that, it's also difficult to quantify the margin impact. That being said, I would say that the impact from a margin perspective is not significant given that we've still been able to deliver especially in Q1 upside results, we were able to more than offset that constraints with other demand. Of course, the COVID, let's say, pandemic is already ongoing for well over two years. And in these two years, we put very strict procedures in place in all our global factories where there were flare-ups in areas like Malaysia, like the Philippines and other jurisdictions, we were able to manage that very well in our manufacturing organization with strict procedures. But currently, we don't see any other locations that see COVID impacts. Amkor delivered strong first quarter results, with revenue of $1.6 billion and EPS of $0.69, both first quarter records, and up 20% on and 40% year-on-year, respectively. Including the anticipated effect of the Shanghai factory lockdown, we expect revenue of $1.52 billion, reflecting year-on-year growth of 8%. Demand for our technology and services remain strong, and Amkor is well positioned within key growth markets of 5G, IoT, automotive and high-performance computing. And finally, I would like to thank our global Amkor team for delivering an excellent first quarter. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call."
