    "content": " We are expecting Q4 revenue between $1.8 billion and $1.9 billion, representing year-on-year growth of 7% and contributing to full year growth of around 15%, well above the semi industry growth estimates for 2022 of mid single digits. Considering our fourth quarter guide, our second half 2022 estimated performance, results in revenue growth of 16% and EPS expansion of around 20% compared to the prior year second half. With respect to the China recovery and the impact of the third quarter, I mean, when we look to the quarter-on-quarter improvement of revenue, then we see about 25% of that's being attributed to the recovery of our ATC factories and the rest is growth. We expect fourth quarter revenue of $1.85 billion, resulting in a second half growth of 16% compared to second half 2021."
