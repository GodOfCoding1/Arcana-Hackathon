    "content": " There are a few dynamics driving this growth: first, we've seen higher small business demand and increased pricing; second, we've been efficiently scaling our team, which has helped us drive higher conversion; and third, we've been successful in landing and expanding within new SMB areas such as payments, insurance and accounting services, and there's still plenty of room to run here. Similar to what we've seen within our SMB business, we expect that by pairing On the Barrelhead's loan matching platform with NerdWallet's trusted brand and massive reach, we can offer more personalized and compelling recommendations to our users, leading to better customer experiences and improved monetization. But despite a very challenging interest rate environment, we're proud of our ability to drive another quarter of strong growth in personal loans as our user experience delivered on key conversion wins, combined with leveraging higher consumer interest. There are some areas where we saw traffic headwinds in Q2, specifically in: mortgages, where the rising interest rates have driven lower consumer demand consistently throughout the year; investing, while not facing as large of a headwind as Q1 when we were lapping the meme stock phenomenon, current market volatility has lowered consumer engagement; and taxes, where we're comping an extended tax season due to the delayed filing date last year."
