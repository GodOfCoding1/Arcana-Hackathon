    "content": " While the focus of today's commentary will be on our fourth quarter performance, we are encouraged by the full year growth we've been able to achieve highlighting years' long success in areas such as credit cards and SMB as well as strength in our banking vertical, offsetting the pressure we saw in mortgages. And after a year of decline due to a pressured macro environment, our insurance vertical delivered revenue growth during Q4 due to a record quarter in auto insurance following the launch of our revamped marketplace and industry recovery. Throughout this past year, we've been prioritizing user registration as a focus area, and that's really helped us to drive growth there, ending the year with 14 million cumulative registered users, which is up 39% year-over-year."
