    "content": " In a testament to NerdWallet's trusted brand and our strong diversification, we have met or exceeded all the goals we outlined for our financial performance despite headwinds in mortgages, insurance and student loans, all while making progress towards our vision of becoming a trusted financial ecosystem for consumers and small- and mid-sized businesses. Finally, other verticals finished Q3 with revenue of $57 million, growing 87% year-over-year, delivering yet another quarter of triple-digit growth in both SMB products and banking. So I guess as we think about the macro, both for Q4 and looking into 2023, for us, the big picture is that as I talk through the puts and takes of some of the macro here, we've managed to grow our business in both years where there's been a really strong cycle versus years where the cycle has been really weak. As we've talked about in the past, we're not making as material of investments in brand this quarter, and as a result, the margin in Q4 is expected to be much higher than the first 3 quarters of the year, which averaged roughly 9%."
