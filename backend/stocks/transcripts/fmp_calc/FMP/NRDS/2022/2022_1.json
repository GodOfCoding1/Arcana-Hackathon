    "content": " We believe our \"Unlock Your Dreams\" brand campaign, combined with a significant increase in the number of registration on-ramps we rolled out across our desktop and mobile experiences, helped us achieve a 65% increase in registrations year-over-year as well as registered user revenue growth of over 80% year-over-year. Obviously, we're seeing really, really strong growth and recovery in credit cards and, as we've talked about, personal loans. I think in terms of unit growth, we still have headroom as well to grow across the credit card funnel from -- everything from top-of-funnel market share to reengaging with our growing base of registered users and on to increasing conversion rates in the marketplace, as Lauren alluded to."
