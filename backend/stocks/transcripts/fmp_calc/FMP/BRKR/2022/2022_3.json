    "content": " Our third quarter 2022 non-GAAP operating income increased 14.2% and our non-GAAP operating margin increased 180 basis points year-over-year to 22.4%, with expanding gross margins and operational leverage more than offsetting our increase in Project Accelerate 2.0 operating expense investments. 2022 non-GAAP operating margin of 22.4% was 180 basis points higher than the 20.6% margin we delivered in the third quarter of 2021, as higher gross margins and operating volume leverage benefits, partially offset our increased sales and marketing investments towards high-growth, high-margin Project Accelerate 2.0 initiatives."
