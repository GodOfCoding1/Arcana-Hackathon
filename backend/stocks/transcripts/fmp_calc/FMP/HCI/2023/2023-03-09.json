    "content": " HCI Group reported net income of $2.6 million and diluted earnings per share of $0.18 for the fourth quarter, an improvement over last year and last quarter. Even with these storm losses included, the fourth quarter consolidated loss ratio was 39.4%, which is the lowest of the year and 1 point lower than the fourth quarter last year. Gross premiums earned were up 17% from the fourth quarter last year to the fourth quarter this year, yet policy acquisition expenses are slightly lower because of the mix of renewals versus new business, lower commissions and lower costs related to the UPC business. During the year, the early loss expense was about $40 million higher than losses paid and reserves are 25% higher at the end of this year than they were at the start. The total dollar amount bought back under that program was $17 million for the year and when combined with the shares bought back as part of our convert offering, the total number of shares bought back in the year was over $1.4 million or about 14% of the shares outstanding at the start of the year. And so when we talk about the consolidated loss ratio going on, let's say, from 40% down to 30%, we're sort of looking at that 25% drop on the 80% of the book that's Florida, but also -- I think the loss ratio on Florida will drop more than that when you take into account some of those other things and that will get us to -- that will get us, I think, to 25% on the full -- on the consolidated loss ratio, even though, to your point, 20% of the book is outside of Florida. At this time, this concludes our question-and-answer session. At this time, this concludes our question-and-answer session."
