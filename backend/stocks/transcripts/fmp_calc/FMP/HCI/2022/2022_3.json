    "content": " In the third quarter, net investment income increased $16 million over last year, including a $13 million gain from the sale of 1.5 acres of land in our Greenleaf subsidiary. The total expense related to Ian this quarter, $77.6 million, $65 million of higher loss expense and $12 million of higher reinsurance expense as we reversed some accrued benefits under our multiyear reinsurance agreement. And lastly, for the non-Florida tower, the expected gross loss is $10 million against the reinsurance limit of $525 million. And when that's taken out, investment income of about $5 million is double what it was in the same quarter last year, and it will continue to increase."
