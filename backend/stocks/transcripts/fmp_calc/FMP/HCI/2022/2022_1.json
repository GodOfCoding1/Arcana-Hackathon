    "content": " The first 3 months of 2022 marked another quarter of growth and profitability for HCI, with reported earnings of $0.09 per share and adjusted earnings of $0.34 per share, excluding the impact of unrealized investment losses. Adjusted net income, which factored out the unrealized investment losses, was $5.5 million compared to $7 million in the same quarter last year and dropped to just $1.5 million despite this being a more active quarter for weather, as I will explain in a minute when I talk about the loss expense. But just as an example, even if we invested, say, half of that, $275 million at 2.5 points, that\u2019s about $7 million a year or $1.75 million per quarter. So, it may look like we haven\u2019t done anything yet, but we are setting the stage behind the scenes in a lot of ways, waiting for the right moment to come along just like the $600 million cash on the balance sheet until December \u2013 even in December, it was not really an item because it was close \u2013 we were aware it was building, and then suddenly in the first quarter an opportunity came along and here we are, yes."
