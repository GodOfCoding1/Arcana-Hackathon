    "content": " Before we begin, let me remind you that we will make forward-looking statements during the course of this call, including statements relating to our guidance and expectations for the first quarter and full year 2023, growth and drivers in our business, changes in the threat landscape in the security industry and our competitive position in the market, growth in our customer demand for and adoption of our solutions; planned innovation and new products and services; and our expectations regarding long-term profitability and free cash flow. Calculated current billings, defined as the change in current deferred revenue plus revenue recognized in the quarter grew 23% year-over-year to $238.9 million and benefited from strength in vulnerability management and continued momentum of Tenable One, our exposure management platform. Looking ahead, we expect gross margins for the full year 2023 to be in the high 70% range with modestly improving margins throughout the year as adoption of Tenable One increases and we absorbed the initial costs related to our newer exposure management offerings.
