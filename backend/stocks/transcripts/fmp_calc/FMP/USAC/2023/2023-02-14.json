    "content": " Bear in mind that when USA Compression was formed in 1998, U.S. dry gas production was roughly one half of the current 2023 forecast, and the shale revolution of the early 2000s is the major contributor to the robust increase in domestic natural gas production and consistent with Eric's messaging regarding production declines and reservoir pressures, many years of empirical evidence confirmed that continued production leads to lower producing pressures, which in turn requires an exponential increase in the demand for compression services to produce the same volumes of oil and natural gas."
