    "content": " Commodity prices remained high during the second quarter with natural gas at Henry Hub averaging just shy of $7.50 per MMBtu and West Texas Intermediate crude oil averaging over $108 per barrel, both at the highest level since 2008. If this plan were to occur, the implications for the amount of gas compression required to move the additional volumes of natural gas to LNG plants, roughly a 40% increase from today's total US natural gas production should be very favorable for USA Compression. Today, USA Compression reported second quarter results, including quarterly revenue of $171 million, adjusted EBITDA of $105 million and DCF to limited partners of $56 million, each of which represented an increase over last quarter's performance."
