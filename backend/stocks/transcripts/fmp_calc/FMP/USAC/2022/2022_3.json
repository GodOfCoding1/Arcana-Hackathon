    "content": " In addition to maintaining a healthy coverage ratio -- we reduced our bank covenant leverage ratio from 4.9x to 4.84x on a sequential quarter basis, consistent with our commitment to reduce leverage over time while providing meaningful returns to all of our stakeholders, with lengthening contract tenders for new equipment deployments and contract renewals of existing active assets Absent unexpected events, such as further supply chain disruptions or major geopolitical events, we remain encouraged that both leverage and coverage metrics will continue to improve. These factors, along with our demonstrated ability to build long term relationships with our customers through the provision of high quality service, position USA compression to continue delivering meaningful investment returns to its stakeholders, we would like to re emphasize our track record of 39 consecutive quarterly distributions, and our expectations of continuing to deliver best in class compression services to our customers. We continue to reprice, our existing book, you know, compression compressor, this 10 years old or 20 years old provides the same service that a brand new one does so, the beauty of our business that we says we don't have technological obsolescence is older assets can perform the same service is a new asset which allows us in a market like this to continue to reprice."
