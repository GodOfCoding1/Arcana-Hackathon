    "content": " For the third quarter of 2022, consolidated revenues rose by 6.1% to $8 million from $7.6 million and last year's third quarter. The increase over the prior year quarter was driven by a 40% rise in APC segment revenues to $2.7 million from $1.9 million, reflecting increased project activity and the timing of project execution. FUEL CHEM product line revenue declined to $5.3 million from $5.6 million in last year's third quarter, primarily due to the loss of one customer from a permanent plant retirement."
