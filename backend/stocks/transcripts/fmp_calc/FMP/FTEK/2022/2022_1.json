    "content": " Before turning things over to Vince, I'd like to remind everyone that matters discussed on this call, except for historical information, are forward-looking statements as defined in Section 21-E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as amended, which are made pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, and reflect Fuel Tech\u2019s current expectations regarding future growth, results of operations, cash flows, performance and business prospects, and opportunities, as well as assumptions made by, and information currently available to, our company's management. These statements are based on information currently available to Fuel Tech and are subject to various risks, uncertainties and other factors, including, but not limited to, those discussed in Fuel Tech's annual report on Form 10-K in item 1A under the caption risk factors and subsequent filings under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as amended, which could cause Fuel Tech's actual growth, results of operations, financial conditions, cash flows, performance and business prospects and opportunities to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by these statements. When we last spoke, I had noted that we had expected FUEL CHEM revenues to be in the $13 million to $15 million range for 2022 and that the reduction from 2021 was due to one known plant shutdown as of 12/31/21 from a long term customer in the business segment; the return of a more normalized maintenance outage schedule in 2022; and to the continued pressure on the remainder of our customer base to optimize program usage. The increase was driven by $1.3 million increase in APC segment revenue to $2.2 million from $0.9 million in last year's first quarter, reflecting project execution timing and revenue generation from new orders booked in late 2021 and the first quarter of 2022. The FUEL CHEM product line revenue declined to $3.4 million from $4.1 million in last year's first quarter, primarily due to a decline in power generation demand in the regions our unit serve and to the sale of equipment to a FUEL CHEM customer in the first quarter of the prior year. APC gross margin was 35.2% compared to 41.5% in last year's first quarter due to shift in project and product mix, while gross margin for FUEL CHEM declined from 45.5% from 48% in last year's first quarter, driven by higher material, freight and labor and administrative costs. Our operating loss narrowed to $984,000 from $1.2 million in last year's first quarter, reflecting higher revenues, improved margin and lower operating costs. And I would expect to see that FUEL CHEM for all of \u201822, once we start generating more revenue moving into Q2 and Q3 and offset some of the fixed costs that are associated with that program, that 46% is going to start to increase and push towards 50% once we get to a full year outcome basis."
