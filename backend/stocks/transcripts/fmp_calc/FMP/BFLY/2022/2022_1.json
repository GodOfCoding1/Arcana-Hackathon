    "content": "  Operator: Hello, and welcome to Butterfly Network's First Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. Earlier this morning, Butterfly released financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2022, and provided a business update. The release and earnings presentation, which include a reconciliation of management's use of non-GAAP financial measures compared to the most applicable GAAP measures, are currently available on the Investors section of the company's website at ir.butterflynnetwork.com. Dr. Todd Fruchterman, Butterfly's President and Chief Executive Officer will host this morning's call. During today's call, we will be making certain forward-looking statements. These statements may include statements regarding, among other things, expectations with respect to financial results, future performance, development and commercialization of products and services, potential regulatory approvals, the size and potential growth of current or future markets for our products and services, and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business. These forward-looking statements are based on current information, assumptions, and expectations that are subject to change and involve a number of risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. During this call, we will refer to non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted gross margin, adjusted gross profit, and adjusted EBITDA. Whilst she will not be participating in today's call, I did want to briefly introduce her. Heather spent 12 years at BioTelemetry, a publicly traded remote medical technology company, where she served as Executive Vice President and Chief Financial and Administrative Officer. Before this, Heather held various leadership positions at companies including Alita Pharmaceuticals, VIASYS Healthcare and Sunoco. Our team has come together to not only realize but to accelerate the vision of Dr. Jonathan Rothberg an Butterfly\u2019s early trailblazing scientists to set out to make healthcare more effective, more accessible, more equitable and more affordable by enabling clinicians to accelerate diagnosis and care and to improve patient wellness and convenience. In today's discussion, you will not only hear how we are catalyzing care transformation across health systems, but also how we are enabling maternal imaging in Africa, facilitating emergency care in Ukraine, providing EMS teams with imaging capabilities and empowering veterinarians across the country to more quickly assess and address animal health needs. We are unified by a belief that our technology will dramatically elevate care across use cases and care continuum, and we are investing heavily in our people and product development to meaningfully capture our first-mover advantage. From a revenue perspective, we opened the year with $15.6 million in quarterly revenues, a 25% increase versus the first quarter of 2021. I'm immensely proud of our Butterfly team for their work this past quarter and throughout the pandemic, which has been a challenging and chaotic period in healthcare delivery. In Q1, at the American Institute of Ultrasound in Medicine Annual Meeting, Dr. Abraham Verghese of Stanford University called out in a keynote speech that it was his hope that recent advancements an ultrasound technology would bring new life to the bedside exam and help foster greater connection between the doctor and the patient. Further, the Institute's President, Dr. Nazarian, supported this sentiment by saying resist the trend of commoditizing ultrasound as just another study that we read wasted in a dark room understand the importance of getting up, scanning and interacting with patients. Our team continues to make progress against our core principles of making Butterfly easy, everywhere and economical. In a landmark study published March 28 in the New England Journal of Medicine Evidence, Butterfly was found to be an effective tool to estimate fetal gestational age just as accurately as a trained sonographer using a standard ultrasound machine. Dr. Joni Price at UNC, who led the study said, armed with a pocket-sized Butterfly probe and the smartphone as Zambian midwife with no prior training in sonography can assess gestational age as accurately as a certified sonographer using an expensive machine. The results of this study offer hope to millions of mothers, when it comes to determining risk and ensuring good quality maternal care. Additionally, ultrasound, as part of routine care can demonstrate the benefit of a patient seeing their health, whether it be a greater willingness to seek out appropriate free natal care or to pursue proper vaccinations. In addition to such external validation, we continue to strengthen and differentiate our educational curriculum, in-app guidance and associated services to take the burden off the user, while increasing their confidence in scanning with a Butterfly. Fifth, alongside our team's ongoing development of AI to enable and simplify bedside ultrasound for those not traditionally trained in it is core to making Butterfly adaptable at scale. The American Academy of Family Physicians is now recommending that family medicine residents be trained in point-of-care ultrasound, in curriculum guidelines, AAFP, called out that point-of-care ultrasound will transform family physicians' ability to arrive at a rapid diagnosis for patients. It's this type of catalyst that our clinical, education and commercial teams are prepared to quickly activate around and already have. Also this past quarter, I was reminded of the importance of our Everywhere principle as our team worked to arm caregivers who are aiding in the humanitarian crisis in and around Ukraine. Due to our mission, we were able to equipped care teams on the front lines of this crisis with Butterfly, and we're already the hearing of the value it's bringing to this distressing situation. The use of Butterfly and such a backdrop reinforces what we are doing, innovating to inform better decisions so people everywhere get the care they need. If we take a quick look at our third principle, economical, one area where Butterfly is increasingly seen as becoming a standard of care is with diagnostic assessment of the lungs. In Q1, the Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine featured a retrospective multicenter study of 479 patients that found point-of-care ultrasound to bring radiation-free, affordable and equivalent diagnostic accuracy to a long assessment as compared to chest x-ray. Given the magnitude and regularity of patients who present with respiratory distress, we're encouraged that Butterfly is being increasingly used by and adding value with a wide range of clinicians to inform decision-making and in turn, to expedite treatment. We are pleased with our Q1 year-over-year growth in the hospital and health system space, which benefited from solid momentum in software sales and from deeper penetration with current clients. Looking ahead, we believe the industry's growing interest to educate and train practitioners to incorporate ultrasound information into the clinical workflow across the enterprise will help drive continued growth in our Blueprint offering. Our first enterprise-wide deployment with Rochester is the embodiment of our Blueprint solution, utilizing Butterfly to advanced care delivery, medical education and clinical research. I'm happy to share that in Q1, we solidified a distribution partnership with Novolog, a leading health care services group in Israel. One of these comes from the UK, where we've begun working with East of England Ambulance Trust, which provides accident and emergency services, covering an area made up of around 6.2 million people. This will allow us to further demonstrate the value of Butterfly in the hands of EMS teams, which represents a substantial opportunity for Butterfly in many markets. Also, as we previously announced, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation provided a $5 million grant to help bring Butterfly to sub-Saharan Africa to improve maternal and fetal health. This grant enables our teams to arm 1,000 health care workers with Butterfly iQ+. 500 probes will be given to mid-level practitioners in Kenya, and 500 probes will be distributed to healthcare workers in South Africa later this year. In addition to the clinical evidence supporting Butterfly, the increasing prevalence of chronic diseases is spurring interest and use cases in in-home care. As part of our clinical program, we are launching multiple studies to evaluate the use of Butterfly for bladder scanning, heart failure and dialysis. And finally, as I've covered on past calls, we are exploring markets adjacent to health care. Beginning this year, Butterfly iQ+ Vet will be deployed and become standard across 200 eco clinic locations in the United States. Whether used as part of routine exams for early detection or for intervention, Butterfly iQ+ Vet will expand the services offered to Petco pet owners, and more importantly, will deliver valuable insights to veterinarians, elevating the care delivered in Petco examiners. This partnership is driven by an aligned vision and a mission with Petco, a health and wellness company focused on creating a better world for animals and the people who love and need them. Our team maintained focus on deploying Butterfly iQ+ Vet to the more than 250,000 veterinarians and vet techs globally who could benefit from having Butterfly in their pocket. As we stated at the beginning of the year, we believe that Butterfly can be as ubiquitous as to stethoscope across all specialties, species and care settings. Over the past year, we've empowered the use of ultrasound where ultrasound is not traditionally utilized and where ultrasound expertise is not traditionally found. Revenue for Q1 2022 was $15.6 million, a 25% increase versus the prior year period and in line with our expectations. Product revenue was $11 million, an increase of 15% versus Q1 2021. This increase was driven by higher average selling prices and volumes in both our US and international healthcare channels, as well as in the vet market. Subscription revenue was $4.6 million in the first quarter, growing by approximately 60% over the prior year period. This increase was primarily due to product mix, reflecting a higher proportion of subscription revenues in addition to higher device prices and volume. Adjusted gross profit margin was 56.3% for the first quarter, which compares to 47.8% in Q1 2021, reflecting the positive mix, higher product ASP and manufacturing efficiencies. For the first quarter of 2022, adjusted EBITDA was a loss of $40 million compared with a loss of $26.5 million for the same period in 2021. These investments were partially offset by increased adjusted gross margin dollars, driven by the aforementioned positive product mix, ASPs and volume. In addition to our operating expenses, our Q1 cash position was impacted by fiscal 2021 annual bonus payout, capital expenditures for the build-out of our headquarters in Burlington, Massachusetts, and the annual renewal of insurance premiums. Looking at our 2022 guidance, given the strong start to the year, we are reaffirming the previously issued annual revenue guidance of $83 million to $88 million and the adjusted EBITDA guidance for a loss of $175 million to $195 million. As a reminder, we expected about 40% to 45% of 2022 revenue in the first half of the year and 55% to 60% in the second half. For some additional color, as mentioned, we are expecting 25% to 30% growth in the first half of the year and approximately 45% growth in the second half. We do, however, anticipate that our subscription sales as a percentage of revenue and gross margin percentage to increase for the full year 2022 versus 2021. For operating expenses, please remember we are doing two things simultaneously: one, we are building a domestic and international commercial organization to support our current revenue base; and two, we are investing in R&D resources to create future revenue streams. Because we are investing significantly for the future and expecting operating leverage on these investments in subsequent years, we believe at this time, adjusted gross margin are the best predictor of our future profitability. In closing, time and time again, Butterfly's unique ability to serve its valuable clinical information quickly and easily, where otherwise does not exist, is winning the hearts and minds of practitioners and leaders across healthcare. This is not about doing more ultrasound, but about using the valuable information from ultrasound to better inform care decisions everywhere. And thank you, to the Butterfly team for the amazing and important work you continue to do. I think there's some med tech companies that have relayed kind of a slow start to the capital purchasing or capital budgets for U.S. hospitals for systems like robots, but Butterfly iQ is in a different category, being a couple of thousand dollars per device versus kind of 1 million plus per robot, high-ticket other capital equipment. And I think we see that as it relates to a number of factors coming together, coming out of managing the pandemic, a whole bunch of dynamics with how care is being delivered, a whole bunch of things within society, employment, et cetera. That said, we think we're actually in a fairly good position, because we think we're not seeing a lot of challenges as a lot of objections to working with Butterfly and exploring the solutions for health care systems. So as you put together a butterfly solution and you have the ability to look at how you go about deploying, how you step into the software, how you step into deploying probes, it actually becomes economically beneficial. So I think as systems get educated about it, as they understand the utility of Butterfly in helping them provide more efficient, more effective care and workflows across the health system. So economically, I think it's been -- I think we don't benefit from the challenges, but I think we benefit from where we're positioned as a solution moving forward in this environment. But just wanted to check in on semiconductor chip supply, but also in the other supply chain constraints that you're facing, and it sounds -- it seems like you're navigating through this these macro challenges effectively on the supply side, but just wanted to kind of check that thought. So -- right now, our relationship with TSMC is great, and we haven't had any issues as it relates to the semiconductor components of our device as we've spoken to you before, and I think that's an advantage for us as we've gone into this. So, I think that's been an advantage of ours, Josh, by being in the market. I think when people look at the landscape of devices, we're here. And I just want to ask about the guidance reiteration revenue guidance range intact, understand the balance in terms of how we should be thinking about growth in the first half or the second half, that was very helpful. And how -- I mean, I think -- we're thinking that the sales pipeline on the enterprise channel is building up nicely. But that's what's giving you the confidence in the back half, but any other details you can share would be super helpful. So, I think you're getting more familiar with the story and I would start there, Josh. I would say that we see confidence in our sales pipeline building as we've gone through, we've been in a number of conversations, and we continue to have things working through our pipeline as we've evolved our value proposition into the enterprise channel. As more time goes on, we're able to enhance our product offering, which is creating more value, which is helping us to be able to move through and be more aggressive as we move through the pipeline and we sign more deals, those will help us in the back half of the quarter, we see external trends supporting our value proposition where we're going as some of the guidelines and recommendations that have come around. So, our natural cadence in the business and as we see things kind of evolving and coming together, we see the back half really pulling together nicely. And just thinking about the -- you laid it out there in your prepared remarks and your presentation, but just -- it seems like you're making nice progress in all four pillars, but enterprise channel, international, debt, and then even kind of start kicking off some of these clinical trials in the home channel. I think this is where we're kind of balancing where we are in the story, which is the early part of the story, Joshua. But right now, given where we were and how we started out, we're seeing a lot of our efforts materializing in health system. We're also moving in our geographical expansion, but that's coming. Right now, we've done a lot of work in our pipeline and our solution that we're offering. We're starting to get momentum in our international geographical expansion and you've seen that in some of our global health initiatives, and we want to stay committed to our global health equity initiatives both here in the United States and around the world. But what we've been all about is the utility of information from ultrasound, and we believe that path to home as you think about where care is going, how information drives that care and how standard of care across different settings to be equal in order to maintain a high quality of care in alternative settings is really important. We see the path to home as being very important, but that's the one that we're really developing right now. I think if you think about home as a journey and it's the site of care, no, I think that home is a destination. So today, people are delivering care in the home, Butterfly provides benefits to people to practitioners who are going out in the home setting and delivering care to patients. It's about getting information and informing care decisions, so we're demonstrating the value of that in a different care setting today by getting it in the hands of practitioners or going out of the hospital to the home to deliver care, and we're already doing that. So that as you use that information in managing disease, identifying disease and then continuing to do that in a broader and more expanded way to getting patients more involved in their care, getting that information last at point in time, but more as a continuum to practitioner and that's really the evolution. We then want to bring it in the hands of patients so that information flow can continue, and we want to ultimately evolve it to other form factors where we can have that information more seamlessly coming. It's just that we're starting that journey, and we're going to continue that evolution as we go on. So we have some of that data with practitioners doing that evidence, now some of those studies are going on, and we hope to see some of that data towards the end of this year and at the beginning of next year. And then this story is just going to keep evolving, and we're just going to keep telling the story. Just thinking about enterprise contracts, the big University of Rochester win and then how we should be kind of incorporating those enterprise wins into our models, just from a revenue ratio standpoint, it looks like Butterfly iQ device deployment will start in the second quarter is a multiyear agreement, thousands of devices being deployed. So I think, Josh, this is the part where we're working on and how they're coming in will help us as we continue to texture revenue. I think what it demonstrates is that our revenue is multicomponent and so that -- there's different elements to how we're going to be building, which hopefully would also get some comment, some confidence as we continue to move through because upfront, actually, we look at some elements of the software, which enable the deployment, right? And so, right now, we're at the phase where we're bringing software up to speed and understanding the services component and to maximize the deployment we're going to be bringing devices onboard with time, that we'll be doing that. But that -- but what I would caution you is we look to -- look at as a predictor, right now, what it is as an enabler -- and so this is really what we're learning with them on how we can package this. And so I think these big deployments early are a huge advantage for us because they're allowing us to absorb and learn the multi elements that are required to actually do something completely different, which is to bring in counter-based workflow with ultrasound into clinical care. And we're going to package it, and then it will be more predictable as we go through and then understanding how it impacts revenue moving forward into the future. And then as we do some of the smaller ones, we're taking elements of it and bringing that together. And lastly, just thinking the bill indicates -- grants $5 million. So I think you're thinking about exactly correct, Josh."
