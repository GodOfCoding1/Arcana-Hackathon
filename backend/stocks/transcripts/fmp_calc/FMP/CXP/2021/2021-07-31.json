And to remind everybody, though the rent ranges on those properties, as we\u2019ve been talking about for the last couple of years is sort of mid-100s or above in terms of gross rental rate for 10-year deals, not quite that at the 80 M Street property in D.C. We pre-leased a little over half of that space. We\u2019ve got about $2 million, I think, in the first quarter and another $6.5 million or so this quarter, which we are \u2013 whatever it is, we\u2019re adding it back for normalized FFO, but not adding it back for AFFO."
