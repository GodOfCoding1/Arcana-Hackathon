    "content": " We also continued the expansion of our solar module manufacturing capacity at our flagship facility in McClellan Park, California and expect to reach a capacity of 650 megawatts of production capacity by the end of this year. With COVID restrictions continue to win, we had an opportunity to meet face-to-face with buyers at two key events, showcasing our latest SolarJuice product offerings at Smart Energy 2022 Australia Premium event for Solar Storage and Energy Management, as well as our solar and renewable energy products, including solar panels, residential energy storage system and EV charger at the RE+ Texas solar and energy storage tradeshow in San Antonio, Texas. As sales continue to grow from our increased production capacity, we believe this will improve as this will provide tremendous strategic value creating positive synergies across our solar and renewable energy business development efforts. As mentioned earlier, our solar and EV wholesale business, coupled with our residential solar and roofing installation business and the new American solar module manufacturing business, are expected to be the primary revenue drivers in 2022 with EV sales accelerating as the year progresses. I think things like head count may go up a little, but it's going to be -- as the scale grows, especially in the solar module manufacturing, we should get quite a bit of operating leverage going forward."
