    "content": " Currently, most of our solar module manufacturing capacity have been sold out this year, with the operation gross margin more than 35%. Under the Inflation Reduction Act, this additional $0.07 per watt manufacturing incentive will be starting next year in 2023 which we expect will help to further improve our income of solar module manufacturing business by additional 10% to 15% next year. The recent Federal Inflation Reduction Act benefits solid SolarJuice as a U.S.-based solar module manufacturer, with incentive becoming effective in 2023, meaning we will be eligible for an additional $0.07 per watt incentive which will increase our other income by 10% to 15%. For the quarter ended September 30, 2022, our net sales increased 10.9% to $43.2 million up from 39 million in Q3 of 2021. Our cost of revenue which consists primarily of raw material and labor costs increasing to $45.5 million in the third quarter, up from $40.1 million in Q3 of 2021, and consistent with our increase in net revenues. Total operating expenses in Q3 decreased to $11.5 million or 27% of net sales, down from $14.9 million, or 38% of net sales in the third quarter of 2021. This will be the driver of our revenue growth in the coming quarters and especially for next year, because it's a big incentive from the recently passed of the Inflation Reduction Act. We will be -- it will happen, because it's either the quarter four and the big increase will be like gross margin of the business because our American module manufacturing business have got 35% gross margin, and it's a very healthy business and the gross margin isn't higher than other buildings that we operate in today. So we have just for in California Sacramento facility, the 650 megawatt module manufacturing capacity may put us over more than $300 million revenue if we produce all the modules we produce."
