    "content": " Importantly, we continue to build our brands' awareness and expand our customer base, as evidenced by 23% growth in active customers compared to the same period last year, led by growth in the U.S.  We are still in the early days of our U.S. market awareness and have significant opportunity ahead of us. While Culture Kings' current priority is U.S. expansion, we're pleased that the Australia stores rebounded in the third quarter with the return of live events and in-store activation. We have an exciting quarter ahead with the opening of the Culture Kings U.S. flagship, and our women's brands are well positioned for the holiday season. In the U.S., third quarter net sales increased to $82 million, up 8% from the third quarter last year, primarily driven by the addition of Mnml as well as Petal & Pup's growth, which continued to be our fastest growing brand in the U.S.  Australia net sales decreased 9% to $58 million and were down 2% on a constant currency basis."
