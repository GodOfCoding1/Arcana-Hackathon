    "content": " In the U.S., fourth quarter net sales decreased to $71 million, down 11% from the fourth quarter last year, driven by macro factors, including softness in demand trends, the highly promotional macro environment, fewer new styles in our women's brands as we look through -- move through inventory in the back half and our decision to pull back on marketing. When adjusted for the impact of the $3.7 million Culture Kings inventory step-up in the fourth quarter last year, gross margins would have declined 360 basis points, largely the result of a lower mix of full price items. As it relates to our own inventory, I think we've made really nice progress on bringing down the inventory dollars as we've gone through the back half, so down $17 million at the end of the year versus June of last year. And we've seen -- you've seen nice bit of progress there even in the Q4 P&L, right, that our selling expenses are down versus Q3 in a time where you have more surcharges from carriers and those extra charges, I think, is kind of progress and kind of gives us confidence as we think about next year's P&L and the long-term model that we have in this business."
