    "content": " As further evidence of the growing momentum, fixed wireless access represented more than half of broadband net additions in the first quarter 2022 across the Top 6 providers in the U.S. Recognizing the substantial SAM expansion opportunity, earlier this month, we introduced our 5G mmWave beamformer IC, initially targeting customer premise equipment in the 5G carrier market In addition to being Peraso\u2019s first 5G mmWave product, we believe that our solution is the world's most highly integrated 5G beamformer, which include Peraso\u2019s advanced 5G antenna technology. Product revenue from the sale of our integrated circuits and modules was $3.2 million, compared with $1.9 million in the prior quarter and $1.1 million in the first quarter of the prior year. Total operating expenses for the first quarter of 2022 on a non-GAAP basis, which excludes stock-based compensation and amortization of reported intangible assets were $6.7 million, compared with $3.7 million in the prior quarter and $2.9 million in the same quarter a year ago. On a GAAP basis, net loss for the first quarter of 2022 was $6.8 million or a loss of $0.34 per share compared with net income of $2.5 million or $0.28 per diluted share in the prior quarter, and a net loss of $4.2 million or a loss per share of $0.79 in the same quarter a year ago. On a non-GAAP basis, net loss for the first quarter of 2022 was $5.1 million or a loss of $0.25 per share, which excludes a stock-based compensation and amortization of reported intangibles. Adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter of 2022 was negative $4.3 million, compared with negative $2.8 million in the prior quarter and negative $2.2 million in the prior year period. The burn of $5.9 million for the first quarter of 2022 was primarily attributable to our negative EBITDA of $4.3 million, payment of $1.1 million of transaction costs incurred in the quarter ended December 31, 2021 relating to the business combination between Peraso and MoSys, and a $0.7 million increase in inventory, partially offset by increased collections of accounts receivable."
