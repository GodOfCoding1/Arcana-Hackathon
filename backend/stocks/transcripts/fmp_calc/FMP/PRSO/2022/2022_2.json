    "content": " Growth in the quarter was driven by record product revenue and more specifically, the continued ramp of Peraso's mmWave ICs and modules for the fixed wireless access market. Further supporting the continuation of these current trends, the federally funded Rural Digital Opportunity Fund, RDOF is poised to provide $20 billion of retainers to incentivized deployment in broadband that work to access in rural communities across the U.S. As demonstrated by our solid revenue growth in the second quarter, we continue to make great progress running our existing tier 1 customers while also extending Peraso's leadership position in the fixed wireless market. Total operating expenses for the second quarter of 2022 on a non-GAAP basis, which excludes stock-based compensation and amortization of reportable intangible assets were $6.6 million compared with $6.9 million in the prior quarter and $2.8 million in the same quarter a year ago. So I think we are part of this overall trend, I mean what we are seeing is idea that in the fixed wireless market obviously there is a lot of unhappy people with recurrent internet situation and so we happen to be tapping into that, so obviously from our perspective we had a great second quarter, our bookings for July I think reflected that trend 6.4 million and so as Jim mentioned we had great momentum going into Q3, Q4, and into Q1."
