    "content": " Total operating expenses for the third quarter of 2022 on a non-GAAP basis, which excludes stock-based compensation and amortization of reported intangible assets were $3.3 million compared with $6.6 million in the prior quarter and $3.1 million in the same quarter, a year ago. On a non-GAAP basis, net loss for the third quarter of 2022 was $2 million or a loss of $0.10 per share, which exclude stock-based compensation and amortization of reported intangibles.
