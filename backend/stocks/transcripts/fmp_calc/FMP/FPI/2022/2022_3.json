    "content": " But in the last -- in the 5 years prior to the last 2, we had really seen sideways appreciation, 0% to 2% kind of range and therefore, there was a lot of potential appreciation of pent-up potential appreciation in the marketplace that there has really come to the 4%  in the last 18 to 24 months. Similar to Q3, the year-to-date performance is due to increased revenue, reduced legal and accounting expense and reduced distributions on preferred stock, partly offset by an increase in cost of goods sold due to directly operating more farms and an increase in G&A expenses due to the acquisition of MWA in late '21."
