    "content": " Leverage is down on the Company and we are still trading at a substantial discount in net asset value, probably in my estimation at today's trading rates, we're probably trading in the neighborhood of $1.50 a share below net asset value. For the three months end of June 30, 2022 net income was positive $3 million compared to negative $2.9 million for Q1 '21, an increase of $5.9 million. Similar to Q1, the year-to-date improved performance was due to increased revenue, reduced legal and accounting expenses and reduced distributions on preferred stock, offset partly by increase in cost of goods sold due to directly operating more farms and an increase in general and administrative expenses due to the acquisition of MWA in late '21. Same row-crop farms were up $0.4 million from year-to-date '21 to year-to-date '22, the fixed payments associated with acquisitions, dispositions and other items was up $0.8 million. But as we look into the back half of this year, I'm just wondering if there's any pushback coming from the other side of your farm renegotiations are -- is the recent rollover in commodity prices affecting that 15% effective renewal rate that you've been achieving so far in the front half of the year. If you look at farmland in a long-term sense, there are forms that, for example, that I personally own that might have a 25% or 30% cap rate today against the original purchase price because you've got decades of rent increases embedded in that, even though the purchase price obviously didn't change, and you didn't have to make additional CapEx into the asset."
