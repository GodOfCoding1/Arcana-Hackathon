    "content": " Our net hires nearly doubled on a sequential basis, and we grew our workforce by 2.5% during the first quarter, which with more than 33,000 associates, was and continues to be a sizable undertaking. Speaking of contract labor, while Omicron put additional pressure on an already difficult labor environment, our first quarter contract labor expenses improved slightly on a sequential basis, all the while ensuring we continue to appropriately staff our communities. Starting with labor on a same community basis, the first quarter labor expense increased nearly 4.5% sequentially. Health insurance expense was higher, with the first quarter net hires nearly doubling sequentially, we continued to use contract labor as new associates were on-boarded and trained. Within our annual guidance, let me share some high-level sequential expectations from the first quarter to the second quarter, with occupancy inflecting positive in March and momentum continuing in April, we expect our sequential occupancy growth in the second quarter will be better than the first to second quarter growth of 2021, which was 90 basis points. For OpEx, as we continue making progress on our net hire initiative, we expect contract labor to decrease, partially offset by the community's annual merit increase, which occurred in mid-March and will have a full quarter impact in the second quarter. As we've said, even with the additional labor needs associated with growing occupancy, we still expect total labor expense will decrease from the first quarter results as we reduce contract labor."
