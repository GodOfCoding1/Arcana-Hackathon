    "content": " On a same community basis, fourth quarter RevPAR grew 10% versus the prior year fourth quarter, which included strong move in results at increased rates that began for new residents in October. As Cindy shared, the January 1st in place resident rate increases, which were higher than in prior years, are expected to address higher labor costs, which is the most significant portion of community operating expense, as well as inflationary increases on food, supplies, and utilities as well as rising interest rates. Specifically, on the adjusted EBITDA and adjusted free cash flow slide in the supplemental deck, beginning in the first quarter of 2023 cash facility operating lease payments will increase approximately $5.5 million quarterly, lowering adjusted EBITDA with an equal and offsetting quarterly interest expense net decrease.
