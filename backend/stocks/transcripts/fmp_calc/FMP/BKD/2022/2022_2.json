    "content": " And if you look at the COVID-19 summary that we have in our supplement, on page 20, it's important to note that that COVID-19 labor cost doesn't include the incremental cost of associates who may need to quarantine, and therefore the incremental contract labor overtime that comes from that, which really kind of takes me to my next point on sort of the COVID-19 costs, if you think about just the extra labor expense that we've had during the first-half of the year and the other COVID costs, our COVID costs were about $12.3 million in the first-half of the year."
