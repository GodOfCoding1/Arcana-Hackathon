    "content": " We are pleased that the contract labor declined more than 40% from the second to third quarter and offset nearly all of the sequential incremental cost, most notably the extra calendar day, which was also a holiday. In the fourth quarter, barring a significant disruptive COVID-19 variant surge, we expect to continue reducing premium labor have a larger Brookdale workforce and as occupancy continues to increase, expect to see more efficiencies in our operations. Turning to operating expenses, starting with the labor, the third quarter labor expenses increased 1% on a sequential basis. We reduced contract labor by more than 40%, which mitigated increases for an additional calendar day, which was also a holiday and direct labor and overlapping costs due to training new associates. Barring a significant disruptive flu or COVID-19 variant surge, the fourth quarter facility operating expenses are expected to be lower in the third quarter due to a continued reduction of premium labor, lower seasonal utilities along with more efficiency in our operational workforce. And the RevPAR that we are going to see next year, I gave you an example of 2021 fourth quarter into 2022, RevPAR being up 5.4% on a slightly less than double digit in-place rate increase."
