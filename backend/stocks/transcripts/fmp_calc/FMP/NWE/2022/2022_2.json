    "content": " The photograph on the cover of the deck you're looking at is taken from the Rimrock's above Billings in Yellowstone County, Montana and that's appropriate because, as you know, we're working very hard to ensure adequate delivery and generating capacity in the Billings area, particularly the Yellowstone County Generating Station, but also other work as well. As Bob noted, an operational quarter with some significant events there and then we look at results from a Q2 perspective, you'll see on Slide 4, as Bob mentioned, lower at the net income line by 7.4 million, coming in at 29.8 million of net income or $0.54. The thing I would mention is after adjusting for non-GAAP items, which I'll get into in a little bit more detail here that is actually improvement at the net income line of 30.1 million in Q2 2022 versus 29.2 million in Q2 of 2021 or $0.54 as compared with $0.56. So because it's related to prior periods and legislation is no longer applicable, we've added that back and obviously our weather adjustment is typical, so that gets us to a non-GAAP net income basis of 30.1 million or $0.54 as compared to the prior period. Moving on to Slide 12, really looking forward and because of that significant investment we've made over the last five years matter of fact going back as far as 2015 on the natural gas side and 2017 on the electric side, result of that investment primarily, we're going to need to file an electric and natural gas rate case in Montana."
