    "content": " The other thing I will mention is Brian just covered the key things that we executed upon in '22 is how important that '22 was from a base and foundation for us of laying the groundwork for a strong rate case that we're working with staff and the commission and interveners on and continue on regulatory execution, but also importantly, from a credit metrics perspective, resolving our negative outlook with Moody's and continuing to enable a strong foundation for growth as we go forward. So what was it that drove us outside of our expectations and importantly, towards the latter part of the year, and I'll speak to the storm that Brian just laid out the criticality of supply for us, the criticality of that to our customers and the work that we do, but also how that impacts us, is while we did expect to see some higher O&M, and if you'll recall in our bridge, we had $0.04 to $0.06 from a full year basis, that was a $0.20 headwind to us. And you see the offsets here of operating costs driving up and also interest expense and property taxes, the general things that we've discussed as headwinds for us and a bit of favorable income tax from a quarter perspective, closing that out at $1.16 on a GAAP basis and again, $1.13 on an adjusted non-GAAP basis. And I would tell you, we've had a really strong year from a cash flow perspective, and you can see that in the numbers on this page of significant improvement of cash from operating activities versus the prior year and think about that as selecting some of those deferred costs from the prior period. From a capital investment perspective, I think from the last five years, we invested about $2.1 billion over those five years and obviously, heavily weighted in the back years as we embarked on building Yellowstone County plant."
