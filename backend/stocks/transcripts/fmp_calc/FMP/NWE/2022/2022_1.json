    "content": " Net income for the quarter of $59.1 million, which is lower than the prior year first quarter of $63.1 million; diluted earnings per share of $1.08 versus $1.24 in the prior period, and on a non-GAAP basis, $1.09. And I would argue that's primarily just to recover the substantial investment and other costs that we've incurred since our last rate case, expect to file for a midyear 2022 on a 2021 test year with some other adjustments accordingly. I think one thing on the PCCAM side, if you looked at our filing, and Bob alluded to earlier what we saw in higher prices, and of course, we are on the market more than our mid-cap peers are you could see in our filing last year the amount of outsized costs above the base in that filing."
