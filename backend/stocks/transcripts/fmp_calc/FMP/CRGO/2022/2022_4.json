    "content": " In order of you to verify that we have a supply brings, demand brings, supply flywheel, we publish two more KPIs, the number of carriers that is the number of air and ocean carriers selling on our platform, and the number of unique buyer users buying on our platform, which includes the number of unique individuals at importers, exporters, or freight forwarders who are logged in and make a booking. So I think it's a wonderful testament to the strength of our platform that we are able to project strong growth this year, even in an industry which is going through a contraction cycle. Still, even with the freight industry going through a contraction phase of its business cycle, 2023 should see revenues increase to between $22.3 million and $23.6 million, and at the end of 2023, we will have even more supply, more demand and more liquidity in our marketplace. So we've always said that we see ourselves primarily as a platform company, and the reason for that is what I spoke about in my opening remark that marketplaces, platforms and specifically platforms, which are marketplaces, which are matching supply and demand have a very strong growth dynamic that they've got this network effect and that they grow like a flywheel."
