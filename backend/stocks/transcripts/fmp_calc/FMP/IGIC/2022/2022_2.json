You will have seen our results press release, which we issued after the market closed yesterday. If you'd like a copy of the press release, it's available in the Investor Section of our website at www.iginsure.com. On today's call are Wasef Jabsheh, Chairman and CEO; Waleed Jabsheh, President; and Pervez Rizvi, Chief Financial Officer. Wasef will begin the call with some high level comments before handing over to Waleed to talk you through the key drivers of our results for the second quarter and half year, and also giving some insight into current market conditions and our outlook for the remainder of 2022. We caution you that such forward-looking statements should not be regarded as a representation by us that future plans, estimates or expectations contemplated by us will, in fact, be achieved. Actual events or results may differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors, including the risk factors set out in the company's annual report on Forms 20-F for the year ended December 31, 2021, the company's reports on Form 6-K and other filings with the SEC, as well as our press release issued yesterday evening. In addition, we use some non-IFRS financial measures in this conference call for a reconciliation of non-IFRS financial measures to the nearest IFRS measures, please see our earnings release, which has been filed with the SEC and is available on our Web site. On the back of our strong start in the first quarter of 2022, IGI continues to perform well with another set of excellent results recording record for the second quarter and first half of Q2. While one or two quarters may stand out compared to others, we are solely focused on our ability to perform well over a sustained period of time. Over the past 10 years, we have achieved an average combined ratio of 80% and a core operating return on average equity of more than 11%. In a moment, I will have over to Waleed to discuss our results in more detail and our outlook of the market and the specifics of the opportunities ahead of us. The growth is speaking, market conditions remain favorable and we continue to see attractive rate increases across the number of business lines and territories, and we see excellent opportunities to expand our portfolio. We have noted in prior quarters that the pace of rate increase is declining, but we are still achieving meaningful increases across most of the lines we like and we are exactly where we need to be to continue to benefit from the momentum for the foreseeable future. Clearly, we are operating in an increasingly challenging environment where elevated inflationary pressures and rising interest rates and broader economic pressure pose  challenges to our business. So while we are very focused on what's going on inside IGI, we are equally focused on what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going  our ability to navigate these challenges and stay successful means having the right people with right experience and the right level of focus and discipline to manage through any scenario and deliver on the promises we make. Now, Waleed can take you through the results for the quarter and half year and provide more details on our outlook for the remainder of 2022. I'm going to take a different or slightly different approach this quarter and focus more on what's going on inside IGI, and also what we're seeing in the market and the opportunities ahead of us. As Wasef said, the results for the second quarter and half year are very strong. While the half year result is exceptional, like Wasef said, we do look at our performance over a longer term period rather than specific quarters or years. Another item of note in our results this quarter as well as the prior quarters is the balance sheet impact of the foreign currency exchange movements, driven by the continued strengthening of the US dollar. As you know, our industry will always have quarterly volatility in one or another and we've said this many times before, it's more indicative to look at the longer term trends. With our 20 year history, IGI has obviously been tested many times and we've got a history of adapting as and when we need to, and now is no different. As we continue to experience instability and uncertainty across the globe, rising inflation, both social and financial is impacting our business. We tend to take a conservative view with all aspects given the complexity and inherent uncertainty in our industry, but we took additional steps during the second quarter to account for the inflation . Lastly, we made some adjustments to asset allocation in our investment portfolio during Q2, including increasing our allocation to higher rated bonds, and managing the duration of the bond portfolio, bringing it down from 3.9 years average at 31st of March to 3.5 years at the 30th of June. I'll say a few words about market conditions, our position in the market and the outlook for the remainder of 2022 and beyond. I mean, we're now more than halfway through the year and all indications are trending in the right direction. Just elaborating on Wasef\u00e2\u0080\u0099s earlier remarks, we're continuing to see healthy rate movements across our portfolio. There's not been any change in claims activity, but we're taking a cautious view here. In our short tail portfolio, we've increased line sizes in energy, engineering and property where rates remain healthy and we're seeing good opportunities. In terms of the territorial commentary, US and Europe are both growth markets for us and we expect to see further expansion in those regions during the remainder of the year and further growth in 2023. In the US, as you're all aware, we're primarily writing energy and property business. Similarly, in Europe where our focus has actually been more on the long tail opportunities, primarily DNO and PI, we've written close to $24 million of premium for the first half and we expect to see steady growth going forward. As you know, we've opened our -- we opened our European subsidiary in Malta last year in July to access this business directly in Europe. We've also recently announced that we've signed a letter of intent to acquire Energy Insurance Oslo, a Norwegian based MGA, which we've had an exclusive underwriting agency agreement with since 2009, writing a portfolio mostly upstream energy and construction business. First is to expand the existing business that we've been writing for many years, but second, also to leverage our relationships to access further growth opportunities, not just in Norway but throughout the Scandinavian markets. The principles of EIO have built IGI's brands in Norway, especially in the energy sphere where we have a strong reputation and broad name recognition, and where their efforts have produced solid results for IGI and built a foundation we can now expand upon. We've also recently began the process of establishing an underground presence in Bermuda, where we don't -- where we moved our domicile in 2019, but where we've had a subsidiary underwriting entity for many years. With the new office in Hamilton, we expect to expand our portfolio of reinsurance treaty business in the near term, and we'll be providing more details on this later in the year. What you are not seeing is all the work being done to manage our growth, continue the momentum, manage our risk appetite and ensure that we maintain the track record of strong results that you've seen from us so far this year. We've launched a number of initiatives and made a number of new hires in recent months across the company, not just in underwriting, as I've said previously, but also in investment, IT and operations. Our business, specialty insurance business, requires experienced technical expertise, disciplined and strong leadership. We've proven our ability to manage growth, volatility and the cyclicality of this business and our track record demonstrates this. As of earlier this week, we had repurchased more than three 35,000 common shares at an average price per share of $7.51, well below our 30th of June stated book value of $8.64. Lastly, I would just highlight the dividend announcements we made earlier this morning, which reflects the new dividend policy announced in May. Again, our commitment is to generate value for our shareholders through excellence and underwriting, growing our book value per share and leveraging other capital initiatives. So I'm going to pause here, and we'll turn it over for questions now. So our Bermuda operation, we don't pay any tax  a tax rate but the general tax rate for the UK is around 30%. So this has turned into negative, because you know that we have the first half year operation, which was a loss recorded and we created a deferred tax asset, that is why it has been in negative. We take a more cautious view, especially with long tail business. Obviously, the newer years will be kept and the  not really adjusted that much until we feel more comfortable that we can adjust them. The other question I had, you had commented about I guess expanding the scope of the operations in the Bermuda subsidiary, and you mentioned reinsurance treaty business. I mean, in the near term, it'll most likely be focused on property. But as time goes by, the operation is undoubtedly going to grow and it will grow based on what we feel the opportunities are and where they take us. And the rate increase in the short tail lines of 4.3%, probably a little bit lower than what I've seen reported from some other similar companies. And I was just wondering if you could elaborate on that a little bit more, we've seen other companies that were really more in the mid and high single digits on some of those lines. A small element of that is in the US, which I would assume, the others who have reported, would be more weighted towards the US, whereas, the US makes up about 10% or less than 10% of our overall portfolio. So various territories, different markets, underlying market conditions, it's not going to be the same. But if you look at our US property portfolio, for example, we average rate increases in the US of about just under 20%. I mean, obviously you're making good combined ratios on the rates that you're getting."
