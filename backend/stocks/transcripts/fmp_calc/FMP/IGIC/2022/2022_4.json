    "content": " In each quarter's results in '22, currency movements have contributed to volatility in most of our key metrics; specifically, net underwriting results, combined ratio and core operating results; positively during the first three quarters, when the U.S. dollar strengthened against the pound and euro, and the reversal of that in the fourth quarter when the pound and euro strengthened against the dollar. This is the driver behind the success we've achieved over many years and that is what you're seeing us do again so far in 2023, focusing more on those short-tail reinsurance lines that are showing positive momentum and being more selective on the long-tail business."
