    "content": " For the three months ended September 30th, gross profit was $3.4 million and that was slightly ahead of $3.2 million in last year's quarter and resulted in a 62% growth margin, which was in line with Q3 in 2021. Looking at adjusted EBITDA for the three months ended September 30, 2022, we reported a loss of approximately $1.4 million, narrowing our loss slightly from a year ago and down more significantly from $2.3 million in the June quarter. And in working with these clients and being a really good partner through this period of time, we're in a really great position for a land and expand and to grow with them as they continue to grow because, of course, there's still a tremendous amount of growth opportunity over the next few years in cannabis."
