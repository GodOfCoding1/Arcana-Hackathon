    "content": " Demand has continued--that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s where we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re really seeing--well, and I should temper that because we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re also seeing a real uptick in interest in our MJ platform retail offering in particular, so I would say that the two most--the two biggest opportunities are some real demand for our MJ platform with our MJ retail app, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re starting to really see that accelerate, and then also at both non-existing customers, right, so the one who may be using something else and is ready to upgrade to enterprise, and certainly also from our existing small and midsized client base, folks who are ready to upgrade into some enterprise systems, and they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re really looking at that in a really careful way. We do really take that partnership approach, look for at least an annual contract with our clients, and look - I mentioned already that good software provides an ROI, and software that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s doing its job provides quite a bit more value than it costs, so it may be a little bit more expensive than these very lowest and compliance-only systems, but what you get in exchange for that are very robust reporting, the comfort of knowing that our compliance is going to be best-in-class, and we certainly have historically done extremely well, I would say kind of in the upper end of SMB and midsized business, which is what we see in most markets as they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re emerging."
