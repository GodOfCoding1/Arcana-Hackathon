As we look ahead, we expect overall Nutrition results in Q1 to be lower than the prior year\u00e2\u0080\u0099s record first quarter, with Human Nutrition delivering similar year-over-year results on strong flavors and SI growth and lower Animal Nutrition results primarily due to weaker margins in amino acids.
