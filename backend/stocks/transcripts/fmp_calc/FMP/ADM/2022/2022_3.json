I would now like to introduce your host for today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s call, Megan Britt, Vice President, Investor Relations for ADM. Ms. Britt, you may begin. Good morning, and welcome to ADM\u00e2\u0080\u0099s third quarter earnings webcast. Please turn to slide 2, the Company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s safe harbor statement, which says that some of our comments and materials constitute forward-looking statement that reflects management\u00e2\u0080\u0099s current views and estimates of future economic circumstances, industry conditions, company performance and financial results. To the extent permitted under applicable law, ADM assumes no to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information or future events. On today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s webcast, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Juan Luciano, will provide an overview of the quarter and how we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re continuing to advance our strategy. Our Chief Financial Officer, Vikram Luthar, will review the drivers of our performance as well as corporate results and financial highlights. This morning, we reported a strong third quarter adjusted earnings per share of $1.86. Our trailing four-quarter adjusted EBITDA approached $6.6 billion, and our trailing four-quarter average adjusted ROIC was 13%. Throughout the quarter, our 40,000 colleagues around the globe continued to deliver on our purpose by supporting the global food system and providing needed nutrition to billions. Global demand for our products remained robust, and our ability to meet customer needs demonstrated our team\u00e2\u0080\u0099s expertise in managing dynamic market conditions as well as the unique benefits of our integrated global value chain and product portfolio. We continue to generate strong cash flows, which support the continued advancement of our strategy, including investments in new capabilities and growth engines across our three businesses and the return of capital to our shareholders. Even as the team demonstrated superb day-to-day execution in the third quarter, we continued to make great progress on driving our strategic growth priorities. In each of our business segments, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve created and are continuing to build new growth engines that are aligned with enduring global trends. As demand for more sustainable produced low carbon intensity products continues to drive growth across our portfolio, our AS&O team signed a groundbreaking long-term strategic agreement with PepsiCo to enroll up to 2 million regenerative agricultural acres over the next 7.5 years. In the third quarter, for example, we formally signed two joint ventures with LG Chem for U.S. production of lactic acid and polylactic acid for a variety of applications, including bioplastics. Both sustainability and food security are powering our growth in nutrition, including our continued investment in alternative proteins. In Q3, we advanced several alternative protein enhancements and expansions, including an agreement with Benson Hill for the exclusive rights to process and commercialize a portfolio of proprietary ingredients derived from their ultra-high protein soybeans. As we discussed at our Global Investor Day last December, we are targeting $1.1 billion in benefits from our productivity efforts, which improve our long-term returns profile while helping us mitigate the impact of market forces, including inflation. That is why around the globe, our team is continuing to identify opportunities to monetize assets and optimize working capital as part of our $1 billion challenge. As of last week, we had realized cash generation in excess of $1 billion from this initiative. Last quarter, I highlighted the operational transformation of our core facility in Marshall, Minnesota, and discussed how we hope to emulate that success more widely across our production footprint. We are now advancing an ambitious plan to install enhanced automation, more sophisticated control systems and the increased use of analytics and more than 50 production facilities globally with further expansion possible as we evaluate and size the opportunities. We are currently evaluating partners to support us in this important work, which we intend to execute in a phased approach, focusing on 8 to 10 facilities per year. We anticipate investing more than $1 billion over this period, and we expect double-digit returns on this investment as we are seeing in Marshall. The environmental and climate benefits associated with regen ag can include greenhouse gas emissions reductions, increased soil carbon sequestration, water quality improvements and biodiversity promotion. With global scale and a value chain that reaches from 220,000 farmers to customers ranging from multinational CPGs to start-ups, ADM has a unique opportunity to lead in this area. For example, in the spring, we announced an agreement with the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation that includes a commitment of $20 million to sign up more regen ag acres. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve signed about 750,000 unique regen ag acres in the U.S. so far this year. And we anticipate that within the next five years, our annual operating profit impact from this work will reach more than $100 million, while continuing to help lead our industry to a more responsible, sustainable future. Just yesterday, ADM was included on the Investor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Business Daily annual list of 100 Best ESG Companies. And in July, Environment and Energy Leader magazine recognized our Illinois-based indicator carbon capture and storage partnership as a top project for energy and environmental management. We posted a new update on our website that details our progress in advancing our Strive 35 goals, including our commitment to reduce our Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions 25% by 2035. And because Strive 35 isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t the end of our sustainability journey, that update includes our aspiration to work towards net zero emissions by 2050. Now, I would like to turn the call over to Vikram to talk about our business performance. The short crops in South America supported U.S. exports, driving improved volumes and margins in North American origination, which had significant negative impacts from Hurricane Ida in the prior year. Better margins in global ocean freight, driven by good execution amid dynamic global trade flows, powered better results in global trade. Strong rapeseed margins in EMEA, driven by robust oil demand and continued market dislocations along with positive impacts from an insurance settlement helped drive improved results. Also, net positive timing effects in the quarter were about $175 million as compared to the approximately $70 million in the prior year quarter. Positive results were partially offset by lower crush volumes, including impacts from idle facilities in Ukraine and Paraguay. Looking ahead to Q4, we expect AS&O to deliver much better results in the fourth quarter of 2021. The Starches and Sweeteners subsegment, which includes ethanol production from our wet mills, delivered much improved year-over-year results amid steady global demand for sweeteners and starches. Corn co-products, including continued robust demand for corn oil as well as effective risk management drove higher execution margins in North America. Wheat milling had a strong performance, delivering improved volumes and margins to meet healthy demand for flower. In EMEA, the business delivered solid volumes and margins and managed through a dynamic energy environment to drive stronger results. Ethanol margins were pressured by higher industry inventories, lower domestic demand and elevated corn costs. In addition, the prior year\u00e2\u0080\u0099s results included contributions from the now sold Peoria facility. Looking ahead, we expect the fourth quarter of this year for Carbohydrate Solutions to be significantly lower than the fourth quarter of last year. Demand and margins for sweeteners, starches and flower should remain healthy, but ethanol margins are expected to be substantially lower than last year\u00e2\u0080\u0099s historic highs. On slide 9, the Nutrition business continued to outpace the industry with Q3 revenue growth of 10% on a reported basis and 16% on a constant currency basis. Our year-to-date performance remains very strong, including 20% revenue and 19% OP growth on a constant currency basis. In this quarter, Human Nutrition results were higher than the third quarter of 2021. Flavors results were impacted by adverse currency translation effects in EMEA, partially offset by continued strong demand growth in the region. Demand fulfillment challenges in North America and lower demand in APAC, driven partly by the lockdowns in China also negatively impacted results. Health and Wellness was lower versus the prior year, which included higher income from the fiber fermentation agreement. Pet results were lower in Latin America on lower volumes, partially offset by strong volumes and margins in North America. Looking ahead, we expect the fourth quarter for Nutrition this year to be higher than the fourth quarter of 2021 with continued strong demand in human nutrition more than offsetting adverse currency effects. Higher short-term interest rates drove improved earnings in ADM Investor Services, partially offset by increased claim settlements in captive insurance. In the corporate lines, unallocated corporate costs of $251 million were higher year-over-year due primarily to performance-related compensation accruals, higher IT operating and project-related costs and higher costs in the Company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s centers of excellence. Other Corporate was favorable versus the prior year, primarily due to higher results from foreign currency-related hedge activity. We still project full year corporate costs to be about $1.3 billion, and we still expect our adjusted tax rate to remain in the range of 16% to 19%. Year-to-date, operating cash flows, before working capital of $4.7 billion, are up significantly versus $3.1 billion over the same period last year. Our net debt to total capital ratio is about 24%, and we have available liquidity of about $11.2 billion. We are continuing to invest in the business with $841 million in capital expenditures and have returned capital to shareholders with $677 million in dividends and $1.2 billion in share repurchases through the third quarter, which reflects the completion of the $1 billion stock buyback announced last quarter. And with enhanced financial flexibility and in line with our balanced capital allocation framework, we plan to repurchase an additional $1 billion of shares by the end of 2023, subject to other strategic uses of capital. And thanks to our execution and the advancement of our strategy, we are well positioned to end 2022 strong. Last quarter, we said we were expecting full year earnings higher than $6.50 per share. Based on where we are today, we now clearly expect to exceed $7 per share. We anticipate ongoing resilient demand for our products, a strong crush margin environment, a positive outlook for starches and sweeteners, and a continuation of our growth trajectory in Nutrition. And beyond that, we are confident that our scenario planning and execution will give us the ability to effectively manage through a dynamic environment. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re also going to continue to benefit from our strategic work, and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll continue to deliver on those priorities throughout 2023. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll drive innovation, expanding and creating new growth engines across our entire business portfolio, Ag Services and Oilseeds, Carbohydrate Solutions and Nutrition. And we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll advance those strategic objectives as we always have, alongside our team\u00e2\u0080\u0099s exceptional day-to-day execution, delivering for our colleagues, consumers, customers and stakeholders. Yes, as you noted, we had lower volumes, and part of that were coming from Europe in soil and rape. We also have a reduction in South America, in soy crush because of Paraguay shutdown, mostly because of lack of beans. And certainly, we have our Ukraine sun crush facility down, as you know, since last March. As some of those one-off issues subside, I mean, we will see those volumes coming back to normal rates. As you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve talked about some of the logistics bottlenecks that you plan to overcome, could you elaborate a little more in detail those issues are and what you may have to do in terms of investments to get this right. And then also aligned with that, what is actually your kind of FX assumption because you stretched the constant currency terms commentary on the outlook for the fourth quarter. So, just to understand a little bit the regional breakdown as well and what FX headwinds we should expect into the short-term period, just given the euro weakness. Listen, as Vikram mentioned in his commentary, we are exceptionally proud of how the team is generating demand, how our value proposition in Nutrition continues to resonate and attract customers. When you look at where specifically those issues have impacted us the most, it has been in flavors, I would say, and mostly in North America, but some of that in Europe. On the other hand, the facility that we inaugurated last year, Pinghu in China has suffered from lack of volumes because of the lockdowns due to COVID restrictions in China. So, I would say, we had a little bit upset in the sense that we couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t bring all that demand that we have generated into the P&L. As you know, on the last quarter or a couple of quarters ago, we bought FISA precisely to alleviate a little bit that. But in a very tight environment with also some shifting of demand based on consumer demand, customers are shifting some of that demand, our ability to react promptly to that given the high growth rates caught up with us in the quarter. Hopefully, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to be able to fulfill all that demand next year. If you think about -- we have a new line in soya protein, we also have the Biopolis expansion in Valencia. So, the business is -- has a long list of organic growth capacity that will come to help next year. But again, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all the problem of maybe a strong successful sales and marketing organization, driving double-digit growth rates. In 2020, we grew operating profit 37%, in 2021 nutrition profit was 20%. But the European part of our business, EMEA, and we referenced this in our Global Investor Day, the revenue contribution from Europe is about 40% of the Human Nutrition side and about 20% on the Animal Nutrition side, and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s getting bigger because of the event. So consequently, given the profitability there and the significant move in the dollar this year, we thought it was appropriate to highlight the growth on a like-for-like basis, which basically means on a constant currency basis. Of course, we have an unprecedented situation and especially in the Lower Mississippi River that will reduce the volume of exports for Ag Services North America. As it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to be a negative impact in Ag Services North America, of course, that -- part of that is because of soy and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to lose that volume. In the corn side, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re probably going to extend the window of exports from North America into the first quarter. We are a large exporter in South America, of course, and you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to see that. And then normally, what we noticed or we expect to happen because we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen it before, is when you export less from North America, where destination marketing sometimes get a little bit of a pop in margins, the products and destination become naturally more valuable, if you will. And then, the other impact is that as beans are not exported that matters not that much demand, local values come down, local bases come down and that may be a boost for crush that you may be able to crush lower-priced beans or maybe eventually lower-priced corn for Carbohydrate Solutions. So probably negative for North America Ag Services and Oilseeds, maybe neutral for Ag Services and positive overall maybe for the whole. Yes, let me address maybe the outlook of Ag Services and Oilseeds, Q4. So, as we go forward, Q4 again in Ag Services, I was mentioning, maybe a little bit lower for North American exports, but that will be offset for other things that I explained in the question before. So, we still expect significantly better results in the Q4, barring any big mark-to-market, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s our expectation at this point in time. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s on the strength of feeding animals around the world, but also on the extra demand for oil from all the renewable green diesel or biodiesel around the world. And as I explained before, I would say the business at this point in time is hitting in all cylinders. So, I would say, the 3 parts of the business will be very robust into bigger than last year, certainly. But if you look at the two independent parts, S&S, sweeteners and starches, we continue to expect that to be strong. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re seeing robust volumes and margins with obviously, the corn oil benefits we are seeing. Lastly, if you remember, we actually had $1-plus ethanol margins. We still expect to be healthy given continued strong gasoline demand, the discount that ethanol has versus RBOB as well as the reasonable inventory levels. So, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s really the ethanol side that is going to drive the significantly lower performance in Carbohydrate Solutions Q4 to Q4. On the nutrition side, yes, as Juan said, we are working and prioritizing unlocking capacity. And on a constant currency basis, we continue to expect growth going forward to be in that 15-plus-percent range. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s important to highlight constant currency because that part of the business in Europe, as I mentioned, is becoming bigger and bigger. So, if you put yourself in the foot of China, China finds itself with lower production, lower domestic production of corn with certainly higher feed demand lower barley and sorghum imports. Certainly, our last check up here, yields for corn in North America were going to be lower. So I think that from a Chinese perspective, this is nothing more than just risk management and expanding open up another optionality. So, as long as demand remains tight, we will see a lot of activity within the trade flow because naturally people want optionality, so. There are a number of times you said in the commentary upfront that should be ongoing momentum kind of going into 2023, and it sounds like more specifically kind of in Q1. If we think about just kind of the general macro backdrop, right, all the tailwinds that are benefiting the business, and maybe this is a little dumb down for some, but not for me. As I said, we are finishing a very strong 2022, and that will get us into a strong -- with good momentum into 2023. What are the things that we are seeing because of course, I mean, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s difficult place to prognosticate these days. We have not seen, maybe with the exceptions of some tiny businesses in Animal Nutrition. When I talk about the pipeline, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the business in which we have the biggest visibility into the future because these are projects that, barring any supply issues, we will bring to the P&L. So, I would say that is what gives us some positive momentum or positive expectations for \u00e2\u0080\u009823. You have to remember also that we dealt with a lot of weather issues, logistical issues, whether it is the river, whether there is hurricanes -- many issues. So, we are bringing a lot of new capacity to bear because we have the pipeline to actually transfer them into profit. So, from what we can see here, and again, in a very uncertain world, is we have good -- very good momentum going into 2023. And maybe more broadly, do you see the value here more on generating grain that has been produced in some kind of sustainable way i.e., that a CPG customer of yours would be willing to pay a premium for that grain? We have made public one announcement, but we have been working on what we call the differentiated bushel, if you will, for like three or four years already. And ADM naturally sits in a unique place in the value chain, and we have the global scale to drive improvements in agriculture, and we have the ability to tie both the farmer with the CPG companies, and so this is a privileged position. When we thought about the differentiated bushel, one is as you described, eventually, and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re seeing more evidence of that, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to be a premium price for bushels that are grown or metric tons that are grown in a certain way. The second, and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s where we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re working with FBN, with Gradable and all that, is to simplify the collection of data and all that in the preparation, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re working with the government on that, on the protocols to be able to have carbon offsets or carbon credits based on that. ADM has 220,000 farmers portfolio in the world that we are engaged in discussing this. Of course, the customer -- the farmers will embrace these as they see more demand for this. And that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s why we make these agreements because, of course, the farmer will generate the production in order to satisfy the demand. So again, I think we are just leveraging our incredible farmer network and the desire of CPG companies and consumer in general, to see bushels or metric tons grown in a differentiated way. So, the question I have is -- and thank you for all your regen comments, Juan, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pretty dear to our heart to result. It seems that maybe Ukraine is going to be an even smaller contributor to global exports, both on the oil season and grains next year. And also, it gives me an opportunity to emphasize the message we sent to our employees in Ukraine to -- for strength and ADM is doing everything possible to make their lives as bearable as possible through all these. So we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been able to export from Ukraine and the industry has worked together with governments and through this corridor agreement, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been able to, in September, to reach the same level of exports almost that Ukraine used to have last year, so about 7 million tons. And then, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to be a harvest and we need to be able to use that storage to harvest the material and to store the material there. I mean, our estimate is that maybe 30% less, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s difficult to make the calculation because some territory are now claimed to be in Russian control. So, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s difficult for us to know even when data are put together, if you will, if that counts with the planting in that Russian controlled territory or not. So, I would say, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a little bit difficult to make prognostications. As I said, Argentina has planted like 10% of the first corn because of incredible drought there. On sun oil, I think the world adjusts a little bit more to present in different blends of different oils. But of course, the oil environment is tight because of all the renewable green diesel and biodiesel. So I would say maybe wheat is a little bit better, but corn and sun oil will be difficult if we stop with the corridor. So we are still counting that the corridor will continue to function, hopefully, with a little bit more efficiency as we appoint more inspectors on with the joint committee. I mean, this is the strongest third quarter I think I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen from ADM in many years. Traditionally, our Q3s have lower volumes because we are getting out of the end of the season and waiting for the next harvest. What happened this time is I think given the short South American crop, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been able to move more volumes, especially exports in North America. Exports were down Q3 to Q2, but not down as much as maybe you see in other years. Also, do not forget, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not just North America, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also the global nature. It was a very good quarter from that perspective, and also destination market. In destination market that we started four or five years ago, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t remember exactly, has continued to grow volumes and expanding margins. And first, just to clarify on repurchase because you did a very sizable amount of buybacks in the third quarter. And then just more broadly, Juan, Vikram, any way to frame CapEx over the -- into 2023 kind of -- you got a lot of capacity actions underway. So, in terms of the share buybacks, yes, we -- as you rightly noted, we did execute the entire $1 since we announced it in -- the buyback in Q2. Looking forward, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re right, in terms of the additional buyback, that is anticipated to be completed over the next five quarters through the end of 2023. But I also want to emphasize, partially getting to one of your questions that we see a rich pipeline of opportunities even on the M&A side. In terms of CapEx, we had signaled about $1.3 billion for this year. And we anticipate that similar level of spend to continue over the next couple of years as well, given the significant need for adding capacity as Juan mentioned, but also some of the additional high-return projects we see on the horizon, such as the analytics and digital automation of our facilities. So, we see rich opportunities to reinvest in the business as well as potentially explore more M&A. One other point that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s very important to highlight, and this really underscores our emphasis on driving returns, which is not just focusing on the profitability but also on the asset, on the denominator is a $1 billion challenge. Even in the face of this outstanding performance this year, the teams are rigorously focused on reducing the assets deployed to produce that profit. And the $1 billion challenge, we actually anticipated to -- we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve actually got -- we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got cash in hand as of last week of $1 billion, as Juan noted. So, I think it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s important to note that we are very focused on driving returns and hence that 13% that we are very proud of we achieved in 3Q."
