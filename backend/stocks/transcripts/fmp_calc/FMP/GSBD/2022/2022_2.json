    "content": " As previously stated, while we intend to voluntarily waive income based incentive fees through and including the fourth quarter in an amount necessary to achieve at least $0.45 of quarterly adjusted net investment income per share, we believe that in the second half of this year, we may be able to achieve this level of earnings without additional waivers. And finally, turning to asset quality, two investments were moved at non-accrual during the quarter due to repayment, and as of June 30, 2022 investments on non-accrual status amounted to 0.4% and 0.9% of the total investment portfolio at fair value and amortized cost respectively. We ended the second quarter of 2022 with total portfolio investments at fair value of $3.6 billion, outstanding debt of $2 billion and net assets of $1.6 billion. At quarter end, 42% of the company's total principal amount of debt outstanding was an unsecured debt and $527 million of capacity was available under our secured revolving credit facility. During the quarter ended June 30 2022, we issued approximately 124,000 shares at an average price of $18.17 per share, resulting in proceeds net of underwriting and offering expenses of 1.8 million."
