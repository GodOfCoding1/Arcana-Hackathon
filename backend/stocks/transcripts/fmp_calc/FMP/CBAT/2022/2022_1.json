    "content": " Hitrans will make further investments into research and development and product innovations to make high nickel, cathode (ph) materials that can improve safety and range for electric vehicles as we seek to make Hitrans to become worlds first-class manufacturer of cathode materials for new energy power lithium batteries. In the first quarter, net revenues stood at 752% to $80.2 million from the same period of 2021, primarily due to additional revenues from this in battery materials brought by the acquisition of Hitrans and the strong sales of high power lithium batteries. And when it comes to energy storage, the market have been paying close attention to our business in this regard and several customers have already started their shakedown test with us and even a small bunch of them have already started the small lots production already and it is expected that in the third quarter, we are going to receive orders -- bigger orders and the quantity, the sales quantity will keep increasing after that. And we have a look at the second perspective, that is the development or the sharpening of our competitive edge, as we know, CBAK is a high-end shader (ph) in \u2013 of lithium battery and based on our 20 years\u2019 experience, we are fully aware that the quality of raw material of the lithium battery as well as the stability of production capacity is crucial for the development of the company. So, yeah we can -- we also noticed that the market, especially those major --major players in the market are quickly expanding their production capacity and our plants in Dalian announcing are the same, but I don't see any conflict in it because our market, our customers are not overlapping because for those -- the other major players, they are focusing or they\u2019re supplying more to the vehicle manufacturers for electric tools."
