    "content": " While Planet's high-resolution SkySat data is already available through the CGI architecture, incorporating our medium-resolution PlanetScope data into the same system enables faster decision making by providing users with data in a user friendly fashion. End of period customer count has consistently grown quarter-over-quarter for more than 10 quarters, reflecting the continued growing market demand for Planet's data. As such, one of the primary expected uses of the capital we raised in going public is to invest in our sales force and the supporting infrastructure that they need to meet the market potential we see for Planet's data."
