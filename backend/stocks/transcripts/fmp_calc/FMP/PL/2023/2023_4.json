    "content": " Over the last 15 years, Sinergise has developed world-class data access and analysis capabilities, leveraging Planet's data, other commercial data sets, including optical SAR and more and the public data sets from sources like Sentinel and Landsat. As Will mentioned, our revenue for the fourth quarter of fiscal '23 ending January 31 came in at $53 million, which represents 43% year-over-year growth. At the end of Q4, our remaining performance obligations, or RPOs, were approximately $152 million, of which approximately 75% applied to the next 12 months and 98% to the next 2 years, a $21 million increase versus last quarter driven primarily by large contracts entered into in Q4. For the first quarter of fiscal '24, we expect revenue of $51 million to $54 million, which represents growth of approximately 31% year-over-year at the midpoint. So I would expect the same type of growth where a lot of the growth is coming from expansion from these very large multimillion dollar deals from our existing customer base, complemented by continuing to bring on new customers that have this potential in some of -- both the existing core markets like Cisco  and events and intelligence as well as all these new commercial markets that Kevin outlined and then seeing those accounts just grow quarter after quarter."
