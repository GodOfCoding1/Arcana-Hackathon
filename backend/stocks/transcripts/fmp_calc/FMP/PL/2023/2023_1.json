    "content": " As we shared on our prior call, we're seeing significant demand for our data across government and commercial markets, which we believe has accelerated, in part due to recent global events as well as broad secular trends. The EOCL award is Planet's largest contract to date, and we're thrilled to have been awarded a firm fixed price contract of $145.9 million in the initial period of up to five years, of which $89 million is for the first two years. Similarly, we're also seeing a number of government and commercial customers expanding their work in new geography or applications, particularly in measuring impact on global supply chain and food security by surveying other region\u2019s crop yields to predict commodity pricing or to explore insurance and financial security for farmers. As mentioned, for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2023, we're tightening our range and expect revenue to be between $177 million and $187 million, representing 35% to 43% year-over-year growth, approaching 40% at the midpoint, an increase from our last forecast. Obviously, there's a lot of relevance to our solutions in things that are kind of top-of-mind for both government and commercial customers around the globe, whether that's some of the global security concerns that we've seen in the Ukraine or some of the secondary and tertiary effects of it, whether that's supply chain or energy costs or things like that. In the near term, we're obviously seeing a lot of demand, not just from the EOCL contract, but from other government customers with the situations going on around the world, but also a lot of demand on the civil government side."
