    "content": " As Will mentioned, our revenue for the third quarter of fiscal '23 ending October 31st came in at $49.7 million, which represents 57% year-over-year growth. It's worth calling out that $1.5 million of the upside this quarter came in the form of onetime revenue associated with an option renewal by a European customer, focused on climate and environmental monitoring. We've seen the average annual contract value of our customers grow year-over-year during the last four quarters, as our sales teams are prioritizing higher-value accounts with opportunity to expand over time. Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we expect revenue to come in between US$50 million and US$54 million, which represents growth of approximately 40% year-over-year at the midpoint."
