    "content": " The average home selling price in Canada of $98,300 increased 24% versus the same quarter last year, driven primarily by pricing actions enacted in response to rising material costs. Our U.S. housing segment gross margins were 21.7% of segment net sales, up 220 basis points from the first quarter last year due to improved operating leverage and efficiencies more than offsetting the deterioration in margin from material price increases. in the first quarter increased to $54 million from $40.8 million in the same period last year, primarily due to higher variable compensation and travel expenses as well as our continued investment in the company's online customer experience and other platform enhancements. While we've seen the prices for certain forest products declined during the first quarter, inflation on other building products remains persistent and is expected to continue for the remainder of the year due primarily to the widespread supply chain challenges combined with high levels of demand. Despite our efforts to continue to pass on inflation and make operational improvements, our production may be impacted by the availability of raw materials due to supply chain challenges, the availability of qualified labor, and the home buyer's ability to qualify for financing at the higher inflationary rates. So, I think it's really those debottlenecking efforts, the automation efforts, the opening up of additional capacity because we have several plants that we're excited to open at the right point in time as soon as the supply chain... We feel confident in that supply chain."
