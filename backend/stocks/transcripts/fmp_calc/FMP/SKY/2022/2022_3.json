    "content": " In the third quarter, we continued to see rising levels of demand driven by numerous factors, including favorable financing, historically low inventory levels, and a rapidly growing base of customers looking for a better alternative to site-built homes. Consolidated gross profit increased to $157 million up 119% versus the same quarter last year due to increased sales volume and higher pricing to offset rising material, labor, and freight costs. Our U.S. housing segment gross margins were 29.6% of segment net sales, up more than I,000 basis points from the third quarter last year due to focused product simplification and material rationalization to improve operating efficiencies in order to better leverage increased production and manufacturing fixed costs. Please proceed with your question. Because if you look with higher price expectations coming out for the site builders and with interest rate increases, just even the most recent stats on new site - built were I think $404,000 per median price per home in the fourth calendar quarter on average. Please proceed with your question. Please proceed with your question. I know that's not the time period you were mentioned, but the 1970s we saw as a manufactured housing industry, robust growth, there were extraordinary robust growth in that was a period of obviously higher inflationary rates and pressures that we're similarly faced with in today's current environment and outlook. Please proceed with your question. Single-family starts have outpaced completions in the housing -- home-building world, and so I think there's going to be a kind of a work in process catch-up where you have given or take 100 to let's say 40,000 homes that come to market as supply chain improves because they're caught between that housing starts and completions. Please proceed with your question. Please proceed with your question."
