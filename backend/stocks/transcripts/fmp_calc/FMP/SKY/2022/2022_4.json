    "content": " Canadian revenue increased 30% to $46 million compared to the fourth quarter of last year, driven primarily by a 36% increase in the average home selling price, partially offset by a 5% decline in the number of homes sold. So I think you are going to see a little bit of increased cancellations really due to the fact that when we change price due to inflation to the end customer, it can open up their loan, which allows kind of for another trigger, which is then the lender can increase the interest rates. Like I said, we are very laser focused on new incoming orders because we somewhat expected as interest rates increases happen, the lower end customer would have some cancellations, because they might not qualify with both the inflation interest rate, and two, we expected some destocking to happen just because retailers are not going to want to have the carrying cost. One last question, just the comments around mix, Laurie or Mark, I wasn\u2019t sure if we should take those comments on mix of kind of the lower endless optioned models as being indicative of you are already seeing that in the incoming order rates and it just takes a while to flow through a backlog or that that\u2019s just your expectation for how things will progress just given what\u2019s happening with prices and rates."
