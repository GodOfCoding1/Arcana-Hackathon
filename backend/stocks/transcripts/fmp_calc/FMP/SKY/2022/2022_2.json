    "content": " Increased output along with price increases to cover rising material, labor and freight costs drove revenue to $524 million in the second quarter, up 63% from the prior year. The average home selling price in Canada of $107,500, increased 32% versus the same quarter last year, driven primarily by pricing actions enacted in response to rising material costs. Consolidated gross profit increased to $129 million, up 106% versus the prior year quarter due to increased sales volume and higher pricing to offset inflationary input costs. Our U.S. housing segment gross margins were 24.7% of segment net sales, up 550 basis points from the second quarter last year due to improved operating efficiencies and leverage of fix cost as we continue to see the benefit of streamlining our product offering.
