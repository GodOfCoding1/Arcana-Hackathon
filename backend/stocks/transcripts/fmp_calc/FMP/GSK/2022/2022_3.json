    "content": " Outside the U.S., we are seeing the growing impact of new launches and strong commercial execution in Europe and international, with nearly 40% of Shingrix's Q3 sales now coming from markets outside of the U.S.  Shingrix is now available in 25 countries with 2 new launches during Q3, and we remain on track to expand our geographic footprint. R&D spend grew 8% in the quarter, with increased investment across several programs, particularly in Vaccines' clinical development, including our mRNA technology platforms and MAPS following the Affinivax acquisition; in Specialty Medicines, with assets like depemokimab and momelotinib; and in early-stage research programs."
