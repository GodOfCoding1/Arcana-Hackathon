Revenues increased 13% for the quarter versus last year and adjusted operating profit reached $70 million, delivering an adjusted operating margin of almost 11% and adjusted earnings per share of $0.62 versus $0.58 last year and $0.32 in the pre-pandemic third quarter. Our e-commerce business continues to grow, with sales in North America and Europe in the third quarter, up 15% to last year and 37% to LLY. When you put it all together, we see top line growing in excess of 20% in the fourth quarter period versus last year and operating profit exceeding $100 million. Overall, the 4% revenue increase to pre-pandemic LLY was a result of growth in our European business, driven by wholesale, including a shift into sales from Q2 to Q3 as well as e-commerce. Operating margin in Q3 was over 14% versus less than 1% in the prior 2 years and operating profit is 15x when it was in pre-pandemic LLY, even on lower sales. Store comps for Europe were down 13% in constant currency versus LLY, a 7% improvement from down 20% last quarter as a result of improved traffic and continued increases in AUR. Our Americas wholesale sales were up 64% to last year and 5% to LOI driven by higher sales in the U.S. and licensing revenue continues to outperform, up 37% to last year and 20% to LLY in Q3, driven by strong performance in shoes, perfumes and watches. Our product margin increased 340 basis points this quarter versus LLY primarily as a result of lower promotions and higher IMU, partially offset by business mix and increased freight, which was worth about 100 basis points this quarter."
