    "content": " We\u2019re also very pleased with our Americas Wholesale business, which grew 19% in sales and 54% in operating profit versus LLY. We used the pandemic as an accelerator to transform our business and not only are we expecting to reach our 10% target this year, but we are now increasing our operating margin target to 12% by fiscal year 2024, when we plan to deliver $2.8 billion in revenue. When I look back at what happened in the last two and a half years, I couldn\u2019t be more proud of what we have accomplished in the face of a pandemic of my partnership with Paul and of the transformation of our business into a company with an elevated global brand and a strong business model. Again, it\u2019s kind of early to tell, but we have a lot of confidence in Europe as a business, as a region for us, as you know it\u2019s more than 50% of our business, very critical and the second half of the year is very important in terms of both top line and profitability. And I just wanted to remind you that last year we changed the cadence of the wholesale business in Europe so we extended our shipments for fall winter into Q3, and this shift was a lot bigger than the shifts that we\u2019re seeing this year. That we were just working with the younger consumer and using special collaborations and capsules and very similar to what brand partnerships does here in North America and globally and with great success and we think that we are going to go back and continue to really focus on that type of business model, Korea has always been very successful for us. And as we go forward and we talk about going from the 10% to the 12%, the 200 basis points being half leverage, half efficiencies, so there\u2019s some IMU in there, but we\u2019ve done a lot over the last two years."
