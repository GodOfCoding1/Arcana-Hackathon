    "content": " Starting with our performance by business, our Europe segment had a solid performance in the period, reporting a 2% revenue decline in U.S. dollars and a strong 17% increase in constant currency, driven by our wholesale and retail businesses, which continued to gain market share in a challenging environment. This performance was consistent with our expectations and reflected the comparison against strong results in last year's third quarter due to unusually high levels of full price selling, resulting from high demand and low inventory levels. Our Asia segment reported a 10% revenue increase in U.S. dollars and a 28% increase in constant currency, as we experienced favorable comps in many of our markets in the region given last year store closures or reduced activity due to COVID restrictions. Our third quarter adjusted operating profit was $58 million, 18% lower than last year, and our adjusted operating margin was 9.1%, a 180 basis points lower than last Q3. Inventories were $575 million, up 19% in U.S. dollars and 33% in constant currency versus last year. Free cash flow for the first three quarters of this year reflects a net investment of $98 million versus $41 million in the prior year, the change being mainly driven by this year inventory acceleration, lower net cash earnings and higher capital spending, offset by last year's impact of the tax payment made associated with our IP transfer to Europe. If we were to eliminate all of that, all other things being equal, our full year outlook would have instead been for sales growth of 10.5% to reach well over $2.8 billion, adjusted operating margin of around 11% and adjusted operating profit growth to exceed last year's $310 million."
