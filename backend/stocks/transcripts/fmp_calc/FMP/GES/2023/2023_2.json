    "content": " Adjusted operating profit totaled $56 million in the quarter, a 37% decline compared to last year's Q2 and adjusted operating margin declined to 8.7%, 540 basis points lower than a year ago. To give that context, if I eliminate this years $55 million operating profit currency headwinds, all other things being equal, the full-year outlook would have instead been for sales growth of over 9.5% to reach over $2.8 billion, operating margin over 11% and operating profit exceeding $310 million and excluding this year's mark-to-market charges along with a $55 million operating profit headwind, that total currency impact would be nearly a $1 per share."
