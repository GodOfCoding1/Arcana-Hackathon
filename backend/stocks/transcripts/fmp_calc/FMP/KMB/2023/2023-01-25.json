So, I guess first on personal care, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m sure you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not going to give us a number, but if I make some rough assumptions around the private label exit and inventory destocking, it looks like elasticity is less than kind of a one for one on the North America personal care business."
