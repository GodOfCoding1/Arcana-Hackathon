    "content": " During the first nine months of 2022, Antero's organic leasing program has added approximately 60 drilling locations at an average cost of less than $1 million per location essentially offsetting our maintenance capital plan that assumes an average of 60 to 65 wells per year. During the third quarter, we generated approximately $800 million in free cash flow, which was used to reduce debt by over $400 million and to purchase $380 million of stock, as I mentioned in my opening remarks. Following the completion of our $300 million tender offer during the third quarter, we are now targeting greater than 50% of free cash flow to be used through the share repurchase program. So the cash costs will come down in '23, they'll be more similar to I think what we'll see in the fourth quarter because it's around $5 gas and $40 NGLs."
