    "content": " During 2022, Antero's organic leasing program added approximately 80 drilling locations at an average cost of less than $1 million per location, more than offsetting our maintenance capital plan that assumes an average of 60 to 65 wells per year. Assuming today's strip prices, we still expect to generate over $500 million of free cash flow, and our leverage remains comfortably under one time at year-end 2023. Provide some additional color on the natural gas macro views and our thought process around the hedge settlement, let's turn to Slide number 10 titled Free Cash Flow Breakeven. As illustrated on this page, as a result of higher maintenance capital costs, limited liquids revenue uplift and widening basis differentials on natural gas, we estimate that most Haynesville companies are not able to generate free cash flow in today's pricing environment. So even at our maintenance capital today and a low commodity price on the natural gas side, we're generating over $0.5 billion of free cash flow."
