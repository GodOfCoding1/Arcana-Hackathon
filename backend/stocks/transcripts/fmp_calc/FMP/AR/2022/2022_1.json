    "content": " As you can see, in the past seven years, Antero has grown production significantly and is now a top five natural gas and top two NGL producer in the U.S. During this time, Antero has dramatically reduced its absolute debt and leverage as a result of transitioning from an outspend to a consistent free cash flow generator. With the increase in commodity prices, Antero's 2022 development plan is now expected to generate over $2.5 billion of free cash flow. Based on current commodity prices, Antero is targeting excess of 25% of free cash flow will be used for share repurchases in the second quarter. Lastly, if we assume today's strip prices, we are forecasting substantial free cash flow generation in excess of $10 billion through 2026, which is our current market cap. What we did is we looked at our free cash flow estimates at the time it was a $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion forecast on the commodity prices, about $400 million of that would occur in the first quarter."
