    "content": " Prior to 2020, where we added 58,000 net new members in the second quarter, we typically saw a reduced efficacy of our marketing efforts, which resulted in lower new member additions during May through August, as people shifted into their summer patterns in the Northern Hemisphere. As a result of the seasonal factors, we elected to limit our member acquisition spending in aggregate for the second half of the quarter to a total of $7.2 million, or 35% of revenues to conserve the marketing spend for a more favorable seasonal period. During the second quarter of 2022, selling and operating expenses, excluding marketing and member acquisition costs were $8.7 million, or 42% of revenues; and corporate and G&A expenses were $1.8 million or 9% of revenues."
