    "content": " I\u2019d say if you unpack it a little bit further and actually look at the dynamics of between the P&L and the cash flow statement, EBITDA or adjusted EBITDA, whichever measure you want to use, tracks pretty closely to our cash flow from operations line item absent things like what happened last quarter and the end of this quarter with the acquisition and the timing at the end of the year. And one of our internal goals is to get over that $100 million mark, because we do feel that part of our valuation is tied to the smallness of our business and our focus is to get bigger so that we can be recognized for what we\u2019re doing from a financial discipline perspective, which is in stark contrast to the majority of the other streaming players that are of a similar size as ours, that are still heavily losing money and cash and funding it from equity or debt from outside investors."
