    "content": " In 2022, revenue increased 3% to $82 million from $79.6 million in 2021 and member count ended December 31st at 759,000 members. Despite the seasonal headwinds we typically experienced during the holiday season, we were able to reduce our per customer acquisition cost by approximately 10% from the prior year quarter, which led to growth in our direct member base during the fourth quarter. Selling and operating expenses, excluding marketing and member acquisition costs in the fourth quarter were $8.2 million or 42% of revenues, which is up from the prior year due primarily to increased technology operating expenses. And I think it's actually going to be big advantage this point because our direct members start to grow and the third party still kind of like even in beginning of March, we actually saw first time growth from the third party. I think it's important when you think about it from a member based perspective that we understand that our direct members are at our full retail price where our third party members are at net revenue depending on the partner, let's just call it, anywhere between 40% and 60% net revenue once you account for transaction processing fees, et cetera."
