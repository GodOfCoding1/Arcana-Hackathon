    "content": " Starting on slide four, first quarter net income was $62 million or $0.91 per diluted share, a $55 million decline from last quarter. On a pretax basis, our net contribution from our institutional trading group decreased $43 million linked quarter. Interest rate volatility also negatively impacted outcomes in our mortgage servicing right hedging results, creating a $13 million pretax decline in performance compared to the fourth quarter. Finally, the other material component driving the linked quarter decline was the $17 million pretax reserve release recognized last quarter. Excluding PPP loans, our core loan portfolio increased $608 million or 3% linked quarter. Period-end loans in our core loan portfolio were $20.5 billion, a linked quarter increase of $608 million. As expected, the payoff trend in real estate abated, resulting in commercial real estate growth of $270 million or 7% linked quarter. Loans in the energy space recorded back-to-back quarters with period-end outstandings, increasing $191 million in the first quarter, following last quarter's $193 million increase. Healthcare balances also increased up $27 million or 0.8% linked quarter, primarily driven by our acute care and specialty hospital sector. Excluding energy and health care, core middle market C&I realized positive growth again this quarter with linked quarter growth of $159 million or 2.6%. We're optimistic that the payoff trend we've experienced since the fourth quarter of 2020 in commercial real estate balances has finally turned this quarter, as period-end balances grew $270 million or 7% linked quarter. And excluding loans guaranteed by US government agencies, nonperforming assets totaled $13 million to linked quarter to $132 million. We realized net charge-offs of $6 million for the first quarter, an increase of $6.7 million compared to only $714,000 in net recoveries for the fourth quarter. Excluding PPP loans, the combined allowance for loan losses totaled $283 million or 1.38% of outstanding loans and unfunded commitments at quarter end. Non-accruing loans decreased $9.8 million from last quarter, primarily due to a reduction in non-accruing general business and energy loans. Potential problem loans totaled $169 million at quarter end, down from $222 million on December 31. Total fees and commissions were $98 million for the first quarter, a $49 million decline from the fourth quarter. Apart from the institutional trading activity all other brokerage and trading revenues were down $1.3 million linked quarter, primarily due to the record fourth quarter we experienced in syndication deals within our Commercial segment, which are irregular in nature. Compared to the first quarter last year, total service charges have grown $2.8 million or 11.5%. Mortgage banking revenue decreased $4.6 million or 21.8% linked quarter, primarily due to lower production volumes combined with narrowing margins. Other revenue declined $1.1 million or 9.8% linked quarter, primarily the result of lower domestic letter of credit fees and reduced repossession revenues. First quarter net interest revenue was $268 million, an $8.7 million decline from last quarter. Interest on our trading securities fell $3.5 million, as the effective yield decreased 18 basis points linked quarter. Our loan-to-deposit ratio increased to 52.4% this quarter from 49% at December 31, due to the combined impact of a $1.8 billion decrease in total deposits and a $469 million increase in loan balances this quarter. Linked quarter total expenses decreased $22 million, primarily due to decreased personnel expense this quarter, and a $5 million contribution to our foundation last quarter. Modeling a 200 basis point interest rate increase for the remainder of 2022 and taking into consideration the flatness of the forward curve, deposit beta assumptions similar to previous rate cycles, loan growth guidance and holding the available-for-sale securities portfolio flat, we expect an increase in year-over-year core net interest income of 9%, which excludes $40 million of PPP revenue differential between the two years.
