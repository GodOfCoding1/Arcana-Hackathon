    "content": " First, on our Wealth Management segment, as China's household savings rate has continued to rise over the past few quarters, Hywin has captured year-on-year growth in our transaction value. In the first half of fiscal year 2023, Hywin's wealth management transaction value reached RMB 40.1 billion, a year-on-year growth of 6.9%. After sophistication of the Asian markets and clients continue to increase, we believe EAM, which is an intellectually driven open architecture, safe, flexible and sticky asset management model is positioned to capture rapid growth and market share, benefiting from our broad client base and our high-quality client coverage and service team, Hywin's first-mover advantage in the Asian EAM market will be reinforced over time. This system aims to support relationship managers with the construction of fund portfolios, comparison of fund performances, analysis of post investment holdings, as well as to help fulfill clients' personalized asset allocation needs, all of which gives Hywin the opportunity to provide more integrated one-stop wealth management services."
