    "content": " In addition, as we attract more agents to our low-cost commission model, our proprietary technology platform and wholly-owned mortgage, title and insurance businesses Fathom should allow us -- rather should allow Fathom to generate significantly more revenue and profit per transaction over time. Expenses related to marketing activities were $1.3 million for the current second quarter versus $378,000 for last year's second quarter. One of the things we're most excited about is that our gross profit in the business grew by about $1.2 million from the first quarter of this year and about $820,000 or 70% of this increase in gross profit fell to the adjusted EBITDA line, demonstrating the operational leverage we have created in our real estate business. Our Mortgage business generated revenues of $2.6 million for the second quarter, down slightly from our 2022 first quarter results, which is not surprising given the reduction in mortgage originations across the country. The best 2 recruiting months in the year is Q4 and Q1 and I think that given the economic factors that are affecting every real estate agent, we certainly believe that Q4 and Q1 will be stellar months, stellar quarters for us to continue to increase recruiting because that's -- in our history, we know that those are the 2 best quarters to recruit agents."
