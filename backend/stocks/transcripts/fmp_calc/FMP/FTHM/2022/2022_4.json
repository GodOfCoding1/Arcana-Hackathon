    "content": " VIA , our insurance business generated revenues of $1.3 million in Q4 and a total of $6.1 million for the year, with adjusted EBITDA of negative $55,000 for the quarter and a positive adjusted EBITDA of $530,000 for the year. So if an agent closes ten transactions a year, you know they may get one or two opportunities every single month to share Fathom with another agent you know, and they may have to share it several times in a row before that agent finally becomes receptive or that agent closes a transaction and realize they just gave their broker $4,000 versus they could have given us $550. So yes, number one, I think our Fathom Careers website is probably the best resource and so you have a lot of agents that will actually refer people, \u00e2\u0080\u009chey, check out the Fathom Career website.\u00e2\u0080\u009d But also we've got a marketing center behind the wall and where our agents can go to get business cards, order business cards, order post cards, download marketing, you know buy your presentations, listing presentations, but we also have a whole section on recruiting as well."
