    "content": " We believe that Fathom\u2019s ability to track an ever increasing number of real estate agents by providing them with greater income potential along with the technology, training and support they need to grow their businesses is even more evident today, especially during these changing times. Over the last four quarters, our real estate business, Fathom Realty generated adjusted EBITDA positive results, I mentioned that earlier, which we believe demonstrates that we're on the right path. Expenses related to marketing activities were $1.1 million versus $402,000 for the last year's first quarter, mostly driven by an increase in marketing activities related to new market openings and newly acquired companies. For the second quarter of 2022, Fathom expects total revenue to range between $110 million and $15 million with adjusted EBITDA in the range of a loss of $200,000 to a positive adjusted EBITDA of $200,000."
