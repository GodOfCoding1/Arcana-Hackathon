    "content": " As we wrap up 2022, we anticipate having repurchased approximately 10% of our outstanding shares, delivering mid-teens total shareholder return yield, paid a substantial special dividend near year-end, fulfilling our commitment to return 60% plus annual post-dividend free cash flow to our shareholders, achieve our ESG and emission reduction goals and mapped our turn-in-line schedule with permits in hand through 2028, what I consider an incredibly strong story. This allowed us to generate $695 million of adjusted cash flow from operations, and after taking into account $290 million of CapEx, we generated more than $400 million of free cash flow during the quarter. After paying $125 million for the base dividends and accounting for our 60%-plus shareholder return target, we anticipate approximately $885 million to be available for share repurchase program and special dividend. As you see in the chart in the lower right-hand side of the slide, we have returned nearly $360 million through the first half of the year and are on track to accelerate that activity to approximately $1 billion, inclusive of a potential special dividend by year end. Depending on market conditions and the number of shares repurchased and the total repurchase dollars spent this year, a special dividend between $2 to $3 per share to meet our 60% post-dividend shareholder return goal is projected. In addition to our shareholder return profile, we anticipate having the opportunity to allocate free cash flow, further reducing our borrowings under the credit facility and exit the year with approximately $1.3 billion of long-term debt and a leverage ratio of 0.5 times. Your line is open. And we were previously guiding more to somewhere around that $6 to $6.25 per share buyback, and we now are kind of leaning in a little bit and look for us to probably do more than half of that Board approved program this year. We have Delaware production that is still going to be stronger in the third and then it tails off in the fourth, but our Wattenberg production will kind of be doing the opposite as we get the Raindance fully to its operational capabilities in the end of October, plus the fact that we have our second completion crew coming in mid-September, you should start seeing some of those extra wells coming online in the November time frame. We're probably in the 5%-ish kind of line because when we get these wells engineered and back on the line, I think you're going to really see a pretty good pickup in the first two quarters next year as we start going through and the Delaware activity really starts kicking in again as it did in the second quarter this year. But I was thinking about next year with the leverage falling to $1.3 billion at the end of the year, how are you thinking about how much percentage of free cash flow post dividend would you allocate towards a capital return program? Your line is open. Your line is open. We did $300 million in the first half of the year, which means the second half of the year has to be about $325 million where we're sitting at today, that's why we're kind of saying that $625 million we would hope would be more of a lower end of the limit right now. Your line is open. Your line is open."
