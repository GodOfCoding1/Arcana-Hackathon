    "content": " Our full year revenues were $1.56 billion, approximately 1% growth on a reported basis, inclusive of the TWC divestiture, and $38 million or 260 basis points unfavorable impact from foreign exchange compared to last year. For the full year, we expect revenues to be in the range of $1.602 billion to of $1.620 billion, representing reported growth of 2.9% to 4% and organic growth of 4% to 5.2%. If we look in more detail at full year revenue, we expect to see higher growth contribution in the second half of the year compared to the first half of the year mainly as a result of a number of 2022 timing items. For the first quarter, we expect revenues to be in the range of $370 million to $376 million, representing reported growth of approximately negative 1.5% to flat and organic growth of 2% to 3.5%. Utilizing a broad set of operating levers, including price capture, operational efficiencies, careful restructuring and cost management, we exceeded our profitability commitment for the year, and we delivered additional value to shareholders in the form of share repurchases, a more focused portfolio and a strategic acquisition expected to strengthen our position in one of the most exciting growth markets implant-based breast reconstruction. If you look at what we have seen historically in terms of sales coming back from CereLink, we think we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to be gradually coming back to this in the second half and then entering 2024 with, again, a stronger base growth in that year. So I think relative to 2023, you got to keep in mind, there's a lot of moving parts on the top line with timing, and that has created some noise in the first half and the second half and then also on the operating expense side the investments that we're making along with SIA as well, too, that is making our EBITDA growth more on the modest side."
