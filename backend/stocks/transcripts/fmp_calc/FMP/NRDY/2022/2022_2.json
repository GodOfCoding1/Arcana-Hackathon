    "content": " Non-GAAP sales and marketing expenses, which exclude non-cash stock-based compensation, were $17 million or 40% of revenue in the second quarter of 2022, which compared to 43% of revenue in the same period of last year, a more than 280 basis point improvement year-over-year. In an effort to balance our growth and profitability targets, we began to slow the pace of corporate hiring during the second quarter as revenue increases from the number of Learning Memberships, and Varsity Tutors for Schools institutional customer base grows, we expect to gain operating leverage. While this evolution towards Learning Memberships results in lower near-term revenue and adjusted EBITDA, we expect it will ultimately allow us to generate superior long-term customer unit economics and drive higher levels of growth and profitability. In the fourth quarter, we continue to expect revenue reacceleration during the key back-to-school period, driven by growth in the Learning Membership subscriber base and as revenue from Varsity Tutors for Schools ramps into the 2022-2023 academic school year. Your line is now open. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re also seeing that the customers and memberships actually engage in additional products, inclusive class enrollments at significantly higher rates and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen historically that when a package customer historically engages in multi-modality learning.
