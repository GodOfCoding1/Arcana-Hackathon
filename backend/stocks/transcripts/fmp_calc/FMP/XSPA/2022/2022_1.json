    "content": " Our overarching goal here is to maximize the revenue potential of our spa business through higher margin services and a stronger retail offering, which I will elaborate on in just a minute, reducing costs where we can by closing suboptimal spas, and acquiring better locations for new spas that can build revenue for us in the future. Historically, our retail strategy has not been a core strength of our business despite having access to millions of potential buyers in our airport, and rather than focus our efforts on selling higher margin products with a lower labor cost, we relied on pushing higher cost services in the hopes of driving more revenue. The increase was primarily due to the recognition of revenue from XpresCheck locations, although we also generated $2.6 million in revenue from our re-opened XpresSpa locations and $0.5 million related to the HyperPointe business we acquired early in the quarter. So, as a result of that, I think we're going to be offering additional services and reinvented retail where we can and work with airports to see if we can expand those services at the same time, while we also look outside of the airport to expand our business."
