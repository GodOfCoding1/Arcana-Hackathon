    "content": " Net sales increased 10.5% to $831.4 million, driven by our strong comparable store performance combined with the impact of 29 net new stores opened since the first quarter of 2021. D&A expense increased to $18.2 million, up 17.3% versus the first quarter last year, in line with our expectations. Stock-based compensation expense was $5.8 million compared to $3.9 million in last year's first quarter, primarily due to the impact of our 2021 grants as well as current performance expectations related to our performance-based share awards. Net interest expense decreased 5.7% to $3.7 million versus the first quarter last year, primarily due to increased interest income on independent operator notes. And as customers continue to shop us and find this maybe new for the first time, increasingly here, our job then is to make sure that they're getting the products they're looking for and they're saving a lot of money while they're doing it and feeling really good about where we're at with that. But I think the thing that gives us confidence is we are very much -- we remain in a highly inflationary environment and as I said before, just the way that which we exited March and the momentum we're carrying here into the second quarter gives us confidence that a lot of those sort of cost increases and the timing impact of when we feel those and when we flow those through have been reflected."
