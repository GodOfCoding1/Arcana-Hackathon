    "content": " And so as you compare against last year from a gross margin perspective, if you recall Q4 last year, a bit of an anomaly for us at 30.9%, but overall feel really good about how we're managing margin with respect to the cost inflation environment we're dealing with. I'd say overall the same fundamental SG&A drivers we're seeing, which is we are getting fixed cost leverage on the higher comps that we're delivering, that's being partially offset by higher incentive compensation, but specific to Q4 also expecting that commission expense is a leverage driver. But yes, when you look at this year, we are of course seeing better comp growth, but that's coming with slightly lower gross margins and EBITDA margins as we feel the impact that cost inflation as well as higher incentive compensation as we've talked about on the SG&A line."
