    "content": " Corporate-related expenses increased $7.6 million, driven by higher incentive compensation, reflecting stronger financial performance versus the prior year as well as continued organizational growth and system investments. And taking a step back from all of this, really view this as more short term, call it 18 months between last year, first 6 months of this year, a disruption to our long-term 10% annual new store growth goal. So as mentioned, we're investing in new platforms to help our buyers with information and capabilities for everything in the buying process, mentioned new tools for store operators to help them better run their stores, driving sales, managing margin, operating efficiencies, really excited about that, enhancing our data business intelligence and the reports and tools that we bring to decision-making. And it's investments yes, in new stores as we're ramping up there, but also just in the market in general to raise overall raise awareness DRIVE trial, and we've seen then the productivity of the stores follow and suit. -- guiding looking at something like, what is it, 25 to 28 new store openings versus last year of, I think, but the CapEx is stepping up from $130 million to $155 million. But no, we've had a minor short-term disruption here in these past 18 months, but I'm excited to be back on the 10% growth run rate later this year and then feeling good about store count and our ability to get those stores open and 2024 and then ongoing as the base continues to grow and the new store count continues to grow."
