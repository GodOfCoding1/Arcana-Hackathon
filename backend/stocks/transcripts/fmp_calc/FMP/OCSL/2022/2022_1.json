    "content": " Notably, our noncore portfolio declined by nearly $40 million and now stands at $95 million or just under 4% of the portfolio at fair value at the close of the quarter. Although competition remained elevated, we leveraged the Oaktree platform to originate $300 million of new investment commitments across 12 new and 9 existing portfolio companies in the December quarter. For the first quarter, we reported adjusted net investment income of $31.2 million or $0.17 per share, up from $29.1 million or $0.16 per share in the fourth quarter of 2021. As Matt mentioned, we increased capacity on our credit facilities in the quarter, raising our revolver to $1 billion from $950 million and welcoming a new bank to our syndicate of 19 lenders. Our strong financial results for the quarter enabled us to generate an annualized return on adjusted net investment income of 9.5%, higher than last fiscal year's quarterly average of just over 9%. We made good progress again this quarter, exiting $44 million of loans priced at or below LIBOR plus 4.5%, leaving only $40 million left in the portfolio."
