    "content": " One is, if you look at the equity index for life sciences companies, it is down, they are over 30% year-to-date, over 50% year-over-year and that volatility in the equity market and the depressed valuation multiples for some of these life sciences companies makes it such that those borrowers would prefer to finance themselves differently rather than tapping equity, diluted equity and so we\u2019ve seen a meaningful uptick in our pipeline of potential deal volume on the life sciences side."
