    "year": 2022,
    "date": "2022-11-15 14:16:04",
    "content": " The increase was mainly due to a $6.8 million reversal of accrued capital gained incentive fees in the prior quarter that did not recur in the fourth quarter, $3.9 million of higher interest expense as a result of the impact of rising rates on the Company's floating rate liabilities and slightly higher part 1 incentive fees and seasonally higher professional fees. If base rates as of September 30th were in effect for the entire quarter, we estimate that our adjusted net investment income per share would have been about $0.015 higher, resulting in adjusted NII of $0.20 per share. The JV generated $2.2 million of cash interest income for OCSL in the quarter, up from $1.9 million in the third quarter as a result of the portfolio's continued strong performance and the impact of rising interest rates on floating rate investments. To start just asking a question about the weighted average yield on the new debt commitments here in the most recent quarter at the 9.9%, which was kind of below the 10.6% in the whole portfolio, and I would have expected that to be maybe higher to what you referenced that you're seeing in October, with the 12 handle on it."
