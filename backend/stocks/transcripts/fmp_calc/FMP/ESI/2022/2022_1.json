    "content": " However, margins improved sequentially 240 basis points from Q4 2021 but compared to the same period last year, our first quarter results reflect many of the same headwinds from higher pass through metals, logistics, and other raw material inflation that we saw last quarter. On a year-over-year basis, adjusted EBITDA margins in our electronics segment declined 330 basis points, nearly 300 basis points of which is explained simply by higher pass-through metals with an increase in tin prices which increased sales with no commensurate increase in gross profit dollars. Your line is open. Your line is open. The Semiconductor business is mostly volume driven and I think that it's a good rule of thumb for the Circuitry and Industrial businesses to say it's about half price and about half the volume, maybe a little bit more price in Industrial than volume given the weakness in auto year-over-year. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open."
