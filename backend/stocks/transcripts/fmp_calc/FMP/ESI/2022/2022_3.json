    "content": " We will be well below 2021 volumes and from a Circuitry perspective, our Circuitry business is looking more like 2018 to give you a sense for how far that market has fallen, which gives us, frankly, a lot of confidence in a very strong recovery because the trends propelling the business forward are durable trends, and we believe we've just hit an air pocket in terms of the mega trends propelling this business around expansion of computing power, the need for more data storage, 5G-enabled devices and 5G networks."
