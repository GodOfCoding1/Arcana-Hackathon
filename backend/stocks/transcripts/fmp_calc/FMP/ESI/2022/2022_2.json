    "content": " Adjusted EBITDA margin declined 170 basis points, with higher metal prices driving 100 basis points of margin headwind on a year-over-year basis, though the dollar value of pass-through metals in our assembly business declined sequentially as metal prices fell. Excluding the impact of $123 million of pass-through metal sales in our Assembly Solutions business, our adjusted EBITDA margin would have been 25% in the quarter. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re also updating our adjusted EPS guidance to a range of $1.52 to $1.55, and our full year free cash flow guidance to approximately $270 million, largely reflecting the lower EBITDA and taking into account higher working capital usage in the first half. For the third quarter of 2022, we expect adjusted EBITDA to be approximately $140 million, which is an improved margins from lower metal pass-through impacts and a sequentially higher level of revenue in constant currency."
