    "content": " This was offset by 11% organic growth in our assembly business, where we continue to benefit from strong power electronics demand and resilience in circuit board assembly products that primarily serve industrial and automotive customers. Adjusted EBITDA in Q4 declined 2% in constant currency terms, a function of negative mix from higher margin, high-end electronics and nonmetal cost inflation across the business. Excluding the impact of $428 million of pass-through metal sales in our Assembly Solutions business, our adjusted EBITDA margin would have been 25% for the year. This all translated to 4% annual organic net sales growth for circuitry solutions, but this figure includes a 12% organic decline in the fourth quarter as high-end electronics market softened due to COVID-related impacts in Asia and memory disk destocking. Customers have reduced production significantly and utilization levels at circuit board and semiconductor fabs have declined, reflecting the current softness in high-end electronics and uncertainty around China reopening impact to industrial activity, we expect Q1 2023 adjusted EBITDA to increase only modestly versus Q4 2022. Again, as we said earlier, it's really the plug to sort of get to that 2.75 and there's depending on the phasing of growth and the magnitude of growth, particularly in the second half of the year that number can vary pretty significantly in terms of the investment we'll make."
