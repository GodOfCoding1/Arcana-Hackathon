Thank you, Hope, and good morning, everyone, and welcome to OGE Energy Corp's Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. In terms of the call today, we will first hear from Sean, followed by an explanation from Bryan of financial results. Before we begin the presentation, I'd like to direct your attention to the Safe Harbor statement regarding forward-looking statements. This is an SEC requirement for financial statements and simply states that we cannot guarantee forward-looking financial results, but this is our best estimate to date. Earlier this morning, we reported second quarter utility earnings of $0.50 per share, which represents an increase of $0.08 per share over the same period last year. Overall, we reported consolidated earnings of $0.36 per share, which includes $0.05 loss from the holding company and the $0.09 loss from natural gas midstream operations. Through the end of July, we've exited 77% of our energy transfer investment at an average sales price of $11.09 per unit, which represents a 33% premium to where the units were when we closed the transaction last December. Interestingly, we've already received more net proceeds than the value of our investment on the transaction closed date and we haven't even completed the exit. At the end of June, we reached an uncontested settlement to rate review pending before the Oklahoma Corporation Commission and the ALJ has recommended approval of the settlement. In early May, the Oklahoma Supreme Court authorized the sale of bonds, the state of Oklahoma issued the bonds and we received the proceeds two weeks ago. Beyond our generation capacity, that grid is serving customers. It's not straying and unlike other areas of the country, we have not cautioned the public of potential blackouts and called on the public to take conservation measures. The system was designed, was built and was maintained for days like these and our customers experienced the benefits of our generation investments and enhancements to the grid. Our investments in technology and equipment deliver improved reliability, resiliency, communication and security to energize their homes, businesses and lives as we maintain affordability for our customers. Additionally, S&Ps annual report on rates was announced in the second quarter, and OGE Energy was listed as having the second lowest rates in the nation, a reflection of our continued commitment to affordability for our customers as we invest in the grid and technology to improve reliability, resiliency and security. So to quickly recap, in the second quarter we exited more than three quarters of our energy transfer investment at a significant premium. We filed an uncontested settlement in Oklahoma rate review, we received bond proceeds from Oklahoma securitization and winter storm your expenses. And we continue to provide safe and reliable stable electric service to nearly 900,000 customers during extremely hot summer. We're accomplishing what we set out to do what we told you, we would do. I'm really incredibly proud of every single employee, each of whom is solely focused on safely ensuring our customers have the life enhancing and life sustaining electricity they need to live their lives. Turning to future operations, we continue the needed investment in the grid, utilizing automation and self-healing technologies to improve reliability and resiliency. The work we're undertaking on our substations, distribution circuits and other portions of our grid will provide great benefit to our customers in terms of reliability and resiliency. Today, we've seen results from enhanced circuits following storms, where customer outages were eliminated, or reduced to the tunes of hundreds of thousands of minutes saved. With a growing service area, increasing reserve margin requirements, we recognized our future capacity requirements are changing. We'll provide an update once we review the results from all the RFPs and at the same time, we have other capacity initiatives underway. Through smart hours our demand response program more than 100,000 customers are shifting their energy usage and helping achieve 90 megawatts and demand reduction this year alone. In the current filing years, we expect to achieve savings of more than 100 megawatts in demand and nearly 500,000 megawatt hours of energy savings, helping us to efficiently operate the generation fleet as we grow our customer base and maintain affordability. In times of economic uncertainty, these programs offer customers incredible value for home improvement, with no out of pocket costs, as well as tools to manage and understand their energy usage. The first half of '22, the 12 new projects secured and announced by our economic and business development partnerships will help add more than 1775 new jobs across Oklahoma and Arkansas. From Mercy Hospital in Fort Smith to no man's land Beef Jerky in Enid, Oklahoma. The affordability of our rates is central to our sustainable business model, as the cost of electricity is a significant factor that companies consider when deciding an expansion or relocation. Before I hand the call over to Bryan, I just want to take a moment to touch on a few important points. This helps us maintain some of the most affordable rates in the nation, which in turn attracts more customers, continuing the virtuous cycle and sustaining the momentum for our shareholders, employees and our customers. Starting with second quarter results on slide six, we reported consolidated earnings of $0.36 per share, compared to $0.56 per share in the same period in 2021. OG&E, the electric utility contributed earnings of $0.50 per share in this Second quarter compared to $0.42 per share in the same period in 2021. ET was flagged this quarter compared to the same period in 2021, reflecting our employees continued focus on cost management. Our natural gas midstream segment experienced a loss of $0.09 per share in the second quarter, compared to earnings of $0.16 per share in the same period in 2021. The decrease in net income was primarily due to mark-to-market adjustments on our energy transfer units, coupled with the elimination of equity and earnings of Enable. On a year-to-date basis, however, we've seen significant appreciation in the fair value of ET units, as I'll discuss in a moment. Turning to our economic indicators and load results on Slide seven, customer numbers grew 1.1% over the past 12 months, and in line with our expectations, reflecting the attractiveness of our service territory in Oklahoma and Arkansas. As of June 30, we have added 60 megawatts for the year from data mining companies alone, and those connections began to accelerate in June. Company-wide for all customer groups based on year-to-date results and updated projections, we now expect to see total retail load growth of around 3.5% to 4.25% in 2022. Let's move to Slide eight, where we are reaffirming our guidance issued in February. Given the favorable weather and solid operational execution by our employees in the first half of the year, we expect results to be in the top half of our 2022 utility got its range of $1.87 to $1.97 per share. Taking a longer term view, our business fundamentals are strong with growing economies in Oklahoma and Arkansas and constructive regulation in the States. Furthermore, our company has prudently managed its balance sheet, putting us in a position to invest in the generation and T&D investments that our customers and communities need and keeping us on the path to 5% to 7% long term EPS growth. As you can see in the chart, we are projecting total pre-tax proceeds of over $1 billion, which would be nearly 400 million more than the fair value as of the February 2021 announcement date. Turning to recovery of the winter storm Yuri costs incurred in February 2021, the state of Oklahoma issued a securitization bonds in July, the proceeds of 750 million have been received and will be used to retire the associated debt that was incurred at the time of the winter storm event. Through prudent management of our debt maturity ladder, we have only approximately 100 million of maturing debt over the next five years to be refinanced. Furthermore, we have very low levels of short-term floating rate debt, thanks to the proceeds received from the energy transfer cells. Secondly, our balance sheet and credit metrics are strong, positioning us to deploy capital investments in our five-year plan without the need to issue equity. There's a few RFPs that are out there, including existing resources. And given some of the near-term kind of generation needs, and now that you've monetized the majority of the ET shares and you have some dry powder. Yes, I think that's certainly a factor Constantine. I mean, that's why we want to get all the RFPs in and kind of stack them up and look at them all in terms of availability and costs. Obviously, mentioned in my remarks, the increasing reserve margin requirements at the SPP, we're certainly watching that. We're going to stack all these up, and we're going to go from there. I don't think the balance sheet per se is the driver, I think was the driver is just the availability and the economics coming out of these RFPs. And just a quick follow up, load has obviously been very, very strong trend in 2Q and 22 in general, both weather normalized and in absolute terms. And for this year, as expected, I would say, on a commercial front, we do anticipate being around that kind of double-digit area for growth this year. As I mentioned in my comments, we have really strong momentum in that sector and believe there's a good chance that will carry over into 2023. As you look to oilfield, you can see -- you may recall that we had about 2% year-over-year growth in the first quarter in oilfield sector on a year-to-date basis, that's bumped up to 3.7%. So you're seeing some improved volumes and activities in that sector and versus 2019, we're actually still below our 2019 levels in oil field. So those two sectors have been strong for us and overall, we're starting to get more and more confidence that 2023 could be another year of above 1% load growth. Thank you for your question. It's actually Cody on for Julian, thanks for taking my questions. So just following up on Constantine's question around load, your expectation on 2022 growth looks like that's down at the top end. Maybe crypto is stepping down and just as we look forward to 2023 and this kind of gets to your point in the previous question, but just wondering if you can share a little bit more about your C&I, customer sentiment on the current economic backdrop and in any conversations that you've had recently. So Cody you are right, we were looking at a broader range of potential load growth for the year up 3.5% to 5%. The delta between that and where we're currently forecasting is around the data mining companies in particular, as I mentioned in my comments, they had some supply chain issues getting some of their mining equipment on a timely basis. And in fact, as I spoke to earlier, given the recent momentum, we think this gives us some nice tail winds going into 2023. In Cody, I would just in terms of longer term, as I speak to people around the state, the economic development activity, I've never experienced the pipeline or the backlog that's out there. So I think this is something, this commercial segment and just looking at the starts and looking at certain site preparations and things like that. We haven't seen a material change in that to this extent, is going to affect our RFP. But again, we're going to look at all three of the RFPs and stack them all up together and proceed down that path in terms of what's available to meet our capacity requirements. You mentioned retirements, but I think your conclusion there's spot on. That's all I had. Thank you for your question. We're going to evaluate all those, stack them up. Certainly, we'll have the benefit of -- if anything comes out of the Inflation Recovery Act, we'll see how that impacts things. The previous question talked about Casper, we'll certainly be cognizant of that. And so the other point that is, I think is relevant here is just in terms of availability, when these could be slotted in and fill some of these gaps. And then when we finished that, will certainly communicate to you and make any requisite filings at the various commissions based on those results. But I don't want to -- I mean, I would expect to have an idea of what we're going to do and recommendation by year end. And but yes, we'll certainly when we make our decision, there will be an adjustment in terms of how we categorize the capital, and certainly how we finance that. And relating to that balance sheet strength, as you get these better than expected cash flows from the ET sale, your balance sheet was already one of the better ones in the industry, with  in the high teens. Obviously, becoming a more fully regulated utility over the next 12, 18 months, let's say the credit thresholds may become even looser. I'm sure I know, you've gotten this question before, but as a bunch of capacity continues to remain strong. And I think we've not commented on strategic transactions, I think that's a distraction. And we've talked about that for many, many years. And I think what is unique here is, we have investment opportunities that we're going to be able to spread out for many, many years. This is not a three-year short-term, peak in terms of the investment opportunities. And we also like the idea about this affordability, I mean, for last four years, we've either been the lowest or the second lowest rates in the country. Just one more if I could, maybe for Bryan, in terms of the guidance of the year in the upper half of the utility range. You have the $0.05 drive from the Hoko and other for the year, how much of the Hoko other maybe drag on EPS is embedded in that range, if any? So when we talked about the $1.87 to $1.97, it's the utility guidance. We did, at the beginning of the year talk about the holding company being a $0.01 to $0.02 drag. That number is still roughly in the range, interest rates been a little higher, perhaps that looks more like $0.03 for the full year. And that exit has progressed, perhaps even faster than we first anticipated. Yes, I think it's, we are. I mean, we certainly are seeing inflation in terms of some of our labor markets, some of our commodity markets, some of our materials and supplies. But what I would say is, it's our job and it's our mission to mitigate this as much as possible. And I think, Brandon the great thing about the opportunity set that we have around investment is there are not any big singular projects or bets out there. But I think it's our job and our mission to do the best we can to mitigate it, but I think it's real, and it's out there. That's all I had. At this time, I would like to turn it back to Jason Bailey for closing remarks."
