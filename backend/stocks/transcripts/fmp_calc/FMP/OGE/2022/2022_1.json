    "content": " Earlier this morning, we reported first quarter consolidated earnings of $1.39 per share, which includes utility earnings of $0.19 per share, earnings at the holding company of $0.05 per share and natural gas midstream operations of $1.15 per share. In February, we announced OG&E's 2022 earnings guidance midpoint at 6% above 2021, while at the same time, increasing the utility's long-term earnings per share growth rate to 5% to 7% through 2026. On Slide 5, you can see that for the first quarter of 2022, we reported earnings of $1.39 per share as compared to $0.26 per share in the same period in 2021. Overall, commercial load growth grew 6.5% in the first quarter and we expect that growth rate to be even higher in the second half of the year with strength in many sectors, including manufacturing, food processing and distribution and other industries. Given our strong first quarter results and expectations of solid execution for the remainder of the year, our 2022 utility guidance remains unchanged at $1.87 to $1.97 per share. And then you're looking at -- as we mentioned back in February, we're looking at an enhanced capital plan that's $950 million per year for 5 years and very customer focused, and we have a tremendous growth opportunity in the state of Oklahoma and Arkansas with those economies, and we're going to put that capital to use for our customers. Already this year, we benefited from continued and expected load and customer growth implemented key projects are in service and delivering reliable and resilient service for our customers, received our fourth formula rate filing in Arkansas, begun the rate review of process in Oklahoma, issued RFPs and to address future capacity needs, released our inaugural TCFD report and begun our energy transfer exit."
