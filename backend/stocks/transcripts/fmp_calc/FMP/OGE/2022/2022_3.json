    "content": " I think if anything has probably been more resolute in terms of that we must own these because one of the points we've recognized coming out of Uri and coming out of this summer as hot as it was is, we are good operators and we know how to run our plants and at the end of the day we're accountable to making sure that energy is flowing to all of our customers. On the commercial front, it's a lot of different business types, but on the data mining topic in particular, that's been a nice balance in oil growth here in the third quarter, less so in the first half of the year, but the biggest customer we have there is an Oklahoma-owned and managed company. So, that's just an indicator for you to watch, but that is not what's given us our enthusiasm for 2023, we're looking at a 1% or higher growth rate next year, completely excluding incremental growth from data mining. I think it's fair to say, we're always moving things around and we've certainly had years in the past where we haven't had the benefit of weather, but I think it's safe to say, we were intent on growing our business, but I would just caution you, don't \u00e2\u0080\u0093 when we move things around, we move things around for the long-term."
