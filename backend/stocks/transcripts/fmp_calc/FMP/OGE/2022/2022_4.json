    "content": " Let me be clear, the plan we've put together for 2023 is exactly in line with the commitment we made to you to consistently deliver 5% to 7% earnings per share growth at the electric company based off 2021's original midpoint. This morning, we reported consolidated earnings of $3.32 per share for the year, including $2.19 per share for OG&E, a holding company loss of $0.03 per share and earnings from natural gas midstream operations of $1.16. The increase in electric company net income in 2022 was primarily due to increased recoveries of capital investments as well as higher sales volumes, primarily driven by strong economic growth and a 26% increase in cooling degree days. With respect to our natural gas midstream operations segment, we reported net income of $231 million or $1.16 per diluted share compared to net income of $385 million or $1.92 per share in 2021. Other operations, including our holding company, reported a loss of $5 million or $0.03 per diluted share compared to a loss of $8 million or $0.04 per share in 2021. On a consolidated basis, in 2023, we are forecasting EPS of $1.93 to $2.07 with the midpoint of $2 per share, which includes a holding company loss of approximately $0.04 per share."
