The one generic comment we've obviously given our long-term guidance of 20% practice collections growth, 30% EBITDA growth and obviously we are growing much faster than that this year, as you can see as a lot of those drivers hit pretty well last year and this year. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. Going back to the fee-for-service revenue, and I guess the revenue outperformance in the quarter, it looks like based on the guidance, and you kind of touched on conservative in the back half, but it looks like there's 46% of your practice collections in the second half versus 56% last year and 53% in 2020. Your line is now open. Please ask your question. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. Please ask your question. So I just wanted to see kind of, as we think about modeling 2023 and 2024 and trying to hit that 20% long-term guidance on growth practice collections, I would imagine practice collection lies and providers are all tying a little closer together than we're seeing right now.
