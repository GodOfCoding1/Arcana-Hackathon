    "content": " Despite the neutral buyer that the Central Bar has adopted in the last monetary policy meeting, we believe that the conjunction of lower growth and inflation will leave room to reduce the interest rate to nearly 6% by the end of this year. With regards to demand deposits, we continue to see a normalization this quarter in terms of the source of funding decreasing by 6.4% during this quarter and 27% year-on-year from the unsustainably high levels of 2021 due to the pension fund withdrawals and relief programs. Thank you very much. So at the end of the day, the upside rise or downward risk related to the bottom line, mainly related with economic growth, with the evolution of interest rate, CPI, as Pablo mentioned, the unemployment rate, especially considering the material impact and risk -- so the potential gap between our guidance today and final results for the next -- for the end of this year will be closely related with the evolution of macro factors rather than specific aspects of our bank of the financial industry. Thank you very much. So if we look at the last 10, last 5 years, customers, depending on how you calculate it, if you look at current account customers, we're growing on average over those periods, similar around 6%, 7% in the last period that we look in a short time frame, it slightly above that because of all these new products that we've been implementing, where we've been growing very strongly in terms of new current account openings, all these digital onboarding platforms. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you very much."
