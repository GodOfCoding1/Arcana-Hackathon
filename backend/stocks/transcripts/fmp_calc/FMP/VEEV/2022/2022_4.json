Yes, I can take that. Peter, I think you said that the macro doesn't really affect the selling cycle for Crossix, it's really a decision whether someone wants to go enterprise or state -- brand by brand. Well, I think when overall, the media spend goes down then that has a negative effect on Veeva because, let's say, a brand is going to be TV advertising and then it feels like why that I really want to measure that with Crossix versus if they decide to. So then in that case, maybe not directly, but indirectly, it is still tied to the macro, maybe not so much the -- like an R&D budget kind of, but it's really just sort of a general economic macro environment is started. Hi, thanks for taking my questions. Hi, thanks for taking my questions.
