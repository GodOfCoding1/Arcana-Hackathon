    "content": " After the speakers\u2019 presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. Good afternoon, and welcome to Veeva\u2019s fiscal 2022 first quarter earnings conference call for the quarter ended April 30, 2021. As a reminder, we posted prepared remarks on Veeva\u2019s Investor Relations website just after 1:00 p.m. Pacific today. But what I will say, we\u2019re very pleased with the overall service business, the strength that we saw on the development side and broadly. Yes, we did have another strong quarter overall in Quality, really broadly across Development Cloud and in Quality in particular. And I guess, I\u2019d started at the highest level, the unified vision that we have in Development Cloud is working, and Quality is just a perfect example where we\u2019re bringing together documentation with quality management with training, and they\u2019re all progressing really, really well. Customers are buying into that overall vision, and then they\u2019re rolling out and kind of driving that vision over time. And companies are looking to modernize in the Quality space, and they\u2019re looking at Veeva to be that partner to help them there. So, we\u2019re really pleased with our progress. Just like to hear maybe a little bit more, if you would all share with us some of your thoughts around the pharma sales force globally. It seems like from the prepared comments, you\u2019re walking back some of your concerns or maybe pushing them out. But, we haven\u2019t seen any of the reductions so far that we\u2019ve talked about, I guess, two quarters ago now. So, I wouldn\u2019t classify it as a walking back. And then, I guess, in recent quarters, there\u2019s been a lot of buzz around decentralized clinical trials across the CRO space and pharma in general. Yes, decentralized trials, that\u2019s part of what we call digital trials, so that\u2019s moving clinical trials to paperless and patient-centric. Decentralized trials itself refers to, most often, to being able to do parts of the trial process with the patient in the patient\u2019s home, still supervised by a caregiver, but that may be through an in-home nurse, or that may be through a Zoom call, something like that. That\u2019s things like MyVeeva for patients, for example. What we\u2019re doing for eConsent, our Site Connect product. And then, we\u2019ll connect that into our Clinical Suite for the sponsor. So, it\u2019s a big opportunity and area of investment. Well, I\u2019ll play -- this is Peter and I\u2019ll play left fielder today and I got that one out of left field. That\u2019s not an area where we\u2019re focused at this time when you keep an eye on it, and you never say never in the future. Peter, when we talk to our contacts in the life science industry, a theme that keeps popping up is kind of this past year led to a potential reimagining of clinical workflows, from trials to submission to post production, which could potentially lead to a replatforming for many customers. Ken, that\u2019s fair to think that the customers are definitely reimagining things COVID, and across all industries has caused people to think maybe some assumptions that they had in the past were not valid. And so, now, they\u2019re trying to question everything more open to innovation, I think, tremendous downside of COVID in terms of loss of life, increasing mobility, that type of thing. So, that is what\u2019s going on. When we look at replatforming, I think really, what I see from the customers is, yes, reimagining efficiency, digital data investment. And yes, I think we\u2019re getting a slight tailwind from that. So, it\u2019s not something that you\u2019re going to immediately see but that will be a continued and moderate tailwind for us for the next three, four years, really. And it\u2019s a positive trend when customers look to innovation, because our product footprint is well positioned. We did a lot of things as we moved into digital last year, especially with MyVeeva and the digital trials and Veeva Engage that position us well. So, I think we\u2019re in a good position and a favorable position, Ken. Any sense if there\u2019s a good amount of pent-up demand for when you guys finally roll out the rest of the prescription data and kind of across U.S. and, to the extent, international at some point? So, we\u2019re certainly focused on the U.S. market at this point. So, we\u2019re really proud of the success and the value that we\u2019re creating for customers in the early market. I guess, first, as we\u2019re seeing kind of an increased willingness here, you noted kind of several customers throughout the quarter looking to standardize across your Clinical Suite and leverage those solutions. What\u2019s going on is, they\u2019re looking for an integrated suite, not so much -- standardization on technology is nice and that\u2019s useful. That\u2019s the essence of a life sciences company, getting products approved to market quickly. So, it\u2019s not the standardization of technology but it\u2019s the seamless business process that they\u2019re looking for. And I don\u2019t want to dig kind of too deep into it, but I guess, can you talk about -- well, you just kind of mentioned some of the early traction around the Data Cloud piece. There\u2019s no impact in terms of IQVIA, and there\u2019s obviously been a lot of noise in the marketplace and kind of their competitive behaviors that they have a history of, but that really has no impact at all on Data Cloud. So, I love your early take on how you\u2019re thinking about these players. Yes,, certainly, not just in health tech overall, the market, early market\u2019s awash with capital right now. Now, you get lower quality entrants on the average because you\u2019re getting diffusity and monies in a surplus. So, I think that\u2019s what\u2019s going on. M&A, I would say not different in that space versus other places that we\u2019ve been in. So, where we can get a seed of something that will really either help the industry overall and thereby help Veeva. So, that\u2019s what we would look for. Sorry, I didn\u2019t finish. So, I just have a quick one because I feel like Ato\u2019s done so much work on this. So, you\u2019ve heard a lot of noise about IQVIA. But that situation there with their anticompetitive behavior, the case is all upside for Veeva because the status quo is this restricted data environment that IQVIA\u2019s created. So, that\u2019s the status quo. But, we\u2019ll see and that\u2019s in 2023. Peter, I\u2019m glad Stephanie just kind of poked at the IQVIA thread there a little bit. And then, conversely, are they opening up and saying, hey, we really, really do want the choice, and it\u2019s about the time we get this choice. So, I\u2019d love to know which way they\u2019re pushing on that thread. Tom, I\u2019ll take that one. So, they feel like, hey, there\u2019s two kids fighting on the lawn. Who started the fight or why, it\u2019s just noise for them. So, they don\u2019t appreciate it. I would say -- I think, they generally know that it\u2019s caused by IQVIA but still it doesn\u2019t matter. They\u2019re not nervous with IQVIA, our customers, they\u2019re life sciences companies. They\u2019re really Veeva and IQVIA, we are the partners with suppliers to the industry. So, I don\u2019t feel any nervousness from our customers. They knew that if IQVIA would do something, like not allow their data into Veeva CRM, a, they\u2019d find another way to analyze that data; and b, they wouldn\u2019t appreciate that from IQVIA to end up IQVIA losing business. So, they\u2019re not willing to be pushed around by IQVIA. So, I think Data Cloud, for example, that\u2019s really enthusiastic for the customers. Noise about fighting in press releases, that\u2019s not a positive -- sorry, more choice is a positive for customers. I mean, we look at these gross margins and they\u2019re at all-time highs here. Seemingly, no reason why they can\u2019t continue. And it just sort of brings to mind anytime you can kind of end-of-life customers on one platform and move them all over to a modernized version, there might be lasting benefits to the gross margin line there. Yes, this was an outstanding quarter, obviously, from an op margin perspective, the highest op margin quarter that we\u2019ve had to date. And how I think about it is, we\u2019re in growth mode right now. And we\u2019re aggressively hiring specifically in the products, sales and services area. So, there\u2019s a lot of things that happened in Q1 that drove the high op margin percentage. Yes, we\u2019re on track with outside of life sciences there. Maybe to add some customers and expand in existing customers, we believe we\u2019re on track to sort of in the $100 million, bringing the business for 2025. So, we\u2019re on track for that. I\u2019m really pleased with the customer success, and that\u2019s what\u2019s fueling our business there. And I guess, I\u2019d characterize the demand around digital events, which is ramping up. That\u2019s been ramping up for some time now and we\u2019re really -- we focused our business on to supporting customers, doing digital events. The good news is, we\u2019re focused on supporting both. So, as customers prefer, we can support whether it\u2019s digital or whether it\u2019s in-person. And I wanted to just go back to one of the earlier questions around the headcount, the overall reduction in headcount across the health care and the pharmaceutical sales industry. So, we don\u2019t anticipate any material impact one way or the other. And typically, those kinds of things, whether we saw a smaller or a larger reduction, one, we\u2019ve modeled the name; and two, those things tend to play out over time, based on renewal cycles. I guess, what I was trying to say is as much as maybe those -- the potential head cuts -- headcount cuts would come in the back half of this year or begin to maybe impact you and you guys are on the long-term strategic annual plus contract. So, Stan, it\u2019s Brent. So, we didn\u2019t see any increase in the reductions in Q1. So, I\u2019ll talk about fiscal year \u201822 and what we\u2019re seeing a bit. So, we\u2019re seeing travel start to return to normalization. All of that\u2019s been contemplated into our guide, and that\u2019s why I explicitly stated about 175 bps of tailwind. So, if you think about the broader Engage opportunity, we have -- we\u2019ve captured roughly 60% of the market. And we\u2019ll expect to see continued growth in Engage, normalizing to where it was. So, Crossix is generally independent of the kinds of reductions that you\u2019re seeing. And fundamentally, Crossix\u2019 business is based on supporting media and advertising and marketing, which is digital. Peter, I\u2019d be curious just to hear your thoughts on what do you think is causing sort of this increased reliance on consulting services from customers. In terms of the percentage revenue and how that grows going forward, I don\u2019t expect any material change there. Consulting business is growing but it\u2019s still small as when you look at the bulk of our business, which is actually subscription and professional services. Consulting is a bit, a higher-value service that focuses on business process -- business process type things, not just implementing our software. So, it\u2019s growing but it\u2019s never going to be the biggest part of Veeva, that type of thing. So, it\u2019s been very complementary. So, one of the things with consulting is very good for us, stitching together the business processes that are needed when you\u2019re implementing processes, for example, across clinical and regulatory or commercial and medical. So, that\u2019s where you get a lot of the value and when you redesign these business processes, roles and responsibilities. So, necessary and view it as icing on the cake, but it\u2019s not the cake. And then, I just had a quick question regarding -- we are starting to see more customers going in full suite, especially in the last quarter and current quarter in like Quality and Regulatory and including new customers or in Commercial Cloud. Generally, that will be with smaller biotechs because they\u2019re nimble, they don\u2019t have existing infrastructure. But, that\u2019s not really so applicable to our large enterprises, because they have lots of people, lots of processes and they have to pick the parts that they optimize. Thank you, everyone, for joining today\u2019s call."
