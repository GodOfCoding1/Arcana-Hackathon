    "content": " We expect to have early adopters on the Vault CRM in 2024, some early adopters, and then the majority moving on 2025 or so, that's when we'll be selling mainly well CRM and customers will migrate over time. I know you guys have introduced a number of functional areas here, but can you give us a sense of how you're thinking about putting together that I think you guys have logged those, right, the proverbial Rubik's cube around the sources and stakeholders there, not just from an existing process perspective, but unlocking and addressing almost an entirely new set of workflows and capabilities. So when it looks like really we're you could think about as moving the back end of the application, the back-end platform, and we'll have migration tools that will bring the data across, including the customers customization and still be able to use all their content that they've developed, their multichannel e-mail templates. When you think about the industry, particularly in the large enterprise, they're not -- it's not as susceptible to some of these macroeconomic changes, and we haven't seen any change there. We're more talking about operating model, how we operate together, how we -- the governance model and it's only done based on trust over many years when they see repeated patterns of a customer success orientation of a strategic partnership orientation, and then it's really the governance model that we put in. So that's why the investment is just -- it's not material to the rest of Veeva, it's because of the leverage, both in the existing application footprint, template and code and then the leverage we get from the Vault platform. Having said that, what makes Veeva -- the factors that are going in Veeva's favor, first, I would say our customer feeling, our customer success viewing and track record of success that we've built up over time."
