    "content": " Because RWS has such a large impact on the fourth quarter and the year, before I turn the call over to Brett to review financials, I'm going to give you an update on what's going on there and an overview of the corrective actions we've taken. During the first quarter of 2023, we expect SG&A costs will be about $9.5 million to $10 million, which reflects the ongoing run rate of our business, along with the ongoing acquisition and integration costs, and increased investment in systems, processes and people to continuously improve our efficiency and the scalability of our platform. While we're not happy with the integration process of RWS, I want to reiterate that this 1 quarter does not affect our overall outlook for the company and it does not reflect on the tremendous growth progress that the company has made during the last several years and our opportunity for continued double-digit growth. So I mean you sort of gave I don't want to say guidance, but January, February this year, you're running at, I think, $4.25 million gross profit."
