    "content": " Second quarter financial results were ahead of our expectations, which was due to multiple factors, including strong activity from our customers across our end markets, growth from both existing and new customers and improvements in efficiencies. First, strong sequential increase in gross profit dollars came from growth from existing customers, including a ramp of activity from several sizable new clients that we added during 2021. I want to point out that these new customers will provide a stable source of business for years to come and a base of organic growth for at least 12 to 18 months, as we roll out services across their footprints. I think to Laurie\u00e2\u0080\u0099s point, we look at if you blended margin over the first two quarters in a macro, and then when you look at some of that specific ramping we were talking about on some of these large clients, they are moving up quite well, well above \u00e2\u0080\u0093 actually, above our expectations currently. And if I can sneak in one comment, I was really thankful and excited to hear that you're focused on operating cash flow, break positivity as we get into the back half of the year, you guys have been growing so fast, it's really hard to generate cash through the kind of growth that you've seen, but I'm excited that you've taken steps to be focused on managing your working capital."
