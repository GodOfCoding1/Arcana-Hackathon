    "content": " But if you look back, Gerry, from when we first talked two years ago, our ability, this team's ability to take existing clients and expand margin without having to increase prices through continued process if it was the right sizing, any type of optimization on the cost side. So I think maybe just a clarifying question on what Sameer just asked about the acquired gross profit dollars in the quarter, I thought that Sameer\u2019s question was specifically about the acquisition that you made in Q1 of that other services company. And I'd love to hear if you think that there's maybe more have an opportunity with RWS and Instream customers of expanding to additional locations and continuing to add waste streams into those customers, you did a good job talking about the cross-selling opportunities of RWS\u2019 programs to your cost to the pretty acquisition customers, but maybe not the other way around."
