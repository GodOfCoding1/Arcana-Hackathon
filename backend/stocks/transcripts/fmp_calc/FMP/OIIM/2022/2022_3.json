    "content": " As projected, our Q3 revenue of $18.2 million was lower than Q2 revenue due to inventories that resulted from improving supply chains during Q2, while consumer spending simultaneously slowed for products like power tools, vacuum cleaners and TVs. While our market position in garden tools, power tools, vacuum cleaners and e-bike remains strong, we see expanding design wins for our Battery Management business in household and industrial energy storage systems that are showing rapid growth as well as automotive applications where we have begun high-volume production with one of our new products."
