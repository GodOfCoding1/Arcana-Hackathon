    "content": " Foreign currency headwinds reduced our third quarter net revenue and net revenue growth by approximately $800,000 and 2.1 percentage points, respectively, as compared to the prior year period. Paragon's revenue for the third quarter of 2022 was $46 million, representing 28% growth compared to the third quarter of 2021. Revenue growth through the first nine months of 2022 was 24% and was fueled by a 23% expansion of our producing U.S. surgeon base, continued double-digit increases in year-over-year U.S. sales force productivity and record international revenue, including 52% reported growth for the quarter. The increased net revenue guidance includes the impact of stronger foreign currency headwinds in both the third and fourth quarters of 2022, which are now expected to reduce 2022 net revenue and net revenue growth by approximately $2.4 million and 1.6 percentage points, respectively. Our increased 2022 annual net revenue guidance includes fourth quarter net revenue of $49.6 million, representing reported net revenue growth of 16% compared to the prior year quarter. Our fourth quarter net revenue guidance includes the impact of stronger foreign currency headwinds, which are now expected to reduce fourth quarter net revenue and net revenue growth by approximately $900,000 and 2.1 percentage points, respectively. And those products, combined with the outstanding medical education programs that we offer, are bringing new products to our existing customer base, and we're also attracting new customers as we referenced the growth in our producing surgeon count as well as our overall surgeon count."
