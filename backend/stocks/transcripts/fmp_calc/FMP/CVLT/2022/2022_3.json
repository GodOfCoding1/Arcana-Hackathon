    "content": " Software and products revenue meaningfully outpaced the market growth rate, increasing 11% year-over-year to a record $99 million. Total customers increased approximately 40% quarter-over-quarter to nearly 1,500, and Metallic landed its first-ever seven-figure ACV deal. 11:09 Total annual recurring revenue, or ARR, increased 11% year-over-year to approximately $561 million. 11:32 As Sanjay noted earlier, subscription and Metallic ARR grew 45% year-over-year to $309 million and now represents 55% of total ARR, up from 51% last quarter and 46% a year ago. 12:09 Total recurring revenue, which includes subscription software, maintenance support services, and SaaS grew 17% year-over-year to $164 million. And then the final quick question is, going back to the Analyst Day early part of 2021, you outlined kind of some growth expectations, both total revenue as well software and then also progression of EBIT, I believe, towards into that mid 20% range, correct me if I'm wrong, I think out for 2024 fiscal year."
