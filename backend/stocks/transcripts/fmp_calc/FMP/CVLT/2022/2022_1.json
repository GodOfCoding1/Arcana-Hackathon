    "content": " It's -- we're seeing -- first of all, we're seeing customers really embracing what we call the Power of And. And then as customers move down the journey, whether they start in the cloud and then incorporate on-premise, or they go the other way, we're seeing that there's a lot more land that we can do with Metallic as a way say that Office 365 workloads. For example, with ransomware where it is today and it's top of mind to every customer, if they're an existing Hyperscale X customer, I oversimplified, but they have an easy button by which they can back up an immutable copy of their data in our cloud. Since we brought the product out and really over the last 4 or 5 quarters we've just whether it's geographical expansion, whether it's feature functionality expansion, whether it's workload expansion, whether it's containers, whether it's supporting multiple clouds that -- the 3 Microsoft clouds, active directory, I mean, FedRAMP certification. The second thing, which relates to your question, is what we keep calling the Power of And, which is with existing customers or customers that have on-premise workloads and it's very much part of their future, we give them that ability to mix and match."
