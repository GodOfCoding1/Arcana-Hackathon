    "content": " Software and products revenue was $92 million, increasing 13% as reported, and growth accelerating to 17% on a constant currency basis. The combination of subscription and Metallic ARR were 46% to $378 million, and now represents 64% of total ARR, which compares to 59% of total ARR last quarter and only 49% in Q1 of the prior year. Total recurring revenue, which includes subscription software, maintenance support services, and SaaS grew 20% to $171 million, or 25% growth on a constant currency basis. So on a constant currency basis, we're guiding Q2 to about 12% software growth, and 8% total revenue growth. So just to give you we're not breaking out Europe, but we are saying International, which includes Asia, software revenue last quarter was up 15%. And total revenue roughly 16% up in constant currency so Europe had a good quarter, we're just saying towards the end of last quarter, we saw a little bit of a slowdown in decision making, not the pipeline as Gary indicated."
