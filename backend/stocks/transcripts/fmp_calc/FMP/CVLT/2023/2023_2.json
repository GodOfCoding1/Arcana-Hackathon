    "content": " Half of those have another Commvault product and one-third have multiple Metallic offerings, reinforcing that in today's world customers need both software and SaaS. Subscription software revenue increased 32% year-over-year to $63 million and represented 76% of total software revenue, which compares to only 63% of total software revenue in Q2 of the prior year. One moment for our next question. One moment for our next question. One of the things, Jim, we're most proud of is this quarter alone on a units basis, 70% of the new Metallic customers were new to Commvault. One moment for our next question. Now if 70% of our customers the last quarter for Metallic were new to the company, every one of them becomes a potential to pull software, okay. One moment for our next question."
