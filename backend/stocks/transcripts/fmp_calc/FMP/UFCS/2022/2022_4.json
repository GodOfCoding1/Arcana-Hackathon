    "content": " From a profitability perspective, our fourth quarter combined ratio was 103.6%, which includes 4.9 points of catastrophe losses and 4.9 points of prior year reserve strengthening. In the fourth quarter, we strengthened prior year reserves by $12 million or 4.9 points of combined ratio impact, focusing on our construction defect business in accident years 2015 through 2019, where a combination of deeper analytical insights and emerging claims experience has increased our view of potential exposure and aligned with long reporting lags. As a result, fourth quarter investment income from fixed maturity assets increased by $2 million or 19% compared to last year. This increase in fixed maturity income was offset by lower valuations in our long-term investment portfolio, resulting in net investment income of $12.9 million in the fourth quarter, relatively flat compared to the fourth quarter of 2021. Within our core commercial business, the average renewal premium change was 8.3% for the year, with rate increases of 5.2% and exposure increases of 3.1% as we continue to focus on adequate property valuation considering today's inflationary environment. As described earlier, prior year reserve development had a neutral impact on our full year loss ratio as releases in the first 2 quarters, focused on commercial auto were offset by strengthening in the third and fourth quarters in excess umbrella and construction defect coverages."
