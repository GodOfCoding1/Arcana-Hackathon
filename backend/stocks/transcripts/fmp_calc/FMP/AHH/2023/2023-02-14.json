    "content": " During this call, we may make forward looking statements, including statements related to the future performance of our portfolio, our development pipeline, the impact of acquisitions and dispositions, our mezzanine program, our construction business, our liquidity position our portfolio performance and financing activities, as well as comments on our guidance and outlook. Portfolio NOI is the biggest increase and that, again, is basically two factors: one being same-store sales being up across the board in each of our sectors as well as a full year of stabilized -- newly stabilized properties which obviously, on a year-over-year basis, gives a pretty significant boost."
