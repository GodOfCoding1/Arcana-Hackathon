    "content": " Total revenue for the fourth quarter and full year 2022 was $9.5 million and $27.4 million, representing growth of 208% and 148% for the respective periods. Gross margins came in at 68% for the fourth quarter and 57% for the full year of 2022, reflecting positive mix shift in revenue towards higher-priced BioXp kits launched during the year for mRNA, long fragment builds, cell-free DNA scale-up as well as the receipt of Pfizer technical milestone payment resulting from the successful achievement of our first of 4 milestones. First of all, on revenue growth, we have a robust series of BioXp product launches, including the launch of approximately 11 additional BioXp kits and 2 new BioXp systems for NGS library prep and the SOLA-powered system that will, for the first time, allow customers to achieve same-day turnaround results or CRISPR guide RNA. We're now adding beginning in the first quarter of this year to that, the Select kits, which will allow customers to use their own DNA as a starting point, including NGS, and we expect to launch about 11 kits during the course of this year, that being 2023. But I think from a production perspective, let's say it's linear with respect to getting the systems up and going but nonlinear with respect to capacity and uptime and things like that, so more of an emphasis on gross margin accretion later in the year from the oligo in-sourcing initiatives."
