    "content": " As you can see in the chart in the upper left side, our recurring EBITDA from continuing operations totaled 1 billion, BRL $113 million in the second quarter of 2022, 131% higher than that of the second quarter of '21, driven by improved results from the three businesses. EBITDA totaled 1 billion, BRL 119 billion, 45% higher than the EBITDA of the second quarter of 2021, which still had Oxiteno's results. Ultrapar's net income in the second quarter was 460 million, BRL 478 million above the net income of the second quarter of '21, mainly as a result of the improved EBITDA of continuing operations of the capital gain from the sale of Oxiteno amounting to 289 million and the Extrafarma impairment of BRL 395 million registered in the second quarter of '21. These effects were partially offset by higher financial expenses, which is mainly due to the one-off negative result of BRL 272 million of mark-to-market of hedges in the second quarter of '22 compared to the one-off positive result of the BRL 65 million in the second quarter of '21. Investments from continuing operations totaled for BRL 107 million in the second quarter of '22, 29% above that of the second quarter of '21, mainly due to greater investments in Ipiranga, partially offset by lower investments in Nutracargo and Nutragas. Ultra-gas SG&A in the second quarter of '22 increased 29% year-over-year due to the higher personnel expenses, mainly collective bargaining agreements and increased variable compensation, which is aligned with the company's results growth in addition to higher provision of our doubtful accounts and marketing expenses. Ultragaz's EBITDA totaled BRL 261 million, 91% higher than that of the second quarter of '21. This increase is mainly explained by the weaker comparison basis of the second quarter of '21, which was impacted by the consecutive cost increases in LPG in that period as well as due to improved profitability in the second quarter of '22, resulting from initiatives to improve efficiency and productivity implemented over the last month. The company's average installed capacity reached 955,000 cubic meters in the second quarter of '22, an 11% growth year-over-year on the back of the startup of operations of the Vila do Conde terminal in December 2021 and the expansions in tank capacity implemented in the Itaqui terminal over the last 12 months. Utracargo's net revenues totaled BRL 217 million in the second quarter, 23% higher than that of the second quarter of '21, led by higher cubic meters sold due to the capacity expansions I just mentioned, and contractual readjustments. Combined cost and expenses were 18% higher than those in the second quarter of '21, mainly impacted by costs and expenses of the Vila do Conde terminal, which is targeted operations in December '21 and accounted for almost half of this increase due to higher depreciation costs arising from capacity expansions and investments made during the last 12 months and due to effects of inflation over personnel and inputs, which were offset by productivity and efficiency gains over the second quarter of '22. Ultracargo's EBITDA reached a new record level of BRL 130 million in the second quarter, 29% higher than that of the second quarter of '21, resulting from the expansions with profitability gains, contractual readjustments as well as productivity and efficiency gains. The other operating results line totaled negative BRL 130 million in the second quarter of 22, down BRL 204 million compared to the second quarter of '21, mainly due to higher expenses with carbon tax credits and lower amount of extemporaneous tax credits recorded. Ipiranga's EBITDA totaled BRL 840 million in the quarter, 99% higher than that of the second quarter of '21. Recurring EBITDA was BRL 754 million, 157% higher than the second quarter of '21 as a result of improved margins and higher sales volume despite increased SG&A and expenses with the carbon tax credits. Ipiranga's recurring EBITDA margin was BRL 134 per cubic meter compared to BRL 52 per cubic meter in the second quarter of 2021 and BRL 110 per cubic meter in the first quarter of '22, an evolution supported by the ongoing results recovery plan as well as by market conditions. Thank you very much. You may proceed, sir. If you look at our share background in the last quarter in the Ipiranga banner network, we grew 10% in volume, and there's a drop of 40% in the white banner, so the work that is being carried out is to look upon the network to look at those low potential gas stations to enhance them to invest in quality to enhance the quality of the business as a whole. You may proceed, sir. In fact, we do have a loss in the auto cycle, but as mentioned previously, there is a drop of sales of 36% in the second quarter of '22 vis-\u00c3\u00a0-vis the second quarter of '21, concentrated in the spot market with the white banners, while our network has had a growth of 10%. You may proceed, sir. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you very much."
