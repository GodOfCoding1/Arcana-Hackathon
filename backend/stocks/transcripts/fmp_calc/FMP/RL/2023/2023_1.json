    "content": " And while roughly 50% of our China stores were negatively impacted by COVID closures in the quarter, driving Mainland sales down 10% to last year in constant currency, we continue to reinforce our elevated brand positioning in the market. Our owned Ralph Lauren digital sites grew high single digits on top of last year's 49% compare, reflecting our compelling product assortments, new consumer acquisition and user-friendly connected retail capabilities. Adjusted operating expenses increased 13% to 55.2% of sales, including marketing expense growth of about 40% over last year's lower spend. Performance was driven by improved traffic, larger basket sizes and 12% AUR growth on top of 39% last year, reflecting our ongoing elevation around product mix, marketing and more targeted pricing and promotions. Comps in our owned RalphLauren.com site grew 2% on top of a strong 51% compared last year, supported by solid demand for our products and ability to retain newly acquired consumers. Europe wholesale exceeded our expectations again this quarter, up 8% on a reported basis and 20% in constant currency, driven by stronger fall bookings and fill rates, reorder trends and sustained growth with our digital pure plays. In addition to the factors we outlined last quarter, including FX, softer consumer sentiment in Europe and Q1 China COVID lockdowns, our updated full year outlook also incorporates increased caution around our value-oriented consumers in North America, notably the potential for softer traffic and conversion rates through the end of the year. We expect second quarter operating margin in the range of 15.4% to 15.7% in constant currency, reflecting increased headwinds from higher freight and marketing expense which are expected to normalize in the second half of the year."
