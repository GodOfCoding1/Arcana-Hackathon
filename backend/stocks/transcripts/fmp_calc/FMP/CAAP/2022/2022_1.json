    "content": " We also saw a strong recovery in revenues ex IFRIC, which reached 82% of pre-pandemic levels, despite the impact of Omicron on travel demand in the first two months of the quarter, tariff adjustments in some segments and the leaner cost structure. In Argentina, the positive trend continued and traffic in April reached 75% of the levels of the same month in 2019, note that Uruguay is already operating at 63% of pre-COVID levels in April with weekly frequencies up 14% versus the first quarter of 2019. We achieved significant margin expansion driven by top-line growth and cost efficiencies, in first quarter 2022 adjusted EBITDA margin EX-IFRIC12 expanded to 36.3% from 5.7% in the first quarter of 2021 while we see room for continued expansion when compared to the nearly 39% margin posted in the first quarter 2019."
