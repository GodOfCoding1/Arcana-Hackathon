In Italy, traffic posted a robust sequential improvement, driven by the summer season, reaching 89% of third quarter of 2019 levels and continued the recovery observed in the prior quarter. Uruguay, Armenia and Italy were particularly strong, beating third quarter of 2019 levels while Argentina posted a sequential improvement with cargo volumes reaching 83% of pre-pandemic levels. Aeronautical revenues increased nearly 130% year-on-year, mainly driven by continued recovery in passenger traffic across geographies, reaching 93% of third quarters 2019 levels. Armenia continued to make a strong contribution to this growth with aeronautical revenues up in the mid-teens from pre-pandemic levels along with Ecuador, which also reported a low single digit increase against third quarter 2019."
