    "content": " Pent-up demand and lifting of travel restrictions continue to support the positive traffic recovery trend with a total of 15.1 million passengers traveling across our airports during the quarter and reaching 76% of second quarter 2019 levels. Armenia, which only operates international travel, again, led the rebound with traffic surpassing second quarter of 2019 levels by 6% in the quarter, accelerating to plus 12% in July. Traffic in Italy was up by more than five times year-on-year to nearly 85% of second quarter of 2019 levels, benefiting from the start of the summer season and the full lifting of travel restrictions, which was in effect last June. In Brazil, traffic stood at 76% of second quarter of 2019 levels, slightly below the 77% posted in the first quarter as rising fuel prices added pressure on aircraft. Ecuador posted steady growth in the quarter reaching 94% of pre-pandemic levels, while domestic flights were impacted by cancellations in June due to social unrest, routes through Europe and the US and Panama continued to post a solid performance with international traffic at 97% in the second quarter of 2019 level. Noteworthy, this quarter are the performances of Italy and Uruguay, which posted cargo volumes exceeding pre-pandemic levels, while Argentina reached 86% of the second quarter of 2019 levels. As shown on slide 6, we delivered a robust top line performance again this quarter with revenue ex-IFRIC12 reaching 98% of second quarter 2019 levels."
