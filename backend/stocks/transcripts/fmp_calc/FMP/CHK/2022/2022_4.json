    "content": " Year-over-year, despite the inflationary environment, our annual drilling and completion CapEx will be modestly lower, but we expect to see only a slight production decline of approximately 2% in the Marcellus and Haynesville, allowing us to maintain our cash flow resiliency and continue our leading shareholder return profile. We find ourselves in this position today, thanks to several important strategic actions taken over the last 2 years, including our well-timed Haynesville and Marcellus acquisitions, which bolstered the depth of our high-return, low-cost inventory as well as our decision to exit the Eagle Ford. But right now, as we look at our inflationary estimates, we do expect to see some year-over-year inflation in the Haynesville, probably something pushing 10% on a cost per foot basis, we would expect the Marcellus to really be less than 5% in the low single digits. I was hoping you guys could talk a little bit about potential for M&A opportunities in Haynesville, Marcellus, Obviously, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to have \u00e2\u0080\u0093 if these two deals close, a fair amount of cash on hand, Gas prices are low. But obviously, we have our volumes in the rich gas area, which has a fair amount of NGLs that are going up based on the investments we had in the Upper Austin Chalk last year, and so then just the mix of assets and pricing is probably affecting that a little bit as we look at 2023 relative to 2022."
