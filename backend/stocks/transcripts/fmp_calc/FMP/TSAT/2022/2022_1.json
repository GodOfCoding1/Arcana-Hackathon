I mean I haven't heard from a single satellite operator in the last, I don't know, 12 months, whether they're a new entrant, whether they're a long-standing operator, everyone's kind of getting moved to the right a little bit, mostly for the same reasons that we've been moved to the right, these supply chain issues and whatnot. But it's certainly the case that once our financing is in place, we started the full-scale production of the constellation, we'll be signing more contracts with customers prelaunch, we're going to be very focused before any satellite is launched to have that backlog number needly higher than the $750 million where it sits today, and we'll be reporting that along the way. And yes, we'll build it and...\n Maybe you maybe you should have said 1.1% and people might have taken a little bit more...\n Whatever -- but no, I mean, I cannot believe that there's anyone who's been more  and forensic and rigorous in building up a demand model for every vertical -- and again, that's backhaul connectivity, again, every bit micro quadrant around the earth."
