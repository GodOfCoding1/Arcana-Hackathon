    "content": " As we covered on our last call, I think we've done a really good job with our customers in upgrading ground infrastructure to extend Anik F2 services and where that wasn't enough, transitioning users who needed station kept capacity to other satellites, including an in orbit satellite we bought from another operator, other Telesat satellites and third party satellites as well. Telesat ended the year 2022 with reported revenues of $759 million, adjusted EBITDA of $568 million and generated cash from operations of $229 million, with $1.7 billion of cash on the balance sheet at year end. On the CapEx side, I think Andrew was careful to say that we've guided to $40 million to $70 million a year, but said that more or less, we'll update our guidance once we've got Lightspeed fully underway because once it's fully underway, certainly, our CapEx spending will look a lot different than the $40 million to $70 million. That's the other thing I'd say would be easy in some ways just to say, oh screw, we've got all this cash on our balance sheet, we've already lined up all this money, we'll just start blowing our brains out and spending money."
