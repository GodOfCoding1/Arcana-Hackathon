    "content": " Total cash collections were $412 million globally, a 16% decrease year-over-year, as we're seeing the impact of lower volumes of portfolios offered for sale. During the quarter, we collected $28 million in excess of our expected recoveries, which represented consolidated overperformance of 6%, with Americas overperforming by 3% and Europe overperforming by 12%. Cash collections in the quarter were negatively impacted by $26 million, due to the strengthening US dollar. We have grown ERC from $200 million to over $5 billion today while growing revenues from $56 million to over $1 billion last year, which was a record year for us in terms of collections revenue cash efficiency and net income."
