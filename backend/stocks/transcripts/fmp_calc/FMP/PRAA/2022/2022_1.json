    "content": " We will make forward-looking statements during the call, which are based on management's current beliefs, projections, assumptions and expectation. We caution listeners that these forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties, assumptions and other factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from our expectation. The earnings release, the slide presentation that we will use during today's call and our SEC filings can be found on the Investors section of our website at www.pragroup.com. Additionally, a replay of this call will be available shortly after its conclusion and the information needed to listen is in the earnings press release. During our call, we will discuss adjusted EBITDA and debt to adjusted EBITDA for the 12 months ended March 31st, 2022, and December 31, 2021. However, I'm not going to assume that 2022 will start bringing some sort of normalcy back to our work lives, spiking cases in different parts of the world and ever-changing government guidance, we will be prepared for the trials this year has in store for us. On to Q1, we had a strong quarter, led by the performance of our European operations. Keep in mind that prior year comparisons will be difficult, given the combination of COVID lockdowns, restrictions around the world and government programs in the US, all of which put many consumers in a position of having excess liquidity during 2020 and 2021. In cash collections, our cash in Q1, our cash collections were $481 million, a decrease of $75 million. The US led this decline for a number of reasons, which were largely related to the government action I just mentioned. These actions drove strong consumer liquidity, coupled with increased consumer engagement in 2021, as well as 2020. Over time, this in turn drove lower levels of consumer debt outstanding along with some of the lowest delinquency rates we've ever seen. This was partially offset by European cash collections, which increased 1% or 6% on a currency adjusted basis. Additionally, Europe did not see the same sort of government actions that we saw here in the US. Net income attributable to PRA Group for the quarter was $40 million, a decrease of 32% over last year. During the quarter, we repurchased $39 million or 860,000 shares of our common stock. Since we began repurchasing last year, we repurchased approximately 5.7 million shares, reducing our common shares outstanding by 12%. From an operating perspective, we had a strong quarter and we continue to benefit from the efficiency gains we drove over the past few years. Since prior year comparisons are tough, as I mentioned earlier, we benchmarked 2019 globally in an effort to remove the impact COVID has had on our business. Comparing our results for the first quarter of 2019, cash efficiency ratios improved 590 basis points. We continuously look for ways to improve our predictive scoring models, test new data sources and improve our legal and outbound calling strategies. In the US, our digital platform continues to drive collections that are a significant part of total collections. Since the first quarter of 2019, our digital collections have increased 105%. Cash collected per hour paid has nearly doubled since Q1 2019, growing from $139 per collector hour to $261 per collector hour in Q1 of '22. Additionally, this quarter was not far from the peak level of $279 we reached in Q1 of last year. In Europe, over the past few years, we've invested heavily in technology, including investments in digital platforms, cloud-based dialers, infrastructure, robotic process automation and integration into supporting systems. Given the current economic environment, we've had a number of discussions about inflation. Given our long history, we've experienced varying levels of inflation and economic stress in past cycles. But during those times, we did not see a sizable impact to cash collections. We are monitoring inflation in all of our markets, but so far, we haven't seen anything negative impacting our cash collections. From an investment perspective, we deployed $147 million in the quarter. One of our competitive advantages is that PRA makes PRA has as a leader and as an industry, is our global footprint and our ability to invest broadly across geographies. We leverage this footprint and choose the purchase portfolios in one geography as the market improves, while refraining as it declines in another. In the Americas, we invested $100 million during the quarter. In the US, we've seen similar volumes of marketed deals as compared to what we saw last year, but still down from pre-pandemic levels. On the competitive front, the competitor list remains consistent, but pricing has increased generally reflecting the current and past 24-month supply environment. In Europe, we invested $48 million during the quarter. And for some context, in Europe, Q1 is typically a seasonally slower quarter for us. However, similar to the US, we saw a stable competitor list, along with increased pricing, which we generally believe reflects supply dynamics over the past 24 months, but coupled with competitors investing reduced amounts during their deleveraging programs over that same time frame. I want to make a point, this level of competition is not what we saw in 2017 and into 2018 when sometimes half of the market at that time was turning for negative returns based on our analysis. Looking forward, we've been monitoring economic indicators in the US over the past few quarters, as I'm sure you have as well. Many of these indicators appear to point to higher NPL volumes at some point in the future, which we anticipate means an increase in sales volumes coming to market by end of 2022. Since our founding, we've taken a long-term view when evaluating which portfolio is the purchase and that's not changed. Given the record year we had last year, the prior year comparisons are tough, but we're performing in line with expectations. Total portfolio revenue was $237 million, with portfolio income of $208 million and changes in expected recoveries of $30 million. During the quarter, we collected $24 million in excess of our expected recoveries. We also wrote down one portfolio in Brazil, resulting in a $20 million NPV adjustment, changing our curve shape and reducing our estimated future collections. You will notice the non-controlling interest is in addition to net income this quarter, which reflects the portion of the write-down shared by our partners. It's important to note, Brazil has been a very profitable market for us. In fact, since we began investing in Brazil in 2015, our portfolio investments have significantly overperformed their underwritten curves even when including this write-down. Operating expenses were $169 million, a $10 million decrease from the first quarter of 2021. The effective tax rate for the first quarter was 12%, driven by some discrete items in the quarter. However, we still expect the full year tax rate to be in the low 20% range. Net income was $40 million, which generated $0.97 in diluted earnings per share for the quarter. Americas collections were $305 million, a decrease of $77 million from the first quarter of 2021. Purchases we've made over the last few years, particularly in Northern Europe and the UK are driving the growth in our European business. Regarding our performance versus our ERC projections, recall that for the past several quarters, we've been focused on adjusting our near-term curve projections to reduce the level of cash over performance. For the first quarter, our consolidated overperformance was 4%, with the US overperforming by 1% and Europe overperforming by 11%. Although this was a decline from the 68% cash efficiency ratio in the first quarter of last year, it's still a very strong number. Reiterating what Kevin said earlier, since the first quarter of 2019, our cash efficiency ratio has improved 590 basis points. So for the full year, we expect cash efficiency ratio between 62% and 63%. ERC at the end of the quarter was $5.7 billion, with 40% in the US and 52% in Europe. The decline from 2021 reflects the impact of lower buying, coupled with cash collections from a seasonally higher first quarter in the US. And based on the average purchase price multiples we've recorded this year, we would need to invest approximately $940 million over the same time frame to replace this runoff and maintain current ERC levels. I think this level is attainable, but it will be dependent on the normalization of the US market, we expect to happen during 2022. At the end of the quarter, we had $1.4 billion available under our credit facilities, $571 million of which was available to borrow after considering borrowing base restrictions. This refinancing has provided us with additional flexibility, a reduction of our borrowing costs and a covenant package that's more consistent with our North American credit facility. Additionally, in the last 12 months, we generated $1.3 billion of adjusted EBITDA. During the first quarter, we repurchased $39 million or approximately 860,000 shares of our common stock at an average price of $45.88 per share. At the end of the quarter, we had approximately $128 million of share repurchase authorization remaining. Combination of strong cash and financial performance, our conservative capital structure provide considerable flexibility as we prepare to fund higher levels of portfolio investments we believe are coming, as well as continuing to evaluate other opportunities to drive meaningful growth and incremental value for shareholders. Looking back, in 2020, we achieved a record $2 billion in cash collections and record cash efficiency ratio of 64.5%. And then in 2021, we again achieved multiple new records, cash collections, revenue, efficiency ratio and net income. We're able to learn a lot and innovate, but not only over the last two years, but over the last 25 years as a leader in the non-performing loan industry. We'll remain focused on our strategic objectives to expand products and market share, improving efficiency and modernizing collections, to be a trusted brand and to foster a high-performing workforce. Honestly, I'm excited because this is a great place to be, a debt buyer, with plenty of cash, strong balance sheet, tenured management and more than 25 years of operating experience. I'm excited about the much anticipated supply we believe is coming and while supply is not where we'd like it to be today, history teaches thus a simple lesson, more is coming. In the meantime, we'll continue to invest with discipline across our global footprint, maintain a strong balance sheet, pursue M&A as appropriate and opportunistically return capital to shareholders. So...\n That's the most popular words in the last couple of years, right? In Europe, your collection momentum seems to be pretty good, 11% outperformance. I can think of maybe Pete, would you want to jump in here, but perhaps another component of that is some of the geographies we invested in Europe have just longer flatter tails on the curves, such as the Nordics, that would be another example. Yes, again, I think we've been pretty programmatic since we started on this journey and all the conditions are still there that were there when we started, which is kind of, I think an attractive point in terms of buyback for us. And then on the tax rate, you mentioned that it will be in the low 20s for the full-year. Well, will obviously be higher than that in order to blend to a low 20s tax rate. But for the full year, we think we'll still be in that low 20s range. I just want o ask on the -- in your philosophy around accounting for finance receivables, in light of some of the conservatism you built in 2020 and 2021 with regards to over collections. No, I think we've been pretty consistent throughout time here in the sort of the early part of the pandemic when there was less certainty about what was going to happen in the future. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, over the last few quarters, we've been taking a look at the near-term curve and trying to sync that up with kind of our trending performance. But I think from where I sit, we'll continue to employ that same philosophy as we move through time and we'll see how performance develops over time. Well, I think it is probably a more normalized tax season than what we've seen in the last couple of years, particularly in comparison to the prior with a big stimulus payment going out to folks in the quarter last year. That coupled with what we believe was acceleration in prior years, particularly on smaller balance accounts, you would have had people pay out when they had liquidity last year. So on the capital allocation, if I can, I mean, you mentioned obviously buybacks of one thing. It does appear that you've now created an entirely new group for corporate development, maybe with the focus on M&A with cash component, right, joining recently. Yes, I think if you go back and listen to the last couple of calls, Kevin has been a little bit more excited about M&A than maybe he had been in the past. And it's always been an area of focus for us, but we had an opportunity to bring on board  really excited to have him join us. I worked with them previously and I know he's the right person to lead this effort for us as we begin to expand our focus a little bit more dramatically here in the near-term, looking at ways that we can drive meaningful growth and incremental value for shareholders. Next on the Brazilian portfolio, the NPV market, if I'm correct, that was a 2021 portfolio where ERC was reduced by about 30 million, the NPV is 20 million. Hey, well, thank you, operator and thank you, everyone for joining us this evening."
