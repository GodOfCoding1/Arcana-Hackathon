    "content": " We reported third quarter revenues of 178 million in-line with expectations and down 24% from the same period a year ago, driven by weak demand for microphones, partially offset by continued strength in the Precision Devices segment. We estimate gross margins for the fourth quarter to be approximately 36.5% to 38.5%, down 100 basis points sequentially, driven primarily by lower factory capacity utilization and a higher proportion of microphone sales in our audio segment, partially offset by benefits of the restructuring program announced in the third quarter. So first, on Hearing Health, I'm not prepared to give the exact number for Hearing Health, but I think we look at the data pretty regularly and I would sit there and say is, if you go back and I don't have the exact numbers in front of me, but if you go back to 2018 and we look we're going to finish in 2022, the Hearing Health business has been growing at a CAGR above 3% and that's through the pandemic, right. And I think again this will go probably into the first quarter as we try to work on inventory, but once this is done, I think we will pick up where we, kind of left off in terms of having the right mix, focusing on higher margin business with new products and we'll have a cost structure that fits that we think we can keep relatively full the whole year."
