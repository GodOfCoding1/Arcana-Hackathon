    "content": " As mentioned in our first full year 2021 earnings call, this past year has been a foundational year for eganelisib and Infinity as we prepare for eganelisib's first registrational study later this year and prioritize initiation of additional clinical studies and indications where eganelisib has the largest potential benefit for patients. And as highlighted in our previous guidance and later today, we are aggressively advancing development of a robust eganelisib MARIO-4 first registration study as well as MARIO-P platform program in other solid tumor indications. We're excited about the continued advancement of our eganelisib program to lay the foundation of initiation of potential future studies and in parallel, we will leverage eganelisib of unique mechanism of action and differentiated clinical data to evaluate and execute on the best path forward to maximize the value of eganelisib for both patients and shareholders."
