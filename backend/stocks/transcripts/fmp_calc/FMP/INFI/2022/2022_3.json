    "content": " In patients with PD-L1 negative tumors, we continue to see an improvement in median PFS with a median PFS of 7.3 months in MARIO-3 compared to 5.6 months in IMpassion130 as 30% relative improvement. Although the one-year PFS rate was not disclosed for the IMpassion130 PD-L1 negative population, it should be noted that the one-year PFS rate in MARIO-3 PD-L1 negative tumors, a subgroup with inferior outcomes with immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy, exceeds the 23.7 one-year PFS rate for the IMpassion130 ITT, which of course included patients with PD-L1 positive and negative tumors. In patients with PD-L1 positive tumors, we also observed evidence of potential long-term benefit with a one-year PFS rate of 37.5% compared to 29.1% in IMpassion130, a 29% relative improvement. In addition to the encouraging one-year PFS rate, we observed further evidence of anti-tumor activity of the eganelisib triplet in patients with PD-L1 positive tumors. Nonetheless, the one-year PFS rate, an indicator of potential long-term benefit, was very consistent across PD-L1 tumor status in MARIO-3, 37.5% in PD-L1 positive tumors and 34.7% in PD-L1 negative tumors. In summary, the almost one-year greater data maturity in MARIO-3 TNBC has provided us a new opportunity to gain insight into potential long-term benefit of the triplet regimen of eganelisib combined with atezolizumab and nab-paclitaxel with encouraging one-year progress-free survival rates across tumor PD-L1 status. Your line is open, please go ahead. Your line is open, please go ahead. Your line is open, please go ahead. And also, I mean regarding the TNBC question specifically, it's true we are seeing pretty consistent one-year PFS rates across PD-L1 negative and positive tumors, which certainly is very encouraging."
