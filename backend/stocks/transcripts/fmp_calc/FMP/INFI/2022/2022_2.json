    "content": " To achieve this goal, as we discussed on our most recent call last May, we are focused on expanding the clinical evaluation of eganelisib in additional solid tumors to maximize its value for patients and thereby for shareholders, and we are pursuing potential partnerships to enable this. Two, the clinical data with eganelisib have demonstrated prolonged progression-free survival and extended overall survival over current standards of care in multiple indications, including in a randomized controlled trial that allows us to see the distinct contribution of eganelisib over its combination drug partners. By the end of this year, we will also review updated PFS data from our MARIO-3 trial in frontline, triple negative breast cancer patients with both PD-L1 high and PD-1 low tumors, which meaningfully will be a full year more mature since our last data cut in October of 2021."
