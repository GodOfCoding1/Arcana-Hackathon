    "content": " For the second quarter of 2022, Veritone reported revenue of $34.2 million representing year-over-year growth of 78% on a GAAP basis and 2% on a pro forma basis. In the second quarter of 2022, GAAP revenue grew 78% year-on-year with strong growth in both Software Products & Services as well as our Managed Services. Within our Managed Services business, we saw strong year-on-year revenue growth as average gross billings per active customer grew 16% to a record $736,000. On one side, we continue to execute across our business with software customer growth of 42% year-over-year, record bookings up 199% year-over-year, customer gross retention in the high-90 percentiles and excluding Amazon, net customer retention well in excess of 120% year-over-year. Software Products & Services revenue increased $12.8 million or 229%, a Q2 record of $18.4 million, driven by the addition of PandoLogic coupled with year-over-year increases in our legacy solutions. Managed Services revenue grew $2.2 million or 16%, driven largely by growth in content licensing, which rose 42% year-over-year, driven by the overall increase in digital content usage and in live events coverage as we return to pre-COVID conditions. On a pro forma basis, Q2 2022 revenue was up 2% year-over-year driven by the 16% increase in Managed Services, offset by an 8% decline in Software Products & Services. During Q2, key customer metrics drove improvements across our Software Products & Services, including ending customers up 42%, customer gross retention in the high-90 percentile and net retention, excluding Amazon, up over 120%. On the positive side, Q2 2022, non-Amazon revenue and customer growth for PandoLogic was over 50% year-over-year. New bookings were $14.7 million, up 199% from pro forma Q2 2021, gross revenue retention in the high 90 percentiles, ending customers of 594, up 42% year-over-year on a pro forma basis. Q2 2022 non-GAAP gross profit reached $27.5 million, improving $13.6 million or 97% from Q2 of 2021. Gross margins expanded to 80% in Q2 2022, up compared to 73% in Q2 2021, both benefited from the entire quarter inclusion of PandoLogic as well as the year-over-year increase in software revenue from legacy Veritone services. On a pro forma basis, Software Products & Services totaled 54% of revenue in Q2 2022 versus 60% in Q2 2021 pro forma, driven by the year-over-year decline in Amazon. On a pro forma basis, the $7.2 million Q2 non-GAAP net loss compares to a $2.0 million non-GAAP net profit in Q2 2021, reflecting lower revenue and margin from Amazon in Q2 2022 coupled with a higher operating cost base. Our unencumbered cash at the end of Q2 2022 was approximately $157 million, which at today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s projected 2022 burn rate is sufficient to operate the existing business and support growth for the next 10 years plus. With that backdrop and a reminder that PandoLogic has significant revenue seasonality with the lowest consumption in the first half of the year and accelerating throughout the second half of the year, we expect Q3 2022 revenue to be between $34 million and $36 million, representing an approximate 54% increase year-over-year at the midpoint versus Q3 2021 GAAP and relatively flat versus Q3 2021 pro forma. We expect Q3 2022 non-GAAP net loss to be between $7 million and $6 million as compared to Q3 2021 non-GAAP net loss of $2.3 million, but slightly down versus Q2 2021 pro forma non-GAAP net income of $3.9 million reflecting the decline in Amazon, coupled with the stepped-up investments in people and infrastructure costs to support our near- and long-term growth. For full year 2022, we expect revenue to be between $150 million and $160 million representing a year-over-year increase of 35% at the midpoint on a GAAP basis and near 5% increase on a pro forma basis for 2022."
