    "content": " On a pro forma basis, our Q1 gross profit of $27.5 million increased $9.0 million or 48% versus Q1 2021, driven by the higher contribution from Software Products & Services, which totaled 53% of revenue in Q1 2022 versus 43% in Q1 2021. With that backdrop and the reminder that PandoLogic has significant revenue seasonality with the lowest hiring in the first half of the year and accelerating throughout the second half of the year, we expect Q2 2022 revenue to be between $38 million and $39 million, representing an approximate 100% increase year-over-year at the midpoint versus Q2 2022 GAAP and 15% versus Q2 2021 pro forma."
