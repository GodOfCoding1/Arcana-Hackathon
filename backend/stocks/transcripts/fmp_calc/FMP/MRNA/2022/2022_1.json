    "content": " But what we see with the $21 billion of signed APAs, we mentioned last quarter and it\u2019s the same this quarter, that $21 billion we think will be somewhat higher second half sales than first half. As David said, as we move into endemic, as we\u2019ve been saying, we\u2019ll have to discuss with payers as part of kind of health economics and value of products as it\u2019s done for every pharmaceutical product, especially in the U.S. And as you might be aware, CMS has already communicated that for fiscal year 2023, which starts in October 2022, the reimbursement for COVID-19 vaccine is going to be $60. Certainly, again, the $21 billion, we don\u2019t, right now, have included any contracts as a result of additional U.S. business, which we think is quite likely, we certainly believe there\u2019s a recognition of the need for boosters in the U.S. and the dialogue is quite active."
