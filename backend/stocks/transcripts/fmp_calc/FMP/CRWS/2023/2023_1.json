    "content": " First quarter net sales were $15.7 million, down from $18.7 million last year. Excluding the impact of the loan forgiveness and Carousel Designs, net income would have been $1.5 million or $0.15 per diluted share for the first quarter of last year. Net sales were $15.7 million for the first quarter of fiscal \u00e2\u0080\u009823 compared with $18.7 million for the first quarter of the prior year, a decrease of $3 million or 16%. Sales of bedding, blankets and accessories decreased by $2.5 million, which includes a decrease of $631,000 due to the closure of Carousel Designs in the first quarter of last year. Also during the current year period, our customers began to reduce their purchases as their inventories increased, which we believe resulted from customers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 excessive inventory purchases during the first quarter of calendar \u00e2\u0080\u009822 and consumers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 response to rising inflation. And as a result, we estimate that approximately $700,000 of sales were made in the fourth quarter of fiscal year \u00e2\u0080\u009822 that would have otherwise been made in the first quarter of fiscal year \u00e2\u0080\u009823. Gross profit increased by $497,000 and increased from 24.9% of net sales in the first quarter of the prior year to 32.8% of net sales for the current quarter. The increase in gross profit includes the effect of the closure of Carousel, which recognized a gross loss of $647,000 in the prior year period and included the sale of inventory below cost and the recognition of charges of $334,000 associated with the settlement of a commitment to a supplier and $265,000 associated with the liquidation of Carousel\u00e2\u0080\u0099s remaining inventory upon the closure of the business. Marketing and administrative expenses increased by $47,000 and increased from 18% of net sales in the first quarter of the prior year to 21.7% of net sales for the current year quarter. The provision for income taxes is based upon an annual effective tax rate on continuing operations, which was 23.5% in the current year quarter and 19.2% in the prior year. The effective tax rate from continuing operations, combined with the effect of the discrete income tax items, resulted in an overall provision for income taxes of 24.5% for the current year quarter and 18.6% for the prior year quarter."
