    "content": " Third quarter net income was $1.3 million or $0.13 per diluted share, compared with $2.4 million or $0.24 per diluted share last year. Excluding the impact of the loan forgiveness and Carousel Designs, prior year-to-date net income would have been $6.3 million or $0.63 per diluted share. Although our inventory remains a little high at $25.8 million at the end of the quarter compared with $24.5 million at the end of December 2021, we were able to reduce our inventory levels during the third quarter, a period in which we typically see an increase in inventory as we approach Chinese New Year. As Olivia mentioned, net sales were $19 million for the third quarter of fiscal \u00e2\u0080\u009923, compared with $22.7 million for the third quarter of the prior year, a decrease of $3.7 million or 16.4%. Net sales decreased to $53.4 million for the first nine months of fiscal '23 compared with $61.7 million for the same period in the prior year, a decrease of $8.2 million or 13.4%. Gross profit decreased by $1.8 million, but increased from 27.4% of net sales for the prior year nine-month period to 28.3% of net sales for the same period in the current year. The decrease in the gross profit amount is associated with the decline in sales during the period and is net of the positive impact of the closure of Carousel, which in the prior year nine-month period recognized a gross loss of $689,000 as a result of the closure of the business in the first quarter of fiscal \u00e2\u0080\u009822. Marketing and administrative expenses decreased by $352,000, but increased from 13.6% of net sales for the prior year quarter to 14.4% of net sales for the current year quarter. Marketing and administrative expenses decreased by $733,000, but increased from 15.6% of net sales for the prior year nine-month period to 16.6% of net sales for the same period in the current year."
