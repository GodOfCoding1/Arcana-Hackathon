    "content": " The CNH team's creativity, hard work, and strong execution resulted in company records for both adjusted net income, up $2 billion for the year, and adjusted earnings per share, at $1.46, up 14% over 2021. For the full-year, gross profit was up $989 million or up 140 basis points from 2021 largely driven by strong price realization coming from all regions and better product mix, including margin-rich technology-related sales growing by about 32%. But overall, I mean I think a lot of what we are seeing -- we didn't expect it, but the Lula election in Brazil really caused a lot of pause for farmers in a region, and that has been so good for us, and we expect it to be, but it's taken, I would call it a ,\"Pause,\" in orders there. I think some markets will get back to reasonable levels of inventory, but I don't like -- I mean we want to be -- our goal, our intent is to make sure as we manage and protect our own cash flow that we do the same for our dealers, and so that takes discipline to do, and that's the discipline that we are going to have as we go through this. So, I think the end of the year inventories aren't really telling great stories, especially in North American market, where that was significant, but overall, we feel like there is just a tremendous opportunity for us to keep our factories running and produce for retails customers at this point, and possibly at the end of the year, start to get dealer inventories back, when I say, \"Back up,\" it means it's up to acceptable levels, not up to historical levels."
