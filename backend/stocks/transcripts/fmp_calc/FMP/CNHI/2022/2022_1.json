    "content": " Adjusted EBIT of $429 million, up $36 million from Q1 2021, with an adjusted EBIT margin of 10.3%, down 30 basis points versus first quarter last year on the back of higher sales and higher R&D expenses. Agricultural adjusted EBIT increased $27 million with a margin of 12.6%, driven by favorable mix and price realization with positive contribution for the Americas, partially offset by higher raw material and freight costs and growing R&D expenses. Higher volumes in Construction Equipment led to adjusted EBIT of $32 million with a margin of 4%, thanks to favorable volume mix and positive price realization, partially offset by higher production costs."
