    "content": " Adjusted EBIT in the quarter was $24 million, with a 2.7% EBIT margin, benefiting from strong sales in North America and considerable contributions from Sampierana acquisition, which is still constrained by -- but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s still constrained by supply chain disruptions. Adjusted EBIT came in at $670 million, up $250 million from the third quarter of 2021, with a corresponding EBIT margin of 12.4%, up 270 basis points versus the third quarter of last year. This $251 million increase, a 60% improvement year-over-year was driven by both favorable pricing and higher volumes, partially offset by higher production cost and SG&A, and of course, R&D expenses. For our Financial Services business, net income was $86 million, down $10 million compared to the third quarter last year, mainly because of lower margins in North America, increased overheads, and normalized risk cost. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. I have $1\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\n \u00e2\u0080\u00a6$1.12, but so\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\n So $0.32 in the fourth quarter with revenue up, I am just trying to say, I mean, you have like revenues up $243 million and it looks like you are trying to imply the margins for the fourth quarter at something like 8.5%, or said another way, revenues up $250-ish million sequentially, but earnings down, EBIT almost $200 million. Your line is open."
