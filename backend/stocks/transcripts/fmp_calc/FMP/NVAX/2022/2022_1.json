We had a landmark start to 2022, reporting today a major milestone for Novavax, our first ever profitable quarter as a commercial stage company, recording $203 million in net income and $704 million in total revenue. We ended the first quarter of 2022 with $1.6 billion in cash and had accounts receivable of over $400 million, which positions us well as we continue our global launch of Nuvaxovid. So we're optimistic about the data inputs that we're getting already where the vaccine has been in the...\n Do you think that, I'll call it, prescribers are aware of and have growing understanding of the kind of relative clinical, as well as logistics profile and that may or may not give an advantage in, say, a future booster campaign? The full year guidance was on - how much of that $4 billion to $5 billion, the guidance you issued today has the U.S. product sales included in there either as users primary vaccine series, in adults, adolescent or as boosters, it would be helpful to get some color on that."
