    "content": " Excluding merger-related expenses of $3.5 million this quarter, pre-tax, our net income for Q3 would have been $31.3 million or $0.48 -- $0.46 a share, resulting in ROA, ROE and ROTCE of 1.21%, 11.36% and 15.25%, respectively. Third quarter net interest income was consistent with prior quarter as improvements in interest income related to higher rates in our organic loan growth quarter-on-quarter, which totaled $160 million, representing a 9% annualized growth rate was offset by a similar increase in interest expense on deposit pricing to fund expected balance sheet growth and advantageous prices. On the deposit side, total deposits decreased $176 million or 2% for the quarter, as we undertook an initiative to lock in longer term certificate of deposits early in the third quarter in anticipation of continued interest rate increases and market interest rates during the remainder of the year. Q3 financial results were favorably impacted by organic loan growth of $160 million, deployment of investment portfolio cash flows into higher yielding assets and the increase in interest rates, all combining to increase yields on our interest earning assets by 29 basis points for the quarter. On the balance sheet, in comparison to the prior quarter, total assets increased $141 million or 1.4%, with the loan portfolio increasing $160.2 million or 2.2%, while investment securities decreased $77 million, as cash flows were used to fund the loan growth."
