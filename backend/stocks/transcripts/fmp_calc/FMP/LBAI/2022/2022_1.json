    "content": " Non-interest income increased $900,000 to $6.8 million versus the trailing quarter due to higher gain on sales on residential mortgages and SBA loans due to the addition of the 1st Constitution business lines. Non-interest income for 2022 is expected to be approximately $7 million to $8 million per quarter, down from prior forecasts due to the increased interest rates negatively impacting our expanded residential mortgage secondary marketing and the SBA loan origination capacity acquired in the 1st Constitution merger."
