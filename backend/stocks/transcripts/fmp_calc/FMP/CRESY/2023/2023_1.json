    "content": " Related to real estate, this quarter we were able to acquire a farm in Brazil, close to 11,000 hectares from those net of 5,500 acres of arable land and in some sales not in the first quarter but in later, we are seeing a lot of movement related to the real estate in the selling. Related to the Urban business, we are going to see some small pictures related to IRSA that closed a very good quarter, mainly related to the rental properties, mainly to the shopping centers that they were recovering a lot comparing to the 2019 numbers before pandemia. Comparing I think next year Brazil will show past Argentine size, because Brazil bought some new land and rented more new land from cattle to grain, but comparable sizes in the two countries much smaller between Bolivia and Paraguay, keeping this breakdown of crops, mainly soybeans and corn first two, sugarcane being the third. Then after the quarter, we received \u00e2\u0080\u0093 we are receiving this week $24.5 million more of Brasilagro and also IRSA paid dividends for first time in the last year."
