    "content": " Gross sales were $23.8 billion, down $12 million or 34% from a year ago, excluding the impact of a onetime $8.7 billion venerable sale in the prior year quarter. Quarter end assets under management of $647 billion declined 12%, both year-over-year and sequentially, an average AUM of $689 billion was down 5% year-over-year and 8% sequentially. Sales of $3.3 billion were down from prior comparison periods, both of which had large onetime sales, the Venerable sale last year and the $9.6 billion Target Date sale in this year's first quarter. In Private Wealth, gross sales decreased 8% compared to the prior year periods with net outflows of $1.2 billion, driven primarily by capital gains, tax-related withdrawals on 2021 business sales. Total compensation and benefits expense decreased 7% in the second quarter versus the prior year period, reflecting lower AUM-driven revenues and performance fees as well as a lower compensation ratio of 48% of adjusted net revenues as compared with 48.5% in the prior year period. Speaking of Equitable, one year post announcement of our $10 billion private markets partnership, we continue to make progress, working together across both organizations to expand AB's existing strategies and launch new strategies towards meeting Equitable's general account needs and deployment goals."
