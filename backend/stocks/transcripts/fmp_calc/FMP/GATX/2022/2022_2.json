Here, we think there's enough freight on the sidelines and we hear this from our shipper customers that we think an improvement in rail service would really just result in more freight on the network and would continue to underpin strong railcar demand. Your line is open. In Europe, the backlog for railcars in terms of time is pushed out a bit, but it's still manageable and we're still expecting that we'll meet our targets in terms of what we expect to add for railcars in both North America and Europe this year. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. As I said, we've already done close to $140 million, $150 million of spot investment this year and that's with customers whose demand and need was significant enough that they're willing to sign up to a lease that preserves GATX's attractive economic return on that investment. Well, the first thing I would say is, I don't think we ever felt any euphoric, we need cars at any cost type of feel from our customers over the last -- course of the last couple of years as the market improved."
