    "content": " I was hoping you guys would talk about how you perfect the balance between taken advantage of a very strong secondary market without risking having your core and lease revenues being challenged in the long term, especially as -- I guess if you would have to maintain a similar lease revenue level, you would have to tap into the secondary market or newly manufactured railcars, which are also very elevated. And I think if I look back over the course of the last 20 years, there's probably maybe one or two rare instances where GATX read guidance in the first quarter. So we're making new termination in various car types of where we think we should be on the term spectrum and over the course of the last three, really six months, we've seen more and more instances where it makes sense to go out longer and we've been successful in doing that."
