The consistency of traffic for the year, across the month of the quarter, I think that's the thing that we look at really closely that gives us a lot of evidence that even as shopping habits have changed and category trends have changed, we've seen a consistent drag to more and more shoppers, shop in our stores, and shopping us online. You may go ahead. You may go ahead. You may go ahead. You may go ahead. You may go ahead. You may go ahead."
