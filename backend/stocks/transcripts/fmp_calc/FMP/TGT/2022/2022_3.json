    "content": " And today, based on all that hard work in preparation, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m happy to report that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re entering the holiday season in a very healthy staffing position, reflecting our success in hiring throughout the year, the significant wage investments we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve made throughout the country, an increase in the number of team members who are looking to pick up extra hours and an 18% increase in applicants for seasonal positions compared with a year ago. Underlying the sales expectation, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re planning for softer discretionary category comps than we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen in the last two quarters, partially offset by the benefit of continued strong growth in our frequency businesses. You may go ahead. You may go ahead. You may go ahead. You may go ahead. You may go ahead. You may go ahead. You may go ahead."
