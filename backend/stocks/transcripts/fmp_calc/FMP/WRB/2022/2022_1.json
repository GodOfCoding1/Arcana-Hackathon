    "content": " But let me save you the work and the numbers I am going to read off are over the past couple of years for the first quarter what the paid loss ratio was and I want to give it to you for the corresponding periods because that way we are getting as close to apples-to-apples as possible, though it\u2019s not a perfect comparison because of mix of business, et cetera. I think that benefit is going to be coming more and more into focus over the coming quarters and years, and quite frankly, I think it was a few quarters ago, we talked about how, quite frankly, if rates move up, we didn\u2019t think that we were getting paid enough by taking the duration out. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. And the reason I ask is, because when you talk about that rate versus loss trend in excess of 100 basis points, I think, it\u2019s pretty close to what you said last couple of quarters as well. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. Your line is now open."
