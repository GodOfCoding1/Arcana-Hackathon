    "content": " That having been said, our discipline remains with our renewal retention ratio remaining at approximately 80% and we're getting a bit of a premium on new business relative to our existing portfolio, which as we've discussed in the past, we think makes sense, because you know more about your renewal book than your new book. As we get to start to think that maybe rates are peaking or close to the peak, we're going to think about duration a little bit differently perhaps, but at the moment, we think there's still a bit of runway ahead of us. Second question is more of a follow-up to the first set of questions from Elyse, when you talked about receivables returns and volatility activity into the property cat, I don't think I understood what you meant in your second answer when you said more, when we're asking --\n That must be being a wise ask what's the problem --\n You know, I know, I know, yes. And it's a similar story on the reinsurance front, where, again, we have the ability to flex, but just demonstrating through action, if you will, we have not found the pricing to be particularly attractive until as of late, and it will likely become even more attractive, which is why if you look at sort of where our growth is and what's happened in the third quarter, it was really some recent opportunity for us to try and take advantage of a changing market, and you may see more of that. I get that it's one-time in nature, but it's just interesting, like every quarter, this pluses and minuses, it's always very, very de minimis one way or another in Berkley, I'm guessing you had that observation too about this quarter, and it's the first time that I think I've seen more than $10 million of favorable unfavorable. Hey, good evening, Rob. Hey, good evening, Rob."
