    "date": "2022-11-14 21:52:02",
    "content": " Our third quarter gross profit margin includes approximately $2 million or 4% of revenue and non-cash charges associated with the write-down and accelerated depreciation of discontinued product lines, primarily our Reflect line. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter improved to a $5.4 million loss from a $13.3 million loss in the same period of 2021, driven by improved volume and demand as well as the reduction in operating expenses and improvements in gross profit margin I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve just discussed. Net working capital at the end of the quarter was $26.9 million, and we used approximately $12.5 million in cash in the third quarter, which included the $3.4 million of one-time reorganization costs just discussed. In connection with this placement, the two shareholders subscribing to this issuance have also irrevocably committed to backstopping any future rights offering occurring by the company in the next 12 months in the amount of $1 million in the aggregate and a shortfall, if any, between the maximum anticipated gross proceeds under the private placement and the actual gross proceeds amounts received by the company upon closing."
