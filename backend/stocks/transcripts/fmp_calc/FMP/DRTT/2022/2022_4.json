    "content": " Similarly, adjusted gross profit margin, which excludes the impact of depreciation, increased 670 basis points from 25.3% in the fourth quarter of 2021 to 32% in the fourth quarter of 2022. Adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter improved to $600,000 from a $9.7 million loss in the period of 2021 and a loss of $5.4 million during the third quarter of 2022 despite approximately 15% lower volumes in both comparable periods. We believe that the combination of growth in our sales pipeline, the improved margins from pricing actions already taken and the reduced cost structure will set us up well to deliver year-over-year growth in revenue, gross margin and adjusted EBITDA during 2023. Benjamin, do you want... Greg, yes, just to add further to Brad's comments, I think it's very representative of what the opportunity is there for us that if we can break even at these revenue numbers, that means that as we continue to increase conversion rates and organically add growth in the pipeline, the ability to handle that additional capacity isn't around retooling, it's more around adding additional ships and whatnot to satisfy that. And so year-over-year growth, not saying we're going to be there that fast, but we do have, by adding and diversifying our construction partners in markets which were under-serviced previously, that applied with strategic channels for additional top line revenue growth that had previously not been entertained is also opening up some windows to revenue that we, in the past, weren't able to actually even participate in."
