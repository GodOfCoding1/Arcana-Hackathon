    "content": " Although our shipments in aerospace and defense end-use market were approximately 50% of pre-pandemic levels when comparing the 12 months ending March 2022 to the 12 months ending March 2020, we see demand continue to accelerate across all the aerospace submarkets as the supply chain ramps to meet steadily increasing travel demand. The tailwind from higher sales both sequentially and year-over-year was partially offset by operational challenges that we worked through early in the quarter related to the press outage in SAO's Reading facility as well as the ongoing inflationary pressures on operating costs, related to critical production supplies, freight and labor. When normalizing for this benefit, SG&A expenses are down $4.7 million from a year ago, largely due to additional costs in last year's third quarter associated with implementing our new ERP system. When excluding the impact of special items, adjusted operating loss was $1.6 million in the current quarter compared to a loss of $29.7 million in the prior year period and a loss of $29.8 million in our recent second quarter."
