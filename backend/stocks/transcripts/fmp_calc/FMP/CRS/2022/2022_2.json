    "content": " SG&A expenses were $44.6 million in the second quarter, up $2.4 million from the same period a year ago, and essentially flat sequentially. When excluding the impact of special items, adjusted operating loss was $29.8 million in the current quarter compared to a loss of $32.3 million in the prior year period and a loss of $17.5 million in our recent first quarter. Net sales for the second quarter were $330.8 million, or $251.6 million, excluding surcharge, matching the sales ex surcharge results from the second quarter of last year on a 12% increase in volumes. The same quarter a year ago, SAO's operating loss was $11.6 million; and in the first quarter of this fiscal year, SAO reported an operating loss of $5.9 million. Net sales in the second quarter of fiscal year 2022 were $85.7 million or $83.8 million, excluding surcharge. In the second quarter of fiscal year 2022, we spent $19 million on capital expenditures. As we move through the fiscal year, we currently expect that the full year capital expenditures will be in the range of $100 million to $110 million, given some delays in projects due to the availability of outside contractors as well as extended lead times for certain materials. While the results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2022 were impacted by near-term operational challenges, we believe they are short term in nature and won't impact our ability to serve our customers and drive growth over the long term."
