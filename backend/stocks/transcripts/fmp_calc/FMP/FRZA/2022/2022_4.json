    "content": " As we push forward, Forza X1 has entered the testing phase for several of our electric products, specifically our electric outboard motors, which are being water tested on almost a daily basis with several of our electric boats that include our FX-1 which is the red multi hull you've seen, our deck boat and our newest model to be electrified our 22-foot center console monohull. As we get closer to commercialization of our products, it's clear that electric boats must offer consumers a comparable boating experience to internal combustion engines, also known as ice motors in terms of price and performance. We believe that recreational day boats powered by electric outboard motors with run times of six hours, speeds of 20 to 30 knots, and up to 50 miles of use with a single charge will be the transformative performance specs required by consumers to ignite the demand for recreational electric day boats. So with that being said, our goal is that we're doing a media day in the next 60 days, which will be kind of a coming out, hey, here's our boats and we're going to invite the media, can investors, people that put deposits down and really start to showcase our products on a national level. I mean there's 20 companies out there that are kind of small batch producers, but we don't know of any other company that's kind of put a stake in the ground and said, we're going to build the infrastructure to be that company that's going to mass produce electric boats, up to 1000 units annually."
