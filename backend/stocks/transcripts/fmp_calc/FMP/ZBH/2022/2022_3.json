    "content": " First, I'm going to briefly talk about our Q3 performance and really the momentum that we saw in Q3 that has allowed us to increase our outlook for the year and doing so, even in the face of some pretty meaningful macro pressures that we're certainly still facing. I'm just going to call it the innovation flywheel here at ZB is really moving in the right direction, and it's creating a solid pipeline that importantly is translating into moving our Vitality Index north and that continues to move north for us and we expect to continue to do that on a go-forward basis. But based on what I'm seeing today, I expect there to be a four handle in that range which may or may not sound like a lot to people looking at Medtech, but to us knowing where we started that's a pretty significant step-up from where we started the journey and we're proud of it. Because just because you're in a fast-growth market, if you don't have a good asset you don't necessarily get the growth rate out of it and it's got to accelerate our EPS growth over time because that's kind of the vetting. And just as I think about the components that you're talking about between VBP and pricing and ASCs, et cetera, it just seems like the environment for hips and knees specifically is going to get more robust or really levered two Hips and Knees."
