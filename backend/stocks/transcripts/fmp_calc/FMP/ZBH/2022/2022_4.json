    "content": " Inside of this, we saw another positive quarter of year-over-year momentum in large joints with our overall global hip and knee business growing more than 8% and 10% on an ex-FX basis, and our overall set category grew in the high single digits driven by strong performance in our business growth drivers, which as we said before, are supports, CMFT, and upper extremities, as well as the expected tailwind from BBP comps in our trauma business. Against this backdrop, our expectations for the full year \u00e2\u0080\u009923 financial outlook are reported revenue growth in the range of 1.5% to 3.5% versus 2022, an expected foreign currency exchange headwind of approximately 150 basis points resulting in revenue growth of 3% to 5% on a constant currency basis, and adjusted diluted earnings per share in the range of $6.95 to $7.15. Yes, I think one of the key drivers is obviously going to be revenue growth, right, so if we continue to navigate the challenges around supply as we have been and as we saw in the fourth quarter, if we continue to see stabilization in the market and start to trend towards the upper half of the range, clearly that will help drive some margin expansion as we continue to leverage our overall cost base. As we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re building our that commercial channel, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s one of those things you really need in your bag to attract talent to that commercial channel, so it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s important to us but I wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t look at that as a significant or a material impact to the year, only in the sense that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to be able to bring that channel in place and get good momentum in sports overall. Katie, can we go to the next question in the queue? Katie, can we go to the next question in the queue? Katie, can we go to the next question in the queue?"
