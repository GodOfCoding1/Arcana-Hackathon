Before we conclude today's call, I'll provide some important cautions regarding the forward-looking statements made by management during the call. I'd like to remind everyone that today's call will be recorded, and it will be made available for telecom replay for the instructions in yesterday's press release, which is available in the Investor Relations section of the company's website. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Consolidated Water Company's CEO, Rick McTaggart. As you saw in our earnings release issued yesterday evening, our first quarter of 2022 showed great improvements across three of our four business segments, specifically our retail, bulk and services segment. Unfortunately, the results of our manufacturing segment came in below last year's level, largely due to adverse global economic conditions, including, but not limited to, increasing raw materials prices, increasing human resource costs, tight labor markets and extended and unexpected delays in the procurement and delivery of raw materials and equipment. However as I mentioned, we made strong progress in other areas of our business that bodes well for our future results. This top line growth helped increase net income from continuing operations attributable to our stockholders by 79%, reaching $2.3 million or $0.15 per share. Our Retail segment revenue increased by $602,000 which, was a result of increased tourism activity due to the easing of travel restrictions to Grand Cayman for vaccinated travellers, which occurred earlier this year. Our Bulk segment, revenue increased by $1.1 million and Bulk segment operating income increased by $638,000. Our operating -- sorry our Services segment revenue increased by $1.2 million, with operating income up for that segment by $231,000. The first award was to our California-based subsidiary, PERC Water to design an advanced wastewater recycling facility in Goodyear, Arizona. We believe our in-house manufacturing capabilities also provided us a competitive advantage in our recent bid for project to design, build and operate a new 2.64 million gallon per day seawater desalination plant in Georgetown, Grand Cayman. Earlier this week, we announced that we were awarded this project, which we expect to generate about $20 million in revenue over the 11.5-year term of the contract. Winning this contract was the result of our many years of experience designing, building and operating some of the most energy-efficient seawater desalination plants in the world, and we believe the energy efficiency that we bid was key in our win for this project. We believe desalination is key to alleviating global water scarcity and especially in the arid Southwestern United States, where they need to take immediate steps to diversify their shrinking water sources by implementing drought-proof water resources like desalination. Water scarcity is also a pressing international concern according to the World Data Labs Water Scarcity Clock, 2.4 billion people are currently living in water-deficient regions, and experts predict that this will reach $2.7 billion by 2030. Now before I talk more about our progress across our business segments and the outlook for 2022, I'd like to turn the call over to David, who will take us through the financial details for the quarter. Yesterday, we issued our earnings release for the first quarter of 2022, which you can find in - the Investors section of our website. Looking back over the quarter, we were encouraged by the return of tourism to the Cayman Islands, the ARC and the improvements we showed in two of our other business segments. We reported revenue totaled $19.6 million in the first quarter of 2022, an increase of 14% from the same year ago period. The growth reflects increases of $602,000 in our Retail segment revenue, $1.1 million in our Bulk segment revenue and $1.2 million in our Services segment revenue. This was partially offset by a decrease of $455,000 in Manufacturing segment revenue. As Rick mentioned, the increase in our retail revenue was due to the resumption of tourism to the Cayman Islands last quarter. This generated an 8% increase in the volume of water sold by Cayman Water subsidiary, and we would hope and expect that over the course of 2002, we will continue to report increases in the volume of water sold by our Retail segment when you compare it to 2021 and 2020. And eventually, we expect the tourism levels on Grand Cayman to -- return to normalcy, we use on or that will be hopefully sooner rather than later. The increase in Bulk segment revenue is attributable to the higher energy pass-through charges to our customer, the Water and Sewage Corporation in the Bahamas, which were caused by higher cost for electricity and fuel that we used to power our desalination plant. Net income attributable to Consolidated Water stockholders for the first quarter of 2022, which includes the results of discontinued operations was $1.7 million or $0.11 per basic and fully diluted share. This was up a net income of $989,000 or $0.06 per share in the first quarter of 2021. Moving from our results of operations to our balance sheet, our accounts receivable balances related to our CW Bahamas business amounted to $21.2 million as of the March 31, 2022. And historically, all delinquent accounts receivable from the Water and Sewage Corporation have been paid in full to us, including the interest we charge on those receivables. In February of this year, we received a payment schedule from Bahamas government pursuant to which the government plans to reduce CW Bahamas delinquent accounts receivables over the course of 2022 with the attention of eventually bringing all CW Bahamas' receivables from the Water and Sewage Corporation to current status. As I mentioned earlier, we were awarded a contract in January by the city of Port St. Lucie, Florida, to replace membrane elements and upgrade equipment at the city's 20 MGD J.E. During the quarter, we continued to diversify our manufactured products, customer base and leverage our sales teams across our four business segments. Our in-house manufacturing expertise and capabilities gave us a significant competitive advantage in our bid for the just awarded Red Gate seawater desalination plant, an advantage we can utilize in future bids for contracts across all of our business segments. And during the quarter, we took steps to aggressively pursue potential new projects and business. Activity in PERC's primary markets for infrastructure, construction contracts and operations agreements has picked up and PERC is currently pursuing more than a dozen potential design build projects and operations contracts. We believe PERC CDR process provides us with a unique competitive advantage as it gives the customer guaranteed solution for the water problems at a guaranteed maximum price, resulting in the most cost efficient - cost-effective and efficient methodology for addressing their water treatment and reuse need. And you can go on PERC's website, may talk more about the CDRs and provide more detail. Earlier, I mentioned PERC had won a major contract in January to design an advanced water reuse facility in the city of Goodyear, Arizona. The new facility will help our client to provide additional reclaimed water for other beneficial uses such as irrigation, which will offset and consider millions of gallons of potable water for human consumption and domestic purposes. Our plans to expand our service revenues and the wastewater reuse market, is supported by our strong balance sheet and a growing pipeline of potential projects. Looking at Cayman the Cayman Islands, we are very encouraged by the return of tourism to the Cayman Islands as -- the country's reopening plan continues. As David mentioned, we expect the resurgence of tourism to help our retail water sales return to normal levels over time as hotels and businesses continue to serve the thousands of tourists and vacationers that are returning to the Cayman Islands. Now turning to our Bahamas operations, as many of you know, our CW Bahamas operations through our client the Water and Sewage Corporation of the, Bahamas supplies as the majority of the piped water on the island of New Providence Bahamas, which includes NASA, the Bahama's largest city and political capital and commercial hub. New Providence is also the most populous island in the Bahamas with about 275,000 residents or 70% of the country's population. We anticipate our bulk business will continue its stable and profitable performance and with the return of tourism to the Bahamas and the resulting significant increase in economic activity, we now see new potential opportunities to expand that business as water demand grows in New Providence and in the family Islands. Given the overall strong progress in our first quarter, we remain very optimistic about the future of Consolidated Water. We offer our customers decades of experience and excellent track record and efficient and cost-effective approaches to designing, building and operating both seawater desalination facilities and wastewater treatment and recycling plants. Combined with our strong financial position, low-cost operating structure and inherent synergies between our 4 operating segments, we believe we enjoy numerous competitive advantages as we pursue new opportunities in growing markets. So to get back however, recognize that the changes that the government made to travel - easing travel restrictions and that sort of thing we made sort of halfway through the quarter, first quarter. And then you talked about the Bahamas as well, maybe higher volumes coming through there or a higher - more of an opportunity, I'm not sure exactly how you phrased it. The Windsor plant, which was the sort of newest one there, we have a little bit of additional capacity, I think that we could get out of that by doing some modifications. But once they get past that level, then you're talking about building new plants and that sort of thing. Yes, I mean we don't have all the details because we're not distributing the water on the island. But I can tell you just anecdotally, I mean, I was there at the beginning of March to one of the bigger hotels, and I mean the place was ramped packed looking - seems like there's a big return of tourists to the Bahamas they don't have any sort of quarantine restrictions and -- it's just sort of a reciprocal deal where you got to have a COVID test before you go there and then before you come back to the U.S. Final question, the DBO Cayman Islands 2.64 million gallons, 11.5 years, I think you said about $20 million? And so that will show up as manufacturing revenue -- excuse me, construction revenue in our services segment. And then on the construction side, 18 months, is this sort of percentage of completion accounting, how does that -- well I know it's not exactly $20 million because you have the service side. So actually, we don't -- the percentage of completion methodology is no longer allowed under GAAP with their new revenue - but they have something -- we use something very similar to it called the inputs method. And as the work progresses, and we incur costs, we'll be recognizing revenue and gross profit\n Got it, okay that's it from me. There's, other opportunities that are more sort of exotic quasi PPP opportunities that we're looking at in the Southwest U.S. And I'll be honest with you, I mean, there's not a lot of M&A opportunities out there, but we haven't forgotten about it, but we're focused quite a bit on managing the growth in our existing business with PERC. From the standpoint of the Mexico litigation, I mean, that's something that's ongoing. And John, we disclosed in our 10-K that the legal fees will be meaningful, substantial, it's not cheap to run this I truck , I mean we hired what we believe to be an excellent law firm, one of the best in the world of doing this. And we think it's money well spent given what we know about the litigation, the arbitration, whatever. But we'll have to spend some money to take this through the four-year process, it typically requires. So I mean, we will be spending - you'll see - our estimate is, to well, we haven't provided an estimate - let me just say that it will - these revenue will be material to our results of operations. Yes, I'd just like to thank everybody again for joining us this morning, and I look forward to speaking with you again in August when we release our second quarter results and holding an investor call.
