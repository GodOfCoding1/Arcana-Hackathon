    "content": " Our sales in the third quarter were $994 million, up 14% year-over-year and down 2% sequentially on a pro forma basis. As expected, gross margin was negatively impacted by a purchase accounting inventory markup of $62 million related to the inventory that came with CMC as it came on to our balance sheet at fair market value or essentially the selling price. While FX had a minimal impact on gross margin in the third quarter, FX impacted the other income expense line as it did in Q2, resulting in $11 million expense in Q3 or approximately $0.05 to non-GAAP EPS. On a reported basis, non-GAAP EPS of $0.85 per share was down 8% year-over-year and down 15% sequentially, driven by the more than $70 million increase in interest expense, a higher combined tax rate and the higher share count. The second factor is in fact the impact of the expected divestiture of the PIM business, which we expect to close in late November, and that will have a negative impact of about $10 million sequentially Q4 over Q3."
