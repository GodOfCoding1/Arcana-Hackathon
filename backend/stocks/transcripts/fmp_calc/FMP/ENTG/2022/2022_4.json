    "content": " We estimate our sales growth was approximately 800 basis points above the market growth for the year on a pro forma basis, this above market growth was driven in large part by a strong position at the leading edge technology nodes, led by solutions like liquid filtration, selective edge, gas purification systems and advanced deposition materials, solutions which are of growing importance to our customers and technology road map. To start for the full year 2023, relying largely on discussions with our customers and using third party estimates, we expect the market, based on a combination of our units and CapEx mix, to be down approximately 13%. The actual impact in the fourth quarter was closer to $40 million, and we expect that our sales will continue to be impacted in 2023 by these restrictions but to a significant lesser degree, at approximately $20 million per quarter, the impact of these restrictions is already factored into our expectations for 2023. Onto our results for Q4, our sales in the fourth quarter were $946 million, up 1% year-over-year on a pro forma basis and down 5% sequentially. So I think things will stabilize, and we expect a number of new products linked to some of the node transitions in the back half of the year to help both in terms of growth and in terms of margin potential for the business."
