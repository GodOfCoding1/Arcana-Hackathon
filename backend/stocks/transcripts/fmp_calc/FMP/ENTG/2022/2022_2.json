    "content": " Growth was particularly strong in several unit-driven product lines of increasing strategic importance to our customers, including liquid filtration, advanced deposition materials and selective edge chemistries, which in the aggregate were up 24% year-to-date. Moving on to some very high-level comments on sales results for CMC Materials third fiscal quarter, excluding revenue from the exited wood treatment business, total revenue for CMC Materials was up approximately 11% year-on-year and up 3% sequentially in the quarter. Putting it all together on a pro forma basis, excluding CMC's wood treatment business, we expect revenue for the combined company to exceed $4 billion and grow in excess of 16% in calendar 2022. Going now to more of a calendar year perspective, I would expect the CMC \u00e2\u0080\u0093 the legacy CMC Materials platform to be up in the second half of the year versus the first half of the year to the tune of 4% to 5%, which is pretty much in line with how we would expect the legacy Entegris platform to behave as well. I think it really boils down to \u00e2\u0080\u0093 I mean, we've got really strong product positions on the wafer handling side of things that go into fabs, specifically the food market where our share is depending on how you measure it, 80% or 90%, I mean, we rarely lose a new FOUP opportunity."
