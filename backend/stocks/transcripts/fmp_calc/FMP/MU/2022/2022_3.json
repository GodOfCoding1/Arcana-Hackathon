    "content": " Fiscal 2021\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 55 to 45 revenue split in favor of the more mature mobile, PC and consumer markets is expected to shift, by fiscal 2025, to a 38 to 62 split in favor of the higher growth data center, auto, industrial, networking and graphics markets. Due to weaker demand in the second half of calendar 2022, we now expect year-over-year calendar 2022 industry bit demand growth to be below the long-term CAGRs of mid-to-high-teens percentage for DRAM and high-20s percentage for NAND. So, we will be using this inventory in fiscal year \u00e2\u0080\u009823 and of course, continue to adjust our plans as necessary on the CapEx and front-end wafer technology ramps, et cetera, to bring balance into demand and supply, and which is what I pointed out earlier that overall, the combination of our inventory as well as new production growth that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s how we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re positioned to bring that into balance to meet the demand sometime in fiscal \u00e2\u0080\u009823."
