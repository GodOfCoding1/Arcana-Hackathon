    "content": " Our full year total revenue of $103 million represents a year-over-year increase compared to the prior year, despite $14 million of royalties from our Tinuum investments in 2021 that did not occur in 2022 due to the conclusion of the Section 45 tax credit generation period at the end of 2021. Lastly, upon the completion of the Arq acquisition, we expect to retain approximately $86 million of our existing federal tax credits, which may be -- utilized to offset future federal tax payments that we may owe as the business grows in the coming years. Post-acquisition, utilizing both ADES's existing lignite-based feedstock and Arq powder as a bituminous-based feedstock, the combined company will be well positioned to provide activated carbon products that serve more than 80% of the North American activated carbon markets, and we'll do so through an expanded focus in Granular Activated Carbon, or GAC products, which will generally provide higher value and higher-margin opportunities."
