    "content": " Our consumables revenue for the quarter was $24.7 million, which reflects year-over-year growth in excess of 41% for the second consecutive quarter. However, both metrics saw solid sequential improvement when compared to the first quarter results of a net loss of $3 million and adjusted EBITDA of $0.9 million. Tinuum's second quarter distributions to ADES totaled $3.1 million, which was in line with expectations as Tinuum continues to wind down its operations. Second quarter revenues and cost of revenues were $24.7 million and $19.9 million, respectively, compared to $21.1 million and $14.7 million for the second quarter of 2021. For the 6 months ending June 30, revenues and cost of revenues were $51.1 million and $41.4 million, respectively, compared to $43.7 million and $28.7 million for the first half of 2021. For the 6-month period ended June 30, 2022, the consolidated adjusted EBITDA was $3.1 million compared to $47.4 million for the 6-month period ending in June -- ending June 30, 2021. The decline in adjusted EBITDA was also the result of the decline in earnings from the former RC segment, which contributed $24.1 million of adjusted EBITDA during the second quarter of 2021 and $51.3 million for the first half of 2021."
