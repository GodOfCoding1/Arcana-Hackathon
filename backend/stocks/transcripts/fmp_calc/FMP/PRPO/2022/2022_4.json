    "content": " Risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those set forth in any forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to the matters listed under risk factors in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 30 2022, which is on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission as well as other risks details and our subsequent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Therefore, rather than building a huge lab with each sales team and tremendous operation, we're focused on building a high-class boutique operation for our customers that is financially sustainable, while generating the patient samples we need in order to continue to develop our existing products, such as IV-Cell HemeScreen, as well as future products."
