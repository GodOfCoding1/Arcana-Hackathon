    "content": " As you will see the 19.2% NOI growth of STAR's communities is a result of strong rental and other property revenue growth, as well as the execution of our operating synergies that we identified as part of the merger. We are confident in our strategy which is focused on capitalizing on continued macro trends and resident demand, accelerating our organic growth profile through our value-add program and continue to refine the portfolio and expand our presence in core high growth markets throughout our capital recycling and joint venture development initiatives. But with our loss to lease of about 14.5%, and the demand for moderate income apartments and our non-gateway markets, that pricing power really sets the foundation for the raise in our 2022, full year guidance that we had for property revenue growth and NOI growth that you're exactly on point. And I think it's not just that the gateways, the non-gateway markets that we're in, but some moderate income rents, because most of working America can afford an IRT apartment, and that's what they're looking for. The recycling, again, is where we're trading out of assets and slightly that capital into different assets that we think have better growth prospects for allocating capital otherwise, that's where we're looking at these JV programs, because it's just a much better return."
