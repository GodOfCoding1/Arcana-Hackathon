    "content": " As a result of our continued confidence, we are raising our previously provided full year 2022 guidance now targeting 13.75% combined same-store NOI growth, and 27% core FFO per share growth each at the midpoint of our guided ranges. On a lease over lease basis for the combined same-store portfolio, new lease rates increased 17.2% and renewals were up 9.7% during the second quarter, yielding a blended lease over lease rental rate increase of 12.7% for the leases expiring in Q2 2022. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re pleased to note that rental rate trends continue to improve in the third quarter to date, with new leases for our combined same-store portfolio having increased 20.8%, while renewed leases are up 11.4% for a blended lease over lease rental rate increased 13.4%. I wanted to ask about your same-store revenue guidance, which you revised up at 10.9% at the midpoint, it still seems a little modest given it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s about 200 basis points below your lease growth rate over the last 12 months."
