So, in response to Austin's question earlier, kind of how we think about occupancy at the value add portfolio is typically averaging on that 92% range, but\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 \n So I think the important factor is that, it's when you start the value-add process at a community every unit that turns becomes vacant and since we started eight new projects every unit to turn at those communities was vacant for the better part of a month or a little bit beyond where as a couple of years ago or last year, most of the value-add work was being done at communities that were in the program for a number of years. Thank you for your question. Thank you for your question. Thank you for your question. Thank you for your question."
