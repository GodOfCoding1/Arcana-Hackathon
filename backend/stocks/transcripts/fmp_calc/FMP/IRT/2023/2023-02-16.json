    "content": " Our ability to deliver nearly 30% core FFO per share growth in 2022 was the result of the strategic positioning of our expanded portfolio concentrated in non-gateway markets within the Sunbelt region, where we continue to benefit from positive supply and demand dynamics. We also made meaningful progress on our value-added program, as we renovated 656 units in the fourth quarter and 1,451 units for the full year, while achieving an annual return on investment of more than 24%. Our strong fourth quarter and year end results were driven by double digit rent growth, with markets like Tampa, Myrtle Beach, Memphis, Atlanta, and Raleigh Durham, achieving mid to high-teens average rent increases for the full year. As Scott mentioned, we are laser focused on driving improved occupancy in the fourth quarter average occupancy at our total same store portfolio was 93.8%, down 40 basis points from Q3 2022, driven in part by seasonality. For the full year, IRT same store NOI growth increased 13.7% supported by revenue growth of 10.7%, with rental rates increasing by 12%. On the property operating expense side, IRT same-store operating expenses increased 4.6% in the fourth quarter, led by higher real estate taxes and utility expenses, while repairs and maintenance costs and advertising expenses declined compared to a year ago. This guidance reflects same-store revenue growth of 6.4%, which is comprised of an average occupancy of 94.5% and earning of 4.9%, a blended rental rate increase of 3% for all leases signed in 2023, and a bad debt expense of 1.5% of revenue."
