    "content": " Based on the final rule, calendar year 2023 facility reimbursement for minimally invasive SI joint fusion procedures performed in ASCs and hospital outpatient settings will increase by approximately 26% to $17,109 and 33% to $21,898 respectively. This revenue was driven by 25% US procedure volume growth in the quarter, a continued increase in our U.S. procedure volumes throughout 2022, while the healthcare systems continue to adjusting the staff limitations reflects strong demand for our solutions. On the guidance side, our updated guidance of 104 to 105, if you look at it from a fourth quarter perspective, it implies a growth rate of anywhere between 17% and 21% worldwide, versus a 19% we saw in the third quarter and in the U.S., it would imply a growth rate of 18% to 23%, because our expectations now based on Laura\u00e2\u0080\u0099s earlier comments on EMEA is expecting no growth out of Europe for this fiscal year 2022. We are actually seeing quite a few of our surgeons using the product in short constructs, as well depending upon the needs of that particular patient and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also helping to drive deeper engagement with our surgeons given that over half of them are using them are primary products, iFuse-3D or TORQ in addition to Granite. But like Laura said, the trends in the procedure volumes in the U.S. did not underestimate the active surgeon growth numbers that we have seen, 27% growth year-over-year, 12% sequentially quarter-over-quarter. Laura, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d love to get your thoughts that  of the 50%, over 50 adult deformity, also used \u00e2\u0080\u0093 I mean, I was kind of thinking that out of the gate, it might be like, higher meaning that you take your core accounts with some of the newer products right out of the gate, so that that might make that number a even more significant one."
