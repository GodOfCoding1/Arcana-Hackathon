TCO has long been the initial, the largest and in many ways I think the most important shipper on that line and that's reflected in some of the practices that I don't want to get into the details, but we would still be able to flow barrels, maybe not all of our barrels, but I think TCO would be well positioned to not be disadvantaged, let me say that, if there were some sort of proration underway."
