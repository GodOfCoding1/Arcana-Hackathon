    "content": " Our OLED revenue in Q1 was $26.1 million, down 30.7% sequentially and down 53.1% year-over-year. In summary, our OLED business is winning new customers and expanding into new applications with additional supply capacity expected to ramp up in the later part of this year and progress with our LTA supply agreements, we are very optimistic about the growth in our OLED business in the future, particularly when our newly designed products at the leading Korean customer and new major customers side of Korea are expected to go into full production with our newly added capacity. Our power business revenue in Q1 was $64.8 million, up 11.4% sequentially and 20% year-over-year. These results were driven by very strong demand for our premium products, particularly our super junction MOSFET, Power IC and IGBT product lines, which grew 19.5% sequentially and 25.1% year-over-year to a record high 53.6% revenue mix. Total revenue in Q1 was $104.1 million, down 5.7% sequentially and down 15.4% year-over-year. Revenue from the Sundar Parks business was $94 million, down 5.5% from Q3 and down 16.7% from the same quarter a year ago. However, our power revenue in Q1 was very strong and achieved a record revenue of $64.8 million, which represented an increase of 11.4% sequentially and 20% year-over-year. While actual results may vary, looking into the next quarter, Magnus currently expects revenue to be in the range of $100 million to $105 million, including about $9.5 million of transitional factory foundry services and gross profit margin to be in the range of 33% to 35%."
