    "content": " Despite a very challenging economic environment that deteriorated rapidly throughout the quarter and also factoring in the typical seasonal slowdown in originations, the resilience of our business model was evident as during the quarter ended June 30, 2022, we generated total revenue of $21.4 million led by loan originations of $2.1 billion. Non-performing loans declined to a total of $0.6 million as of June 30, 2022, compared to $0.7 million at March 31, 2022. Despite facing an economic environment that deteriorated quickly during the quarter, loan originations were $2.1 billion, down from $2.5 billion in the prior quarter and higher compared to $1.4 billion in Q2 2021. Average loan balances comprising held-for-sale and held-for-investment loans were $279.3 million during Q2 2022, a decrease of 5.9% from $296.7 million in Q1 2022 and an 11.8% increase from $249.7 million in Q2 2021. Total average interest-earning assets declined 3.8% to $373.2 million during Q2, compared to $387.8 million for Q1 2022 and increased 24% from $301.1 million for Q2 2021. Average interest-bearing deposits declined 4% to $127.2 million during Q2 compared to $132.5 million during Q1 2022 and increased 41% compared to $90.2 million during Q2 2021. Net interest margin for Q2 was 13.69%, representing a 32 basis point increase from 13.37% in Q1 2022 and down compared to 20.29% in Q2 2021. The sequential quarter increase was primarily due to an impairment of the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s SBA servicing asset in Q2 2022, driven by rising market interest rates and market-wide increase in prepayment speeds on SBA loans. Compared to Q2 2021, the increase was primarily due to higher expenses from incremental employee headcount related to an increase in strategic program loan volume and an impairment of the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s SBA servicing asset."
