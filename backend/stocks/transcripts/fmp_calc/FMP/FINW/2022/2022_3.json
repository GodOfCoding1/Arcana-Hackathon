Total average interest earning assets were $335.4 million during Q3, compared to $373.2 million for Q2 \u00e2\u0080\u009922 and $294.3 million for Q3 \u00e2\u0080\u009921. Average interest bearing deposits were $104.8 million during Q3, compared to $127.2 million during Q2 \u00e2\u0080\u009922 and $112.2 million during Q3 \u00e2\u0080\u009921. Net income was $3.7 million in Q3, compared to $5.5 million in Q2 \u00e2\u0080\u009922 and $8.4 million in Q3 \u00e2\u0080\u009921. Net interest income for Q3 was $12.5 million, compared to $12.8 million for the previous quarter and $13.5 million for Q3 \u00e2\u0080\u009921. On a sequential quarter basis, net interest income declined primarily due to lower average loans held for sale balances, partially offset by higher loan yields and higher average loans held for investment balances. Non-interest income was $7.5 million in Q3 \u00e2\u0080\u009922, compared to $8.4 million in the previous quarter and $8.5 million in Q3 \u00e2\u0080\u009921. In terms of expenses, we held the line well in Q3 \u00e2\u0080\u009922 with non-interest expense of $8.5 million, compared to $11 million in Q2 \u00e2\u0080\u009922 and up from $7.4 million during Q3 2021. Compared to Q3 \u00e2\u0080\u009921, the increase was primarily due to higher other operating expenses, driven primarily by an increase in consulting fees, partially offset by the cessation in June 2022 of commission accruals related to the company's strategic lending program. The bank's credit quality remains solid and we did not have any non-performing loans at the end of this quarter, which compares to non-performing loans as a percent of total loans receivable of 0.3% for the previous quarter and 0.3% for Q3 \u00e2\u0080\u009821. The company's provision for loan losses was $4.5 million for Q3, compared to $2.9 million for Q2 \u00e2\u0080\u009922 and $3.4 million for Q3 \u00e2\u0080\u009921. Net charge offs for Q3 were $3.1 million, compared to $2.3 million in the prior quarter and $1 million for Q3 \u00e2\u0080\u009921. The company's net charge off rate as a percentage of average loans for Q3 was 4.7%, compared to 3.3% for Q2 \u00e2\u0080\u009922 and 1.6% for Q3 \u00e2\u0080\u009821. The change in net charge offs for Q3 \u00e2\u0080\u009922, compared to the prior quarter and Q3 \u00e2\u0080\u009821 was primarily driven by higher net charge offs related to strategic program and SBA 7(a) loan balance that are not guaranteed by the SBA that have previously been held as classified assets."
