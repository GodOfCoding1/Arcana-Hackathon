Second quarter U.S. revenues for our Prevnar family of vaccines for adults were up 337% operationally, compared with the prior-year quarter, to $431 million, with Prevnar 20 representing more than three quarters of the total adult revenue. Additionally, we are also increasing our guidance for adjusted R&D expense by $500 million at the low-end only, with the new range of $11.5 billion to $12 billion, reflecting incremental investments in multiple programs, including mRNA vaccine programs outside of COVID-19 and other programs.
