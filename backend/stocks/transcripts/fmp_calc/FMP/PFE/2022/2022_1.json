    "content": " The adjusted cost of sales increase shown here reduced this quarter's gross margin by approximately 10 percentage points as compared to the first quarter of 2021, with 14 percentage points attributable to the impact of higher COVID-19 vaccine sales year-over-year, partially mitigated by an unfavorable product mix for other products, primarily driven by higher sales of PAXLOVID and higher alliance revenues. A couple of questions, please. A couple of questions, please. In terms of the number of countries, just to give you a sense, we've actually -- when we think about the $22 billion in guidance, right, plus the $500 million that we're absorbing from foreign exchange, when you think about that part of revenue, it really consists of countries that we have finalized contracts with as well as countries that we anticipate to close shortly. And we see that area as a real new opportunity growth area for PAXLOVID to do very well, where you may need to take multiple courses over a year or even treat with extended duration, and that's something we're now planning to study in order to expand the use of PAXLOVID where it may be the most appropriate and life-saving drug."
