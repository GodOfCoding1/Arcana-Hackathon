    "content": " On the exploration side, and again, we'll get into more detail, but excellent results and importantly, really exciting results at both -- well, at Detour with a 2-kilometer step-out hole, suggesting continuity 2 kilometers west of where the existing or the current mine plan pit shell is. And then finally, before we turn the page, remember, all of this are at -- assets that already exist with existing infrastructure and importantly with teams already in place, which has always been important, but probably never more important than what we're seeing today in today's environment. But to the extent you're able to supplement some of the throughput through an underground at, say, 5,000 ton a day at, let's say, between 2 and 3 grams, you can see that that really gets you much closer to the sort of 1 million ounce target that we're talking about. Not clear -- let's say, probably we need some modification, small modification to do like over 9,000 ton per day, but we think we're going to end up in between 8,500 to 9,000."
