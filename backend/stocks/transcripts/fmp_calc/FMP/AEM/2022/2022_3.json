    "content": " With the strong results in this third quarter, we've now got nine months under our belt, and we are pleased to be able to say that we are reiterating guidance for 2022, production guidance, capital expenditure guidance and importantly cost guidance and that hasn't been easy in the highest inflation environment in probably 40 or 50 years. We are in fact expecting and planning for continued cost pressures going forward, but the team is focused on that and focused not just on mitigating cost pressures where we can, but optimizing mine efficiency, mine throughput, gold production, which also helps to offset some of the cost pressures and the team has done a good job with that. So I guess, we're seeing a market where we're certainly not near the top of the market for valuation of gold equities and I think we've got a really solid base here for the share price to continue moving higher as the equities and the gold price recover going into next year."
