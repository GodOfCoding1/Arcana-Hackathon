    "content": " I would say that 2022 full year can be characterized by two things: number one, solid and strong operational performance; but number two, and this is important, some very strategic consolidations that have led and will lead to some great opportunities that we're going to talk about. We paid a fair price for the second half of Malartic based on its current life of mine, but the reason we did the deal is because we think there's a lot more potential, and we're going to talk about that a little bit. And if things go the way that we hope, they go -- and that we're optimistic they go, we will have an ability to produce more at Kittila and probably another 30,000 to 40,000 ounces there -- and going forward, by the way, because we have that restriction in place in our forward year guidance as well. So all of that is going to be updated through the year to see, let's say, a very good vision on where we're going to handle with the project. And again, that's kind of why I said it might take a couple of years, but we're confident that we're going to be able to find additional ore face for the LaRonde complex and hopefully, recover back to where we were last year."
