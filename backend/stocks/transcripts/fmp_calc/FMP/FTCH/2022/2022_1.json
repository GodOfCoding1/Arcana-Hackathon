    "content": " This position reflects 2.5% growth in digital platform GMV driven by strong growth in the Americas, the Middle East and Korea, offset by a decline in GMV in Russia, parts of Europe and Mainland China; an 11% decline in Brand platform GMV due to a transition of our logistics operations, which has caused shipment delays during the main spring/summer 2022 selling window and in-store GMV growth of 62% year-on-year as we saw an increase of customers engaging with our connected retail formats as well as contributions from new store openings."
