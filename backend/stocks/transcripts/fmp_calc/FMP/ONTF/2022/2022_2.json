    "content": " Total revenue for the second quarter was $48.2 million, representing a decrease of 7% year-over-year. Professional services revenue was $5.2 million, a decrease of 33% year-over-year and representing approximately 11% of total revenue compared to 15% in the year ago period. We ended the quarter with 349 customers, contributing ARR of $100,000 or more, representing an increase of 1% year-over-year. In 2020, we experienced explosive growth, growing our ARR 100% year-over-year, and we continue to experience high growth in the first half of with our Q2 2021 platform revenue growing 64% year-over-year. In 2021, professional services revenue was 14% of our total revenue, and this year, our current guidance is for that to decrease to low double digits as a percentage of our revenue, which is largely driven by more of our customers electing to be self-service. So hopefully, that helps. So hopefully, that helps. In today's economic environment, the ON24 platform is well positioned with our portfolio of experienced products, first-party data and insights to drive revenue growth for our customers efficiently and effectively."
