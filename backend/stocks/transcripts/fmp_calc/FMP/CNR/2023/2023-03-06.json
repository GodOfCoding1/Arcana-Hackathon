    "content": " The Shelter Solutions segment, fourth quarter net sales of $488 million was approximately 7% lower than the same period last year and comprised of unfavorable 7.9% organic volume, slightly lower pricing actions with lower steel costs that were partially offset by favorable 1.7% impact from the UCC acquisition. The Surface Solutions segment fourth quarter net sales of $304 million were approximately 7% lower than prior year, primarily driven by favorable price and mix of 8.3%, which more than offset the lower volumes of 15.4%. Adjusted EBITDA of $25 million was down versus prior year due to the softening volume impact of $15 million as well as price and mix, not fully offsetting inflation of an unfavorable $14 million. Your line is open. Your line is open. Like, how should we be thinking about the back half of '23 if demand kind of hangs in just from a destocking perspective because the second half of the year, it looks like it's setting up for a pretty good year-over-year comp, even if margins go back to this, call it, even like mid-teens level, about 12%, 13%, 14%. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. So just rough math, right, but we think about a 1% opportunity inside of 2023, we talked about that in the years past as well, reducing our working capital after you take into consideration the commodity normal movements up and down, performance, we think that there's about a 1% benefit that should come from working capital."
