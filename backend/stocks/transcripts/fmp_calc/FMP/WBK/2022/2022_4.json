    "content": " Core earnings were up significantly in the last 2 halves from lower costs and higher interest income, and this division has a deposit to loan ratio of over 150%, and so its NIM is more leveraged to rising rates and you can see that in the latest half. First, we've improved momentum across all our banking businesses, combined with better margins and lower costs, core earnings rose 12%. In the half in particular, we've seen, as you can see from the slides, we still see significant mortgage price pressure in the system, and that's going to play through in the second half -- into the first half of 2023.
