    "content": " For the second quarter, new order intake was approximately \u00e2\u0082\u00ac252 million, bringing new order intake for the first half of 2022 to \u00e2\u0082\u00ac576 million compared to \u00e2\u0082\u00ac529 million last year. Starting on Slide 13, revenue for the second quarter increased 15% and 11% on a constant currency basis over the prior year to \u00e2\u0082\u00ac234.2 million, driven by growth in both segments. Today, we are pleased to be raising guidance based on our year-to-date strong performance in our core business, which is offsetting revenue declines related to COVID, an improved outlook in the engineering segment and favorable currency effects. For the second quarter of 2022, revenue related to COVID continued to decline and represented approximately 9% of revenue compared to 15% for the same period last year. Excluding COVID and the favorable impact from currency, revenue in the second quarter would have grown approximately 17% compared to the same period last year. For the second quarter, operating profit margin was 18.7%, and on an adjusted basis, 19.6%, excluding certain start-up costs in the U.S. For the second quarter, adjusted EBITDA was \u00e2\u0082\u00ac61.8 million and adjusted EBITDA margin was 26.4%. In the second quarter, revenue from external customers in the segment increased 8% to \u00e2\u0082\u00ac188.6 million compared to the same period last year and approximately 3% on a constant currency basis. For the second quarter, revenue derived from external customers increased 57% to \u00e2\u0082\u00ac45.6 million compared to the prior year. Second, our increased full year revenue guidance assumes favorable currency effect of approximately \u00e2\u0082\u00ac18 million for 2022."
