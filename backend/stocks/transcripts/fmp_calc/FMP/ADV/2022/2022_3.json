    "content": " Marketing segment adjusted EBITDA of $42 million was up 9% year-on-year due primarily to higher in-store sampling and demonstration volumes following the return to in-store events, partially offset by wage and inflationary pressures. The lower margin is due to a revenue mix shift, reflecting an increase in the lower margin revenue, primarily driven by increase in our in-store sampling and demonstration businesses and single-source retail merchandising services, coupled with inflationary pressure driving higher expenses in such areas as labor and medical benefits. For the full year, we anticipate free cash flow conversion of approximately 15% to 20% of adjusted EBITDA which take into account unusually high earnout payments in 2022, a nonrecurring payroll tax payment related to the CARES Act and working capital related to the rebuild of our sampling and demonstration business. Looking beyond 2022, the continued rebound of our in-source sampling and demonstration businesses is expected to provide a tailwind for Advantage, although the path through returning to feed pandemic levels has taken longer than anticipated. Our ability to manage a very large labor force enables us to provide our services better, faster and more efficiently than our customers could do so by themselves and that is important right now, as exemplified by our quarter-over-quarter improvement throughout the year despite this worsening market."
