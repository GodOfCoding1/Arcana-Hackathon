    "content": " On Slide 11, we show the components of the change in our allowance for credit loss from the end of the prior quarter with the provision being well in excess of net charge-offs, in the fourth quarter, our ACL increased by approximately $2.4 million, and the ACL to total loans increased by 2 basis points to 97 basis points. It's clear that the possibility of a recession is going to make 2023 a challenging year, but with the stronger franchise and earnings quality that we have built, we believe that we could continue to generate strong financial performance and a higher level of profitability while we maintain our more conservative approach to new loan production until economic conditions improve. At this point, it is difficult to provide a forecast for our level of expected loan growth given the uncertain economic environment, but we believe that we will continue to grow our total loans as a result of a more productive commercial banking team we have built, the greater exposure we have to higher growth markets like Chicago and St. Louis and the continued growth of the Equipment Finance business. Your line is open. One moment for our next question. Your line is open. But then if we can keep the Fed at 25 basis points or less and give our fixed rate portfolios a month or two after that to continue to catch up on rates, then I think we're kind of looking at a margin that's relatively stable past this month into the rest of the quarter. One moment for our next question. Your line is open. One moment for our next question. Your line is open. One moment for our next question. Your line is open."
