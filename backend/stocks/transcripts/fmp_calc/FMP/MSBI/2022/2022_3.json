    "content": " Our equipment finance business continues to be a significant driver of our commercial loan growth, and this portfolio surpassed $1 billion in total outstandings during the third quarter. Our equipment finance team continues to generate strong production, with $147 million in new loans and leases in the third quarter. Our equipment finance pipeline continues to be strong, and we are expecting continued growth in the fourth quarter and beyond, although not at the same level as in years past, but the continued growth of this business will increase our production of loans and leases that provide attractive risk adjusted yields. I mean, do you feel like given the strong growth this quarter, and given the view on the economy, the $7 million kind of is a peak provision level for you guys, considering loan growth will be slowing, so you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t need to put as much away for loan growth."
