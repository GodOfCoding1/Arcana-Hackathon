    "content": " We believe that in this environment, continued inversion that results in lower 10-year yields and lower mortgage rates, especially mortgage rates below 5%, in combination with the expected quantitative tightening from the Fed in September, could set the stage for wider MBS spreads and very solid returns in the second half of 2022 and beyond. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Once again, I think this is one of these things where the beatings will continue until morale improves, and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s literally what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s happening at this point in the yield curve is the Fed is being challenged to go ahead and raise rates at 3.75% because the market believes that those rates will have to come right back down because they are going to push the U.S. into a recession. Your line is open."
