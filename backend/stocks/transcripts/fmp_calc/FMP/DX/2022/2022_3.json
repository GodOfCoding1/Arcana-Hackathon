    "content": " You can see this in Agency RMBS spreads, which widened dramatically in September and have continued the widening trend into the fourth quarter, now standing at levels within a few basis points of the peak spreads seen in March of 2020 as shown in our slide deck on Page 10. Mortgage rates have been rising higher and faster than financing costs, causing spreads to widen to historically wide levels, making this the best investment environment in Agency RMBS since the great financial crisis, and we expect this to continue. Post quarter end as spreads have continued to widen about 15 basis points to 20 basis points across the coupons that we own, book value at the end of last week was down about 8% to 10% versus quarter end."
