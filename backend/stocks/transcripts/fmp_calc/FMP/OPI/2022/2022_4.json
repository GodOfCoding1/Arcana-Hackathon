    "quarter": 4,
    "year": 2022,
    "date": "2023-02-16 14:02:04",
    "content": " During 2022, we completed 2.6 million square feet of leasing for a weighted average term of more than nine years and a roll-up in rent of 5.6%, which was in line with the leasing spreads we had projected at the beginning of the year. Annualized revenue for 2023 expirations is comprised of the following; net known vacates for the year are trending between 5% and 6% of annualized rental income, nearly 80 basis points represents planned dispositions, and the balance of 5% to 6% is expected to renew, of which 2.2% has either signed subsequent to year-end or is in advanced stages of lease discussions. I'd like to highlight that OPI's fourth quarter income statement includes a decrease in expense reimbursements included in rental income and real estate tax expense of approximately $8.1 million and $8.2 million, respectively, related to a favorable real estate tax assessment received during the quarter for a property located in Chicago that OPI acquired in June 2021."
