    "content": " During the second quarter, our leasing activity increased sequentially to 679,000 square feet, and same-property occupancy increased 50 basis points over the prior quarter to 94.3% attributable to new leasing activity and advancement of our disposition program for noncore assets. Looking ahead to 2023, roughly 13.5% of OPI's annualized revenue is scheduled to expire with the largest known vacate being a tenant located in Washington, D.C. CBD, representing 2% of annualized revenue and a lease expiration during the back half of the year. And I think the highlights there are the 2% of known vacate on the back half of the year, as I just mentioned in our prepared remarks, we're selling about 60 basis points and then I would say we're in advanced conversations with a lot of those expirations, representing about 4% of our annualized revenue. I think right now, kind of the -- based on the breakdown I provided earlier, we've got about 7% that's unaccounted for, with the majority of that really being kind of in the back half of the year. I mean other than the 2% I noted later in the year, we have 60 basis points with the tenant that is expected to vacate at the end of Q2 next year, and that's a property that we're also -- we have in the market as part of our capital recycling."
