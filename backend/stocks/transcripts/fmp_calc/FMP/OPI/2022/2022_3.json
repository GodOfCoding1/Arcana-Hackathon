    "content": " During the quarter, we sold 10 properties containing 1.3 million square feet for $118 million at a weighted average cap rate of approximately 6.2%. Year-to-date, dispositions totaled $196 million at a weighted average cap rate of 6.8% and close to the high end of our 2022 guidance range. We reported a solid leasing momentum with 24 signed leases for 606,000 square feet, including a 21.6% weighted average roll up and rent and a 7.2 year weighted average lease term. Year-to-date, we completed over 1.8 million square feet of leasing with an 11% roll up in rent and a weighted average lease term of nine years. Over the past year, our real estate team has strategically allocated capital to improve common areas and expand the amenity base, which has resulted in an increase in occupancy from 58% in Q4 2021 to 82% of the Q3 and supported by close to 145,000 square feet of new leasing activity. As we progress on core initiatives, we remain focused on leasing operational efficiencies, development and capital recycling and are pleased with our portfolio position, which includes 63% of our rental income coming from investment-grade tenants, a portfolio average lease term of 6.3 years and a well-positioned balance sheet."
