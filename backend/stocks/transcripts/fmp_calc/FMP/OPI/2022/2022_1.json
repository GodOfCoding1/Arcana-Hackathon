    "content": " Our purchase of two core properties in both the Chicago CBD Fulton market and Atlanta Georgia, the more than one million square feet of new leasing activity over the past four quarters and continued execution on our cap recycling program with the particular focus on reducing capital exposure and improving our portfolio geography footprint and operating fundamentals. During the quarter, we sold or agreed to sell six non-core properties for aggregated proceeds of $67.8 million that contain over 800,000 square feet at an average age of 20 years and an average cap rate of 6%. As we highlighted earlier, we completed 572,000 square feet of new and renewal leasing activity during the quarter with a weighted average lease term of 10.7 years and a 5% capital and rent. Well, I think that if you look at it from it, it was 2% of annualized revenue that burned off and if you look at it from an occupancy standpoint, it was really nominal in the sense that, that building was 300,000 square feet and at the same time, we did you just over 230,000 square feet of new leasing and so I think kind of the net impact to occupancy was really nominal, which is a testament as to why kind of our same occupancy trends didn't really have much of an impact quarter to quarter."
