    "content": " As I mentioned the past two quarters, our recent fintech partnership for student loan refinance business, continues to progress nicely, with $11 million of originations during the quarter. C&I loan growth accelerated, increasing $85 million or 8.8% versus 4.5% growth last quarter. Also contributing nicely, commercial construction loans grew $54 million or 23%, driven by increased advances during the quarter. Net recoveries of $1.1 million in the first quarter, compares to $3 million or seven basis points of annualized net charge-offs in the fourth quarter of \u201921, and seven basis points of net charge-offs for all of 2021. During the quarter, we saw increases in non-interest-bearing and savings deposits, offset by decreases in certain interest-bearing categories, as well as time deposits for the net decline of $32 million. Also contributing to the linked-quarter decline and expenses were lower outside services costs due to the timing of certain technology projects in the fourth quarter, resulting in a $1.5 million linked-quarter decline. And lastly, we reported a $4.7 million decline in other expenses, primarily due in part to a $2.2 million decrease in charitable contributions linked-quarter, and a net gain on fixed asset sales of $1.5 million recorded in the first quarter.
