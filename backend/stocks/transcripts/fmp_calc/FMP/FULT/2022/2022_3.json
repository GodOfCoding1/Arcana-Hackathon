    "content": " Operating earnings per diluted share which excludes merger-related expenses, the Prudential Bancorp acquisition were $0.48 and represents an increase of $0.06 and over operating earnings last quarter and $0.03 above the year ago period. The operating results exclude $15.5 million of merger-related charges recorded during the quarter, with $7.5 million of this reported in operating expenses and intangible amortization and $8 million reported as additional provision for credit losses under CECL merger accounting rules. Consumer and small business lending produced organic growth, excluding Prudential of $262 million or 17% during the quarter. As Curt noted, total deposits grew $233 million during the quarter and excluding the acquisition of Prudential Bancorp, total deposits declined $167 million, consistent with broader market trends. With respect to the investment portfolio, balances declined modestly during the period, decreasing $181 million to $3.9 billion at quarter end. In noninterest expenses, excluding merger-related charges, were approximately $162 million in the third quarter, up $14 million linked quarter. This increase was driven by the following factors: additional performance-based compensation accruals of $2.6 million, additional expenses of $3.6 million related to Prudential Bancorp, a $1 million contribution to our Fulton Forward Foundation, An additional calendar day during the third quarter which added approximately $1.3 million and additional technology costs of $1.7 million due to the timing of certain projects. But when you look at the merchant and card within commercial banking, as well as consumer card, that's a business that through 3 quarters is $40 million of revenue for us -- and so we think going forward, that the changes to overdraft again, less than $1 million this quarter, now we're implementing those sort of mid-October. Yes, through the cycle I think we're going to be in the 30% range but to get to 30% range from where we are today, depending on how you calculate it, if you're just looking at the quarterly levels that we report, we've gone from 11 basis points to 18 basis points. So we would recapture all of that AOCI hit which over the last 2 quarters combined, in our prepared comments, it was $130 million\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\n $139 million this quarter."
