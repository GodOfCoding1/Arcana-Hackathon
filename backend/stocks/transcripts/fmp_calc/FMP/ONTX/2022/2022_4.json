    "content": " We are pursuing narazaciclib's development in multiple cancer indications based on both preclinical and clinical science, and we are pleased to say that narazaciclib's Phase I/IIa combination trial with estrogen blockade in endometrial cancer is on track to open for enrollment and screening patients later this quarter. These early clinical findings are also notably consistent with narazaciclib's differentiated kinase inhibitory profile as well as its preclinical data that showed reduced neutropenia when directly compared to the most widely prescribed CDK4/6 inhibitor, palbociclib. On our last earnings call, you heard Steve and I speak about how narazaciclib's differentiated inhibitory profile positions it as a potentially best-in-class therapy when combined with letrozole in patients with recurrent or metastatic low-grade endometrioid endometrial cancer, or LGEEC. As a reminder, the scientific rationale for the narazaciclib, LGEEC study comes from a randomized, placebo-controlled Phase II study as well as a couple of different single-arm clinical trials of the currently available CDK4/6 inhibitors, palbociclib, ribociclib and abemaciclib in patients with estrogen receptor positive endometrial cancer. However, I think it's important to realize that none of the currently available CDK4/6 inhibitors are FDA approved for the treatment of low-grade endometrioid endometrial cancer, and they are limited by the shortcomings related to safety, tolerability and treatment resistance as we've discussed before. Moreover, we believe our preclinical and Phase I findings suggest that narazaciclib may offer significant safety advantages compared to currently available agents and its ability to target additional proteins related to antitumor immunity, metastasis, cancer cell survival, et cetera, may lead to improved efficacy."
