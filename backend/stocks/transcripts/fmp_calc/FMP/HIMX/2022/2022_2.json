    "content": " Second quarter net revenues of $312.6 million decreased 24.3% sequentially, but were within our updated guidance of a decline of 22% to 27%. Monitor IC sales declined sequentially in Q2, but increased more than 100% year-over-year for the 6 months ended June 30, 2022, thanks to substantial shipment growth for high-end area, such as the high-frame rate gaming monitor. Second quarter smartphone and tablet revenues both declined double digits sequentially as channel inventory across panel houses, OEMs and end brands remain stubbornly high against backdrop of continued sluggish demand. The third quarter guidance for IFRS profit per diluted ADS has taken into account the expected 2022 annual bonus, which subject to board approval, is now assumed to be around $40 million, out of which $17.6 million or $0.08 per diluted ADS will be vested and expensed immediately on the grant date."
