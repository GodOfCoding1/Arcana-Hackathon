The second kind of thing that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s happening is the fact that because they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re trying to digitize their entire operations at these retailers, they are also partnering with our platform products as well, products like DoorDash Drive, DoorDash Storefronts, where they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re trying to run more of their business in a fashion that both I think takes advantage of the convenience economy, but also I think, just creates a better business model for themselves, right, where they can make more productive use of their square footage by adding more and more sales into a fixed space. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. And on your question on new categories growth, I think I mentioned this earlier in the call and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll reiterated our U.S. convenience and grocery business grew roughly 60% year-on-year in Q4. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. Now that takes lots of work on the back end around catalog and many things, and I think that's also now showing promise where we can solve both the use case of the top-up, where I think we're quite advantaged with our logistics network as well as just how consumers perceive us, but also the stock-up use case where people are buying bigger and bigger carts for their more staple items. Your line is now open."
