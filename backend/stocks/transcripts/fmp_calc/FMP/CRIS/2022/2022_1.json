    "content": " 04:59 In April, the FDA asked us to pause the enrollment of new patients, placing partial clinical holds on both the TakeAim Leukemia and TakeAim Lymphoma trials following Curis\u2019 report to the FDA of the   of a relapsed refractory AML patient. That's not part of these clinical studies, but as I would say, our approach, you may remember when the leukemia study was originally put on hold since it's the molecule, we were advising our partners across the studies whoever is using the drug that the spirit of the FDA clinical hold was don't enroll new patients. We don't know that that definitely means that we're in that timeframe, but if you use that as a proxy, you'd say, it's a bump in the road between now and NDA and it's not something that I would consider a material question from a cash burn perspective, it's more a question of executing against the goals, especially when we think about how many patients data we're going to be able to accumulate being this calendar year."
