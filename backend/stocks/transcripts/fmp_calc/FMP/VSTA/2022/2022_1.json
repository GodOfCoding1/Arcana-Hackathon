    "content": " 2022 ACV for school year totaled R$1 billion, which represents a growth of 35% over the subscription revenue for the last cycle -- for the 2021 cycle. In 2022 cycle, from fourth quarter '21 to first quarter '22, the net revenue grew 25% due to the recognition of 68% of the ACV. Adjusted EBITDA grew more than 100% in the quarter and 41% in the 2022 cycle as a result of the net revenue growth, operating leverage gains and cost savings with margins increased up 430 basis points. That means that although the first two quarters continued registering the largest part of the ACV revenue, there was less revenue captured in the first half of this cycle when compared to the previous year, being 68% in the first half of 2022 cycle versus 71% in the same period of 2022 cycle. In this first quarter, the net revenue increased 36% year-on-year to R$381 million, exceeding the R$370 million guidance. In the first half of the 2022 cycle in the chart on the right, adjusted EBITDA grew 41%, reaching R$302 million, with a margin increase of 450 percentage points."
