    "content": " Net revenue grew 35% year-on-year and 27% in the cycle to date, driven by an acceleration in growth of subscription revenue that grew 33% in the 2022 cycle to date and is representing almost 90% of the total revenue of the company. Operating cash flow totaled BRL103 million in the second quarter, a significant improvement from a consumption of over BRL60 million in the second quarter last year, driven by the recovery of operation -- operating results and better working capital dynamics. In terms of adjusted net profit in the second quarter, despite the growth in operating profit, we posted an adjusted net loss of BRL42 million, worse than the same quarter last year, mostly driven by the higher financial leverage of the company and the higher interest rates in the country. In this quarter, operating cash flow totaled BRL103 million, a significant improvement when compared to the second quarter '21 when we normalize it -- even when we normalize the operating cash flow of that quarter by the early receipts of accounts receivable amounting to BRL52 million. In the right chart, we see that our leverage measured as net debt to last-12-month adjusted EBITDA has started to decline since the first quarter, reaching 3.04x in the second quarter '22, or 2.98x including Eleva's last-12-month in full. First, BRL88 million in cash over the last -- over the next 2 years according to the growth of Educbank's student portfolio; and two, BRL70 million in capitalization of credits arising from the sale of Vasta to Educbank the right of -- to access our base, our client base."
