    "content": " We are, therefore, very excited about our upcoming expected milestones, which include the following, in late September, we are planning an investor event to prevent data from our now fully enrolled proof-of-concept Phase 1b clinical trial in patients with chronic neutropenic disorders. Before I pass it over to Adam to discuss the quarter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s financial results, we did want to provide a brief overview of our new response data from the Phase 1b mavorixafor trial in patients with Waldenstr\u00c3\u00b6m\u00e2\u0080\u0099s macroglobulinemia, a rare B-cell lymphoma. As detailed in today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s press release, 16 patients were enrolled in the clinical trial which is a Phase 1b open label multicenter, single-arm study evaluating the safety and efficacy of mavorixafor in combination with the BTK inhibitor, ibrutinib, in adults diagnosed with Waldenstr\u00c3\u00b6m and confirmed to have MYD88 and CXCR4 mutations, a double mutation status that has been associated with poor responses to standard-of-care. Looking at the data over time, adding mavorixafor to ibrutinib was associated with a higher major response rate at nine months, 12 months and 24 months as compared to previously recorded major response rates achieved with ibrutinib monotherapy, which historically achieved a maximum of 57% major response rates at 24 months in a similar patient population."
