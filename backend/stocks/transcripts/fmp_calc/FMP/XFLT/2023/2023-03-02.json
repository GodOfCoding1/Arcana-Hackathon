    "content": " And the benefit of having varied sources of leverage is that we can reduce the overall cost of leverage in the fourth quarter, the average cost of leverage was about 5.54% and we've talked about this previously, XFLT is uniquely positioned in the marketplace, because it does invest in CLO debt and equity, but it has a healthy portion of the fund invested in first lien and second lien loans, which is what allows us to secure that credit facility and borrow more cheaply."
