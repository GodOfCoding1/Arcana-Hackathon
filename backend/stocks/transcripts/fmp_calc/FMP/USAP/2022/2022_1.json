    "content": " Specifically, consolidated backlog increased 50% from the record of $134.5 million at year end 2021 to reach a new record of $201.8 million before surcharges. The backlog growth reflects record monthly and quarterly bookings which totaled $107.4 million before surcharges, providing an excellent base load for operations over the next several quarters. Net sales increased to $47.6 million, up 10% or $4.4 million from the fourth quarter and 20% or $10.4 million from the first quarter of last year. First quarter selling, general, and administrative expenses approximated about $5 million, essentially the same as the fourth quarter of 2021, but declined as a percentage of sales from 11.6% to 10.5%. Even so based on our bookings and a 42% increase in order backlog in first quarter, we expect our heavy equipment market sales remain strong in 2022, driven by continued industrial equipment demand and model changeovers by automakers. General industrial market sales in the first quarter totaled $3.4 million or 0.7% of sales, an increase of 33% from the $2.5 million in the fourth quarter. Our gross margin of 8.5% in the first quarter was aided by strong premium alloy sales, a modest positive misalignment between prices and material costs, and a $1.1 million grant. Your line is open, please go ahead. Your line is open, please go ahead."
