    "content": " Third quarter revenue was $53.9 million, up 8.7% or $4.3 million from $49.6 million in the same period last year. Revenue growth was led by our Fulfillment and Logistics segment, which was up $8.4 million or 55.6% year-over-year. Customer Care was down $2.4 million or 12.1% year-over-year, and marketing services was down $1.7 million or 11.6% from the prior year quarter. Our operating expenses for the third quarter were $50.1 million, up 10.5% from $45.4 million in the year ago quarter, due to the increased revenue and change in the revenue mix, resulting in higher transportation costs in our Fulfillment and Logistics segment. We posted net income of $7.2 million or $0.87 per basic and $0.83 per diluted share in the third quarter, compared to net income of $4.4 million, or $0.54 per basic share and $0.52 per diluted share in the third quarter last year. We recognized a one-time gain of $2.5 million, or approximately $0.30 per diluted share related to the sale of unused IP addresses in the third quarter. Additionally, as previously disclosed, we reached an agreement with Wipro at the end of the second quarter, in which we will acquire all of the outstanding preferred shares for a one-time payment of $9.9 million and 100,000 common shares."
