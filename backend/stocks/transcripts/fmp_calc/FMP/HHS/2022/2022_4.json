Marketing Services revenue decreased 6.8% to $13.6 million, and EBITDA decreased to $2.1 million in the quarter. We expect continued positive net income and a significant year-over-year improvement in full year EBITDA, driving higher free cash flows during 2023 as we target revenue and EBITDA growth for the full year, even when considering a challenging first quarter comparison. Fourth quarter revenue was $54.8 million, up 5.4% from $52 million in the same period last year. Revenue growth was led by our Fulfillment & Logistics segment, which was up $6.3 million or 34.4% year-over-year. Customer Care was down $2.5 million or 12.9% year-over-year, and Marketing Services was down $987,000 or 6.8% from the prior year quarter. Our Fulfillment & Logistics services segment delivered $2.3 million in EBITDA, up slightly year-over-year, and marketing services EBITDA declined by approximately $485,000 or 18.4%. Our operating expenses for the fourth quarter were $51.3 million, up 4.5% from $49.1 million in the year-ago quarter due to the increased revenue and change in the revenue mix resulting in higher transportation costs in our Fulfillment & Logistics segment."
