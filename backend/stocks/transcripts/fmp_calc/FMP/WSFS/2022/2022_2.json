    "content": " As seen on Slide 10, NIM in the second quarter was 3.40%, a 39 basis point increase over 1Q as loan yields increased 27 basis points from the rising rate environment and churn in the portfolio. Our fee revenue ratio was relatively flat from 1Q at 30.0% as fees grew $5.5 million or 9% not annualized driven by growth in Cash Connect and capital market fees of approximately 2 million each, as well as $1.3 million increase in core banking, which was offset by weaker mortgage banking fees from lower resi refi volume. For this year, given the timing of the rate increases, particularly with seven remaining in the second half of the year, we would expect the deposit beta to ramp up around 10% to 15% by year end with some continued increases into 2023. Given our returns and growth expectations, we have increased that to 35%, so it's up to 35% of capital returned annually \u00e2\u0080\u0093 or of earnings returned annually, but now it's one-third purposely low dividend, two-thirds share repurchases regardless of price."
