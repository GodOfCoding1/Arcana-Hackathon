    "content": " Reported ROA in the third quarter of 1.44% and EPS of $1.16 included $2.6 million of corporate development and restructuring costs and a $2.3 million nonrecurring valuation adjustment on Visa Class B structured sale derivative, which was established in 2Q 2020. Deposits decreased 3% or 13% annualized in the quarter, with 40% or over $220 million coming from transactional trust deposits, driven by timing of customer trust transactions and not tied to the broader market deposit trends. Core fees, while down $1.1 million quarter-over-quarter demonstrated the benefits of our diversification of revenue, particularly in this environment, with lower fees in wealth, capital markets, and mortgage almost fully offset by increases in Cash Connect and other fees. The core efficiency ratio decreased to 53.8% from 56.2% in 2Q, driven by the growth in NII and stable fees, offset by core non-interest expense increases of $6.6 million, primarily driven by $2.6 million of higher performance-based incentive, $1.6 million in other one-time personnel costs, $1.5 million from higher funding costs for Cash Connect, and $1.2 million higher loan workout and other credit costs. The portfolio is cash flowing about $50 million a month, which was part of the optionality of why we determined the investment portfolio was the best option for deployment of the excess liquidity because of the cash flowing and the opportunity to either fund any excess liquidity runoff loan growth or reinvest it at a higher rate environment."
