    "content": " In addition, we closed out our three-year strategic plan that included the combination with Beneficial and our delivery transformation initiative, both of which successfully positioned us for our combination with Bryn Mawr and the continued opportunities we see across our diversified business model. This is a 167 basis points lower than prior quarter resulting from the changes in AOCI from the rising rate environment impact on the AFS portion of our investment portfolio, plus the anticipated onetime cost associated with the Bryn Mawr transaction. Regarding the impact of AOCI, it is important to note that given our strong diversified customer deposit growth over the last few years and the consistent loan-to-deposit ratio on the low sixties, along with our strong capital position, we made the purposeful and strategic decision to deploy our excess liquidity into our investment portfolio. Lastly, as illustrated on Slide 7 in the supplement, we are sharing the financial targets supported by our three-year strategic plan for 2022 through 2024, which focuses on optimizing our investments made over the last few years, including our combinations with beneficial and Bryn Mawr and our delivery transformation initiative. And so actually, I'm going to sneak one last one, and just curious, the three-year strategic plan if the thoughts around M&A have changed or altered at all, just kind of strategically now with Bryn Mawr under your belt, and obviously a lot of space between you and $10 billion and two fairly large deals in the last few years, just wondering if there's any different kind of indication or thoughts around M&A that are worth refreshing at this point."
