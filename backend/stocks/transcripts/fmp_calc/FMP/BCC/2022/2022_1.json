I think as we look at the overall demand environment and to your point, as I think the marketplace reflects on what took place in the third quarter of last year, but whether the discipline is the right description, but I think there's more, people are very focused on risk versus reward. Obviously, I think there'll be perhaps a bit more even dependence on wholesale, two step distribution on a range of products and services, as again people try to manage those risk and I know our Jeff and our BMD team is really well-positioned to support customers as they, they kind of navigate some potential changes in the marketplace. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open."
