    "content": " BMD experienced lower sales volumes compared to the prior-year quarter due to decline in housing starts, and declining commodity prices also negatively impacted our financial results during the fourth quarter of 2022. The decrease in segment EBITDA was driven by a gross margin decrease of $39.7 million, resulting from decreased sales volumes and declining commodity prices during fourth quarter 2022. BMD's fourth quarter sales were $1.4 billion, down 12% from fourth quarter 2021, driven by a sales volume decrease of 14%, offset partially by sales price increases of 2%. Gross margin dollars decreased $39.7 million in the fourth quarter compared with the same quarter last year, resulting from decreased sales volumes and declining commodity prices during fourth quarter 2022. So in terms of why maybe more optimistic today, I think the reality is that we're still looking at a different marketplace than certainly we were this time last year; but perhaps to your point, perhaps a bit more improved in terms of optimism and maybe some of the momentum that the builders are experiencing in select markets."
