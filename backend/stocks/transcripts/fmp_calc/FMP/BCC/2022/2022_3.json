    "content": " In third quarter 2022, total U.S. housing starts decreased 7% driven by a decrease in single-family housing starts up 18% compared to the same period last year. Wood Products benefited from improved EWP sales realization, offset partially by lower plywood sales prices and higher manufacturing costs compared to last year\u00e2\u0080\u0099s third quarter. Wood Products sales in the third quarter, including sales to our distribution segment, were $595.3 million compared to $497.3 million in third quarter 2021. Pricing in third quarter for LVL and I-joists were up 19% and 18%, respectively, compared with second quarter 2022 as previously announced price increases continue to take effect and price protection and allowance mechanisms roll off. Excluding the Coastal volumes, our third quarter plywood sales were 272 million feet, down 13% from third quarter 2021 and 3% sequentially. The 477 per 1,000 average plywood net sales price in the third quarter was down 15% from third quarter 2021 and down 16% sequentially. BMD\u00e2\u0080\u0099s third quarter sales were $2 billion, up 14% from third quarter 2021 driven by a sales price increase to 15%, offset partially by sales volume decrease of 1%. Gross margin dollars increased by $166.1 million in third quarter compared to the same quarter last year, resulting primarily from margin improvements on commodity products. And we gave some amount of detail in the last quarter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s call around by 2025, we expect 10% to 12% more EWP capacity, and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a function of not just the incremental stress-related veneer that we get from that acquisition, but also some of the CapEx projects to put more steel in the ground to have more EWP capacity."
