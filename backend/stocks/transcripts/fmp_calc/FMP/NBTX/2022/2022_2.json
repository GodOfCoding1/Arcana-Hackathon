    "content": " I'm very pleased to now, be able to say that what started as exploratory study evaluating radiotherapy activated and VGFR-3 in combination with anti-PD-1 immune Checkpoint inhibitor as lead to compelling evidence of activity and the identification of our certain planned registration program for patient with local regional recurrence or recurrent metastatic head and neck cancer that are resistant to PD-1 therapy. As we reported two weeks ago, following enrollment of 29 patients across three quarters of patients with advanced metastatic disease, we have completed the dose escalation phase of the Study 1100 and determined the recommended Phase 2 dose to 33% of gross tumor volume for all patient cohorts. As you will recall, in the first half of 2022, we modified the three expansion cohort in the study for more robust data collection in our target population of patients with head and neck cancer resistant to prior immunotherapy. The first one is, for example, KEYNOTE-048, which gives a reference in head and neck patient early line getting PD-1 where we see an overall response at the end the true responses around 16% So that could be a good baseline to look at for naive patients, meaning that there is around 85% of this patient that will not respond being either primary or secondary refractory patient."
