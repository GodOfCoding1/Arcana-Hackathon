    "content": " One of the results we are really excited about is when you look at the anti-PD-1 resistant patients, you see that 87% of them had progressive disease when entering the study, meaning a progressing in the primary lesion and potentially also in secondary lesion. Now, if we look at the local and systemic response, both for anti-PD-1 naive and refractory patients, what we see overall in the 21 patients is we have a disease control of 95% and 43% of objective response. And here, it's interesting to see that both in anti-PD-1-resistant patient or anti-PD-1 naive patient; we see a good disease control rate and a good rate of response, which of note, 60% of anti-PD-1 resistant head and neck patients achieved a stable disease as a best response. Now focusing on the IO pathway with the head and neck recurrent and metastatic cancer patients, we've been establishing the RP2D, as you've just seen and started to look at some data and have initiated the dose expansion part of this trial."
