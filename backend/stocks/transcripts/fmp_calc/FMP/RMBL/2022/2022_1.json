Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and thank you for joining us on this conference call to discuss RumbleON's First Quarter 2022 Financial Results. Joining me on the call today are Marshall Chesrown, RumbleOn's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Narinder Sahai, RumbleOn's Chief Financial Officer. Before we start, I'd like to remind you that the following discussion contains forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, RumbleOn's market opportunities and future financial results that involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed here. The forward-looking statements and risks in this conference call, including responses to your questions, are based on current expectations as of today, and RumbleON assumes no obligation to update or revise them, whether as a result of new developments or otherwise, except as required by law. Also, the following discussion contains non-GAAP financial measures. For a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures, please see our earnings release issued earlier this morning. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. The -- we enhanced our omnichannel customer offering, expanded our national footprint, deepened our leadership position in powersports and delivered on our financial goals while keeping our focus firmly on our North Star, providing customers an unparalleled choice of products and services as well as an unmatched buying and selling experience, both online and in our retail locations. We sold over 19,000 total units in the quarter alone, delivered nearly $460 million in revenue and generated over $105 million in gross profit. We recorded over $9 million of net income and over $31 million in adjusted EBITDA, while making strategic investments to strengthen RumbleOn's core and execute on our mission. At RumbleON, we do not have a one-and-done transactional mentality as our goal to become a powersports destination of choice for participants in the space throughout their buying future. That starts with building trust, not only through professionalism, transparent pricing, quality assurance and superior customer service, but also in our promise to provide the best selection of high-quality inventory from all of our manufacturing partners and unparalleled selection of used products of all makes and models, courteous and on-time service and market-leading financing options. Since the beginning, our proprietary technology and process has enabled us to acquire high-quality used vehicles directly from consumers anywhere in the country. In addition to this highly efficient acquisition channel for used units, the significant expansion of our footprint has enabled us to funnel most of our used powersports inventory to our retail locations. The strong demand environment, combined with our efficient inventory strategy helped us expand sales of used retail powersports again in Q1. Despite this impressive growth, the majority of our stores are still in need of additional used inventory, and we're working hard to acquire more and accelerate days supply in our highest performing locations. Our fulfillment system will also prioritize ensuring we have consistent photos, videos and descriptions of each vehicle, further enhancing our omnichannel customer experience. We are on track to complete our digital inventory system and full integration of our retail location websites later this year, which will further support our retail growth strategy. We also continue to see strong demand for new inventory, and we sold more than 9,600 new units in Q1. Due to this dynamic and ongoing supply chain challenges, we expect new powersports retail unit sales in 2022 to be consistent with last year. While we are still in the early innings, we will continue our work to bring our new-to-use ratio to 1:1. Long term, we are focused on both new and used. However, our unique access to a broad array of high-quality used retail powersports units presents the greatest near-term opportunity. Used vehicles due primarily to affordability, provide a great entry point into powersports for both newer and younger users, which builds a base of new riders into the sport. By offering the best customer experience, compelling price points of products and the ease of RumbleON finance, we believe these lifetime relationships will be significant. Before I turn the call over to Narinder, I'd like to reiterate the 3 key investment areas that we outlined in our last earnings call. First, implementing our customer experience center for efficient inventory acquisition and distribution as well as fulfillment for new, used, parts and merchandise. Our customer experience centers will enable us to become a destination for powersports enthusiasts to interact and engage with not only the products they desire, but also with both the broader powersports community and with our brand. The customer experience centers will also serve the dual purpose of fulfillment and inventory acquisition, reconditioning and distribution. And over time, we look to replicate that playbook in other geographic areas that are important to our omnichannel growth strategies. As I just discussed, optimizing and integrating our inventory is critical to ensuring we're the leading destination for powersports consumers. As with our technology development, we are thoughtfully investing in people and process to strengthen our foundation and prepare us for our next stage of growth. We implemented our regional management structure in Q1 and not only are our regional directors working more closely with one another, they're also sharing ideas and developing best practices, but we are realizing important efficiencies that will enhance our integration efforts going forward. Our omnichannel strategy, combined with our unique ability to source and distribute high-quality used inventory at affordable prices are the cornerstones of our model. Amid increasing affordability concerns, inflation, the absence of government stimulus packages, negative consumer settlement and some of the highest fuel prices in history, consumers are responding to our offering, and we are delivering a superior product and experience to our customers while driving profitable growth. We believe that there is significant pent-up demand, which will continue to offset potential macro headwinds in the foreseeable future. With that, I will turn the call over to our CFO, Narinder Sahai, to provide you with further details on our recent financial performance and an update on our outlook. Our first quarter results reflect strong momentum and demonstrate our commitment to executing on our plans, realizing integration benefits and delivering profitable growth. Unless otherwise specified, all of the first quarter growth figures cited in my remarks today are quarter-over-quarter or sequential comparisons. In the first quarter, we sold over 19,300 total units, up nearly 14% from the fourth quarter of last year, led by over 43% growth in used retail powersports unit sales. Excluding the contribution in the first quarter of powersports unit sales due to Freedom Powersports acquisition, which closed on February 18, 2022, new retail powersports unit sales increased 5%, used powersports unit sales increased 23% and total powersports unit sales increased 12% sequentially. In the first quarter, we delivered nearly $460 million of revenue, a record, up approximately 7% sequentially. Our first quarter revenue growth was driven by strength across the powersports segment, which was up 22%, but offset by the decline in revenue from the automotive segment. Revenue from finance and insurance net grew 24% and parts and services, accessories and merchandise increased 7.6% sequentially. I'll note that we are reporting finance and insurance revenue net of cost in this quarter, and we'll be reporting finance and insurance revenue on a net basis going forward. For comparison purposes, we have calculated prior quarter's finance and insurance revenue on a net basis in our earnings press release. In the first quarter, total gross profit was approximately $105 million, a record, up 17% from approximately $90 million in the prior quarter. Total gross profit margin was 23%, up from 21% in the fourth quarter of last year. Sequential increases were driven by strength across the powersports segment, particularly across the used retail unit sales, which is the high-margin sales channel. The increase in retail sales also contributed to revenue and gross profit growth in finance and insurance net and parts, services, accessories and merchandise. Our first quarter operating expenses include early investments in technology, facilities and people and processes we are making to scale RumbleON. Within operating expenses, total stock-based compensation was approximately $1.9 million, down from $2.1 million in the fourth quarter of last year. Income from operations, our operating income was $22.7 million compared to nearly $16 million in the prior quarter. Net income was $9.1 million compared to $20.7 million in the prior quarter, which was helped by a tax benefit of approximately $11 million and a $2 million onetime benefit from PPP loan forgiveness. Adjusted EBITDA was $31.4 million, up 29% sequentially from $24.3 million in the prior quarter. As of March 31, 2022, cash and cash equivalents, including restricted cash, was approximately $69 million. Total available liquidity, which is defined as cash and cash equivalents, including restricted cash, plus availability under our inventory financing credit facilities was over $201 million. In regards to new powersports units, given the strong consumer demand and the ongoing supply constraints that manufacturers are broadly experiencing, our new inventory levels are down from the end of the fourth quarter. While new powersports unit sales may fluctuate quarter-to-quarter, we now expect full year 2022 levels will be flat to slightly down on a comparable basis with the prior year. As a result, we are reiterating our full year 2022 outlook, which already reflects our visibility into the supply chain environment and a tough macro backdrop for consumers marked by higher inflation, rising interest rates and consequently impacted affordability. For 2022, we continue to expect to deliver total revenue in the range of $1.9 billion to $2 billion and adjusted EBITDA of at least $145 million, which includes up to $20 million of incremental operating and capital investments over the course of the year. We'll be at the B. Riley Conference in L.A. on May 25, Jefferies in New York on May 26 and the Baird Conference in New York in June. Lastly, and certainly most important from my perspective in creating shareholder value, I want to thank our entire team of nearly 2,400 members across the country. For us to have tremendous success in following our North Star of providing customer experience second to none, we must first provide an opportunity for the ones responsible for the mission, a team culture that is second to none with unparalleled opportunities for growth and professional development. As I've said many times, many can dream with great vision, great teams determine whether vision becomes reality. We are performing at all-time record levels, and we are thankful for everyone's incredible efforts and the passion you show for our business. I guess, first question, I sort of connected the dots between the reaffirmed 2022 guidance and the comments at the end made by Narinder around unit guidance reflecting kind of inflationary risk and potential pressure on consumers. I mean, we're reading the same reports you are from various different vehicle segments, whether that be boats, RVs, cars and trucks, whatever. However, when we break it down into headwinds and tailwinds, I think, obviously, the headwinds are the economic pressures, be it interest rates, inflation, which obviously drive suspendible income and supply chain challenges. But I think some things from a tailwind perspective, tend -- from our perspective, tend to be offsetting it in some ways. Number one, we still have a significant supply and demand issue. We have much higher supply have much higher demand than we have supply, and that's continuing. And we don't really see -- but again, we haven't seen a reduction in traffic into the stores at this point. Obviously, there's a lots of competition on the used side, and there's also, I think, affordability. I want to just -- the one thing to focus, I think, on or what might be helping our business is 2 things. We sell everything from a mini bike to a 9-year old for $499 all the way to a Trike to a 75 -- Harley Trike to a 75-year-old that could be $50,000 or $60,000. Obviously, we're just at the very beginning of the RumbleON finance, but it is growing significantly. The new vehicle side had aggressive financing, but the preowned side was certainly short from our perspective, and we've been able to backfill that and we think we can continue to grow that dramatically. And then I would say also that as -- again, my experience in the car business would say that when new vehicles slow down because of supply or demand or whatever it might be, typically, your service business increases, and we're certainly seeing that. And the concept there is if I don't trade it in today because I don't want to spend additional monthly payment or whatever, I'm more than likely going to need to service it. So we have all those levers to pull, which is, I think, unique to our space in that we have new, used finance parts, service and merchandise. And when you match this to autos, boats, RVs or whatever, very few match up to have that many high gross margin opportunity levers to pull. And March, obviously, made up a significant amount of the quarter. But as we go into Q2 and Q3, we are -- we have the tailwind of seasonality for sure, which, again, if you take all these different items, I think that it just all adds up to a position that we can continue to grow the company despite some of these economic pressures. So first, I would say the $20 million of investments we outlined are not just on technology alone. If I look at facilities and experience center, we signed a lease on the Dallas fulfillment center in the quarter, and we are kind of in the process of getting that up and going. And as you know, it's going to be a combination of lease expense flowing through the income statement, but then we will have some capitalized improvements. So it's going to be a combination of that, but most of that will be capitalized. And if you move to technology, you already see in the statement of cash flows, $1.7 million capitalized in the quarter for technology investments. And then finally, people and processes, that obviously flows through the P&L as we scale our systems, scale our organization, especially in key functional areas of finance and accounting and compliance. So if you look at all of this, I would say, early on, I would say, majority of that would be on the balance sheet. In terms of onetime items, clearly, the investment we're going to make in the fulfillment center this year would be onetime unless we obviously want to do more and see how that goes. And then on the people and processes side, once we get over the hump on that and we in-source a lot of the work that is currently being outsourced, then I would expect that to create some leverage on the SG&A side. I think in our last quarter, we mentioned that I think if you look at the saturation of physical locations that could benefit from fulfillment, especially you would identify the Arizona market, certainly the Texas market where we're starting and for sure, the Florida market. But if you stretch it out past then, obviously, there's some organic opportunities in big population markets that we aren't represented in presently, one be at the Northeast. Because when you look at this from a market consolidation perspective, this isn't just about consolidating existing dealers. This is really about creating a model that is an organic opportunity to kind of dominate the space, if you will. We have a significant need of fulfillment, but we have a great opportunity on these experience centers. Our inventory has come down, as Narinder pointed out, but our sales are up. And if, in fact, we're on an even allocation basis, my experience is that the retailers that do the best job of taking care of the customer and accelerating market share, will get the lion's share of the opportunity. As far as the supply chain itself, it's a little bit of a mixed message. So I'll kind of just keep my comments to kind of the major players because as you know, we represent -- by the time you get down with all the manufacturing, probably well over 20 manufacturers. And then you can read, obviously, of the public manufacturers, some of them are representing reductions of probably up to 25%. I think ours is about -- if you look at the thousands of units we have in inventory, continuing to accelerate that turn rate, if you will, making sure that I think our objective is to right now is to have empty showrooms. We also think that there's an interesting move in consumer behavior and employee behavior from the standpoint that these powersports dealers are now becoming very, very good at taking offers which really plays into our hand as we move forward with virtual selling on the pre-owned side. All of a sudden, they've become very astute at selling a product that doesn't have to be sitting right in front of them on the showroom floor. There are some new products that are out there with a couple of the manufacturers I don't want to name names, but there are new products that are coming to the market that are sold out pretty much indefinitely right now. So it looks like supply is going to continue to be under constraint, but we really believe we can maintain at the levels we are, and we are seeing some that are improving. I'd like to give you a real scientific answer, but I'm going to give you a real simple one. This is a business -- and our stores are still -- not across the board, but the majority of our stores are still very, very short on inventory to fill the demand. And so we continue -- if you look at our marketing spend, as an example, it is really focused on acquisition to drive more traffic and to spend marketing dollars, as an example, to drive more traffic into the showroom floor right now would be fairly futile with not a lot of ROI. We are remarketing to those people, whether that be e-mail or remarketing through Google, and that's really our focus right now because we believe that we are even close to the opportunity, and we believe there are millions and millions of these assets sitting in people's garages, barns and sheds that are not being utilized. And now they have an opportunity, I would say, similar to car backs in the early days, right, when they made their whole focus on, we'll buy your car, whether you buy from us or not. We're really, really attacking that marketplace, and we think we can get a real stronghold because we aren't really the only one that offers it. You'll see several on the web that say, we'll pay cash for your unit. It's not an opinion of value, and it's a very, very friction-free process to get the money ACHed into your bank account. First one, I'll ask you about the -- it looks like there was a change in strategy mid-quarter in terms of how you're listing third-party product on your website. I think your -- the number of vehicles on the website was down about 1/3, somewhere mid-quarter. I would say, as you're well aware, that is not a profit center for us, but it is a great opportunity to connect with dealers to gather data, which really, really helps our cash offer business, knowing what is for sale in the marketplace without having to scrape websites and do all those kinds of things. The mix of product, so now as I look at right now, 62,000 roughly vehicles on the website. But just to give you a wag, I would say, it's probably in the range of 14,000 total belong to our retail outlets. I just wanted to ask about -- since the last time we reported it and you gave your guidance, it's great that you guys are reiterating it really different than a lot of others. Well, first off, Mike, as you know, I'm a half-full guy. And if we do, we think that it will probably fall on the new vehicle side. And with what we see coming through the pipeline from a pre-owned perspective, we think we are confident that we can more than offset it. So I would say, for Q1, it was a little bit messy, if you will, from the standpoint that we had a fair amount of drama during the quarter. So if we were sharing the entire quarter, you would probably see that March was a big part of it. We are heading into the 2 quarters of the year that from a seasonality perspective, are always strong. And if -- Mike, if I can add to that, we are focused on delivering profitable growth. As you saw, we delivered over $9 million of GAAP net income, $31 million of adjusted EBITDA and over $31 million of cash from operations. So that's where we are focused, what can we do, what's in our control, and we continue to drive that. I think one other thing, Mike, that I'll add is, it does appear that making money is back in vogue. And I think that plays well into our business plan because we are -- as we like to say, we're laser-focused on that. And you have an industry that's void of technology that we're bringing in not just from a customer perspective, the customer-facing piece but also operationally to streamline our operations and become significantly more scalable. Well, again, I'd like to thank everybody for joining us today. We're excited about the quarter already, and we look forward to hearing from you."
