    "content": " Adjusted EBITDA was $25.7 million in the third quarter, down 42.1% over the second quarter, driven by modest gross profit margin compression in the Powersports segment and lower gross profit contribution from the Automotive segment. Our revised adjusted EBITDA outlook is due to expected lower realized gross margin in the Automotive segment, anticipated modest gross margin compression in the Powersports segment and continued expectation of ongoing organic investments and integration costs resulting in no SG&A leverage for the remainder of this year. Please proceed with your question. I also want to make a note that what you also see in the SG&A expense, and we don't back this out, so I want to remind everyone, there are some purchase accounting adjustments that run through the operating expenses because of the acquisition accounting, purchase accounting that we have to do and that you would recall that we had made some changes on the leases which essentially results in incremental expense kind of flowing through the facilities line, which obviously we're not backing out. Please proceed with your question. Please proceed with your question. Please proceed with your question. Please proceed with your question."
