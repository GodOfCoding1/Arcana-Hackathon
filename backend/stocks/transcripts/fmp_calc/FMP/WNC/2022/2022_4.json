    "content": " And maybe I'll shift my next one for Mike, when I look at the revenue guidance at the midpoint, it's up about $300 million relative to last year, any additional color you can give us on the key components of that growth and maybe what you're expecting for revenue growth for trailers versus truck bodies versus parts and service? In some part from some of our long-term agreements, but we're also seeing growth in some of our less talked about value streams like tank trailers, we believe 2023 can be the best year in tank trailer history for Wabash, which is an important point, we're going to see significant growth in our truck body business on the revenue side in 2023 as well. But as of right now, we're focused on the guide that we've given and also scaling the Parts & Services, as I mentioned, at a consistent margin profile which we believe we can maintain the growth to get to $300 million that we guided to back in May of 2022 in that 2025 time period. So had to summarize, what I think could happen, if we were to get to $3 billion quicker than the planned period, it would be our ability to get the supply for dry van components and get more volume out the door and that maybe could come quicker than 2025, but I don't foresee that right now happen in 2023. And if you think about what we want to see, let's say, about 20% long-term agreements in the direct side and I'd love to see closer to 10% of that allocation or that capacity on the indirect side and that'd be a nice mix for us that we think would fit a real nice subgroup of customers that have a long-term vision, and we're going to be able to play this market really well."
