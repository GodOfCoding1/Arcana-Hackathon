    "content": " In EMEA and Asia, product revenues in the third quarter grew 43%, compared to the prior year to $3.8 million. For the three months ended September 30, 2022, total revenue was $11.2 million, representing a decline of 7% compared to the prior year period. Product revenue for the third quarter of 2022 was $10.8 million, an increase of 16% compared to the prior year period. Government grant income, license and royalty revenues and R&D revenues combined for the three months ended September 30, 2022 were $0.4 million, compared to $2.7 million the prior year period. Gross product margins during the three months ended September 30, 2022, decreased to $1.2 million, compared to $1.5 million in the prior year period. R&D costs decreased by $1.6 million, compared to the prior year period to $1.9 million in the third quarter of 2022, primarily associated with completion of development work from prior partnership development agreements. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased by $0.4 million, compared to the prior year period to $5.6 million in the third quarter of 2022. Net loss in the three months ended September 30, 2022 was $6.7 million or a loss of $0.21 per diluted share, compared to a net loss of $6.4 million or a loss of $0.24 per diluted share in the prior year period. So I think it's a long-winded answer Per, but I think we're beginning to see a really good distribution of product revenue in our core products, as well as by regions around the world where in the history of Chembio, they were largely focused on Africa and Southeast Asia, where there's tremendous pricing pressure, tremendous competition from the South Asian manufacturers of rapid tests."
