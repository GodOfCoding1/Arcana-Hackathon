    "content": " So this year, we\u2019re kind of looking at something like 11 to 12 net wells on -- from the Diamondback side and maybe 5% to 6% on the non-op side. And if you look at where we exited last year, pro forma for the Swallowtail acquisition, I would say that, call it, ballpark 17 net wells will give you what\u2019s looking like 5% organic growth. So we\u2019re trying to be creative and we\u2019re working with Diamondback for what the development plan is going to look like in the next 2, 3, even 4 years out, and try to add some inventory on the back there where we can also underwrite a little bit lower price deck."
