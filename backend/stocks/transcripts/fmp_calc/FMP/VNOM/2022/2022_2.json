    "content": " As a result of Diamondback's consistent focus on developing Viper's high-concentration royalty acreage, primarily in the Northern Midland Basin, as well as continued strong activity levels by third-party operators, Viper is increasing our guidance for oil production for the full year 2022 by 4% at the midpoint. Beginning in the third quarter, the Board has approved an annual base distribution of $1 per unit, which provides a competitive yield of 3.3% at today's unit price and which would represent an annual distribution roughly equal to 50% of our estimated cash available for distribution assuming $50 WTI. I would say generally the move to 75% took a lot of thought and consideration, on the Viper side particularly moving to a base distribution which kind of can be seen as basically a base dividend like at the Diamondback side, but it's a little bit higher on a yield basis. But with that said with the activity that's going on now and will be resulting in the Midwest turn the production in the back half of the year, I think you'll just see the NRI bump up a little bit on the third-party side. I mean we can look at our Diamondback operated production being 60% or two-thirds of our total production, and heavily high confidence that it's going to grow over the next three to five year period."
