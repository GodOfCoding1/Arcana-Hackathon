I think that kind of mimics how we're thinking about things where on a time period like today, or over the last couple of weeks we've got to sell off, and that's when the buyback kicks in. And I think generally being able to sell that losing 250 to 300 barrels of oil a day, and still hit numbers in 2023 that we expected prior, just shows that we didn't need that asset in the portfolio and instead we're being we're moving to 100% Permian and higher growth."
