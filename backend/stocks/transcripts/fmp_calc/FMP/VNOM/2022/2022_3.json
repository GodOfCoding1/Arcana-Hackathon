    "content": " Although our distribution went down from previous quarters as we allocated more capital to unit repurchases, we will still be paying a distribution for the third quarter of $0.49 a unit, which provides a competitive annualized yield of almost 6% at today's unit price. It is important to note, however, that Viper continues to expect Diamondback to focus on developing Viper's high concentration royalty acreage in the Northern Midland Basin and as a result, growing Viper's 2023 Diamondback-operated net oil volumes by roughly 10% year-over-year. Given that Diamondback-operated roughly 60% of Viper's total production, we still anticipate meaningful production growth in 2023. But, when we can buy minerals in the market much cheaper than we can buy minerals in the private markets, we've seen some astronomical valuations on deals sold of lower quality than what Viper has that calls us \u00e2\u0080\u0093 it sounds to probably up and buy our unit factor that's a better deal than trying to grow the business by buying external minerals."
