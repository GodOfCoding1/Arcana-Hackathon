    "content": " On the containership side, 2022 was a unique year with the first half drawing upon favorable market conditions with strong demand and logistical disruptions continue to impact the sector, while during the second half, charter rates and asset values normalized as a result of reduced cargo demand and the return of capacity previously tied up by congestion. We chartered the total of 16 secondhand containerships during the year, which added incremental contracted revenues of more than $550 million. On the container side, our revenue stays at 96% fixed for 2023 and 85% for 2024 while our contracted revenues are up to $3.2 billion with the TEU-weighted remaining time charter duration of above four years. As you've seen we have started the dry bulk trading platform that, we have allocated up to now $100 million that's going to go up to $200 million. However, if we don't see asset values coming at levels that make sense both on the containership side, and also in the dry bulk side, simply we will sit back and we're not going to be buying any ships. I have to remind you that, we didn't put any new building orders at the high prices we saw in the containership market over the last couple of years, simply because we felt that asset prices were prohibitive, even if the charter rates offered were at high levels as well. At the same time now for the time being, however, if we feel that the asset values make sense and as I mentioned earlier justify further acquisitions either in the containership segment second part of buildings or sort of, dry bulk vessels, this is something we would look very, very carefully without excluding share buybacks for example, but we follow the market for timely acquisitions should circumstances change."
