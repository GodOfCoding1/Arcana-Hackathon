    "content": " For the first quarter ended December 31, 2022, the company reported net loss attributable to Alico common stockholders of approximately $3.2 million as compared to net income attributable to Alico common stockholders of approximately $10.1 million for the first quarter ended December 31, 2021. The decrease in revenue for the three months ended December 31, 2022 compared to the three months ended December 31, 2021 was primarily due to a decrease in grove management services and a decrease in revenue generated from the early and midseason harvest, with such decrease in harvest revenues being in large part because of the increased fruit drop caused by the impact of Hurricane Ian. In addition, the company recognized an increase in interest expense of approximately $247,000 for the three months ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the three months ended December 31, 2021 as a result of an increase in the overall interest rates on its variable term debt and the working capital line of credit and incremental borrowings on under the working capital line of credit. During the first quarter ended December 31, 2022, we received the last installment of the Florida citrus block grant program from the 2017 storm, Hurricane Irma, of approximately $1.3 million as compared to approximately $1 million for the first quarter ended December 31, 2021. For the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, we reported net loss attributable to Alico common stockholders of approximately $3.2 million and income attributable to Alico common stockholders of approximately $10.1 million respectively. Our adjusted EBITDA was approximately a net loss of $3.4 million for the first quarter ended December 31, 2022 as compared to a positive $2.3 million for the same period in the prior fiscal year."
