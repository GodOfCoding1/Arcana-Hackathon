    "content": " The Company issued a press release today, March 31, 2023, containing a business update and financial results for the year ended December 31, 2022, which is also posted on the Company's website. With a deeper understanding of the landscape in the key economic drivers for heavy industry, with ever deepening relationships partly as a result of an influx of client-driven and industry partners studies and joint initiatives with a horizon of key milestones in metal powders and plasma torches still to come and with the revised business strategy, the Company's ambitions remain robust. The modified EBITDA excludes $5.5 million of noncash share-based expense as well as an $8.3 million adjustment to the fair market value of the strategic investment in fiscal 2022, which is attributable for the decreased share price of the common shares of HPQ, which are owned by the Company."
