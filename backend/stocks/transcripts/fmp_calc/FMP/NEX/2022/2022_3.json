    "content": " Alongside our Q3 earnings, we have initiated a $250 million share buyback program totaling 9% of our market cap as of the close of the market yesterday, and we plan to return at least $250 million to shareholders through the end of 2023. Our cash used in investing activities was $31 million during the third quarter, excluding the $27 million in cash used in acquisitions mostly from the purchase of CIG's last-mile logistics business. I hope that we've shown you today that we are prepared to deliver on this capital allocation plan and are positioned to deliver on our first $250 million cash return program through the end of 2023, while also reaching our financial priority of net debt zero. It's that while there is some of our CapEx allocated to new fleets like electric, that is equally likely to be a replacement as it is to be anything to do with growth because as we've guided before, we intend to stay in that 12% to 13% kind of organic market share range with our fleet. Please go ahead with your question. Please go ahead with your question. Please go ahead with your question. So my point to your question on the additional investments in the integration, as we called out the $120 million or so that we've been invested in high-return projects, that's going to not only strengthen the integration profitability on a stand-alone basis, but it's also going to strengthen it from a frac perspective. Please go ahead with your question. And I would say, when you get to 8% to 9% of revenue, looking at it from an old OFS guide that's managed historically compared to a wireline - open hole wireline franchise or something else, 8 to 9% of revenue for frac business is better than the market, I think. Please go ahead with your question. Please go ahead with your question."
