    "content": " In our Completion Services segment, first quarter revenue totaled $603 million, compared to $481 million in the fourth quarter, a sequential increase of approximately 25%. Our cash used in investing activities was $27 million during the first quarter, mostly driven by Tier 4 dual fuel upgrades, maintenance CapEx and investments in our Power Solutions business. With our continued efforts on integration and quarterly pricing resets on our agreements, we expect to be able to achieve annualized adjusted EBITDA per fleet deployed of at least $15 million in Q2. This outlook assumes total revenue will increase at least 20% sequentially, which would mark our fifth straight quarter of market-beating top line growth, coupled with significant margin expansion, resulting in expected Q2 adjusted EBITDA of at least $130 million. Going back to the Analyst Day, I take that $7.5 million number for 10% of net pricing increase that you laid out, assuming we exited last year on that $9 million implies reaching the $20 million EBITDA per fleet by the end of this year."
