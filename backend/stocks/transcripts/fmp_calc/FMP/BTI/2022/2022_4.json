    "content": " Over the last four years we have grown New Category revenue by a CAGR of 33% and we are confident in achieving our \u00c2\u00a35 billion revenue target by 2025, regardless of the transfer of our businesses in Russia and Belarus. In 2022, we achieved our renewable energy use targets three years early, which is why we have increased our target to 50% by 2023 -- by 2030, sorry. In our established markets we continue to transform at speed, with non-combustible already representing over 30% of our revenue in a total of 11 markets, where we have been most active with our multi-category strategy and we expect more markets to exceed this 30% level in 2023 as we take our transformation to the next level. In 2022, we delivered revenue growth of 2.3% driven by New Category growth of 37%, and a strong combustibles price mix of nearly 5%. Turning to New Categories, we delivered strong revenue growth with all three categories growing in excess of 25%, driven by share growth, innovation and Geo expansion. Looking forward, 2023 results are expected to be driven by another year of strong New Category growth and a further reduction in losses, alongside a resilient combustibles performance, supported by continued efficiency savings and strong cash generation. We expect to deliver organic revenue growth of 3% to 5%, excluding Russia and Belarus, adjusted mid-single figure EPS growth, second half weighted, reflecting, incremental New Category investment, higher net finance costs, transactional FX headwind of around 2%, and a second half weighted U.S. performance. Your line is open, please go ahead. Your line is open, please go ahead. Your line is open, please go ahead. Your line is open, please go ahead. Your line is open, please go ahead."
