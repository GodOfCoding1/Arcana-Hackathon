    "content": " Today we introduced a full-year 2022 financial guidance, which includes net income of $250 million to $330 million, adjusted EBITDA of $970 million to $1.05 billion, and deferred revenue of approximately $355 million. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. I think that -- I'm loads to say this because it's MVP, but the timeline guidance that we put out, I would define as regular way guidance, meaning that we're actively engaged with the agencies for them to reissue the  right-of-way opinion."
