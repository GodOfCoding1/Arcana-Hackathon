    "content": " While MVP is nearing the end of its long and delayed permitting process, this proposed legislation will benefit an MVP expansion and the MVP Southgate project, as well as other energy infrastructure projects by providing a timely and certain permitting process, which is just as important for renewable energy infrastructure projects, as it is for oil and gas. As a follow up you mentioned side deal, there's a revision of the Clean Water Act is included in the Federal Permitting Reform Act ultimately, kind of curious if this would have any impact on MVP timeline, and whether any changes in the ultimate permitting process could unintentionally impact the existing timeline for the buy up Army Corps in the water permit, et cetera."
