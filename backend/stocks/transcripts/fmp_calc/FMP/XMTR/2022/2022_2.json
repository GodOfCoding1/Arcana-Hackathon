    "content": " Q2 marketplace revenue was $75.6 million, growing over 55% year-over-year and 17% quarter-over-quarter. On top of strong revenue growth, gross profit grew 217% year-over-year in Q2, driven by significant improvements in marketplace gross margin and the addition of higher margin suppliers services. We generated Q2 revenue of $95.6 million, up 89% year-over-year, driven by strong marketplace growth and the addition of Thomas and supplier services. Q2 gross profit was $37.7 million, an increase of 217% year-over-year, gross profit margin was 39.4%. Q2 total non-GAAP operating expenses increased 120% year-over-year to $46 million driven by the addition of Thomas, continued investments in the business and incremental public company costs. For fiscal year 2022, we are raising the bottom end of our revenue guidance, and now expect revenue in the range of $395 million to $400 million, representing year-over-year growth of 81% to 83%, versus prior guidance of $392 million to $400 million. We are raising our gross margin range for fiscal year 2022 to 38.5% to 39% from 38% to 39% based on better than expected trends from marketplace gross margin, We expect our adjusted EBITDA loss to be in the range of $31 million to $33 million for 2022 versus our prior guidance of a loss of $32 million to $36 million. And we're continuing to enhance those algorithms and we'll expect to continue to see the growth in that gross margin, which will provide some of that leverage as we talk about getting to profitability next year, that's an important component to that and getting to our long term goals of 40% to 45% gross margins."
