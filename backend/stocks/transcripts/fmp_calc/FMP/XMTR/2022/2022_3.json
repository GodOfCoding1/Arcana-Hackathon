    "content": " Q3 marketplace revenue was at $84.1 million nearly 55% year-over-year, and 11% quarter-over-quarter growth. On top of strong revenue growth, gross profit grew 182% year-over-year in Q3, driven by significant improvements in marketplace gross margin, and the addition of higher margin supplier services. We generated Q3 revenue of $103.6 million up 83% year-over-year, driven by strong marketplace growth and the addition of Thomas and supplier services. Moving on to Q3 operating costs, Q3 operating costs, Q3 total non-GAAP operating expenses increased 93% year-over-year to $47.4 million driven by the addition of Thomas continued investments in the business and incremental public company cost. We expect Q4, 2022 revenue in the range of $104 million to $106 million representing year-over-year growth of 55% to 58%. As a reminder, as marketplace revenue grows at a faster rate than supplier services we would expect total gross margin to be lower in Q4 than Q3. If you look at in your model with active buyers, and we're seeing as Randy said, we expect that number is even grow in Q4 you play that out starting in 2023 what you're going to see is the active buyer growth year-over-year is going to remain very strong. Absolutely, we always have more active buyers, but we're really the step change was there, just as you said, their behavior on their, on the platform, their activity level, and just their eagerness to take the jobs much faster -- that they took them 36% faster in a very short period of time that change and that's been a persistent change, which has endured."
