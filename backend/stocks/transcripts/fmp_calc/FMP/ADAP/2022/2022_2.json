    "content": " If approved, afami-cel will be the first new therapy approved and labeled in the United States for the treatment of synovial sarcoma in nearly a decade and would be the first marketed engineered TCR T-cell therapy for a solid tumor, which would be a milestone for Adaptimmune, patients, and healthcare more broadly. I think the reasons to a durable clinical benefit would start with the data from the Spearhead-1 trial which clearly shows that in a solid tumor, cell therapy can deliver durable responses that of significant benefit to patients, and that will be the basis of the BLA file later on this year."
