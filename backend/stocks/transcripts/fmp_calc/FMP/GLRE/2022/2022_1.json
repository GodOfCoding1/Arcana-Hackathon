    "content": "  Forward-looking statements are not statements of historical fact, but rather reflect the company's current expectations, estimates and predictions about future results and events and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions, including those enumerated in the company's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021, and other documents filed by the company with the SEC. Gross premiums written were $145.9 million for the quarter, a decrease of 14% from the first quarter of 2021, due primarily to our decision to reduce our participation in motor and worker's compensation contracts. I'd say that we've had no specific data on any emerging losses since March 31, let's call it the fog of war, but that information will steadily make its way to us through our partners, reinsurance partners and of course, it will be reflected in our financial statements at the earliest opportunity to the extent that the ongoing events presents new exposure, but we are monitoring the situation very carefully."
