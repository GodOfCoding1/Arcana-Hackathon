    "content": " Our second quarter performance was strong as we grew book value per share by 3.3%, with a positive contribution from each of underwriting, innovations, investments and the silky fund. Gross premiums written in the second quarter were $134.8 million, a decrease of 5% from the second quarter of 2021 due primarily to our decision to reduce our participation in motor and workers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 compensation contracts. At the end of the second quarter, our fully diluted book value per share was $14.10, an increase of 3.3% from March 31."
