    "content": " The rapid increase in mortgage interest rates, significant declines in existing home sales and moderating growth in home prices caused us to experience a steady sequential decrease in our transactions in fiscal 2022 culminating in the fourth quarter comparable store sales transaction decline of 10.4% from last year. Our fiscal 2023 annual comparable store sales are expected to be flat to down 3% from last year, reflecting continued declines in existing home sales throughout most of 2023 from higher interest rates, moderating growth in home prices and strategic price reductions we expect to take from the benefit of lower freight costs."
