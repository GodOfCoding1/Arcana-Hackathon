    "content": " Additionally, we are pleased with the execution of our growth strategies and gross margin rate recapture, which enabled us to deliver better than expected third quarter 2022 adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.70 per share, an increase of 16.7% from last year's $0.60 per share. As expected selling and store operating expenses increased 28.4% to $28.7 million from $21.7 million during the same quarter last year, due to new store openings and additional staffing to support our sales growth. Our third quarter adjusted EBITDA increased a better-than-expected 23% to $147.9 million from $120.2 million last year, primarily due to our sales performance and managing our cost structure well."
