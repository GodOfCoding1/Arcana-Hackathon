    "content": " Considering these factors and the potential impact on our business, we continue to expect our 2022 comparable store sales growth will be within the range of 10.5% to 13% but coming the high end of the sales and earned range could be more challenging than previously contemplated due to the recent changes in the macroeconomic and geopolitical environment, such as rising interest rates and mortgage rates, continued declines in existing home sales, record high inflation and still a difficult supply chain."
