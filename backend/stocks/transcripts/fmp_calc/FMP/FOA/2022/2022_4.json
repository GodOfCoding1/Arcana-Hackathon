    "content": " The adjusted net loss for the year is entirely attributable to the losses associated with the wind down and operating losses of our mortgage originations business, as well as declining volumes in commercial and lender services, on a pro forma basis, when we strip out mortgage originations, commercial originations and lender services, FOA recognized $53 million in adjusted net income for the year. Turning to the operating results, the overall company recognized an adjusted net loss for the quarter and the year, which was entirely driven by the wind down and operating losses of our Mortgage Origination segment and declining volumes in the commercial and lender services segments. If we eliminate the impact of those businesses, the company would've generated adjusted net income of $53 million for the year. In conclusion, on a pro-forma performer basis, excluding the wound down and divested businesses, the company recognized adjusted net income of $53 million for the year, and we anticipate that the steps we have taken to expand our Reverse business, streamline the organization and de-risk our balance sheet will lead to improved performance in 2023."
