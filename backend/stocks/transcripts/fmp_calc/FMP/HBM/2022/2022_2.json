    "content": " As you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen in today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s presentation, we had a strong operating quarter with unit operating costs within guidance expectations and our consolidated cash costs benefit from our commodity diversification with higher gold byproduct credits. Consolidated zinc production in the second quarter was 23% lower than the first quarter, primarily due to lower tonnes and grades at 777 as the mine approach the end of its life and the continued transition toward mining the gold lenses at Lalor with a corresponding decrease of production from the base metal zones. Consolidated sustaining cash costs decreased to $1.87 per pound in the second quarter, compared to $2.29 in the prior quarter, due to the same reasons affecting cash costs. Consolidated all-in sustaining cash costs decreased to $1.93 in the second quarter from $2.54 in the first quarter, due to the same reasons I've already mentioned, along with lower corporate selling and administrative expenses. Operating cash flow before change in noncash working capital was $124 million during the second quarter, reflecting a marked increase from the first quarter, primarily as a result of an increase in noncash working capital, higher realized zinc metal prices and higher copper, gold and zinc sales volumes. Second quarter adjusted EBITDA was $141 million, 28% higher than the previous quarter, primarily as a result of the same factors affecting operating cash flow. Second quarter combined unit operating costs in Peru were within the guidance range at $12.02 per tonne, lower than the first quarter due to lower milling costs and higher throughput. Peru's cash costs in the second quarter were $1.82 per pound of copper higher than the previous quarter, primarily due to higher mining and general and administrative costs and lower byproduct credits, partially offset by lower milling costs. Manitoba combined units operating costs decreased 5% compared to the previous quarter, mainly due to lower costs at 777 as the mine approach closure, partially offset by higher inflationary cost pressures for both commodities fuel and Lalor contractor costs. Looking ahead to the second half of 2022, we expect combined units operating costs to increase due to ongoing inflationary cost pressures and the removal of the lower cost Flin Flon operations. Gold cash cost net of byproduct credits in the second quarter was negative $207 per ounce, which was lower than the first quarter and well below the 2022 guidance range as the operation has benefited from higher zinc byproduct credits, lower operating costs and higher gold production. So Jackie, we disclosed an additional $25 million of costs expected this year starting in the second quarter relating to one-time costs for closure of the 777 mine and the zinc plant as well as to transition the Flin Flon mill and tailings facility to care and maintenance."
