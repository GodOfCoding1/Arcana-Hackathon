    "content": " For the full year 2022, ACV also grew approximately 17%, ignoring the impact of the prior year government stimulus revenues, which, as we have said before, are non-recurring and we saw the tail end of them in 2022. Adjusted EBITDA was $394 million for the full year 2022 as compared to $448 million in 2021, and our adjusted EBITDA margin at 10.2% was 80 basis points down year-over-year as compared to 2021. The puts and takes on the adjusted EBITDA for the full year were headwinds from the runoff of the onetime government stimulus volumes, headwinds from mix and foreign exchange, offset with the positive impact of increased fall-through from BenefitWallet revenue and our ongoing cost efficiency programs. For the Government segment, full year 2022 revenue declined 12% as compared to 2021. Transportation segment revenues declined 5% year-over-year in 2022 as compared to 2021, with approximately half of this decline being driven by foreign exchange headwinds affecting the international transit business. In the Government segment, adjusted EBITDA declined 24%, and the adjusted EBITDA margin of 28.8% was down 460 basis points year-over-year. For the Transportation segment, adjusted EBITDA declined 21% year-over-year as compared to 2021, and the adjusted EBITDA margin of 11.8% was down 240 basis points year-over-year. Overall, this was an approximate 3.5 point decline in the adjusted EBITDA margin for the quarter as compared to Q4 2021 and approximately 120 basis points on a full year. This is offset by a decline of approximately 12.5% in the Government segment driven by client losses and the $42 million of government stimulus volumes in 2022, most of which was anticipated and communicated on our previous outlook that we gave in our Q4 2021 earnings update."
