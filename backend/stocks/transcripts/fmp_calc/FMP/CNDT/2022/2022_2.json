    "content": " In terms of the numbers themselves, adjusted revenue for Q2 2022 was $928 million as compared to $1 billion in Q2 2021, down 8% year-over-year or 6.9% in constant currency. Adjusted EBITDA was $87 million for the quarter, down 26.9% as compared to Q2 2021, and the adjusted EBITDA margin of 9.4% was down 240 basis points year-over-year. For Q2 2022, Commercial segment adjusted revenues were down 3.7% year-over-year at $470 million due largely to the previously mentioned financial institution merger impact. Within the Government segment, adjusted revenues for the quarter were $279 million, down 17% year-over-year as compared to Q2 2021. Adjusted EBITDA for the Government segment in Q2 2022 was $78 million, down approximately 34% year-over-year, reflecting that runoff of government stimulus volumes, partially offset by operational efficiency initiatives. Transportation segment revenues in Q2 2022 were $179 million, down approximately 3% year-over-year. For the Transportation segment, adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $24 million, down 4% as compared to Q1 2021, and the adjusted EBITDA margin was 13.4%, down 10 basis points year-over-year. During the second half of the year, the Commercial segment will grow approximately 1.5% year-over-year as compared to the second half of 2021 and, as noted above, we expect approximately 1% of growth for the full year 2022 as compared to 2021 in constant currency. We now expect the year-over-year decline to be around 13%, which, ignoring the onetime benefit from government stimulus programs in 2021, would have the underlying business growing slightly in 2022 where previously we expected it to be flat."
