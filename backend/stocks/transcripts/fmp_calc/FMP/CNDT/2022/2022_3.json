    "content": " In terms of the numbers themselves, adjusted revenue for Q3, 2022 was $977 million as compared to $1.02 billion in Q3, 2021, down 4.1% year-over-year or down 2.7% in constant currency. Adjusted EBITDA was $105 million for the quarter, down 11.8% as compared to Q3, 2021 and the adjusted EBITDA margin of 10.7% was down 100 basis points year-over-year, again, largely driven by the margin loss from the one-time government stimulus volumes roll-off from 2021. For Q3, 2022, Commercial segment adjusted revenues were $504 million, up 2.2% year-over-year. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $68 million, up 70% as compared to Q3, 2021. Within the Government segment, adjusted revenues for the quarter were $291 million, down 15.9% year-over-year as compared to Q3, 2021. Adjusted EBITDA for the Government segment in Q3, 2022 was $88 million, down approximately 34% year-over-year, reflecting this runoff of government stimulus volumes, partially offset by operational efficiency initiatives. Transportation segment revenues in Q3, 2022 were $182 million, up 1.1% year-over-year, including a $6 million headwind from foreign exchange in the quarter impacting our international transit business. For the Transportation segment, adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $25 million, up 13.6% as compared to Q3, 2021, and the adjusted EBITDA margin was 13.7%, up 150 basis points year-over-year. The combined impact of these in the fourth quarter, along with further headwinds from foreign exchange, as well as timing of certain project revenues within the Transportation segment means we now expect overall Q4 adjusted revenues to be in the range of $985 million to $995 million."
