    "content": " During the quarter, our per barrel production costs were $5.42 in Hawaii, Washington was $3.57 and Wyoming was $7.80 per barrel. For the full year, Hawaii production costs were $4.86 per barrel, Washington was $4 per barrel and Wyoming was $7.32 per barrel. In an $80 per barrel Brent and $4 Henry Hub price environment, we would expect Hawaii production costs between $4.25 and $4.50 per barrel, Washington near $3.50 per barrel and Wyoming between $7.50 and $8 per barrel. Combining the 3-1-2 and feedstock indexes, the overall margin environment compressed by about $5 per barrel versus the third quarter. In Washington, market conditions declined by approximately $5 per barrel, but remained seasonally strong at $28 per barrel with very strong conditions early in the quarter. Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA includes a net price lag benefit in Hawaii of $10 million, offset by a negative FIFO impact of $4 million in Wyoming and a product crack hedge loss of $4 million in Hawaii. Cash provided by operations during the fourth quarter totaled $132 million, excluding net working capital outflows of $48 million. Again, with respect to Billings, I think we called out a maintenance and regulatory requirement of about $15 million a year and then turnaround -- amortized turnaround of about $20 million a year."
