    "content": " First quarter Washington production costs were $7.35 a barrel, reflecting reduced throughput of 20,000 barrels per day as we completed the turnaround. Production costs were $8 a barrel and throughput was 15,000 barrels per day during the first quarter. Adjusted gross margin grew by 3.2% compared to the first quarter last year, increasing from $25.3 million to $26.1 million. Excluding the RIN mark-to-market impacts, Refining segment adjusted EBITDA was $5 million compared to $8 million in the fourth quarter. The net impact of rapidly rising prices largely offset the market improvement and the impact of crack spread hedging, increased backwardation and increased yield costs and other items caused another $4 per barrel capture headwind, and an approximate $9 per barrel. We anticipate landed crude differentials will be between $4.50 and $4.75 per barrel during the second quarter, reflecting increasing backwardation and a tighter physical crude market. Laramie generated hedged adjusted EBITDAX of $22 million, unhedged adjusted EBITDAX of $30 million and a net income of $33 million during the first quarter of 2022. Par Pacific's first quarter cash flow from operations, excluding turnaround funding, was $21 million."
