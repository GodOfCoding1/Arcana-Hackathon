    "content": " We made a change this quarter to our definition of adjusted EBITDA and adjusted net income to remove the impact of noncash RIN mark-to-market charges, which was approximately $18 million this quarter.. We believe this better reflects the ongoing earnings of the business. I'm going to start, and then I'll turn it over to Will to talk about the $450 million target because I think it's important just to underscore that, first of all, capital allocation is an important element of our corporate strategy. So John, as we think about the target and again, the retail and logistics support, you look back historically at our Retail and Logistics segment contribution, it's moved between probably $115 million to $135 million if you combine the two and that's without any overhead allocation to it. I think going into this next quarter, we see our rates pushing up at the refinery that's operating 84,000, 87,000 barrels per day."
