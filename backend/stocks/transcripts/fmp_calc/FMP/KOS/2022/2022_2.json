    "content": " Our three development projects, Tortue Phase 1, Jubilee Southeast and Winterfell are continuing to make good progress and are expected to deliver production growth of around 50% by 2024. In the Gulf of Mexico, net production of 20,600 barrels of oil equivalent per day was above expectations, and around 10% higher than the previous quarter due to less downtime of third-party facilities in the second quarter. The first phase, which can be seen on the right side of the slide, is expected to include five wells, three drilled before first oil, targeting around 100 million barrels of gross recoverable resource. Please state your question. So if you take those inputs and you look at an average gas price, let's say, for '24 and '25 of around $20 and an oil price of, let's say, $100 per barrel, the opportunity could be around $200 million of additional revenue net to Kosmos in total over those two years. The first phase is a five-well development, as I said in my remarks, that's targeting development -- the initial 100 million barrel opportunity, but we think with production data from those initial wells, we would see that being the indicator of a larger resource, and clearly, the infrastructure that we're putting in would enable us then to build and expand to fully access that. So I think the work we've been doing over the quarter to go after FID is around that Phase 1, three initial wells pre-first oil followed by two follow-up wells, but we're anticipating a larger resource, and therefore, the ability to expand from there. Please state your question. Please state your question. Please state your question. Please state your question."
