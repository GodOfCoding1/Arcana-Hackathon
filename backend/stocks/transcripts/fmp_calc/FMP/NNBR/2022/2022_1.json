    "content": " Our presentation today will contain forward-looking statements regarding sales, margins, input cost inflation, supply chain constraints, the impact of the automotive semiconductor chip shortage, foreign exchange rates, cash flow, tax rates, acquisitions, synergies, cash and cost savings, future operating results, performance of our worldwide markets, the impact of the coronavirus or COVID-19 pandemic and the Russian-Ukrainian conflict on the company's financial conditions and other topics. Our sales were up 1% over a very strong first quarter last year, and we generated $13.4 million in adjusted EBITDA, which is our best result since the strong first quarter of last year. Sales for the quarter were $128.1 million, up 1% from the strong performance of a year ago and up $17.7 million or 16% sequentially, inclusive of pricing actions. Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter was $13.4 million or 10.5% of sales, down from $16.9 million or 13.3% of sales a year ago. We had $58.4 million of liquidity, including cash and availability on our ABL as of March 31, 2022, which was a decrease of $6.3 million from Q4 2021, driven by our use of free cash flow in Q1 2022, due to our sequential sales growth and increase in accounts receivable previously noted. Mobile Solutions sales fell 2.2% in the first quarter from one year ago, primarily due to lower sales volumes stemming from supply constraints as well as comparison to a strong first quarter of 2021, which reflected demand driven by pandemic recovery."
