    "content": " Our Performance Coatings Group\u2019s fiscal 2022 third quarter net sales were record $270.9 million, an increase of 19.6% over the year ago period. Adjusted EBIT was a record $26.6 million in fiscal 2022 third quarter, an increase of 5.4%, compared to adjusted EBIT of $25.3 million in the last year\u2019s quarter. Speaking of challenges, the Consumer Group also faced a difficult comparison to the prior year period when sales increased 19.8% and adjusted EBIT increased 48.6% due to elevated demand for its home improvement products during the pandemic\u2019s first phase. Despite these challenges, we expect to generate fiscal 2022 fourth quarter consolidated sales growth in the low teens versus a difficult comparison to last year\u2019s fourth quarter sales, which grew 19.6%. Its EBIT margins have eroded all three quarters of this fiscal year due to inflationary pressures, which have a greater impact on the Consumer Group than RPM\u2019s other segments.
