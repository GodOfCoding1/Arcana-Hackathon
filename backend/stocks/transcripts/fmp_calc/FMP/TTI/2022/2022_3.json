    "content": " As a reminder, our PureFlow fluid is a high purity zinc bromide based electrolyte which is part of a rapidly growing long duration energy storage technology, completion fluids and products third quarter 2022 revenue 59 million increased year-on-year by 22% but decreased from the second quarter of 2022 by 21%. In North America key raw material prices are still inflated and as we exhaust our yearly contractual supply of bromine, we are fulfilling demand with spot market bromine, which will impact our margins in the fourth quarter before resuming to our long-term contract supply volumes and pricing starting in the new year. To demonstrate how those in the lithium business are benefiting from the high lithium prices and strong market demand, let me give you an example of such returns SQM, publicly traded global lithium producer increase their lithium EBITDA from $41 million in the second quarter of last year to $1.2 billion in the second quarter of this year. These types of returns and high profits being achieved in the market by lithium producers, when we're holding significant lithium and bromine assets in Arkansas, explains why the TETRA management team are highly focused on getting these assets to market to create what we believe will be significant shareholder value in the coming years."
