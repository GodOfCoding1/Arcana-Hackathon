    "content": " In the third quarter of 2022, the company reported total net revenues of $46 million, representing an almost 100% increase of our total net revenues of $23 million during the third quarter of 2021, which was mainly the result of the higher average charter rates our vessels earned in the third quarter of this year, compared to last and the fact that we operated -- or we've operated 4 more vessels. Excluding the effect on the income attributable to common stockholders for the quarter of the unrealized gain in derivatives, the amortization of fair value of below market time charter supply and the vessel depreciation and the portion the consideration of vessel supply with attached charters allocated to below market charters, the adjusted earnings attributable to common shareholders for the quarter ended September 30, 2022, which has been $2.90 per share, basic diluted compared to adjusted earnings of $1.16 per share, basic diluted for the quarter, the same period of 2021, a quarter during which we excluded the unrealized gain on derivatives. For the first 9 months of this year, the company reported total net revenues of $139.8 million representing a 150% increase of the total net revenues of $55.6 million during the first 9 months of 2021, again the result of higher average earnings, our vessels earned and a higher number of vessels owned and operated during the period compared to last year. Again, excluding the effect on the income attributable to common shareholders for the first 9 months of this year, of the unrealized gain on derivatives, the amortization of fair value of below market charters acquired and the vessel depreciation on the portion of the consideration of vessels acquired with attached below-market charters, the adjusted earnings per share attributable to common shareholders for the first 9 months of this year, which has been $10.71 basic and $10.67 diluted compared to adjusted earnings per share of $2.76 basic and $2.74 diluted for the same period of last year."
