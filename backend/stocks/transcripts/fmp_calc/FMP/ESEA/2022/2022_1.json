For the first quarter of 2022, Euroseas reported total net revenues of $45.4 million, representing a 217% increase over total net revenues of $14.3 million during the first quarter of last year. Interest and other financing costs for the first quarter of 2022 amounted to about $1 million, compared to $0.7 million for the same period of last year. Adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter of 2022 was $31.1 million, compared to $5.6 million for the same period in 2021, representing a 455% increase. Basic and diluted earnings per share for the first quarter of 2022 were $4.15 and $4.13, respectively, calculated on $7.2 million basic and $7.3 million diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding, compared to basic diluted earnings per share of $0.53 per share for the first quarter of 2021, calculated on about $6.7 million basic diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding. The results for the quarter, which have been $3.71 basic and $3.70 diluted, compared to adjusted earnings of $0.45 per share basic and diluted for the first quarter of last year in a period during, which we excluded unrealized gain on derivatives and the loss on the sale of a vessel. During the first quarter of 2022, our commercial utilization rate was 99.6%, while our operational utilization rate was 99.5%, compared to 100% commercial and 96.7% operational for the first quarter of last year. On average, 16 vessels were owned and operated during the first quarter of 2022, earning an average time charter equivalent rate of $33,996 per day, compared to 14 vessel in the same period of last year earned on average 12,134 per day. Our total operating expenses, including management fees, general and administrative expenses, but excluding drydocking costs, averaged $7,329 per vessel per day, during the first quarter of this year, compared to $6,914 per vessel per day for the first quarter of 2021. Thus, during the first quarter of 2022, our daily cash flow breakeven rate was $14,057 per vessel per day compared to $9,330 per vessel per day for the same period of last year, with the difference primarily due to loan -- to increase loan repayments and drydock expenses.
