    "content": " I believe that Celsion has a very differentiated DNA plasma technology with proprietary, synthetic, non-viral delivery systems that are engineered for gene-based therapies that's the TheraPlas platform or for the expression of multiple pathogen antigens in vaccines and that's a PLACCINE platform. It is important to note that this increase was driven primarily by a one-time expenditure in the first quarter of 2022 for the following: interest expense of $4.5 million related to the sale and subsequent redemption of $30 million of Series A and B convertible redeemable preferred stock, and another $100,000 in costs related to the special meeting of shareholders held in February 2022. For the second quarter ended June 30, 2022, Celsion reported net loss of $6 million compared to a net loss of $5.4 million in the comparable quarter in 2021. The increase in research and development was primarily due to costs associated with the development of GEN-1 to the support the OVATION 2 program, as well as preclinical development activities around our PLACCINE DNA vaccine technology platform, which increased to $1.2 million in the second quarter of 2022, compared to $1.4 million in the same three-month period of 2021."
