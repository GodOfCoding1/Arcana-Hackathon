    "content": " We continue to shape our enterprise towards our long-term strategic goals by introducing exciting, new products; making bolt-on, accretive acquisitions; and using EBX to expand margins and improve cash flow. This acquisition strengthens our position as a leader in gas control technology; and continues to shape ESAB into higher-growth, less-cyclical, mission-critical and higher-margin businesses. As an enterprise, we are focused on growing organically through introduction of new innovative equipment like the Renegade VOLT and the Warrior Edge, supported by our InduSuite and robotics workflow solutions, improving our mix and margins going forward; bolt-on acquisitions like Ohio Medical; and EBX, driving margin expansion and improving cash flow. We think that the geographic opportunities for us to cross-sell our products, whether it be GCE products in North America or the Ohio products globally -- we think that there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a real opportunity there for some volume growth; and build out and strengthen our gas control portfolio that, again, drives high growth, better margins, lower cyclicality and better cash flow for the business. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re very quick as we go out with pricing to the marketplace and we sort of are very deliberate on the way down, so I think that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an expectation that we continue to have within the business going forward. So all in all, what we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re doing is rationalizing the number of product lines, rationalizing the number of SKUs, creating truly innovative products that start on a foundation and a platform that can then be built upon  consistency and simplicity of our supply chain, really exciting stuff that in my view will continue to pay dividends in terms of margins and customer satisfaction over the next 3 to 5 years."
