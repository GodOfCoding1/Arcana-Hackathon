    "content": " We continue to have solid uptake of Ontruzant and Renflexis in the U.S., while the phasing of tenders will show up in quarterly results, year-to-date this business is developing or delivering double-digit growth and we expect results for the full year to demonstrate double-digit growth as well. Given its strong year-to-date performance, we expect the Established Brands franchise to deliver modest revenue growth for the full year 2022 even with some expected impact from volume-based procurement in China in the fourth quarter. The U.S. is an important market representing a quarter of our business, so the 6% growth in that market during the quarter was meaningful and was primarily driven by growth in Nexplanon and also Ontruzant and Renflexis, the two biosimilars that we offer in the United States. Moving across, we saw an approximate $30 million impact coming from price in the third quarter, which is consistent with our expectation that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll see low single digit price erosion on a company-wide basis and this is mostly coming from established brands where products are subject to mandatory price reductions in some markets. Making these straightforward adjustments in the third quarter of 2022, non-GAAP adjusted gross profit was $1.032 billion on revenues of $1.537 billion, representing a gross margin of 67.1%, which was up from 64.9% in the third quarter of last year. As we said last quarter, second half 2022 margins are a directional indicator for what 2023 adjusted EBITDA margins could look like in advance of Organon's formally releasing 2023 guidance, which we will do when we report our full year results in February.
