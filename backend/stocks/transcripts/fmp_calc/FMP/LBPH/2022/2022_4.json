    "content": " Before we begin today, I would like to remind everyone that this conference call and webcast will contain forward-looking statements about the company including, without limitation, statements about the anticipated timing of commencement, enrollment and completion of clinical trials for our product candidates; the anticipated timing of release of clinical trial data; the market opportunity for our product candidates; and the expected timeframe for funding operations with current cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. And so, what we're trying to do is really, in this study, figure out where do we want to push, how do we want to push, how do we want to get patients to that optimal dose where we're balancing both that safety profile that we hope to have as well as that efficacy that comes from dose optimization. But we think there's tremendous unmet need in these orphan neurological conditions where lymphocyte reduction, T cell trafficking, all these things that we've seen with these S1Ps over the last 10 to 15 years could be incredibly valuable to patients who have tremendous unmet needs. But as of right now, we're not seeing a tremendous uptake with fenfluramine in even Dravet alone, let alone in Lennox-Gastaut, such that we think it's necessary, but it's something we've been kicking around for a while as a potential after we see PACIFIC data."
