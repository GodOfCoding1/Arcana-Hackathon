    "content": " We have already paused our real estate growth strategy to better utilize the capacity we already have in place, and we\u2019re reviewing every contract and expense line item to validate that they support our goal to sell more cars and provide the best buying and selling experience for our customers. But generally speaking, I think we need to get us close to capacity as possible in terms of operations, and we need to diversify the mix of vehicles that are coming in so that we\u2019re not just reliant on one source of vehicles but we can get consumer-sourced vehicles as well as commercial consignment, commercial and consumer consignment, which are more profitable for us from the front-end GPU perspective. But again, we\u2019ve mentioned a number of things here on the call from better sourcing to getting arms around the reconditioning cost, working on lead management a lot more, doing a better job with logistics, working on our technology side, all that and then also controlling this SG&A cost in general."
