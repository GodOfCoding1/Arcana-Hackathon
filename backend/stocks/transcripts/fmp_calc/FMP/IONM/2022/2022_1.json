Assure's greatest opportunities going forward include the following: number one, expanding remote neurology services; number two, taking full advantage of our position as a sole contracted provider of interoperative neuromonitoring services for the Premier network and related GPOs; three, organic growth that extends our reach within the existing states and helps us expand into new states, as well as leveraging more than 16 signed distributor agreements; fourthly, utilizing data, analytics and automation to strengthen revenue cycle management and to facilitate the signing of new in-network contracts; and fifthly and lastly, our desire to run leaner over the balance of 2022 as we move forward in our current business model."
