    "content": " For the second quarter of 2022, as compared to the prior year quarter, TA produced the following: a 117% improvement in adjusted net income to $64.4 million; a 67% improvement in adjusted EBITDA to $122.8 million and a 56% increase in trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA to nearly $300 million versus the prior year period. Adjusted EBITDA which excludes two one-time items in each quarter, increased by $49.2 million or 67%, primarily due to strong diesel CPG margin and non-fuel gross margin, particularly in our truck service business. We're really -- it's something in the fuel area that -- the AI machine learning for street diesel, which by the way we talk a lot about that because we're now we finished our Phase 2 beta, and we're preparing to roll that out and scale that as we get into these next couple of quarters here."
