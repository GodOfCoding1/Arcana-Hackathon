    "content": " The first quarter required intensive focus on monitoring inflationary forces and carefully passing through cost increases, managing labor pressures and gaps in operating hours as sourcing products to ensure shelves remain full while continuing to carry out our broad based transformational initial across all parts of the business and ramping up execution on our capital plan. Adjusted EBITDA which excludes two one-time items in the current quarter, increased $26.8 million, or 94%, primarily due to the strong results we generated in both fuel and nonfuel gross margin. Nonfuel revenues increased by $39.2 million or 8.7% and total nonfuel gross margin increased by $19.6 million or 7.1% against 2021, strength in trucks service of 10%."
