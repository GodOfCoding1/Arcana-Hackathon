    "content": " I am pleased to say that we reported continued increasing demand for our industry leading dental lasers in the third quarter, generating a 26% increase year-over-year in our total revenue. Our strong performance, which we have consistently maintained now for the last 2 years, reflects continued positive momentum on several fronts, including continued progress with the Waterlase exclusive trial program as our success rate, the percentage of dentists who purchased after the trial, remains at over 50% year-to-date in 2022. This initiative, along with our continued emphasis on endodontists, periodontist, pediatric dentists and dental hygienist continued to generate increased adoption of our laser technology by new customers, with over 90% of our U.S. Waterlase sales during the quarter coming from new customers and close to 40% of U.S. Waterlase sales coming from dental specialists. We believe each 1% increase in the adoption of our all-tissue laser technology in the U.S. will equal approximately $50 million in additional revenue for BIOLASE, assuming we keep our same 60% historical market share. We have $6.5 million in operating activities, including advanced purchases of inventory and prepayments to secure materials to meet future sales demand as well as $2.7 million invested during the quarter to acquire the manufacturing equipment I mentioned earlier, and to build out our model dental office and training center that we believe will support our efforts to improve the adoption of our dental laser technology. Please pose your question, your line is live. Please pose your question, your line is live. So, when you look at the numbers, every 1% of that, roughly 170,000 dentists in the U. S. assuming we keep our 60% market share, which has been a historical norm for us is $50 million of revenue, basically 1 year\u00e2\u0080\u0099s worth of revenue for us."
