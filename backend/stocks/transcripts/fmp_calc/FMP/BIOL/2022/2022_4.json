    "content": " This initiative and our continued emphasis on dental specialists, including endodontists, periodontist and pediatric dentists, continue to generate increased adoption of our laser technology by new customers with a record 84% of our U.S. Waterlase sales during the year coming from new customers and 47% of U.S. Wireless sales for the full year coming from dental specialists. We believe that if an additional 5% of U.S. GPs adopt our lasers, it would generate $225 million in laser revenue, not including the follow-on consumables. Some additional full year highlights include U.S. laser system sales increased 39% year-over-year to $20.4 million, and U.S. consumable sales increased 25% year-over-year to $7.5 million, an increase to over $11 million on a consolidated basis. So the calculus that we show and what we're showing in the trial program and I said we're well over 50% so far this year is that two procedures a week that you're doing that you weren't doing before, and getting a 200% ROI, the fact that the payments went from $1,000 to $1,300 because the interest rate spike hasn't impacted calculation meaningfully."
