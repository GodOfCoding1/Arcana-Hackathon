Loan facilitation income and other related income decreased by 95% to RMB8.8 million from RMB177 million for the third quarter of 2020, as a result of the reduction in transaction volume of off-balance sheet loans during this quarter. Sales income and others decreased to RMB7.3 million from RMB139 million for the third quarter of 2020, mainly due to the decrease in sales related to the Wanlimu e-commerce platform which we are in the process of winding down. Our cost of revenues decreased by 47.4% to RMB104.6 million from RMB198.8 million for the third quarter of 2020, primarily due to the decrease in costs associated with the loan book business and a decrease in cost of goods sold related to Wanlimu e-commerce platform. Sales and marketing expenses decreased by 49.3% to RMB32.9 million from RMB64.8 million for the third quarter of last year, primarily due to the decrease in marketing promotional expenses.
