As it relates to the sales rep and the quota class (ph), we feel really good about the capacity we're carrying in and it's going to set us up really well not just for this year, but the way we think of FY \u00e2\u0080\u009824 and how that appears. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. So we just presented to our Board this last week the approach we're taking on how to have a more recommendation based set of use cases that we can introduce to our sales team so there's commonality in the core value prop, not so much just like PPM and marketing, but like more specific granular functional used cases in certain industries where we've been very successful. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. Your line is now open."
