    "content": " Today, I'd like to focus on three key areas, a solid Q1 with healthy growth in both revenue and billings, our strengthening leadership position in collaborative work management, project and portfolio management and digital asset management markets, and how we are investing to deliver shareholder value in the years ahead. Your line is open. Your line is open. And I would say it's when you look at the bookings impact, Brandfolder is still relatively small, compared to mainline CWM, but the resonance with customers is really interesting, when I speak with executives and I hear them responding to the use cases they can understand, it's very visual, it's very compelling, it\u2019s an easy value prop to convey, we're seeing some really good uptake. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. I think one of the things as we're investing in our project and portfolio management capabilities, we're starting to have opportunity -- to see opportunities to display, some of the legacy players in that category, where people are looking at PPM and CWM as a composite and that's been a welcome development at some of our larger clients. Your line is open. Your line is open. In terms of whether we've seen a change in diversity, we already started in such a diverse spot industry functional group that I would say the areas where we have -- where you see greater residents is once we've landed where we can really go deep project and portfolio, the Brandfolder work and marketing, we have offerings now that lend themselves really well to that project centricity, the marketing centricity and operation centricity and that's where a lot of our engagement activity is post land. Your line is open."
