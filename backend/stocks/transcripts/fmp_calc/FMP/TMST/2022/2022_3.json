Thanks, and good morning, and welcome to TimkenSteel's third quarter 2022 conference call. Related to our melt shop incident and future utilization, we expect to average approximately 50% to 60% utilization during the fourth quarter, which reflects the continued monthly ramp up of production and some planned annual maintenance shutdown. Turning to our results, third quarter net sales, as well as adjusted EBITDA, both suffered sequentially as a result of lower volumes, higher manufacturing cost and a significant decrease in surcharges due to lower market prices for scrap. In mobile, shipments decreased by 17%, compared with the prior quarters. Touching upon our strategic imperatives, we remain well on track to achieve our targeted $80 million of profitability improvements. In 2022, we expect to realize approximately $25 million of profitability improvements from actions directly linked to our strategic imperatives with the remaining EBITDA improvement expected between 2023 and 2026. I sincerely thank our employees for their hard work during this challenging quarter and our customers for their continued trust, our suppliers for their partnership and our shareholders for their ongoing support. As Mike mentioned, the July melt shop incident significantly impacted our third quarter profitability. While we expect the continued unfavorable impact on profitability in the fourth quarter as we ramp up melt production, we are actively pursuing a business interruption insurance recovery to recoup our losses. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be sharing more details shortly regarding the insurance recovery process, as well as our fourth quarter outlook and views on 2023. Comparatively, sequential second quarter net sales were $415.7 million with net income of $74.5 million or $1.42 per diluted share. On an adjusted basis, the company reported a net loss in the third quarter of $4.1 million or a loss of $0.09 per diluted share. For comparison purposes, adjusted net income in the second quarter was $67.4 million or $1.29 per diluted share. Adjusted EBITDA was $10.8 million in the third quarter, compared to $84.2 million in the second quarter. Drivers of the decrease included lower shipments and higher manufacturing costs, both linked to the melt shop incident in July, as well as the market-driven decline in the raw material surcharge environment. Compared to the same quarter in 2021, adjusted EBITDA decreased by $61.2 million. This decrease is reflective of higher manufacturing costs, a decline in the scrap raw material surcharge environments and lower shipments, partially offset by higher base selling prices. Shipments in the third quarter were 158,500 tons, a decrease of 50,400 tons or 24% compared to the second quarter. Similarly, third quarter shipments decreased 54,200 tons or 25% from the third quarter of last year. In the industrial end-market, shipments totaled 71,300 tons in the third quarter, a sequential decrease of 30,800 tons or 30% driven by available inventory for shipments. Mobile customer shipments were 71,200 tons in the third quarter, a sequential decrease of 14,200 tons or 17%. We expect mobile shipments to return to its targeted level of approximately 40% of the portfolio going forward, compared to 45% of the portfolio in the third quarter. Shipments to energy customers totaled 16,000 tons in the third quarter, a sequential decrease of 5,400 tons or 25%, again driven by inventory available for shipment. Of our total third quarter shipments, approximately 10,000 ship tons were sourced from third-party melt producers that rolled, finished and shipped by TimkenSteel. We expect shipments of third-party melt to more than double in the fourth quarter to help support customer demand, while we continue to ramp up our melt shops. Net sales of $316.8 million in the third quarter decreased 24% compared with the second quarter and decreased 8% compared with the third quarter of last year. The net sales decline, compared with the prior year quarter was primarily driven by lower shipments, partially offset by 30% higher base selling prices. Sequentially, base selling prices increased $107 per ton on average, consistent with our expectations and reflected a continued strength in customer demand. Turning to manufacturing, cost increased sequentially by $32.8 million in total in the third quarter, driven by a significant sequential decline in manufacturing cost absorption as a result of the melt shop incident and ongoing production ramp ups. To the extent possible, the company pulled forward annual maintenance activities in the third quarter to minimize fourth quarter downtime. In comparison to the prior year third quarter, manufacturing cost increased by $54.3 million. Drivers of increased year-over-year manufacturing costs included the impact of lower cost absorption related to the melt shop incidents, as well as increased maintenance and the impact from the current year inflationary cost environment. From an SG&A expense perspective, in the third quarter, SG&A expense was $16.2 million. During the third quarter, operating cash flow was $46.8 million and free cash flow was $41.1 million, primarily driven by lower working capital. Through the first nine months of 2022, the company generated $110.8 million of operating cash flow and spent $15.7 million on capital expenditures. Another liquidity matters, at the end of the third quarter we refinanced our asset-based revolving credit facility or ABL. The amended ABL which matures on September 30, 2027 maintains our borrowing capacity at $400 million and includes improved financial terms and covenants. During the third quarter, the company repurchased 1.3 million common shares at a total cost of $19.7 million. Including the common share repurchase activity completed in October, the company has repurchased 2.6 million common shares to-date in 2022 at a total cost of $44.5 million, leaving just $5.5 million remaining on our $15 million share repurchase program established in December 2021. This common share repurchase activity, combined with the convertible note repurchase activity earlier this year represents a 11% reduction in the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s diluted shares outstanding in comparison to diluted shares outstanding in the fourth quarter of last year. Earlier this week, our Board of Directors authorized an additional $75 million share repurchase program. Regarding pensions, the company recorded a non-cash net loss of $4.8 million in the third quarter, as a result of the required remeasurement of certain pension plans. As I reported last quarter, in July, the company settled $256 million of its U.S. pension obligations through the purchase of a group annuity contract from a highly rated insurance company. However, fourth quarter shipments are expected to continue to be negatively impacted by inventory availability following the July melt shop incidents as well as normal seasonality. As a result, fourth quarter shipments are expected to be slightly lower than the third quarter. Additionally, from a commercial perspective, we anticipate surcharge revenue per ton to decline sequentially given market-driven decreases and scrap prices to-date in the fourth quarter. Operationally, melt utilization is expected to average approximately 50% to 60% during the fourth quarter as we continue to ramp up through the end of year, while also completing planned melt shop shutdown maintenance. The remaining annual shutdown maintenance will be completed this quarter at an expected cost of approximately $3 million with the fourth quarter melt shop utilization impact of the planned shutdown of approximately 5%. Given these elements, the company expects adjusted EBITDA to continue to be challenged in the fourth quarter, excluding any potential business interruption insurance recovery related to the July melt shop incident. The insurance claim components that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re seeking include first, the cost of melt shop repairs, second, any lost sales to customers, third, the incremental cost of third-party purchased melt during the period in which we are recovering from the incidents and fourth, the incremental cost per ton of internal melts as we continue to ramp up production, compared to our historical melt cost per ton. Commercially, in 2023, we expect quarterly shipments to begin to recover to levels experienced in the first half of 2022. Realization of the negotiated base price increases will likely begin late in the first quarter, as we secure of portion of carry over 2022 demand at the beginning of the year. And lastly, from an operational perspective, melt utilization rates are expected to be much improved in 2023 compared to the second half of 2022. No, we are most likely not going to see a pickup in net working capital and our expectation is, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll see modest increases in net working capital in the first half to three quarters of 2023. We do have likely a bit more CapEx in AP, as you saw at the end of the third and our guidance here we revised our CapEx spend and most of that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just because of the cash spend is pushing into 2023 of $6 million to $8 million. So, what our expectation is, is that, we will be back to our targeted utilization rate around that 85%, towards the end of the year going into the first quarter of 2023. Well, like I just said, we are targeting to ramp up through the remainder of this quarter and get back to our targeted utilization rate of 80%, 85% by year end and/or early Q1 of 2023."
