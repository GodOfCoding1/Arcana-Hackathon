    "content": " On an adjusted basis, net income for the first quarter improved to $48.6 million or $0.92 per diluted share. Adjusted EBITDA improved to $65.3 million in the first quarter of 2022, a $3.2 million sequential increase. Compared to the same quarter in 2021, adjusted EBITDA significantly increased by $24.5 million, reflective of higher base selling prices and improved mix. First quarter of 2022 shipments increased 3,000 tons or 2% from the first quarter of last year as a result of improved industrial and energy demand, partially offset by lower shipments to mobile customers. In comparison to the first quarter of 2021, shipments to industrial customers increased by 10,500 tons, reflecting year-over-year improvement in demand, primarily within the distribution channel. Lastly, from an end markets perspective, continued momentum in energy demand drove shipments of 12,600 tons in the first quarter, a slight increase on a sequential basis and over twice the level of shipments in the first quarter of 2021. Cost decreased sequentially by $5.2 million in the first quarter, primarily driven by improved fixed cost leverage and the completion of the annual Faircrest melt shop maintenance shutdown activities that occurred in the fourth quarter of last year. From an SG&A expense perspective, in the first quarter, SG&A increased $1.7 million on a sequential basis to $18.5 million, primarily driven by increased benefit costs and share-based compensation expense. In comparison to the first quarter of 2021, SG&A decreased by $1 million, largely driven by lower employee expense as a result of prior restructuring actions. These restructuring actions resulted in cash severance payments of $1 million in the first quarter of 2022, with approximately $4 million of additional cash severance expected during the remainder of this year. During the first quarter, operating cash flow was $13.3 million, driven by quarterly profitability, partially offset by working capital requirements and the payment of variable compensation earned in 2021. During the first quarter, the company repurchased approximately 170,000 common shares at a cost of $3.4 million."
