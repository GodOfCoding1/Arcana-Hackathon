    "content": " Turning to the results, fourth quarter net sales declined 23% sequentially as a result of a market-driven reduction in surcharge revenue per ton due to lower scrap and alloy prices, as well as the impact from lower shipments. Turning to our fourth quarter results, net sales totaled $245.4 million with a net loss of $33.2 million or a loss of $0.75 per diluted share. Fourth quarter of 2021, net sales were $338.3 million with net income of $57.1 million or $1.07 per diluted share. On an adjusted basis, the company reported a net loss in the fourth quarter of $4.6 million or a loss of $0.10 per diluted share. Net sales of $245.4 million in the fourth quarter decreased 23% compared with the third quarter, and decreased 27% compared with the fourth quarter of 2021. The net sales decline compared to the fourth quarter of 2021 was primarily driven by significantly lower shipments as a result of the unplanned melt shop downtime, and a market driven 27% decline in average raw material surcharge per ton. Sequentially from the third to the fourth quarter of 2022, base selling prices increased $120 per ton on average, reflective of a specialty strong sales mix and resulting base selling prices within the industrial and energy end-markets. From an SG&A perspective, in the fourth quarter SG&A increased $1.2 million on a sequential basis to $17.4 million, primarily driven by higher variable compensation expense. That's perfect, thank you. That's perfect, thank you."
