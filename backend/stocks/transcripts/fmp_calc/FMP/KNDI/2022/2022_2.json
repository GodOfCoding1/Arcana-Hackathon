The main reason that we have not offer our foot space EVs product in is because that we have not met the requirements of the airbag safety requirements standard by the U.S. As a matter of fact, that none \u00e2\u0080\u0093 no one of the China based EVs product has fulfilled such requirement has been over in the U.S. market, even though the mechanism is rather self-ratification process."
