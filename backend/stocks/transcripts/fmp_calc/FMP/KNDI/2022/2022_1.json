    "content": " So my primary question, as I said, has to do with Kandi's decade-old discussion regarding its Quick Battery Exchange and a little bit of background first, since I've been around long enough to see it from the beginning. Even today, there are a few YouTube videos accessible that I personally posted a decade ago showing Kandi battery exchange in action, both robotically and at a changing terminal at around 60 seconds, as well as a roadside mobile exchange in just a moments. This was considered so revolutionary at the time that the PRC government published a white paper in September 2012, recommending for all of China only three charging methods as the preferred mode for EVs, the plug-in, which we still have today, obviously, lease just the battery, but the third one actually named Kandi in the official name of the project was called the Hanju  Kandi lease and battery swap mode. So at that time, the development government agency, they may have not too much experience in this aspect that time they didn't really buy the idea of the battery swap mode, even though they recognize it, but it's not their focus. Like I mentioned earlier on the call, in China right now, it's again about being of losing money in order to achieve certain sales volume in the market, and we are definitely not in that kind of game, and we just don't have that kind of money to compete with these peers."
