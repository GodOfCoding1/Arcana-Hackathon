    "content": " While we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re seeing some orders for stoppers for smaller vials to hold fewer doses, we do not assume a meaningful sales impact in 2022 and expect an overall decline of COVID-19 sales of 20% or $85 million from 2021 sales levels. On the positive side, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re expecting even stronger base business growth in the second half of this year from all three market units of Biologics, Pharma and Generics that is helping to moderate the guidance impact. Your line is open. What we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re seeing in 2022 based on the current visibility and discussions with customers, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re looking at about a 20% reduction of that number, which is about $85 million. And that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s why you hear us talk about, we have capacity that is being installed as we speak, but also into 2023, which will give us more capability to support our customers on the increasing demand we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re seeing and particularly around Biologics and in particular on the higher end of high-value products. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open."
