    "content": " Hello, everyone and thank you for joining the call today to discuss our second quarter 2022 results. For a discussion of the material risks and other important factors that could affect results, please refer to the CarParts.com annual report on Form 10-K and 10-Qs as filed with the SEC, both of which can be found on the Investor Relations website. As reported in today's release for Q2 2022, our team achieved record sales of $176 million, up 12% year-over-year and adjusted EBITDA of $8.3 million. We're also excited to announce our new $150 million, five-year credit facility with our partners at JPMorgan Chase. Our leadership has continued executing on the four areas of focus; outstanding customer service, operational excellence, financial discipline, and innovation. As a reminder, over one-third of our e-commerce revenues come from repeat customers. As we think about capital and resource allocation, we see a significant opportunity to increase our focus and efforts on customer-centric initiatives. As the business continues to grow and evolve, we see opportunities for our teams to collaborate and improve performance by systematically removing inefficiencies and improving  focusing on driving results is key for us, as evidenced with our year-to-date ear to date results and our ability to simultaneously open two distribution centers in this environment. We're always raising the bar and aligning people, process, and strategy with the needs of our customers, which is part of our DNA. As we think about the future, we are committed to growing our addressable market and turning more of our customers into repeat customers. In the spirit of simplifying and removing the stress from vehicle care, we have been working on expanding our offering to include the ability for our customers to find a trusted local mechanic to assist with their repair. With this newly built functionality, some of our customers have the option to book an appointment with a certified mechanic of their choice directly on CarParts.com with full transparency of the installation price. In Q2, we generated revenue of $176 million, up 12% from the prior year period, resulting from the great execution by our entire team. If you'll recall, Q2 of 2021 benefited from the inflow of pandemic-related federal stimulus funds, resulting in an increased consumer spending. Gross profit for the quarter was a record $62 million, up 16% with gross margins improving 120 basis points to 35% this year versus 33.9% in the same year period. Net income for the quarter was $4.1 million versus $2.1 million in Q2 of 2021 and adjusted EBITDA in Q2 was $8.3 million flat to last year, reflecting the impact of self-funding, our new Jacksonville distribution center, including rent and startup expenses. At the quarter end, our cash position was $15 million and we were successful in building our inventory to $163 million. As a reminder, we are currently carrying approximately $40 million or eight extra weeks of inventory to account for longer lead-times in the supply chain. Our goal remains to be able to deliver to 80% to 90% of our customers in one-day transit time and we continue to be pleased with our Texas expansion, which is now fully stocked. We also recently opened our brand new Jacksonville, Florida distribution center that includes new best-in-class technology tools and that over time should drive operational efficiencies. Despite what we're seeing in the broader macro environment, we continue to optimize the business towards a balance of growth and profitability. For the first four weeks of Q3, our robust inventory position is helping us against prior year comparisons. For net revenues in the back half of 2022, we continue to project double digit year-over-year growth. Obviously, we feel very good about how gross margins turning out both up nominally, sequentially, and year-over-year. We continue to leverage our data science team to basically optimize for price as well as leaning on our vertically integrated supply chain, which I think gives us a benefit over some of our competitors, who have a worse ability to stay in stock compared to us. Tom, it's David, I think if you think about auto repair in general, the majority of the time -- at least my experience has been its complex and stressful. Obviously, it's a big project, it's a big endeavor, but we're very excited about the progress. But more importantly, it gives our customer a new option, depending on what type of repair they want to do. Now, as of today, , like we call it out in the prepared remarks, we've done hundreds of successful bookings. But in the last three months, we've made a big push to get this going. Yes, we're really focusing on the customer experience, but over time, and especially, over the long run, I think this is a game changer for our company. I think short-term, in this environment, we're really focusing on free cash flow and profitable growth. So, we really want to get the maximum out of the current network before investing in the new building. Right now, at least internally, the focus is on operational efficiencies and leveraging some of the tools, the new tools and software that we're implementing in Jacksonville, we're really learning and focusing on driving the most out of what we have in the network. Now, medium term, obviously, as we call it out, many times before we're going to open another DC. But again, right now, as far as the main focus is free cash flow and operational efficiencies and getting the most out of the current network. I think that for 2023 peak season, it should really help us. What I'm most excited about, Tom, is really for the second half of the year that as Ryan called it out in his prepared remarks, we're really targeting double-digit year-over-year growth, but at the same time, kind of, balancing that growth and profitability. So, I think I just heard you say to Tom's question that Jacksonville's almost full. I think what -- the challenge with same-store metrics like this for an online retailer is that for us, you're always focusing on delivery speed and so we're constantly optimizing for shipping times and transportation costs. So, if you're looking at it on the same-store basis, it's kind of difficult to quantify. Have we plateaued in terms of that monkey wrench  system and do inventory levels maybe fall from here, plateau, just any kind of color would will be great. Yes, I think we're definitely seeing some signs of improvement. Now, in the past two years, to navigate the supply chain disruption, we have to build this extra safety stock and we have been carrying that extra eight weeks or call about $40 million. Now, as I said, because of the signs of improvement over time, I think that you're going to see this inventory level come down and converted back to cash. Now, it is a little more complicated than just giving you a number because it's at SKU level at the vendor level. But I think over the next, call it, six to 12 months, you're going to see some of that inventory revert back to cash, and us carrying less inventory to support this level of business. So, the number one is the source of customers right now is our existing customer base. On CarParks.com, I think we've built a fantastic destination for auto repair. On top of that, we have a pretty robust email list with millions of customers. And again, as we pulled out, about one-third of our revenues on e-commerce come from repeat customers. So, there's plenty of opportunities for us to offer this, this service to our current customers. So, I think right now at least for Phase 1, we're okay with targeting the current customer. So, we have a technology team, we have a marketing team, we think that to do-it-for me opportunity is going to be a game changer. So, it's just a matter of allocating more resources and more capacity to that, which is how we were able to push out this new phase of the initiative in the last three months. So, right now, the whole team is really focused on making this phase a success. So, it's basically flat year-over-year, a hair down sequential, but I wouldn't read too much into the minor fluctuations. Over the long run, the goal is still to be at that, call it, 45% to 50% mechanical, 45% to 50% collision, and that last, 5% to 10%, performance accessories. Yes, I think every retailer in anyone in the industrial warehouse space is always competing for talents. I think we're always looking to number one, have a safe environment, building a great culture, great values, diversity, inclusion, equality, so we're constantly investing in that. We've also done a good job at setting a compensation structure that incentivizes performance, where we do gain sharing and referral bonuses, retention, bonuses, you know, I think there's a lot of different things that you can do. But ultimately, I think that our warehouse associates are bought into the vision, they're bought into the business that we're trying to build and really a big part of the culture. For us, we always see ourselves as a supply chain company first and the warehouse teams are really the heart of our company. And then last one for me just kind of touching on the Do-it-for Me offering, pretty helpful to hear some of the positive commentary on that. Yes, for this phase of the initiative, we really partnered with mechanics that are already pre-bought in to the fact that they're the customer is going to bring in the parts. So, part of making the initiative a success, at least, for this phase, is to have a pre-selection of mechanics that already know that customers are going to come in. And the scheduling and trend is transparent, and the zip codes and the part names and categories that we're focusing on. Now, obviously, it's a new experience and no one has done it before. And frankly, I'm excited about the feedback from the customer, because it gives them an alternative, if they don't feel comfortable doing the repair themselves, they have this option and also targeting another subset of customers that maybe doesn't feel like doing the repair themselves. Ryan Sigdahl from Craig-Hallum\n Curious on the gross margins, so really sold this quarter, but as you think about kind of all the costs inflation and the moving pieces between how much cargo containers cost coming from China so on and so forth. Obviously, we can only say this, but we think about gross margins, EBITDA margins, we always really take a step back and look at it over multiple quarters in the full year. So, I think we feel very comfortable there as well as far as the remainder of the year. And then obviously, next year, I think, going back to our history over the last three years, no matter what has happened, we've generally done a great job working through it. So, I think whatever kind of pressures the environment might throw at us in 2023, I'm pretty confident our team can handle it. You talked about profitable growth, big focus or increased focus, at least in the near-term. And David maybe a question for you, I've seen some of these tech forward companies that are starting to lay-off people, some good talent out there, and I've seen you kind of go open arms embracing them if they want to come work for CarParts. Yes, I think listen, we've made significant investments in building a culture. We're a culture that rewards discipline, excellence, and high performance. For me, we're trying to build an expectational business and that starts with hiring the best people; hiring, training, developing, retaining. And if you have an exceptional friend and you're willing to work extremely hard to build an exceptional business, I think we can be a great destination. So, right now we're in this short-term phase, where we're focused on the customer experience. And really, if you think about it, there's no place that customers can go that they trust to get their car repaired in a single destination. So, our goal is to get it right for the customer and take that stress out of car repair. Obviously, once we get this nailed down, then the next phase is to scale the offering, scale the market, scale the bookings, and with that obviously comes marketing."
