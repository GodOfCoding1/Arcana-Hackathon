    "content": " In the first quarter, we ran multiple jobs with our top fill-based systems as part of our integrated last mile services offering, which allowed us and our customers to optimize trucking. We believe that adding additional kit to current customers and the benefits of the top fill and AutoBlend combined with sand equipment for new customers, will deliver increases in reliability, direct cost savings, increased speed and superior safety to our customers. Last quarter, we spoke about our commitment to growth capital of between $20 million and $30 million for the first half of 2022, driven by our investments in our top fill and AutoBlend technology. We didn't give a number on the first quarter, but actually, it's closer to 4 in the first quarter, we're ramping that up and you can imply from the capital forecast on what we're going to do, there'll be a mix of top fill units as well as additional blenders. And I think the point is that we effectively believe that we are able to grow our TAM per frac fleet up 2, 3x where it is today on top of additional -- attracting additional customers that may find the top fill delivery and much more attractive solution for them versus using pneumatic trucks in certain markets and certain customer base."
