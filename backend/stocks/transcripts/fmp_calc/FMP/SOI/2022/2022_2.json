    "content": " During the second quarter, our last mile services offering delivered a record amount of sand to well sites throughout the Lower 48, which was an additional contributor to overall profit per system. Last quarter, we spoke about how we frame the potential return opportunity on a per frac crew basis relative to the investments we are making in new technologies, particularly the top fill and AutoBlend units. We believe that for every well site where we deploy a top fill, our last mile services, our fluid silos and our AutoBlend unit, we deploy 2 to 3x the investment and expect 2 to 3x the return or contribution margin per frac crew compared to a single 6-pack sand system. The strong incremental margin increase was driven by a combination of improved last mile profitability, fixed cost absorption due to activity growth and contribution from our new technologies as we deployed more top fill and AutoBlend units. For the third quarter, we expect our fully utilized system count to grow between 5% and 10% sequentially driven by new technology deployments that provide incremental work with both current and new customers and continued focus on customer service. We expect continued improvement in system margin throughout the course of the year primarily driven by contribution from our new technologies, continued execution in our last mile logistics offering and improved system cost absorption with anticipated activity growth."
