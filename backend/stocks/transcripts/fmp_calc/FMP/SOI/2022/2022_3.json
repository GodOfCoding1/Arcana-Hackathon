    "content": " For the fourth quarter 2022, we expect continued pull through demand for sand systems, which can be offset by a frac market that is expected to be flat to down due to normal seasonality around the holidays, resulting in a flat fully utilized sand systems quarter-over-quarter. The strong incremental margin contribution from our top fill and sand system deployments was offset by combination of lower last-mile profitability, higher system support costs, and startup costs associated with ramping new product deployments and activity in underrepresented bases. Luke, a different way of thinking about it is that we've probably continued to add top fills at a similar pace and so you should continue to see both the pull-through that Kyle referenced of additional sand systems, plus the contribution on that two to three-year payback on the growth CapEx in 2023."
