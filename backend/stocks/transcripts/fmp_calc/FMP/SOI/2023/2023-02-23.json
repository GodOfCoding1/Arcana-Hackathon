    "content": " While many operators are currently using either our top fill solution or AutoBlend, approximately one-third of the frac crews we supported in the fourth quarter operated a combination of sand silos, fluid silos, last-mile services, top fill and/or AutoBlend on one well site. We believe that for every well site where we deploy a sand system, a fluid system, top fill, AutoBlend and last-mile services, we deploy approximately two to three times the investment and expect two to three times the return on ore contribution margin per frac crew compared to a single six pack. We're already seeing these incremental returns on well sites that incorporate our new technologies as we continue to ramp up additional deployments over the coming quarters, we would expect to see our overall profit per system grow over time, as well as continued pull through benefits to sand system deployments and new customer additions. During the quarter, we continued to manufacture new top fill units, adding approximately six top fill units on a fully utilized basis bringing the fourth quarter to a total of 15 units. We are revising our 2023 capital expenditure guidance to a range of $65 million to $75 million, which accounts for improving operational efficiencies and flexibility to respond to changing market dynamics, while maintaining our plans for continued top fill system deployments."
