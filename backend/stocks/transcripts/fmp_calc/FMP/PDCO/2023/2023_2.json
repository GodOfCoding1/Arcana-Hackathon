    "content": " Consolidated reported sales for Patterson Companies in our fiscal '23 second quarter were $1.63 billion, a decrease of 1.4% versus the second quarter one year ago. Adjusted operating expenses as a percentage of net sales for the second quarter of fiscal '23 were 15.9%, and unfavorable by 60 basis points compared to one year ago. In the fiscal '23 second quarter, our consolidated adjusted operating margin was 4.3%, a decline of 20 basis points compared to the second quarter of last year. Again normalizing for the negative impact from the mark-to-market valuation of our equipment financing portfolio, our consolidated adjusted operating margins for the fiscal second quarter improved by 30 basis points compared to the prior year. Internal sales of value added services in the second quarter of fiscal '23 increased 7.8% over the prior year period, led by the strong year-over-year performance of our technical service team and double-digit growth of our software business. In the second quarter of fiscal '23, internal sales for our Animal Health business increased 0.7% compared to the second quarter of fiscal '22. Excluding this deflationary impact, internal sales for our production animal business increased by 0.7%, and industry data would indicate that our sales team and production continues to outperform the overall market during the fiscal second quarter. Adjusted operating margins in our Animal Health segment were 3.8% in the fiscal second quarter, an increase of 40 basis points from the prior year. Your line is open. Your line is open.
