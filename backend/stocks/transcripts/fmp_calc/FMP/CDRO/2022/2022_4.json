    "content": " Starting with the highlights of the quarter on Page 7, we've been able to deliver a strong set of results in the fourth quarter with an impressive 70% net gaming revenue growth versus last year to nearly 38 million, confirming the acceleration of revenue growth trend that we anticipated when providing our initial outlook for 2022. Turning back to the fourth quarter with a significant growth in the net gaming revenue was driven by 54% increase in our active customer to nearly 142,000 together with a 10% increase in average monthly spend per customer to \u00e2\u0082\u00ac88 to \u00e2\u0082\u00ac89. Turning to the Spanish operating and financial metrics, net gaming revenue in the fourth quarter increased 42% versus the prior year quarter, despite a lower 8% increase in active customers, due to the significant increase in spend proactive in the quarter. No, I was just going to say for starters, on the just to make it apples-to-apples, though the 155 would have included Italy, I think looking back at prior three year plans that we have, it was probably $4 million to $5 million of Italy, and that $155 million number for 2023. I think if Argentina would have come online, if some of the other regions in Argentina would have come online earlier, I think we would be more -- we would probably wrapping more around that 150 number, but getting some of the timing delays and getting launched in other regions in Argentina versus what we would have thought, let's say a year ago, and what our expectations would have been our objectives would have been. Yes, so Mike, I think as Moshe mentioned in the prepared remarks, what we're expecting is for full year 2024 to be both EBITDA positive and cash flow positive, so that that's, that's, that's a little bit different than maybe what we've said in the past, where we've said, we would be turning the corner and '24 would be generating positive cash flow, but really never committed to being EBITDA positive in 2024. In terms of 2023, I think, I would just say in terms of where we think we would end the year in terms of cash that the EBITDA guidance that we're giving is a good proxy for what we would actually be expecting in the year for cash burn."
