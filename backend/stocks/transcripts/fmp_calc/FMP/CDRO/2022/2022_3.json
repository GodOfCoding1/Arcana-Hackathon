    "content": " We've been able to deliver a strong set of results in this quarter, in the third quarter with the net gaming growth accelerating significantly to 54% versus last year to nearly \u00e2\u0082\u00ac31 million a 5% sequential increase versus the third quarter despite the usualQ3 headwinds from seasonality on the sports betting side of the business. We did so in the average cost of \u00e2\u0082\u00ac200 per customer, which is higher than the third quarter, given the increased in marketing efforts to attract customer ahead of the start of the season, but also due to the timing differences in marketing spend in Mexico, which we discussed in our second quarter earnings call. Turning to Page 9 of the presentation, consolidated net gaming revenue grew 54% to \u00e2\u0082\u00ac31 million in the third quarter, driven by an 82% growth in Mexico to nearly \u00e2\u0082\u00ac13 million and a 29% growth in Spain to \u00e2\u0082\u00ac15 million. Turning to the Spanish operating and financial metrics, we see net gaming revenue in the third quarter increased 29% versus the prior year quarter, despite only having 4% more active customers due to the increase in spend per active."
