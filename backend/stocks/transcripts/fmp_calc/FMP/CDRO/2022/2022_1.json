    "content": " Also, based on the feedback that we have received from a number of you following our fourth quarter earnings call, in today's presentation, we are providing both consolidated income statements and country level net gaming revenue and adjusted EBITDA on a quarterly basis throughout 2020 and 2021, in addition to of course, first quarter 2022 figures. In regards to EBITDA performance by country and as discussed in our prior earnings call, we had a significant uptick in negative EBITDA in the quarter, primarily due to higher levels of marketing investment and furtherance of our accelerated growth throughout this business. Adjusted EBITDA in the first quarter decreased to negative $13 million, in line with our expectations, primarily due to this increased level of marketing investment and, to a lesser extent, higher platform content, technology and personnel expenses incurred in the period. Overall, the net working capital position of the business decreased to negative $28 million by quarter's end, primarily as a result of the $10 million increase in accounts payable, which was due to both the delay in the invoicing from certain of our Mexican media partners, but also delay in payment of certain services provided by Codere Group."
