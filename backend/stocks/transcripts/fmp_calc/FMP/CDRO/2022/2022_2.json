    "content": " Turning to the financial results for the second quarter, and as Moshe mentioned, consolidated net gaming revenue grew 41% to \u00e2\u0082\u00ac29 million, driven by an impressive 85% growth in Mexico to nearly \u00e2\u0082\u00ac12 million and an equally impressive 12% growth in Spain to over \u00e2\u0082\u00ac14 million, exceeding the levels we had prior to the regulatory restrictions that came into effect starting in May of last year. As we discussed in last quarter's earnings call, the uptick in negative EBITDA versus the prior year quarter was primarily due to the higher levels of marketing and other operational investments to drive the accelerated net gaming revenue growth we are delivering and expect to continue delivering into year-end. Some of this is I would say largely that that's driven by some of the timing issues that I alluded to in my prepared remarks specifically in Mexico where toward the, let's say the back half of the second quarter, we took our foot a little bit off the pedal in terms of some of the line marketing that doesn't necessarily have any immediate impact in terms of the top line revenue that we deliver."
