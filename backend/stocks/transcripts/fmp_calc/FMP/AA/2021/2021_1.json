    "content": " And I think it\u2019s particularly important given how much -- how many changes we\u2019re seeing in the market, not only when you look at the -- some of the things we talked about with China, over the course of this last -- or this last 40 minutes, but also when you think about this low-carbon revolution and the expectation for responsible production that we have embedded into the aluminum stewardship initiative and some other work that we\u2019re doing. And when you look across the portfolio and you think about how can we drive great returns across the product lines that we have, you\u2019ve got the ELYSIS partnership, which is developing, which I think is a great opportunity, although still a bit far out because it\u2019s in the midst of research and development, but also along the lines and across aluminum, when you look at some of the most competitive plants where you have real support, both from a pricing standpoint and from a desire to have that industry in country. It requires significant negotiations in order to reopen your power contract or to find the way to -- outside of just the pricing environment, which can come and go, be quite honest, while we always assume it\u2019s going to be a positive future, I think you need to -- everyone would need to consider that. And again, I think it\u2019s -- we\u2019re very careful not just to look at today\u2019s prices, but really to look forward at least 12, 18 or more months because of the time it we take in order to pay back that investment."
