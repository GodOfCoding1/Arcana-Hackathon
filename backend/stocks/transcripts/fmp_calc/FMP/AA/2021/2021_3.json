    "content": " Adjusted EBITDA, excluding special items, also increased up 18% sequentially to $728 million, much higher than last year's $284 million. In the first 9 months of 2021, the aluminum segment has had its best year so far with nearly $1.4 billion or 73% of Alcoa's total adjusted EBITDA, excluding special items of $1.9 billion. The $110 million increase in adjusted EBITDA, excluding special items was driven by higher metal prices, as well as favorable currencies, slightly higher alumina prices, and better product pricing in alumina and aluminum. 9 months of 2021 free cash flow less non-controlling interest distributions was negative 51 million due to the second quarter's $500 million pension funding, but was positive $320 million in the third quarter due to the strong EBITDA partially offset by a three-day increase in days working capital. However, at the San Ciprian Refinery and Smelter, the current high-energy cost in the country and the strike if both persists through the quarter end, are expected to be primary factors decreasing adjusted EBITDA, approximately $100 million sequentially, and increasing working capital sequentially, $120 million."
