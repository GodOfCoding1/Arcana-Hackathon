    "content": " On our financial results, our quarterly net loss was driven primarily by a non-cash charge for pension annuitization, coupled with the sequential decline in Aluminum and Alumina prices and higher costs for energy and raw materials. When comparing the third quarter EBITDA to the second quarter, the largest driver was $516 million of lower metal and Alumina prices, followed by higher energy and raw material costs of $126 million. In the segments, Bauxite improved $10 million on higher intercompany pricing and better volume, partially offset by lower unfavorable mix of contracts at CBG and higher production costs. In the Alumina segment, the $274 million EBITDA decline was due to lower index prices, higher production costs, higher gas prices at San Cipri\u00c3\u00a1n and higher caustic prices, partially offset by benefits of the San Cipri\u00c3\u00a1n refinery production. The largest EBITDA decline was in Aluminum, $444 million, due primarily to lower metal prices and the inability of production cost improvements to fully offset higher energy costs, higher carbon costs and slightly weaker value-added pricing. The third quarter cash balance declined $206 million sequentially to $1.4 billion, primarily due to capital returns to stockholders of $168 million. In Alumina, we expect approximately $20 million in lower energy costs at the San Cipri\u00c3\u00a1n refinery. In the Aluminum segment, we expect Alumina costs to be favorable by $30 million, also higher raw material costs, lower Warrick power plant sales and lower value-add product premiums are expected to be offset by lower energy costs at Lista. Further, due to rapid metal price changes at the end of the third quarter and inventory adjustments made to net realizable value, we expect EBITDA in the fourth quarter to be $40 million higher than calculated using prorated annual metal sensitivities. Now when you look at that on a lagged basis as it flows through our cost of goods sold, we are anticipating around $25 million, $28 million higher raw material costs in the fourth quarter."
