    "content": " Based off what we're seeing in the market today, including our September and October open contracts, we're seeing more like over 25% volume reductions driven by lower unit sales and recent third party forecasts predict lower 2023 volume driven by a decline in unit sales versus their 2022 forecasts. Going forward, our most important focus is on the challenging environment ahead, executing cost savings, making prudent growth investments and capitalizing on the better competitive dynamics to set us up for even stronger outcomes and greater competitive differentiation as the market improves. Your line is open. And then you saw a little bit of quarter by quarter variation, especially year-over-year, like as we started adding those back when volume completely boomeranged back, to that point, if volumes are still down next year, I would fully expect that some of these temporary cost savings remain temporary cost savings in line with whatever the market is delivering for us. Your line is open. If I can just kind of take on kind of the competitive environment side of it, look I think the reality is we're seeing a better competitive environment for us because if you go into kind of a downturn, it kind of exposes different people's strengths and weaknesses and you see a lot of competitors kind of pulling back compared to in better markets. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open."
