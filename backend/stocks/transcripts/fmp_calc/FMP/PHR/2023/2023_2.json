So I think we think from our perspective, it's pretty healthy, and it is hard to increase that statistic when you're adding so many clients every quarter. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. The overall payment volume that we report every quarter, if you look at that, I think many of the analysts who look at it this way, if you look at that on a per client basis, it's pretty clear the commentary from our letter and Chaim's opening comments, that something unusual was going on with a lot of sort of catch-up utilization last year, and we're still working through that. The reason we're doing well, like without a question is our client success team, our sales organization, our demand gen team, our marketing team, it is -- they are just doing a phenomenal just -- I'm just so excited every time I get on the weekly calls that I listened in, and I just -- that's first point.
