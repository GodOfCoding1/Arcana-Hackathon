    "content": " Furthermore, actual results may differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements and will be affected by a variety of risks and factors that are beyond our control including, without limitation, statements about our future financial performance, including our revenue, cash flows, costs of revenue and operating expenses, our anticipated growth, our predictions about our industry, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business and our ability to attract, retain and cross-sell to healthcare provider clients. And I think it's the reason we had the quarter we had, is all of those teams across the board really lean into our go-to-market and they're just incredible individuals that work really, really well together. And when we say, investment, we think \u2013 I sort of think about it as years, it's not so much months, but we do expect there to be continued growth in our life sciences org. And I think when we look at it, I don't think we really know why the patient is coming back this particular quarter, if it's regular seasonality patterns that we see, which is a major part of it, right, whether it's higher payments of the patient responsibility in the earlier part of the year, there could be a delayed visit to the doctor, but we really don't know. So, I think when we look forward to the rest of the year, there's some unpredictability based on the pandemic, but we've seen it's really disrupted patient visits over the past 15 months. And I think that's very different than what you often see in sort of the other verticalization of payments, right, where banks are still using their \u2013 the large things are still using their treasury relationships to try capture the vast majority of the payment revenue."
