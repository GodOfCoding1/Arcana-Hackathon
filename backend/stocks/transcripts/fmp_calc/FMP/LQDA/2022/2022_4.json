    "content": " I'd like to now turn the call over to Rajeev Saggar, our CMO and one of those key 2022 hires, expand on why we are so excited about the YUTREPIA's unique product profile and why we believe we are ideally positioned to provide a differentiated best-in-class option for patients. In fact, given the device's proven track record with obstructive lung diseases, there is considerable interest among medical professionals to use YUTREPIA, particularly for patients with pulmonary hypertension associated with interstitial lung disease or PAH where lung restriction and impaired respiratory effort are comped. With the 901 patent having been dropped, we would now be able to see final approval for YUTREPIA if the decision of the District Court in the Hatch-Waxman litigation is affirmed on appeal with respect to the 066 patent and either the District Court's decision regarding the 793 patent is reversed on appeal or the PTAB's decision regarding the 793 patent is a firm done appeal. Your line is open. First thing is that, I think it's very important that YUTREPIA has been studied in pulmonary arterial hypertension patients in the INSPIRE database  enable to successfully YUTREPIA to doses equivalent up to 27 breadth, four times a day of TYVASO, which is incredible. Operator, next question, please. Your line is open. Operator, next question, please. Your line is open. Operator, next question, please. Your line is open. Operator, next question, please. Your line is open."
