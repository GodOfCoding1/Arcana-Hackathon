    "content": " In dollar terms for the third quarter, this drove the largest negative quarterly impact from foreign currency translation so far this year, a $216.6 million or 6.3% reduction of revenue. It's clear that growth was solid overall, but vary widely by region and as expected, each region grew a bit less than they did in the second quarter, both in the U.S. and internationally, in Q3, Organic growth was primarily driven by revenue growth in Advertising & Media, Precision Marketing, Commerce & Consulting and Public Relations. Our third quarter operating profit was $546 million, a 1% increase from last year, net of a reduction of 5.2% due to the impact of foreign currency translation. Just keeping with the theme of trying to think about the strong results to continue to deliver and the macro, we're all worrying about, could you talk to us a little bit, John, about the performance of the company this year thus far in the UK and the euro markets where arguably the macro maybe is the most concerning and yet you're doing double-digit growth."
