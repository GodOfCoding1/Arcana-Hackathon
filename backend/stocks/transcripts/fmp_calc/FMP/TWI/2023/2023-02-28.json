    "content": " Looking at the fourth quarter, we closed the year out well with $510 million in revenue, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s up 4.5%, and also the first time we have ever surpassed $500 million in Q4. The strong farmer income for recent years combined with that pent-up large equipment demand from \u00e2\u0080\u0093 that is really still lingering from that supply chain and labor disruptions over the past couple of years, this along with continuing low levels of available used equipment, all continues to bode very well for 2023 large ag demand. Agricultural segment net sales were $275 million, an increase of $10 million or 4% from Q4 last year, excluding FX and the lack of Australian sales, this growth was 7%. This segment\u00e2\u0080\u0099s gross profit for the fourth quarter was solid at $5.8 million and gross margins were 15%, improving nicely from Q4 last year. This improvement in dollars and margin are primary reflective of positive mix of products, again, most notably growth from specialty products in the U.S. Our SG&A and R&D expenses were $33 million in the Q4, which represented 6.5% on net sales in line with previous quarter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s performance and the full year. And then on another really strong free cash flow quarter you didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t pay down debt, obviously you have over $150 million on the balance sheet now CapEx up a little bit, but as you noted, you still should be looking at a pretty strong cash flow year. So therefore those tires, as they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re converting those oil \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Russian oil byproducts into tires, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re importing them into the U.S. And so again, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a combination of the case that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve previously filed with the ITC regarding Indian imports, and we were victorious in that five years ago."
