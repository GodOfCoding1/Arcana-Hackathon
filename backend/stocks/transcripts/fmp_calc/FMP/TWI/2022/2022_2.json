So given our strong Q2 performance and our current visibility in the second half of the year, we now expect 2022 full year sales of around $2.2 billion and we have increased our target for adjusted EBITDA to be between $240 million and $250 million. Our adjusted EBITDA was $100 -- was $82 million, which increased $25 million from last quarter and $45 million from Q2 last year. Our Agricultural segment net sales were about 56% of total sales again this quarter or $319 million, an increase of $87 million from a -- from Q2 last year and was up sequentially from Q1 by almost $9 million, representing 3% sequential growth. Our Agricultural segment gross profit in the second quarter was $62 million, up from $35 million in the prior year, representing a 75% improvement year-over-year. Gross profit within the Earthmoving and Construction for the second quarter was $36 million, which represented improvement as $14 million or 63% from gross profit last year. Gross profit in the segment for the second quarter was very strong at $11 million, an increase of $7.6 million from last year. Our operating cash flow was strong at $67 million in the quarter, which is driven by the healthy increase in our bottomline along with continued working capital management, even with a sequential quarterly sales growth. Our capital spending was in line with expectation at close to $12 million, which means we generated $56 million in free cash flow in Q2, bringing year-to-date free cash flow to $29 million. We made a marked improvement this quarter from last quarter as well, due to the improvement in EBITDA, but we also paid down debt at $34 million in the quarter, using our strong free cash flow generation."
