    "content": " Let's start with our biggest highlights for the quarter, Q1 represents the seventh quarter of sequential sales growth in net sales grew 14% sequentially from Q4 and 38% from last year in the first quarter, our gross profit grew 63% from last year and our margin reached 15.6% which is the highest we have seen in almost a decade. I will update you and on a few other key metrics for the year and a little bit, but here if you are important points relative to the segment performance in the quarter, starting with agricultural segment net sales accounted for 56% of total sales this quarter and were 310 million, an increase of 101 million from Q1 last year and was up sequentially from Q4, almost $45 million representing 17% sequential growth. The segment's gross profit for the first quarter was 7.4 million, a $3.7 million increase from Q1 last year and the gross margins were strong at 16.5%, improved from Q1, 2021 margins reflecting the positive mix of products and solid pricing. Titan is a reflection of what our team has accomplished and what we're capable of doing and we've seen that over the last couple of years, but I also want to just make sure that it's clear, it's deeper than that we didn't just wake up in January of 2022 and all these things is fell into place."
