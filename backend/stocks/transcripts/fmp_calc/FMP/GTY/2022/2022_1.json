    "content": " Our adjusted funds from operations or AFFO increased 12.5%, and our AFFO per share of $0.52 represented a 6.1% increase over the prior year\u2019s quarter. Year-to-date, the company has invested approximately $53 million, including the acquisition of 2 convenience stores for $7 million during the first quarter; the acquisition of 10 car washes and 1 convenience store for $43 million subsequent to quarter-end; and approximately $3 million of total development funding year-to-date across 4 projects, including both new-to-industry convenience stores and car washes. I am also pleased with our recent capital markets execution, including our credit facility refinancing and ATM equity issuance in the fourth quarter of 2021 and the 2-tranche $225 million debt private placement we completed in the first quarter, which position us well to fund our growth pipeline."
