    "content": " A flywheel that is shown in slide 11 would do the following, would drive very strong growth in subscription and subscription services, which in turn would also increase sales growth across the company overall; second, generate large amounts of durable recurring revenue, which would establish high levels of revenue predictability and visibility; third, this flywheel would establish a compelling business model, a model that would generate significant revenue growth while at the same time driving both increases in gross margin percentage and reductions in SG&A as a percent of sales with the result that a significant percentage of incremental revenue would flow through to increases in adjusted EBITDA and cash flow; and that this would, fourth, achieve accelerated growth in adjusted EBITDA and cash flow, which would in turn allow us to, point number five, make ongoing investments in the business, which will allow us to further accelerate the velocity of this virtuous cycle while also returning capital to shareholders."
