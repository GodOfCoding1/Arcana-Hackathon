    "content": " In conclusion, the performance of our core assets in the first quarter reinforce our confidence to deliver on our ambition to grow our core asset mid-single-digit CAGR over the period of 2020-2025, reach 2020 General Medicine sales in 2025, excluding EUROAPI sales and deliver roughly stable overall General Medicines sales in 2022 as announced at 2021 full year results. On the next page, looking at our Q1 net sales performance, I'm thrilled to announce that we have delivered a powerful 17% growth, doubling -- more than doubling our cough and cold business and with a strong double-digit growth in most of our categories and geographies also growing versus pre-pandemic levels in Q1 '19 and 2020. It seemed to be an easy quarter 1, but still, I think what we can say is that, of course, as you mentioned, with the cough and cold season almost behind us, the strong market growth and the performance of Q2, Q3 and Q4 last year, we believe that the market will go more to normalized levels. Brendan O'Callaghan, I'm leading Industrial Affairs at Sanofi since Q4 of last year, before which I led the biologics manufacturing organization since 2015, primarily supporting Bill and the Specialty Care organization across the therapeutic areas that he's responsible for in immunology, oncology, rare disease, rare blood disease."
