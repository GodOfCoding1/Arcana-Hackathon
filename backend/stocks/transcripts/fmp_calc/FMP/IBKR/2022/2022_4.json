    "content": " Commissions rose versus last year despite declining global market indices, reaching $331 million our third highest quarter ever. The drop from the prior year quarter was driven primarily by the risk off positioning of customers, which led to a reduction in risk exposure fees from $18 million to $6 million. In our operating data on pages six and zeven, our contract volumes for all customers rose 23% over the prior year quarter and futures well above the industry growth. Total GAAP net interest income was $565 million for the quarter, up 92% and $1.7 billion for the year, up 45%. Higher interest rate led to margin loan interest income, up 32% over the third quarter and 182% over prior year quarter more than compensating for lower average balances in both periods. And -- but as long as our expenses don't increase only higher than our revenues, I think we're going to continue to run at around 70% profit margin, and that's good enough for us. Maybe just a follow-up on the commentary earlier regarding the sales effort adding 10% to 20% to account growth per year, I'm just wondering is that with the current sales team and marketing budget and when we think about that 15% expense growth in sales and marketing and area you're prioritizing."
