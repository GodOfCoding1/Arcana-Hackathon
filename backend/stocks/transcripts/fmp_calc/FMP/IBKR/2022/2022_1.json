    "content": " Products which carry a higher commission, so in the case of futures, they also carry a higher cost, with 56% of futures commissions taken up by exchange, clearing and regulatory fees, likely due to a lack of competition in the largest futures market in the U.S. Higher DARTs led to commission revenues rising to $349 million, also the second highest in company history, behind only the unusually active trading period last year. On page seven, you can see that our account growth remains robust with over 132,000 net account adds in the quarter and total accounts reaching 1.8 million, up 36% over the prior year. Total customer DARTs were over 2.5 million trades per day, second highest in company history, surpassed only by last year\u2019s extreme first quarter activity, but up 4% from strong fourth quarter trends. Our cleared IBKR Pro customers paid an average of $2.57 commission per cleared commissionable order, up 11% from last year, as our clients\u2019 volume mix included proportionately more futures than last year. Total GAAP net interest income was $282 million for the quarter, down 8% on the year ago quarter, reflecting strength in margin lending offset by fewer opportunities in securities lending. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. We compare that to the first quarter of last year and even excluding the, I think, $19 million or so of one-time Brexit expenses last year, the fixed expense growth rate was still only 8% or so year-on-year, which is lower than your historical growth rate, as well as I think the guidance range, which is closer to that 15% type range for fixed expenses. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. Your line is now open."
