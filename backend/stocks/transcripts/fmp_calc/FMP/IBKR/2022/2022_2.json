    "content": " Higher DARTs and commission per trade led to our total commission revenues rising to $322 million, the third highest in company history and behind only the unusually active trading periods in the first quarters of this year and last. Execution, clearing and distribution costs rose 43% from last year led by strong futures volumes, which carry higher fees, lower exchange liquidity rebates, and a smaller clearing fee rebate than in last year's second quarter. Our total assets were $113 billion at the end of the quarter with growth over the last year driven by increases in our segregated cash and securities, partially offset by a reduction in customer margin loans. On Page 7, you can see that our account growth remains robust with over 114,000 net accounts added in the quarter and total accounts reaching 1.9 million, up 36% over the prior year. Our cleared IBKR Pro customers paid an average of $2.74 commission per cleared commissionable order, up 15% from last year as our clients' volume mix included higher per order contributions from stocks and options. Total GAAP net interest income was $348 million for the quarter, up 27% on the year-ago quarter, reflecting stronger margin loan and segregated cash interest partially offset by higher interest expense on customer cash balances. As I said, the current account growth is roughly 40% below our average growth over, say the last year and these new types of accounts will start kicking in very, very late this quarter and then gradually more and more of them through the first quarter of next year."
