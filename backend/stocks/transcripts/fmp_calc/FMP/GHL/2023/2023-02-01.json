    "content": " For a discussion of some of the risks and factors that could affect the firm's future results, please see our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K. Our revenue was $95.8 million for the fourth quarter and $258.5 million for the year, and our earnings per share was $0.95 for the quarter and $0.15 for the year. Between the projects we carried into 2023, expectations for an improving operating environment as interest rate hikes wind down and the likelihood of improved advisory activity and restructuring as well as M&A, we expect a considerably stronger first half than we've seen in the last few years as well as a return to higher revenue and more typical profit margins for the full year ahead. Our non-compensation costs were $18.3 million for the quarter and $58.1 million for the year, a bit higher than last year, given a loss on foreign currency movements, a somewhat unusual professional fee paid to a co-adviser, increased travel expenses and carrying 2 London leases while we built out some new space there."
