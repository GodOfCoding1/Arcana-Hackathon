But if we focus on the comp dollars, as you think about the fourth quarter here, does 3Q -- perhaps the right way to think about what -- like is kind of the right run rate for the fourth quarter as we think about a full year comp expense.

I'm going to think it's going to be a record year or something like that, like last year was for overall M&A activity, but we feel like 2023 could hold up pretty well."
