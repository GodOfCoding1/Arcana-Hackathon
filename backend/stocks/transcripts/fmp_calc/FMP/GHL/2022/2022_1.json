    "content": " For a discussion of some of the risks and factors that could affect the firm's future results, please see our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, and current reports on Form 8-K. Our backlog suggests that, this year is likely to play out like the last few, where quarterly revenue range from the $40 million to the $140 million. Well, I think based on a lot of years of doing this, I would say that unless an assignment is pretty far advanced by April or May -- you're -- if it's a large one, you're probably not going to get it done this year. So, a firm of our size that's going to happen sometimes, where you may have a year of sort of underperformance relative to the market just because your clients, your deals didn't get done or last year, we talked a lot about having a very high volume of deals, but not that many big deals. And I suspect that as the year wears on and then into the beginning part of next year, life at the big banks, which felt I think pretty attractive last year, is going to feel much less so. But, I think the trend of more people wanting to get out of big banks will sort of revert to the norm, which is pretty significant interest in that as this year wears on and the reality of a different capital markets environment sets in. Does it feel like it is, or is there something specific that you would point to that makes you feel better, I guess maybe just off of maybe a low bar from last year if that's just what it is, but I'm curious if there's any other color you can provide there."
