So it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s definitely been something that we have been focused on for the past couple of years, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve heard us talk about this that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve grown, obviously, domestically in our first 5 years, but we always have positioned the company to grow internationally and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re spending time not only in the casino sector but also in the experiential sector outside the U.S. and study in markets where we think we would like to own real estate, and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re in the middle of that process and understanding the underwriting and understanding the countries where we would own real estate and their laws and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re right in the middle of it, Tony. As most of you on this call know, bank credit, especially to real estate credits has effectively dried up and I was reading the transcript as the Blackstone call last week, which I always do because if you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t listen to what John Gray is saying at any given time, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re missing an opportunity to pick up a lot of intelligence, and I thought it was telling the degree to which John was emphasizing to read it, they believe a lot of their real estate capital allocation in the near to midterm is going to be credit-focused. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. Todd, good to talk to you. Todd, good to talk to you. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. Your line is now open."
