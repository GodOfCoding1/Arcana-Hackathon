    "content": " Number one, same-store NOI growth based on key lease terms regarding escalation and CPI protection; number two, internal funding capability based on cash retention; number three, the capability and opportunity to invest incrementally in existing assets and return for incremental rent; number four, the ability to source acquisitions when the frequency and intensity of asset marketing processes lessen; number five, access to investment-grade credit when high-yield markets may be constricted or costly. Pro forma for the annualization of VICI's net income and debt service, having enclosed Venetian and MGP, if we maintain a dividend payout ratio between 75% and 80%, that would leave between $400 million to $500 million of retained earnings available to us for investment annually, a competitive advantage during periods when market may be constricted. One point answer that Spenser that I'd like to add -- Spenser I was just going to say one more point I want to add on top of what John just rightly said, is that with all the focus on inflation, I think it's important to note that, obviously, we, VICI, enjoy superior CPI protection in our leases versus other triple nets. I mean based on what we've heard, we now have Caesars, MGM and The Venetian running assets in Las Vegas who run the largest convention business there that they are seeing that business planning to return later this year and very strong, as you've heard them say in their earnings in 2023. And then with the index inclusion that has occurred with the MGP Class A shareholders being converted to VICI Class -- to VICI shareholders and then potentially one day S&P 500 inclusion, we can continue to lower our cost of equity capital to -- as you said, Jay, and frankly, so broaden that funnel and continue to diversify both in and outside of gaming."
