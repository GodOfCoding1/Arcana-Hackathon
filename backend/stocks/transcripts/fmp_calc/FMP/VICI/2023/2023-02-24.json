    "content": " In February of 2018, the time of VICI's IPO, I don't think any of you would have been very excited if I told you that the ensuing 5-year period from VICI IPO through year-end 2022 would be a period in which the S&P 500 Index would generate cumulative total return over that period of 48.5% or that their RMZ REIT index would generate cumulative total return of 27.9%. Once you've made those comparisons, I believe you'll find that VICI offers what we believe to be one of the more compelling 2023 price earnings growth or PEG plus yield ratios that you will find among all S&P 500 REITs. So what you'll see us do over the next 5 years is continue to grow categorically, continue to grow geographically, do accretive deals be willing to over-equitize in the way David spoke of at the beginning and answering Tony's question and just make sure that we never put the value we've created together with our investors at risk. I mean part of what we're proud of is that we've taken the time to go talk to all the operators inside the gaming industry and hopefully, over the next 5 years and most of the experiential companies whether you're big, whether you're small, whether you're private, whether you're public, we take the time to understand how they're trying to grow their company."
