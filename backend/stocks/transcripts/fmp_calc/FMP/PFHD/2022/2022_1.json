    "content": " Since we named Abel Iglesias to serve as CEO, Professional Bank has retained all members of the management team who are with us here on today's call, key producers and relationship managers across South Florida as well as our teams in St. Petersburg, Jacksonville in New Hampshire loan production offices, and of course, the entire group at Cleveland Digital Innovation Center. As reflected in the first quarter results, traditional banking will continue to be at the center of Professional Bank's offering with C&I and CRE representing 72% of our loan portfolio on March 31, and residential loans representing another 21%. As Herb mentioned net interest income of $19 million for the three months of 2022 was the second highest quarterly level in the company's history, and grew 5.1% from the previous quarter and 6.5% from the year ago period on higher average earning asset balances. Commercial loans including C&I and search fund grew by 9.7% during the quarter and 53.8% over the last 12 months, excluding PPP, as our existing lending teams capitalize on continued strong pipelines. Understood, I appreciate it. Understood, I appreciate it."
