    "content": " POSCO Holdings has retired 2.6 million shares in August to strengthen shareholder value along with making investments for future growth, including the investment decision for the second-stage project in Argentina in October for lithium carbonate to achieve 100,000 tons of lithium hydride production early than scheduled. Thank you very much. Taking this plan into consideration, the fourth quarter production and sales volume will be lower than Q3, because in Q3, we have only had damages in one month, in September, but we believe that the first quarter of next year we will see a full recovery. If we include these two investment decisions, we believe that we are now able to flexibly respond to any changes in the business environment including the IRA of the U.S. We have the -- all the  lithium plants that brings the sodium from Australia, but we also have the Argentina plant as well as SNNC and we will be able to reflect any changes in the business environment. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. So on a consolidated basis, we have been investing about KRW1 trillion across these different businesses and for the next three years or so, we do hope to have an annual investment amount of KRW9 trillion on a consolidated basis about half of that would go into POSCO steel and some of that would be funded internally as for the new growth businesses, then POSCO Holdings will have to input some capital."
