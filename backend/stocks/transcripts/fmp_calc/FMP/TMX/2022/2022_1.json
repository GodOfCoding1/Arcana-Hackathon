    "content": " Excluding the impact of foreign currency and approximately $1 million of disinfection revenue in the prior year, commercial pest organic growth would have been approximately 2%. While we did see an increase of about $3 million year-over-year in total termite damage claims expense, we remain confident we are taking the right actions to reduce termite damage claims expense to baseline levels of approximately 4% of termite revenue. Termite and Home Services completions were up 13% in the quarter, with core termite completions up 5% and home service completions up 19% year-over-year due to increased cross-selling to existing customers. Organic revenue growth of 1% was driven by a reduction in onetime services, including more than $1 million of disinfection revenue from the same period in 2021. International growth was negatively impacted by increased COVID-related sick leaves in both Sweden and the United Kingdom that peaked in late January and early February. Revenue growth added $13 million of adjusted EBITDA in the quarter for a gross margin flow-through of 52%, higher than our normal rates due to strong pricing we delivered in the quarter. If we go back to last year, if you remember, pretty strong margin performance in Q1 of last year was driven by probably the, unfortunately, lowest labor staffing levels that we've seen in a long time coming out of COVID, so we building our staffing levels really positions us well heading into the peak quarters of Q2, Q3."
