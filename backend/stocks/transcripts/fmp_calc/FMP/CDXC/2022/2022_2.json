Total net sales in the second quarter of 2022 were down 5% year-over-year compared to the second quarter of 2021 with a 6% decrease in Tru Niagen, driven by 13% growth in e-commerce offset by a 47% decline in combined Watson\u00e2\u0080\u0099s and other B2B sales as previously discussed. By segmenting our Tru Niagen and NIAGEN consumers into different cohort groups, through e-commerce analytics, as well as insights from our partners, we can orient our marketing content communication, R&D and business development pipeline to strategically target the market."
