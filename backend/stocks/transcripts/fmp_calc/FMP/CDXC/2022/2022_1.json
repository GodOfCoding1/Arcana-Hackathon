Total net sales in the first quarter of 2022 were up 18% year-over-year compared to the first quarter of 2021, with growth of 20% in Tru Niagen, including 13% growth in e-commerce and 43% growth in combined Watsons and other B2B sales. The Omicron variant continues to have an impact on Hong Kong residents, although lessening of late. I'm excited about our holistic approach to building the Tru Niagen brand, which emphasizes communication and customer education, including our new TV campaign, a loyalty or brand ambassador program that incentivizes our most engaged customers to recommend Tru Niagen and an expanded product portfolio that caters to different consumer needs, including our recent launch of Tru Niagen Immune. Your line is open. Your line is open. The Omicron variant continues to have an impact on Hong Kong residents, although lessening of late. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open."
