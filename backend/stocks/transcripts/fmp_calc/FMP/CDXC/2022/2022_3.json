    "content": " Today's conference call may include forward-looking statements, including statements related to ChromaDex's research and development and clinical trial plans and the timing of results of such trials, the timing of future regulatory filings, the expansion of the sale of TRU NIAGEN in new markets, business development opportunities, future financial results, cash needs, operating performance, investor interest and business prospects and opportunities as well as anticipated results of operations. These risk factors include those contained in ChromaDex's quarterly report on Form 10-Q most recently filed with the SEC, including the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic as well as inflationary and adverse economic conditions on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. As I said, total net sales in the third quarter of 2022 were down 1% year-over-year compared to the third quarter of 2021, with a 1% decrease in TRU NIAGEN driven by a 23% decline in combined Watsons and other B2B sales. As it relates to our 2022 full year outlook, all key metrics remains unchanged from last quarter's outlook with the exception of G&A expense, which we now expect to be down $6 million to $8 million, an improvement from our previous guidance of down $6 million to $7 million. Are there certain pieces of sales that are coming in the fourth quarter that are new on the other side of that, what's basically the assumption for the underlying growth in the business, the trajectory of the growth of the business as we're going from Q3 into Q4 to get that guidance."
