    "content": " Today's conference may include forward-looking statements, including statements related to ChromaDex's research and development and clinical trial plans, and the timing and results of such trials; the timing of future regulatory filings; the expansion of the sale of Tru Niagen in new markets; business development opportunities; future financial results; cash needs; operating performance; investor interest; and business prospects and opportunities; as well as anticipated results of operations. An important Tru Niagen's sales highlight was Watson's where revenues in the fourth quarter were up over 50% year-over-year, and we are quite optimistic, but we'll see more consistent sales from Watson's now that China has ended its zero COVID policy. ChromaDex delivered a solid quarter with total net sales of $21 million up 18% year-over-year, the gross margin of 57.2% and selling a marketing expense of 29.5% of net sales, a significant improvement from 48.7% of net sales in the prior year quarter. Moving to the P&L details, as I said, total net sales were up 18% year-over-year compared to the fourth quarter of 2021, with 14% growth in Tru Niagen including flat sales in E-commerce, and 67% growth in combined Watsons and other B2B sales. Selling and marketing expense as a percentage of net sales declined 1,920 basis points to 29.5% compared to 48.7% in the fourth quarter of 2021, as we pivoted to spend on distribution channels and marketing campaigns with the highest short term return on investment and a strong focus on conversion beginning in the third quarter of 2022. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open."
