    "content": " We continue to execute on our share repurchase program and have repurchased approximately $233 million year to date, decreasing our outstanding common share count by 10% and utilizing a significant percentage of forecasted 2022 free cash flow. Our third quarter turn-in lines, several of which occurred in late September, coupled with the additional wells we plan to bring online during the fourth quarter will result in over 15% quarter-over-quarter production growth, which allows us to reiterate our previously provided annual production guidance. We are currently running one rig in the Utica and to improve the efficiency of our 2023 development program, we have elected to add a top hole rig during the fourth quarter of 2022, which will allow us to begin drilling seven additional wells in the Utica before year-end. As of the end of the third quarter, we had nearly 50% of our 23 natural gas production covered through a combination of swaps and collars at an average floor price of $3.19 per Mcf, which is more than zero point $0.50 higher than our 2022 average floor price."
