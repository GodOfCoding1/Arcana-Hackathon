    "quarter": 1,
    "year": 2022,
    "date": "2022-05-04 11:52:11",
    "content": " As you saw from our release, we had a very strong quarter delivering over 1 billion cubic feet equivalent of gas per day and $117 million of free cash flow. We began executing our share buyback program and the board has recently approved an additional $100 million taking the program to $200 million, which represents approximately 50% of expected free cash flow. Our strong first quarter production was driven by the continued outperformance of our 2021 development program, excellent uptime during the winter months and the addition of five new SCOOP wells performing above expectations. We delivered a total operating cost of $1.26 per Mcfe, which represents a slight increase from 2021, primarily due to increased production taxes and a seasonal increase in LOE associated with winterizing our equipment, increased water hauling driven by recent turned in-lines and the addition of compression to help offset base declines. I'm pleased to be increasing our share repurchase program by $100 million, which has the company returning approximately 50% of 2022 expected free cash flow to shareholders. As of May 2, we had natural gas swap and collar contracts totaling approximately 621 million cubic feet per day at an average floor price of $2.66 per Mcf for 2022 and natural gas swap and collar contracts totaling approximately 450 million cubic feet per day at an average floor price of $3.19 per Mcf for 2023. On the return of capital front, as indicated during our fourth quarter earnings call, we began executing on our initial $100 million common share repurchase program during the quarter."
