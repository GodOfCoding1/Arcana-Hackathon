I don't think we've yet fully provided the guidance because I think, as I alluded, we're actually shifting those products from where they're currently hosted and operated from being Austin and Hong Kong to our studio in Tel Aviv, and then they'll be supported out of our studios in Vietnam and in Southeastern Europe, given that as we make those transitions, we're going to also then be layering in some additional teams and resources to support those efforts. Please proceed with your question. what I can tell you is that the Brain Room suite has performed as we expected that the, we feel really good about the transaction and ultimately the price that we paid for the company, and we're going to continue to look to optimize the suite of products and their performance as we integrate our playAWARDS program and start to drive what we think will be added lift and performance as we deliver those benefits to those players, and then also benefit from the cross promotion out of that network into the rest of our products and, and the other way as well. Please proceed with your question. Please proceed with your question. Please proceed with your question."
