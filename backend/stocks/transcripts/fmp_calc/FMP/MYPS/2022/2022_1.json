    "content": " To this end, we\u2019re working on incorporating our playAWARDS program into the existing Tetris game and in doing so, we hope to improve player retention, player engagement, network wide value and in parallel, we\u2019re actively advancing the all together new Tetris app, which we intend to launch by the end of this year. And so as we diversify our portfolio and move into puzzle games and other casual games, we think that, well, what these perspective partners are telling us is they\u2019re very excited about those opportunities, because it really means that they now can commit to the program and have their brands and their offerings attached to the type of game and certainly in the case of Tetris another brand that they\u2019re happy to be associated with."
