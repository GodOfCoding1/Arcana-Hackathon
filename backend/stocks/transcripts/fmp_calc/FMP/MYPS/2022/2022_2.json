    "content": " Lastly, given the importance of consumer engagement with our program, it's worth highlighting that reward purchases were up 6% versus last year and nearly in line with last quarter's record performance. It's worth noting that we rolled out several key features over this past quarter, most notably a new puzzle and progression feature focused on deepening engagement, and we're on the cusp of introducing our playAWARDS program into the Tetris game, which should also improve engagement, retention and network-wide value as we leverage our myVIP loyalty program to incentivize multi-app play. As a result, the increases in average DAU and MAU from Tetris were dilutive to our ARPDAU, which was $0.51 in the second quarter of 2022, down 17.7% over last year's second quarter ARPDAU of $0.62. Given the games market decline of 10% year-to-date and our current trajectory, we now expect our full year revenues to range between 270 and $285 million and full year adjusted EBITDA to be between 30 and $35 million. And then as far as the playBLOCKS initiative, our acquisition of WonderBlocks allowed us to bring into the company a relatively small team and just over 20 people that have been actively working on an overall set of features and technologies and tools and an overall framework that's going to enable us, as I alluded to, in our other communications to tokenize our loyalty program and enable our players to start gifting and for certain classes of rewards actually go into a marketplace that we'll manage and sell and exchange them."
