    "content": " From a high level, our first quarter reflected a continuation of the trends that impacted the performance of our last two quarters, namely ongoing delays in the initiation of large LED lighting projects as our customers navigate a range of shifting economic, supply chain and other external factors. While Orion\u00e2\u0080\u0099s history is rooted in the manufacture of energy-efficient LED lighting solutions with a focus on retrofit projects both through our turnkey capabilities as well as through our valuable ESCO and distribution partners, we have been expanding our vision and capabilities to provide a broader set of solutions that brings even greater long-term value to our customers. In terms of the lighting industry in general trends, despite the compelling cost savings of LED retrofit projects, the macro backdrop over the past few quarters has resulted in some customers delaying projects as they address other issues in their business. Fiscal \u00e2\u0080\u009823 first quarter revenue was $17.9 million versus $35.1 million in Q1 \u00e2\u0080\u009822, reflecting the completion of a large project in Q4 \u00e2\u0080\u009822, ongoing delays in the startup of several new larger LED lighting projects and general slowness in approval of projects by new and existing customers due to the current economic environment. Your line is now open. And I would say within those, Eric, there are some possibility as some could be quite large, not really ready to say they are going to be the size of that largest customer where we had previously said about $250 million of business for the last 2.5 to 3 years, but there are some projects of significant size out there that we are in discussions with. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. Your line is now open."
