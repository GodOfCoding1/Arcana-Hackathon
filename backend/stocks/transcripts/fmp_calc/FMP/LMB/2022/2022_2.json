    "content": " Cash flows from operations for the quarter was $15.6 million, with the business generating free cash flow of $5.1 million, excluding changes in working capital. Much like last year's pattern, we're expecting an acceleration in both our top and bottom-line results over the second half of the year and as a result, continue to expect full year revenue to be in the range of $510 million to $540 million with adjusted EBITDA of $25 million to $29 million. Within the last several weeks, one of Jake Marshall's most prominent customers announced a multi-year $200 million plant expansion to produce specialty silicon products at the facility in Chattanooga. This compared to 2021, the Southern California operations in the Eastern Pennsylvania GCR segment unfavorably impacted the Q2 results quarter-to-date and year-to-date income before the income taxes by $1.9 million and $3.2 million, respectively. For the quarter, free cash flow generated from operating the business before working capital changes was $5.1 million."
