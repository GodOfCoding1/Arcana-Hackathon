    "content": " For the past several years, we have met or exceeded our adjusted EBITDA guidance, and I credit that to the risk management practices we installed in the business as well as our game-changing strategy of rapidly expanding our owner-direct revenue or ODR segment, as we call it, and focusing on the quality of the General Contractor or GCR backlog. This success continued to be underpinned by our strategic focus on our higher-margin ODR segment, which accounted for 44.6% of the fourth quarter consolidated revenue compared with 30.8% in the year ago quarter. Given that segment's general profile of quicker hitting small dollar value work than historically has been the case with GCR, it requires more selling and transactional support to grow the relationships, drive revenue and those margins and those investments were also a factor in the increased SG&A for the full year. And I think our ability to really focus on our key customers to dedicate resources - we see it's helping us now and as well in the future, depending on what happens, whether they're in a stage of whether repairing a lot of small equipment or from a large capital infrastructure position, we really looked at ourselves that we positioned. So from the ODR segment, we look - we think there's opportunity beyond even the margin range that we gave of 25% to 28%, but that's going to depend upon how we evolve our relationship with our customers. On the GCR side of things, I think one of the reasons we were able to raise that margin from 12% to 13% to 12% to 15%, is that as the business shifts to being more owner-direct, it's a lot - we're less dependent on those GCR projects."
