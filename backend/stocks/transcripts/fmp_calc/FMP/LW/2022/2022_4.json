    "content": " Specifically, in fiscal 2022, we delivered a record year of $4.1 billion in sales, driven by a combination of favorable price/mix and volume growth as restaurant traffic and demand for fries continued to recover from the depths of the pandemic. So, looking at our fiscal 2023 outlook at a high level, we're targeting sales of $4.7 billion to $4.8 billion, largely driven by price/mix, and we're targeting adjusted EBITDA, including unconsolidated joint ventures, of $840 million to $910 million, largely driven by strong sales growth as well as gross margins that approach a normalized annual run rate of 25% to 26% during the second half of the fiscal year. We've taken a prudent approach to our fiscal 2023 targets as we expect the operating and demand environment to remain highly challenging, and we're confident in the long-term prospects of the category and remain committed to executing on our strategies and investing in our global network to support growth and create value for our shareholders over the long term. Then as we start harvesting and recognizing some of the cost -- higher costs associated with this year's crop, we're not going to see much of a change there in terms of the cost of our potatoes just given, as Tom previously announced, we did have a 20% increase in the cost of that crop this year."
