    "content": " Sales volumes were also affected by the timing of incremental losses of certain low margin non-commercial business, as well as our inability to fully serve demand as a result of constrained production.Foodservice's product contribution margin rose more than 40% to $138 million as favorable price more than offset higher manufacturing and distribution cost per pound and the impact of lower volumes. In our Retail segment, sales increased 28%, price/mix was up 32% reflecting pricing actions across our branded and private label portfolios, as well as favorable mix with the sale of more branded products.Volume was down 4% reflecting incremental losses of certain lower margin private label products.We will be lapping the last of that lost private label business in the second quarter. We continue to target SG&A expenses of $475 million to $500 million, which reflects higher compensation and benefits expenses to attract and retain talent, higher spending for our new ERP system and other IT infrastructure upgrades, higher advertising and promotion expenses as we look to return support back to historical levels, and overall inflation for third-party services. We continue to expect equity earnings of $25 million to $30 million, excluding items impacting comparability, but also expect increased volatility given the likelihood of a poor crop in Europe, as well as possible limitations on natural gas usage that may affect our production."
