    "content": " Q4 revenue increased 32% year-over-year to $184 million, driven by growth of high-value services, continued customer acquisition across diverse geographies and accelerating interest income from growing customer funds and rising interest rates. So look, revenue, we would expect over the course of 2023, that revenue will increase sequentially throughout the year, driven by our continued customer acquisition, grossing high value services, as John has indicated, even if we see the impact, as we noted in our prepared remarks, of that $15 million decrease in non-volume revenues beginning in the back half of the year, as you know, our business is seasonal, benefits from strong consumer and other spending in Q4."
