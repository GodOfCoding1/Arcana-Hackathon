    "content": " Operating profit decreased 40% to $66.3 million versus $111.3 million in prior fiscal year with the challenging supply chain situation, primarily in our Fishing business, significantly impacting our profitability. In Fishing, while supply chain challenges persisted throughout the first part of the fiscal year, we saw supply availability start to improve during the fiscal fourth quarter. While it's unclear the extent to which economic conditions and inflation may affect consumer buying behavior in the future, as always, our team takes the long-term view, working hard to position our brands and businesses for growth well beyond the next quarter or next year."
