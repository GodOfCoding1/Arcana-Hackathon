    "content": " Sales in our second fiscal quarter ending April 01, 2022 declined 8% compared to the prior year's unprecedented second quarter. For the quarter, operating profit was down versus the prior year's record-setting quarter due to lower sales volumes and a decrease in gross margin. The quarter's gross margin of 36.2% is down nine points from last year's second quarter due primarily to increased material costs, higher inbound freight and lower absorption from decreased volume. Operating expenses in the quarter decreased $4 million versus the prior year second quarter, primarily due to lower sales volume-driven expenses as well as lower variable and deferred compensation expense. I'd rather not get into the percentage that we got into, but it's been incremental, I would say, in terms of the pricing and obviously not enough to offset the cost increases that we've seen."
