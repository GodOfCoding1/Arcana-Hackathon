    "content": " Sales in our third fiscal quarter ending July 1, 2022 declined 5% compared to the prior year's record high third quarter. In camping while the market has cooled compared to the high demand of last year's unprecedented season, participation remains high and we continue to see double-digit growth. Obviously, we are monitoring the uncertain economic conditions and as always, we take the long view at Johnson Outdoors, working hard to position our brands and our businesses for growth well beyond the next quarter or next year. As Helen mentioned, sales declined for the quarter compared to last year's record high third quarter, but sales are significantly higher than the pre-pandemic June 2019 quarter. Operating expenses for the quarter decreased $9.7 million versus the prior year third quarter, primarily due to lower sales volume driven expenses, as well as lower variable and deferred compensation expense between quarters. We'll still have a little bit more investment in the fourth quarter, so we'll see some increase for the year versus last year in CapEx, but I expect that to come back down to 2021 levels for next year."
