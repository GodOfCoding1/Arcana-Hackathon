    "content": " Operating profit decreased 60% to $5.5 million versus $13.8 million in the prior fiscal year first quarter, with increases in inventory costs significantly impacting profitability. Profit before income taxes was $8.2 million versus $14.6 million in the prior year quarter, driven by the lower gross margin and increased operating expenses. So we're not talking big numbers here for the quarter, but it's -- and the compensation expenses, they will probably be incrementally higher this year versus last year just due to headcount and merit and that kind of thing."
