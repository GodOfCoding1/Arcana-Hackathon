    "content": " In the first quarter, we reported record sales of $696 million and the second strongest quarter of profitability in our company's history with $58.1 million of EBITDA. As Rick noted, our Specialty Metals and Pipe and Tube segments, each delivered record sales and profitability for the quarter and our Carbon segment posted its second strongest quarter of sales ever along with strong profits. We weathered the headwinds of carbon index pricing, decreasing by over $1,000 per ton and maintain high volume levels to record a $380 million in sales, our second strongest quarter of Carbon segment sales ever. In addition to the $696 million in record sales for the company as a whole, our $58.1 million of consolidated EBITDA was a record for the first quarter and the second best EBITDA for any quarter in our company's history. Consolidated operating expenses totaled $88.1 million for the first quarter, an increase of $11.2 million or 14.6% compared with the $76.9 million for the first quarter of last year. The current quarter included $1.6 million of Shaw operating expenses and $6.1 million of incremental incentive expenses, which are tied to profitability, when compared to the first quarter of 2021. So if you're trying to compare the first quarter of 2022 to the first quarter of 2021, there's a dramatic higher price level for carbon flat rolled in 2022 versus 2021 while it's down -- it started trending down versus fourth quarter when you're comparing to 12 months ago it's a substantial difference and that's where you're going to see the difference in the cost of goods sold."
