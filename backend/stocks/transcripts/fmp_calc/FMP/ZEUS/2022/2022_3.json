So I think some of the input costs in terms of metal pricing are going to be permanently higher and that may -- as you really look long-term, may point to higher metal pricing than what traditionally we've seen prior to the last cycle of the last couple of years. I think that what you typically see in most cycles is that first quarter is generally a rebuild of the working capital kind of coming off year-end lows -- and so I don't know that you'd see a lot of debt reduction in the first quarter beyond that, but we certainly will see it here in the fourth quarter."
