    "content": " While we are very optimistic about our fourth quarter performance, due to continued customer growth, or conservative assessment, when shared by others as well is that we can generally see a more modest cadence and it's typical for customers, we usually work to spend down remaining budgets, and therefore less sequential growth in the fourth quarter might seem a typical year. Breaking down $41.7 million, we recognized $17.6 million from our core assay services business, 0.4% increase from our third quarter 2021 assay services revenue of $17.5 million and a 60.8% increase for the $10.9 million of assay services revenue we recognized last quarter. So turning to guidance, based on our year-to-date progress, and including this third quarters licensing revenue, the current trends in our current trends in our business, we now expect 2022 revenue at the end in the range of $93 million to $98 million. No, I don't really need to add again, just that in this market, we're not anticipating a huge spin down in previous fourth quarters, in the last month of the quarter, we've often seen large drop in projects, so that our biopharma customers can spin down their budgets, and we're just not hearing that that's going to be the philosophy this year. So, that's all of the core components, with the exception of again, that the typical licensing revenue, which is primarily that previously would have been recognized each quarter and historically has kind of been $1 million to $2 million in the last year, each quarter, that's not going to be recognized due to the new arrangement. I think we like everybody else in at the beginning of the year hope to this market would already be much better, but it's just not and so again we're just trying to be, it's not conservative, a pragmatic about the spending behavior in this market in the fourth quarter."
