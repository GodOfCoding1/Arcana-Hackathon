    "content": " Fourth quarter, 2022 revenue reflects early traction in our kit rollout, nearly tripling our kit business over Q4 2021, which to echo what Adam said, is a critical component of our strategy to return to above-market growth, but the current quarter also reflects the change in our New England biolabs royalties recognition with zero recognized this quarter versus $1.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2021. So we have a great deal of confidence in our business and I've personally seen Adam take the reins from mid last year and you'll see that if you look at our corporate deck, how he's moved the needle on the key metrics and indeed the cycle, the sales cycle time, it can be lengthy, but Adam has done all the right things and has helped bend those curves in terms of bringing on new customers and pulling on our land and expand strategy. A great pipeline to be getting those sites installed, giving customers the convenience of either sending in samples to us in or running the SomaScan array in the comfort of their own labs, as well as what we're doing with Illumina, and I'd be remiss if I didn't mention, because there's been a heck of a lot of hard work going, frankly, for years here at SomaLogic to launch the 10-K SomaScan assay by the end of this year, which will continue to extend our market leadership as it relates to content, which we are highly confident will provide greater discoveries for our customer base. So we have pivoted the organization fairly firmly in a way that's focused on serving both that customer base commercially as well as ensuring that the innovations, the products that we've got in our R&D pipeline and product management pipeline are all focused really on that life sciences core set of customers."
