    "content": " Zooming in, we scaled both our consumer and merchant networks dramatically, growing active consumers by 124% to 8.7 million, and increasing active merchants to a staggering 102,000 from just 6,500 a year ago. That top-line growth generated strong unit economics, with revenue less transaction costs up 103% to $112 million or 4.1% of GMV, a 38 basis-point increase. Finally, we expect the growth in our slip pay business which has a generally lower merchant discount rate than our 0% APR business strive lower total revenue yield as a percentage of GMV, albeit with lower total transaction costs once we reach scale. The robust top-line growth and leverage and transaction costs resulted in higher revenue, less transaction costs, which grew 103% to $112 million or 4.1% of GMV. We now expect GMV to grow 71% to 76% to $3.55 to $3.65 billion, total revenue of $320 to $330 million, total transaction costs of $143 million to $148 million, revenue less transaction costs of $178 million to $183 million, adjusted operating loss as a percentage of revenue of 5% to 7%, and weighted average shares outstanding of $285 million. We added about $820 million on the Balance Sheet, made up of about 100 -- or of $1.1 billion that we securitized on the Balance Sheet, and about $250 million reduction in the warehouse funding, which is probably a little bit tighter even than we'd like to run it, that's what drove the really efficient equity capital required number that we posted this quarter."
