    "content": " But we think it's more of a onetime change in terms of the warehouse usage that we'll see next quarter, and we'll run the business at that level for the next couple of quarters, which will result in more revenue that we'll earn later for originations, and that trend will show up as you'd expect. And obviously, we were doing it -- we gave you a framework to think about it as every 100 basis points, there's a second or third order effect, too, because the set of the curve begins to affect decisions and I think it's more just as we've observed and seen the impact, we're just updating the range for everybody. At that time, I think exactly zero merchants fired us or did anything but say, we get it, we're going to work with you because it's important for us to continue selling. And so 1 of the things that you could say we're preparing to do, although we don't have to act on it right now, if we felt that the unemployment is about to spike or starting to go up really rapidly, we would necessarily pull in terms and make the 4.6% average go down just to make sure there are fewer opportunities for our borrowers to default. Again, the product that is brand new, we're not going to, given today's reality of the question about our term profitability, nothing will be more frustrating than saying everything is awesome, we're hitting every number, except debit loss turn out to be loss here than I thought."
