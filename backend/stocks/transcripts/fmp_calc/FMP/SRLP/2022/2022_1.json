    "content": " Operating expenses increased by 21% or $4 million in the first quarter, primarily due to increases in insurance, utilities, boiler fuel, stockpiling and employee-related expenses. Below the EBITDA line, first quarter cash interest expense of $9.2 million increased by $1.9 million or 25% above the prior year, which was primarily due to higher net borrowing rates. Given the increase in adjusted EBITDA and tax benefits, which were partially offset by an increase in cash interest expenses and maintenance CapEx, Sprague\u2019s distributable cash flow for the first quarter increased by $29.8 million year-over-year to $83.6 million, generating a quarterly distribution coverage ratio of 7.3x."
