    "content": " This is evidenced in the fourth quarter with outflows from bankruptcy trustees and property managers being offset by strong inflows from retail deposits, up $178 million in the quarter, and fintech banking-as-a-service deposits, which were up $40 million in the quarter. Of that remaining $494 million deposit balance, $326 million or 6% of total deposits are related to MCB's four active institutional crypto asset related clients, which are subject to wind down in 2023. We did have $250 million of FHLB advances and Fed funds purchased at year-end, which in part reflects the strategy, but it's also reflective of the timing of normal client cash flows around year-end. Legal fees remained elevated by approximately $2.4 million in the quarter and $6.2 million for the full year, with outside counsel engagement focused on the regulatory matter as well as carry over on Voyager's bankruptcy proceedings. As far as the expenses and once this falls out of the expense run rate going forward, how -- I think the regular professional -- sorry, professional and legal line is also still a bit elevated in this quarter as well relative to where it's been in the past."
