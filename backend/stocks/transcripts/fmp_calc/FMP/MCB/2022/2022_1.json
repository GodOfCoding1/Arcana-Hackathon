    "content": " I\u2019m also very pleased to note that our return on average tangible common equity for the first quarter was 14%, which is remarkable, given the fact that, this is just the second quarter since our successful $175 million capital raise in September 2021. Mark\u2019s already touched on the impact that strategic investments being made by our clients had on deposit flows in the quarter, I will just note though that, GPG-related deposits, which were elevated at year end did come down later in the quarter given those strategic moves. Converting the liquidity in the first quarter into loans, obviously, we\u2019re not going to see the full benefit of that until the second quarter."
