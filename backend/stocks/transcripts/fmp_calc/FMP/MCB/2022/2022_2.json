And you're also, getting back to the margin, going to start to see the uptick on the asset side loans and to a much lesser degree securities, just given most of those are fixed rate given that we are still asset sensitive. But again, I think you're still going to see some level of -- I would expect to still see some level of NIM expansion just given that we are asset sensitive and over 40% of the loans are effectively going to be floating rate loans by the time we see a rate move next week. I think Mark's point though is the right one, which is, again, we're not expecting any large programmatic shifts across the verticals, and we're going to continue to focus on longer term efficiency of funding and NII accretion. But I think by the second half of this year, certainly by the fourth quarter, you're going to start to see us make some progress there as well."
