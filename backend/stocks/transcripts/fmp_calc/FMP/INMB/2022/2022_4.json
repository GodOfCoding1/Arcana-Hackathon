    "content": " And what we've shown over the last 12 months and more recently, INKmune converts resting normal NK cells in patients into what are now known in the field as memory like NK cells and these can target solid tumors directly even in the presence of immunosuppressive regulatory cells as we've shown and particularly in hypoxic environments. The company's preclinical data with human NK cells and cancer cells show that INKmune primes NK cells from patients and indeed from healthy donors to lies as NK resistant solid tumor cell lines and we've worked with ovarian cancer, published those data, breast cancer, prostate cancer, more recently, renal cell carcinoma and now straight out of the box, nasopharyngeal cancer cells. So I think the combination of basic research into mechanisms of action, the manufacturing improvement in the clinical trial operations in the U.K., broader Europe and the U.S., plus the continued preclinical research in new diseases such as renal and nasopharyngeal put the company in excellent position to support the INKmune trials in solid tumors in the U.S. and elsewhere. So we -- the investigators have been very supportive of this strategy because at the end of the day, when you walk into a memory clinic now, they've got three or four or five trials that they can choose between to enroll their patients and they're always trying to look out for the best wishes of their patients, and we think this puts us high on the list."
