    "content": " As described above for the MCI trial, we are using endpoints that measure the cognitive and clinical changes that occur in patients with mild Alzheimer's disease. In the patients that responded to INKmune, memory-like NGKD2+ NK cells, that's the memory-like NK cell that is cancer killing, were present in the blood and bone marrow for at least 100 days after the last dose of INKmune. We will finish the MDS/AML trial, but I do believe, and I'm saying it publicly here, that the future opportunity of INKmune is solid tumors, and there's only nine times the number of solid tumor patients than there are hematologic malignancy patients. I guess exactly as RJ, you pointed out that there isn't really much in the way of data or certainly nothing all too promising yet from any of the other allogeneic NK cell therapies where we're delivering actual cells or NK cells, in this case, into patients in the solid tumor setting. But the most important thing that I presented today, I think, and what Mark really talked about when he was at the Innate Killer Conference was that we now know why everybody has failed in NK cells and solid tumors is because they keep making NK cells that are supposed to be working in 21% oxygen with no immunosuppressive environment, throw them into the patient and they get blindsided by hypoxia in immunosuppression. And we think that it's actually a pretty well-designed trial, and there are going to be other applications of those biomarkers in patients with psychiatric diseases."
