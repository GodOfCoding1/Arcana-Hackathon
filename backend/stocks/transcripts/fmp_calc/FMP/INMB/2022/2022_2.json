    "content": " To make these cancers killing memory-like NK cells with cytokine, you need a complex cytokine triplet of IL-12, 15 and 18, these cytokines complicate both manufacturing and the care of cancer patients because of cost and off target side effects, common to many cytokine treatments. I remind you that mitochondria, the engines of the cell are essential for NK survival and we believe this increased fitness may be the cause of the extended therapeutic persistence in INK \u00e2\u0080\u0093 of memory-like NK cells and INKmune treated patients. These observations combined with the data presented on the ability to \u00e2\u0080\u0093 of INKmune to prime NK cells that thrive in the conditions of the tumor microenvironment, including hypoxia has driven our strategy to pivot our development program towards solid tumors. I mean, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been touting for, I think since is the NK  Killer Summit, which I believe was in February of the remarkable data that Mark has shown about the advantage of INKmune-primed cells in the tumor microenvironment of solid tumors."
