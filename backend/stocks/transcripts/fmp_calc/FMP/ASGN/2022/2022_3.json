    "content": " Commercial consulting revenues totaled 268.6 million for the third quarter, an increase of 43.2% year-over-year and up 29.8% organically. As we discussed in recent calls this year-over-year decline resulted from our strategic decision not to re-compete a low margin web services retail program in the third quarter of last year, which was partially offset by the impact of distances we acquired in 2021. Revenue from our commercial segment were 900 million up 16.1% on a difficult year-over-year comparison, all commercial divisions grew with the highest growth coming from the commercial consulting services, which carry higher gross margins than our IT staffing services. For the fourth quarter, we are estimating revenues of 1 billion, 123 million to 1 billion, 143 million ad implied revenue growth rate of 6.6% to 8.5% on one fewer billable day and on difficult comparable. Starting with revenue, given the outperformance of the business in the first half of the year and continued strong top line growth in the third quarter, we continued to track ahead of our baseline revenue growth expectations. We told you, in the second quarter and the third that we expected it to be a slightly lower contribution to the overall revenue mix, which is true, because we have other units that are growing faster like commercial consulting, plus, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got the addition of acquisitions here. Today it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s performing very nicely, and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re expecting it to have a similar market in the fourth quarter, although we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll break that out specifically, but they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to perform as we expect, I believe, if we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re just looking one month into the fourth quarter and like we said earlier, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to be a lower percent of the revenue mix, based on what we said before."
