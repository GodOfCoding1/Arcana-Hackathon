    "content": " Apex Systems, our largest division, accounted for 82.7% of the segment's revenues for the quarter, reported solid double-digit growth in both IT staffing and consulting services. 05:49 Gross margin for the commercial segment was 32.7%, up 210 basis points from Q1 of last year, due to growth across our high margin, commercial consulting, creative digital marketing, and permanent placement businesses. Gross and adjusted EBITDA margins were up significantly from Q1 of last year related to improvements in business mix, which included a lower mix of revenues from cost reimbursable contracts which carry lower margins than other contract types and the contribution from the higher-margin businesses we acquired in 2021. 11:19 Commercial consulting revenues were $204.7 million, up 74.2% over the first quarter last year and accounted for approximately 25% of the segment's revenues. 14:37 For the second quarter of 2022, we're estimating revenues of $1.108 billion to $1.128 billion, an implied growth rate of 13.7% to 15.7% on a difficult prior-year comparable due to the high sequential growth in Q2 of last year of 7.5%.
