    "content": " Our goal is to demonstrate proof of concept in the full set of 29 patients, which requires that the response rate of JTX-8064 in combination with a PD-1 inhibitor is greater than what would be expected with a PD-1 inhibitor alone. We are very pleased at the pace of enrollment in INNATE, and we expect to present data on all 31 Phase I dose escalation patients, 9 of whom were in combination and at least 60 Phase II patients from INNATE at a medical meeting in the second half of 2022. In SELECT studying 2 doses of Vopra in combination with Pimi compared to Pimi alone in biomarker selected patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, who are PD-1 inhibitor naive and have progressed on a platinum based chemotherapy regimen. Those are probably lower priority than things like LILRB2, CD-163 things that we've talked about as clearly negative prognostic factors for cancer or for prediction of response to PD-1 inhibitors that we think could be you know, promising predictive marker for JTX-8064."
