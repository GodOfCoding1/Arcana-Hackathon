Software and Payments segment growth of 35.4% year-over-year was incredibly strong and drove highly profitable adjusted gross margins of 74.1%, up 241 basis points year-over-year. Direct card revenue or DCR, which is the revenue we generate from processing credit card payments through all of our solutions was $5.8 million or 57% year-over-year growth and a quarterly yield of 6.6 basis points.
