    "content": " We secured $778 million of additional backlog during the quarter, this attributed to the previously announced contracts on the Ocean BlackHornet, Ocean Apex, Ocean GreatWhite, and the managed rigs Auriga and Vela. As a result of the Ocean Endeavor shipyard work in the fourth quarter and the ongoing reactivation of the Ocean GreatWhite, as well as the Ocean Apex going into the shipyard between contracts for a little over a quarter in the first half of \u00e2\u0080\u009923 for its special hole survey and other maintenance programs, we expect our liquidity to continue to dip over the next few quarters. Turning to our Q4 and full year 2022 guidance, we expect Q4 2022 contract drilling revenue excluding reimbursables to be between $205 million to $215 million, and largely due to the Ocean Endeavor being in the shipyard and Ocean GreatWhite reactivation activities taking place in Q4, EBITDA is expected to be slightly above breakeven and our capital expenditures are expected to be between $30 million to $35 million. As we understand it today, the expectation is that that rig would finish its contract, including any exercised options, sometime around August of next year and then likely demob to Las Palmas, where we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll make the--conduct the special hole survey which we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re bringing forward from \u00e2\u0080\u009924 into late \u00e2\u0080\u009923, before moving onto its next project. Wanted to follow up on that last question and kind of tie it to the \u00e2\u0080\u009923 outlook, which I realize is preliminary, but I did want to ask how the Ocean Onyx kind of factors into that $160 million to $200 million EBITDA outlook for next year."
