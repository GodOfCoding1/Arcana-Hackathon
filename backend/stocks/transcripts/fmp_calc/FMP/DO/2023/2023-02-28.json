    "content": " We relisted on the New York Stock Exchange, secured $1.3 billion in new contract awards, successfully started up 2 managed drillships and secured work to reactivate the Ocean GreatWhite, all while continuing to deliver industry leading operational excellence for our customers. CapEx for the full year of $60 million came in well under our prior guidance of $75 million to $80 million, in large part due to the Ocean Endeavor and Ocean GreatWhite projects straddling year-end with some items pushing into 2023. As preliminarily guided last quarter, 2023 revenue, excluding reimbursable revenue, is expected to be between $950 million and $990 million, which represents a more than 30% increase over 2022 revenue as a result of higher average day rates and the Ocean GreatWhite being on contract after its reactivation. Also consistent with our preliminary guidance last quarter, EBITDA for 2023 is expected to be between $160 million and $180 million, a more than fourfold increase over 2022 EBITDA. Our estimated CapEx spend for 2023 does take into consideration the completion of the Ocean Endeavor repairs and Ocean GreatWhite reactivation as well as the maintenance, upgrades and special whole survey for the Ocean Apex occurring over much of the second quarter when it is off contract for approximately 110 days and the special whole survey and customer-required upgrades for the Ocean Courage occurring in the fourth quarter in advance of its new 4-year Petrobras contract. In contrast, the second half of 2023 benefits from full quarters operating on higher day rates for the Ocean BlackHornet and Ocean Apex and the Ocean GreatWhite being on contract for the full period, more than doubling our EBITDA potential compared to the first half of 2023, including returning to free cash flow breakeven or slightly positive for the second half."
