    "content": " The company continued to generate strong free cash flow with $54.8 million in cash from operating activities during the third quarter, driven from improvements in networking capital and $106.7 million in net cash from operating activities year-to-date. The markets that we're seeing some softening at your steel, lumber, building materials and as you would expect, I mean, when you think about \u00e2\u0080\u0093 we've gotten this question before, when you think about building materials, that's probably about 30% of our flatbed business. I think just since we've seen a little bit of the softening that Jonathan alluded to on the flatbed side, while we're seeing other end markets remain strong and offset some of that, I think we're kind of thinking more towards the bottom end of that, the lower range of the guide, but still within the guide is what we're seeing at today."
