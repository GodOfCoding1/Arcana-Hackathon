    "content": " In 2022, demand for new vehicles and aftermarket parts and services was strong, primarily due to supply constraints experienced over the last few years and an overall healthy economy. Can you talk about your ability at Rush to outperform the market whenever we do see that pull back, let's say, in 2024, the market's down, Class 8 truck sales for the industry are down 15%. If you look at their market share now and with new ownership over the last 1.5 years, per se as they get their feet on the ground and get moving forward with product and stuff, I think that they will be a tailwind for us going forward as they gain market share."
