    "content": " Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, those discussed in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31st, 2021 and in our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission,\n As indicated our news release, which achieved third quarter revenues of $1.86 billion, net income of $90.4 million, or $1.59 per diluted share. But as I said, the numbers seem to be like 50% plus higher this year than I expected to sort of try to recalibrate how to think about Russia's earnings power going forward in the long run. Now, when you get into segments and what I expect to happen up our biggest segments would be refuse, would be we've got a larger pickup in oil and gas, but don't think for any minute now, it's like it was years ago when oil and gas was 15% of our business. As we've said, we're going to return 35% to 40% of free cash flow of FCF to shareholders, and we have consistently raised our dividends averaging right now, it's $0.21 on $0.84 a year, $0.21 a quarter at is around, I don't know, 1.758 just right under 2% return from a dividend perspective."
