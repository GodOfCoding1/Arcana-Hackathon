    "content": " I guess to bring my answer back to one place, I guess our path back to 2019 margins is likely to have four main components: number one, a focus on higher sales, especially in 2023, higher sales drive leverage; number two, lower freight expenses as external rates normalize in the next couple of years, and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re starting to see that happen; number three, higher merchant margin as the highly promotional environment of last year begins to recede; number four, supply chain efficiencies but, for the reasons we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve outlined, some of those may take a little bit of time."
