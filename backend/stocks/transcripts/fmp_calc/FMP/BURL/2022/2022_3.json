So our optimism about 2023 is driven by other factors, specifically, a greater focus on value by other income groups and therefore, more trade down traffic; less of an inventory overhang and therefore, lower promotions, especially in mass retail; an improving expense environment, especially for contracted freight; and lastly, of course, better execution by us as we lap our own mistakes from this year. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open."
