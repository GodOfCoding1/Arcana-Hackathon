    "content": " At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Burlington Stores' Second Quarter Fiscal 2022 Operating Results Conference Call. Our presenters today are Michael O'Sullivan, our Chief Executive Officer and John Crimmins, Principal Financial Officer. Before I turn the call over to Michael, I would like to inform listeners that this call may not be transcribed, recorded or broadcast without our expressed permission. Remarks made on this call concerning future expectations, events, strategies, objectives, trends, or projected financial results are subject to certain risks and uncertainties. Such risks and uncertainties include those that are described in the company's 10-K for fiscal 2021 and in other filings with the SEC, all of which are expressly incorporated herein by reference. Firstly, I will discuss our second quarter results. Okay, let's talk about our results. During this call, when describing our comp trend, I'm going to use a three-year geometric comp stack. Given our large comp numbers last year, we think this provides a more meaningful indicator of our trend. In May, our three-year geometric comp stack was plus 4%. For Q2 as a whole, it was minus 1%. On an absolute and on a relative basis, these comp results are well below our expectations. It's about offering the best value in the categories, brands, styles and price points that the customer is looking for. But when you look at our results, especially on a relative basis, it's clear that we did not move far or fast enough. First of all, the low to moderate-income customer is under significant economic pressure. Approximately 40% of the money spent at Burlington comes from shoppers with household incomes of less than $50,000. Low to moderate-income shoppers helped drive our extraordinary growth last year, and they remain an important part of our future growth plans. And versus last year, they have considerably less money for discretionary spending. The second factor that contributed to our weakening trend in Q2 was that promotional activity, especially among retailers that serve low to moderate-income shoppers. Third, the root cause of this is that there is a massive imbalance between inventory levels and sales across retail. Our customer proposition, the key reason to shop our stores is that we offer better value than other retailers. The overall sales trend may be weak, so we can shift into the areas that the customer is buying and we can use the supplier balance deliver great value in these categories. Despite the weak trend in Q2, our margins came in ahead of expectations. Instead, we focused markdowns on excess seasonal merchandise and ended the quarter very cleanly. The second factor that drove above plan earnings is that with the weak sales trend, we aggressively controlled our expenses. As a result, although we came in below our guidance for sales, our earnings were above the high end of our guidance range. I'm going to move on to the outlook, and I will split my remarks into the near-term outlook, i.e., the rest of the year and then further out. Think about it, there is really no need to trade down when every major retailer is on sale. Based on these factors, we are lowering our guidance for the back half of the year. As a reminder, our comp growth for the back half of 2021 was positive 10%. We had originally planned for an increase in merchant margin in the back half, but we have now pulled back on this. As I said earlier, the most important driver of sales is the value that we put in front of the customer. During this time, we will tightly control buying and liquidity, carefully managed inventories and aggressively pursue opportunities to drive down expenses. But, the net effect of all this is that we expect our results for the full year to be well below our normal expectations and well below what we believe we can accomplish over the next couple of years. Last year, actually on this call, we described the then current situation of strong consumer spending fueled by government stimulus and a significant merchandise supply constraints, we describe that situation as completely unsustainable. Let me say, we believe that the now current situation weak retail sales trends and massive oversupply of merchandise is equally unsustainable. To support this process, we have started to sketch out scenarios for what the retail environment could look like in 2023. I'd like to describe the scenario that based upon what we know at this point, we think, is most likely. Firstly, we believe the inventory overhang across the retail industry is likely to clear over the next several months. We expect that by early 2023, once this overhang has cleared, promotional activity will have declined significantly. Many vendors have been hurt by the current imbalance and they are likely to pull back but with weak consumer demand, we think there will still be plenty of merchandise supply for the off-price channel. Thirdly, we believe that in 2023, the expense environment is likely to have changed significantly, especially for freight rates. We also think it is likely that by then, the labor market will have softened, which could ease pressure on wage rates. And this slowing economy may also drive heightened consumer focus on value, driving trade down shoppers to our stores. Lastly, we think that several financially weak bricks-and-mortar retailers may have to close stores. Forecasting the future is a very risky undertaking, especially after what we have lived through over the last three years. But, we believe the scenario, I've just described, isn't just possible, it's slightly at some point in 2023. I would now like to turn the call over to John to provide more details on our Q2 results, and our rest of year guidance. Total sales in the quarter were down 10%, while comp sales were down 17%. In terms of earnings, the headline is that we faced gross margin pressure in Q2, but this was more than offset by productivity and expense savings elsewhere in the P&L. Comp sales came in below our guidance range, but our adjusted EPS came in above. For Q2, our adjusted EPS was $0.35 versus the guidance range of $0.18 to $0.31. The gross margin rate was 38.9%, a decrease of 320 basis points versus 2021 2nd quarter rate, of 42.2%. It's worth calling out that although our markdown rate was higher than last year, it was still significantly below 2019 and historical levels. Product sourcing costs were $157 million versus $146 million in the second quarter of 2021, increasing 130 basis points as a percentage of sales. This deleverage was due to higher supply chain and buying costs driven by higher supply chain, wages and growth of our buying and planning team, respectively. Adjusted SG&A was $518 million versus $150 million in 2021, increasing 120 basis points as a percentage of sales, which was driven primarily by deleverage on occupancy expense. Adjusted EBIT margin was 2.1%, 610 basis points lower than the second quarter of 2021. We were able to achieve the high-end of our adjusted EBIT margin guidance, by offsetting the lower-than-expected comp sales and gross margin with expense savings, but into the context of our Q2 2019 adjusted EBIT margin. Of this, about 450 basis points were driven by freight and supply chain deleverage. At the end of the quarter, our in-store inventories were 5% below 2021 on a comp store basis and our reserve inventory was 52% of our total inventory versus 31% last year. In dollar terms, our reserve is more than double last year's levels. In Q2, we opened 11 net new stores, bringing our store count at the end of the quarter to 877 stores. As Michael mentioned, we are updating our back half forecast based on a minus 4% to minus 1% three-year geometric stack. Based on this range and on our expectation of a continuing heavy external promotional environment, our adjusted EBIT margin is expected to decline by 160 basis points to 80 basis points, which would generate adjusted EPS for the back half of $2.81 to $3.41. Breaking out the quarters, we are modeling Q3 at a one-year comp decline of minus 18% to minus 15%, which translates to minus 4% to a minus 1% decline on a three-year geo stack basis. We are modeling Q4 at a one-year comp decline of minus 9% to minus 6%, which for Q4 translates to the same three-year geo stack that we are planning in Q3 of minus 4% to minus 1% decrease. There were two major external factors that contributed to our Q2 trend, the low to moderate-income customer is under a lot of economic pressure. Our business is all about offering the best value on the categories, brands, styles and price points that the customer is buying. Now before I turn the call over to the operator for Q&A, there are a couple of additional topics that I would like to call out. On this call, we do not have time to discuss the content in any detail, but I would like to encourage investors to take a look at the report on our Investor Relations website. The report describes the huge progress that we have made over the past year on our major environmental, social and governance priorities. If there are any investors who have questions about any of these topics, or would like more information, then please contact our Investor Relations team. I would like to welcome our newly appointed CFO, Kristin Wolfe, who joined us a few weeks ago. This is John's last earnings call, so please ask him some tough questions. Seriously, I would like to take this opportunity to thank John on behalf of the company and the Board for his hard work and commitment to the company over the years and to wish him all the best in his well-deserved retirement. With that, I would now like to turn the call over for your questions. Your line is open. Or said differently, comps for these retailers have historically trended together versus the wider gap that we've seen year-to-date today. So of course, we've interrogated the year-to-date performance. If you look at year-to-date on a three-year geometric stack basis, one of our off-price peers is up in the mid-teens. The other is mid-single digit, and we're minus 1%. The low-income shopper, the low-income shopper really drove our relative outperformance versus both peers last year. This year, those shoppers are struggling, and I think that's contributing to our weaker trend. At some point, inflation will moderate and the low-income customer will start to recover. And I think it's important to understand that longer term, that low-income customer is a large and growing demographic. And frankly, it's a demographic that really likes bricks-and-mortar retail. It's hard to know how much that customer piece is worth, but there is a second factor that we think is important. And this one -- this is the one that matters most to me, because I think we can control and influence it. Put another way, if a customer walks into one of our stores versus one of our peers, what do they see, which store has the most compelling assortment and value and therefore, where are they going to buy, where are they going to spend money. Now most retailers, either are faced with a weak sales trend or a tough promotional environment, are stuck because they can't do much. But as an off-price retailer, we can shift our assortment mix to the areas that the customer is buying, and we can take advantage of supply opportunities to deliver great value in those areas. But when you look at our results, especially on a relative basis, it's clear that we really didn't move far enough. In short-term, for the back half of the year, we're really looking at every aspect of value in our assortment. Last year, we showed we were really good at chasing sales when the customer had money. And the last couple of years, we've been investing, especially in merchandising to improve our execution. And I'm pretty confident that once those improvements -- once those investments have bedded in, they're going to help us improve and over time, close the gap with our peers. When I joined Burlington three years ago, my thesis was that the off-price model, with its focus on value, responsiveness to trends, ability to take advantage of supply disruption, immunity to e-commerce, that model to sell advantage to me versus other retail models. Now, fast forwarding to today, sitting here in 2022, that strategic and investment thesis, really hasn't changed all the structural advantages of the off-price model over other retail channels still apply. And I think the improvements we're making, a stronger buying organization, a more flexible operating model will, overtime, strengthen our own execution of the off-price model. Now obviously, I can't ignore -- over the last three years, we've seen some significant curveballs. The impact of inflation on our core customer and the tidal wave of promotions, they're just the latest of these curveballs. But it's important, I think, to realize that these things are not going to last. Sooner or later, the long-term trends will reemerge and re-ascertain sells, especially the relative advantages of off-price and the dividend that we're going to get from the improvements that we're making to the business. Your line is open. It's funny, of all the topics discussed over the past year I think this is the one that's seen the greatest evolution. A year ago, a combination of stimulus spending, pent-up demand, tight merchandise supply meant that most major retailers were achieving higher realized prices than they had in years. Once the inventory bubble passes, which may take some time and I think pricing across the industry will get more rational again. We talked a little bit about this, I think, on the call in May. If merchandise availability means that we can buy goods at lower cost, then that should allow us to drive markup without necessarily raising prices. But as you can tell from our guidance and based on the factors we've discussed, we're much more cautious about this now. As long as the external environment remains heavily promotional, we think we're going to have to pass along some of this markup to the customer. But on the EPS performance in the second quarter, it was better than the guide despite the comp miss. I think the best way to answer it is just kind of run through the G&L -- sorry, the P&L and give you a little color. So yes as I said earlier, gross margin delevered by about 320 basis points, 210 basis points of that was a decrease in merch margin. And as I said earlier, the markdown rate was still significantly better than in 2019. The rest of the merch margin decrease was driven by a true-up to our shortage accrual based on physical inventory results, we took a physical inventory in June. Remember, last year, most of the increase in freight rates took place during Q3 and Q4. Even though we did manage expenses pretty aggressively in the quarter, we're still investing in all of our Burlington 2.0 initiatives. On the SG&A side -- sorry, more broadly on supply chain, we also had a similar to freight us -- a difficult compare for the second quarter. Within other income, there were some gains from the sale of real estate of about $4 million, so a little bit of a non-recurring item that helped us in the quarter there. So altogether, that should account for the 610 basis point operating margin decrease that we saw. We also had some unanticipated good news in net interest expense, where we had $3 million of interest income related to a tax refund that actually nets against our or interest expense in the P&L. Your line is open. On sales, a couple of points to call out. First, we've missed our sales guidance for the last three quarters. So, we think this guidance may be conservative, but this deal is appropriate. These could help us if inflation slows and if gas prices continue to decline, those things could help. And then if promotional activity elsewhere slows down, we may start to see that trade down shopper in our stores. In terms of the margin and expense side of the guidance, as John mentioned, we're forecasting EBIT margin decline of 160 to 80 basis points in the fall. And as Michael mentioned in his remarks, much lower versus our previous expectations due to the promotional environment. And I'll also call out that the fall plan doesn't include productivity gains that will help us continue to leverage expenses, particularly in supply chain and stores while we continue to invest in the growth of our business. Lastly, comparing Q3 and Q4, the margin decline in the third quarter is expected to be more significant. But also in Q4, we are lapping peak freight and supply chain cost pressures from last year. So let me finish up by saying, yes, we do think this is a conservative plan, but this feels appropriate given the environment and the way we're managing the business. Good morning, Lorraine, it's Michael. On inventory, I think it's important to draw a distinction between in-store inventory and reserve inventory. If you think about sales turns, markdowns and margins, this is the inventory that matters. If we have too much of this inventory, then it will turn slowly, and we'll take markdowns. We ended the quarter very cleanly and we ended with in-store inventories on a comp basis, just slightly below 2021 levels, but we're pretty happy with that. Reserve inventory is much higher than last year, and that's deliberate. In other words, merchandise where we've gotten a great deal and that we're storing for at least in a future month or even next season. The sell-through and the gross margin characteristics of reserve inventory tend to be much better than other types of buy, we manage what goes into reserve carefully to make sure that's the case, and we're pretty happy with our reserve position. And we can either accelerate releases from reserve, and we know we have a good reserve balance or we can go into the market and buy fresh receipts, and we know there's plenty of supply in the market. Now neither of those things was true last year, supply was much more difficult this time last year. But now it's freed up, it really puts us in a good position to chase if the sales trend is stronger. Your line is open. At this point, I don't think it would be fair to have Kristin. If you take the upper end of our updated guidance, it implies an EBIT margin for the full year 2022 and is about 420 basis points below 2019. Of the 420 basis points of contraction, 370 basis points is from higher freight and supply chain expenses. All the other line items combined, so merch and margin and store costs, et cetera, all of those combined represent about 50 basis points of contraction. Now within that bucket, there are positives and negatives, but obviously, the biggest piece within that bucket is expense deleverage on a minus one comp over a three-year period, which, as you can imagine, is significant. So, when we come to update our long-range plan later this year, it's pretty clear to me that there are four main buckets that we're going to be going after. As I just said, 370 basis points of the 420 basis points of deleverage since 2019 has been in these line items. Now as we said before, we're not expecting to get all of that back some of those costs, higher wage rate in the DC, for example, are going to be permanent. But other drivers of those costs, the freight rates, the fuel costs, special wage incentives that we had to give people to get staff, special shifts that we had to run that were more expensive. And I think it's early, but there are signs that that's starting to happen. So that's freight and supply chain costs, and I think we can pull out quite a bit there. The second bucket, though, second lever we would go after, if you like, is sales. Today, we've talked about why sales have declined this year, especially the impact of inflation on low-income customers, extraordinary levels of promotional activity. Add to that, we believe that the longer-term improvements we've been making to the business, especially in merchandising, will further underpin our long-term sales growth. So we think we can drive sales, and that obviously will drive leverage on fixed expenses. I think just -- Kristin just talked about, we originally planned to raise our merchant margin in the back half of this year through higher markup. Now as we've explained, we're being more cautious about that now in this environment. In other words, we've given back some of the progress that we made last year. Now I guess I should just maybe just finish up by saying, we've always believed that we can drive margins above 2019 levels. And I'm not going to review now, we don't have time, but there are additional levers that we believe will help us to get to double-digit margins overtime. Now those include, lower occupancy costs based upon a smaller, more productive store prototype and significant efficiency and productivity improvements that we expect to make in our operations. These -- all these expenses spiked in the back half of last year, I think the model suggests it was a 200 basis point headwind or so to gross margin in the second half last year. So yes, as I said earlier, during the second quarter, supply chain and freight together cost about 170 basis points of deleverage, freight was 110, supply chain another 60. As you know, cost in both of these areas increased much more significantly in the second half than last year. What we're seeing overall, I think, is similar to what we've heard and what you probably heard from other retailers. And we anticipate that this trend is going to continue over the next two quarters and into next year, it's going to help us a little bit in Q3 and Q4, but we expect it to be much more help going into next year and beyond. But so far, it's been less impactful and offset by high fuel prices. But longer term, we think there's going to be much more meaningful movement there, just haven't really seen that much of it yet. For supply chain costs, we do expect some improvement in the second half of the year. You remember last year, we had significant non-recurring incentives and hiring costs as we struggle to get our DCs fully staffed and operating at full capacity. We have seen that wage inflation has slowed the availability of labor has improved significantly since last year, but still a bit of a challenge. But we do anticipate some overall softening in the availability of labor, which should help overall staffing costs some of that maybe a little bit of that in the second half of this year and then looking forward. Your line is open. I don't have a really hard ball question for you, but I did want to follow-up, Michael, on your comments earlier about the sort of agility and the adjustments in the quarter and maybe year-to-date, when trends -- when consumer buying patterns shifted and changed. We've -- in the last couple of years, we've invested in our merchandising team. We've added, I think, since 2019, we've added about 35% headcount to our merchandising team. And within that, there is absolutely a very -- I think, very difficult balance that merchants have to make between deciding where to spend our open to buy, which categories, which styles, which price points. And I think that -- we did all those things in Q1, I want to be careful to acknowledge, we did all those things in Q1. It's really when I do a comparison with our off-price peers, I have to acknowledge well. So, I kind of feel like -- again, as I said in the script, you have to kind of strip out customer differences but if I strip out the customer differences, I'm left with that relative merchandising execution as the thing where I think we still have opportunity. And I can say like I said in the script, I feel like given the talent we've brought on, given the changes we're making, we're absolutely going to be able to do that over time. And last year, I think last year was interesting because I felt like we really demonstrated a lot of capability chasing the trend, chasing into businesses people -- customers wanted to buy when they had money. This year, I just think that challenge is a little different. Your line is open. And I would say, actually throughout Q2 we're very careful to hold back on buying. And a buyer's market, patience is really what gets rewarded. So we're being very, very careful about how we're spending our open to buy, making sure that we're really waiting until the deal is as good as it can possibly be. And I think it's quite likely in the back half, it could be even more excellent. I think, again, it relates to all the things we've talked about, the massive oversupply of inventory, et cetera. When you have external promotions like we're seeing right now, it's so important that we get the very best deal when we're out there buying, because we have to compete against those promotions, it can be done, and that's the value of the off-price model. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call."
