    "content": " Welcome, everyone, to our Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. Before we start, please note that certain statements in today's press release and discussed on this call may constitute forward-looking statements under federal securities laws. And that mindset continues to pay off as our strong Q2 performance once again reflects our rigorous execution of our business plan, a plan we continue to strongly believe will provide significant upside for our shareholders. Elements of the plan include our multi-platform audio first content strategy, which extends our broadcast, and digital content and talent across channels to expand and diversify our audiences. Multiple digital businesses developed profitably from day one, which have bolstered and will continue to drive the company's ability to deliver sustainable top line growth. Significant and continuing reduction of fixed costs, which has meaningfully increased the company's operating leverage, profitability, and free cash flow generation, a focus on high ROI internal investments, a disciplined approach to M&A and the generation of incremental cash through non-core asset monetization. And finally, the creation of a rock solid balance sheet characterized by best among peers net leverage and substantial liquidity, which together enhance the company's financial flexibility and capital allocation optionality. For those who have followed Cumulus for some time, you know that our implementation of this business plan has been both disciplined and unrelenting. With our audio first content strategy to reach new audiences and extend our touch points with existing listeners, we have been creating both new content and extended current content and extended current content franchises and personalities from broadcast to digital and vice versa. The benefits of this content strategy are demonstrated in both our broadcast listenership performance where our audience recovery since the pandemic has outperformed our major peers, and in our digital listening growth, which we have significantly expanding the impressions we take to market. Additionally, as we previously announced, for the first time ever, we have secured the digital audio streaming rights under our new NFL agreement and we expect strong interest when the season starts from listeners who are unable to access this content through an audio stream last season. Also, the Cumulus podcast network continues to help our podcast partners and talent expand their audiences, which in turn, provides us with more impressions to sell. In addition to growing podcast audiences, we were also able to deliver incremental value by extending our podcast relationships across the entire Cumulus platform as we have done with Dan Bongino and Ben Shapiro and others. So, this multi-platform content strategy increases the diversity of channels we could leverage to generate new monetizable impressions to drive revenue growth. Most specifically, we saw continued strength in local spot, up 8% year-over-year offset by ongoing weakness in demand from national clients, which impacted both our national spot and network lines, a challenge we noted in our last earnings call that led to overall broadcast revenue for the quarter coming in at  . However, given the solid performance of our digital business and the contribution of political, we grew revenue overall in Q2. As a reminder, our participation in digital was nascent just several years ago, representing 7% of revenue in 2019. Through the execution of our strategic plan, we have now developed three strong digital businesses, which represented 16% of revenue in Q2, up from 14% in Q1. So, podcasting was not surprisingly our fastest growing digital business in Q2, up 27% year-over-year. All-in, digital revenue contributed 138 million in revenue on an   basis and podcast makes up approximately 40% of that with the other two businesses fairly evenly split. Our digital marketing services business, which leverages the relationships of our local sellers with tens of thousands of local and regional businesses grew 22% in the second quarter. Dealing that growth is our continuing expansion of the products we provide our clients, including in Q2, the launch of a full array of integrated presence products ranging from listings and reputation management to website development and SEO. These presence products are not only stickier, which will improve customer retention, but we also believe that there's strong interplay between presence and campaign solutions, which will significantly increase the value of the digital marketing dollars that our customers are spending with Cumulus. Our third digital business as mentioned earlier is streaming, which was up 12% in the quarter. Another characteristic of our performance is our ability to seed and develop these digital businesses, while simultaneously reducing fixed costs on a permanent basis, enhancing profit margins and driving free cash flow. Against the 2019 baseline, our fixed costs will be more than 75 million lower in 2022 and we realized 5 million of benefits from fixed cost reductions year-over-year in Q2 alone. As an example, last year, we leveraged technology and process improvements to move our business manager function from individual roles into each market to a central consolidated function across markets. Also, applying some of the lessons from COVID regarding reduced in office operating footprints, this year we have taken on 28 facility consolidations or reductions, and we are continuing to explore additional opportunities for long-term real estate savings. Now, returning to where we started, our rigorous execution of our business plan resulted in another quarter of EBITDA growth, up 23% year-over-year and margin expansion up 280 basis points. Importantly, trailing 12-month EBITDA is now 166 million, up from 157 million last quarter, 135 million in 2021 and 82 million in 2020. This improving profitability also brings year to date cash generation from operations to 31 million, with quarters ahead of us that traditionally generate more cash flow. As I mentioned earlier, we've been able to invest in the infrastructure, systems, technology and people on a fully organic basis to date to fuel significant growth in our digital businesses. Lastly, we have bolstered our cash balance over the years to aggressively monetizing non-core assets such as land and towers and we continue to look for opportunities to generate value from remaining non-core assets. All of these aspects of our plan, the multi-platform content strategy, our digital revenue drivers, strong expense management, and cash flow generation, and high ROI investments have helped to fortify our balance sheet and put us in a position to have tremendous capital allocation optionality. In Q2, we took advantage of that to execute a 25 million Dutch tender offer, utilizing half of our 50 million share buyback authorization. Additionally, the debt market dislocation this quarter provided us with an opportunity to buy back 50 million of our bonds at a discount, bringing year to date debt reduction to 62 million, reducing interest expense to partly counteract the impact of rising rates. Inclusive of these actions, we yet again reduced net leverage from 3.9x last quarter to 3.8x this quarter. The local channels are relatively stronger and digital is still performing nicely, given that, our Q3 total revenue pacing as we sit here today is down low single digits. Given that pace and our current visibility, we are on trend toward the low-end of our previous EBITDA guidance range of 175 million to 200 million. As Mary mentioned, while digital revenue was the key driver behind our growth this quarter, our strength in local broadcast offset continued weakness from national advertisers. The weakness in national spot also  8% year-over-year in local spot, bringing total spot performance to up 5%. During the quarter, we also had 3.9 million of political revenue. As a reminder, we expect to receive most of our political revenue during the second half of the year and more heavily weighted to the  quarter. From a category standpoint, we continue to see strong growth in physical presence categories such as live entertainment and travel. On auto, we're still expecting the weakness in the sector as we were down 45% in the   in 2019, down 5% versus 2021. In the quarter, we also began to see weakness in the financial ad category, which is a large driver of the decline in national spot. Total expenses in the quarter increased by approximately 3 million year-over-year, driven by higher variable costs and higher revenue, which more than offset fixed expense declines. The combined revenue  performance resulted in EBITDA for the quarter of 45.5 million, which is up approximately 9 million or 23% year-over-year. As Mary mentioned,   of fixed costs  this last year  to the second quarter of 2019, costs were down approximately 25 million. We ended the quarter with net leverage of    down from 3.9x at the end of the previous quarter, despite the use of 25 million of cash and stock repurchases. As a reminder, we're  to reduce net leverage to below 3.5x, given our current outlook, we would achieve by year-end. With trailing 12-months EBITDA of 166 million, up from 157 million last quarter, we are on trend given what we see now to the low-end of our 2022 EBITDA guidance range of 175 million to 200 million. Your line is now open. Just first one from me on the outlook, down low single digits in the third quarter. You know, for Q3 and this was encompassed in the pacing, we continue to see weakness in both national and network. In terms of categories, it's really what Frank said in the prepared remarks, the categories that are doing well so far are what we call the physical presence category. What's also built in is, there's obviously upside in political as well. In the quarter, in the second quarter, we saw the decline in the network in national   towards the second half of the quarter versus the first half of the quarter  everyone pacing is at a point of time, but we're still seeing the weakness as we're here in the first five weeks in the third quarter. The other thing I would add Dan is, and we talked about this in the first quarter is, we pull forward a whole bunch of revenues this year through the settlement of the WynnBET transaction. And so, when we look at pace at the company \u00e2\u0080\u0093 on the company level, it includes pacing last year that had WynnBET revenues and this year does not. And then like you're sitting here, you have 109 million of cash in the balance sheet, that's a lot of cash for a company of your size. On the stock repurchase side, as we discussed, we utilized 25 million of the 50 million authorization that we've received from the Board. And that   ends next year, and so it's our expectation that we'll continue to be active in the markets throughout the period that we have the authorization to buy back stock, but we'll also be balancing what the market is and the liquidity is on that. We'll continue to be opportunistic users of our capital, but also want to be mindful of what the environment in front of us, but the goal here from a net leverage perspective is continue to reduce leverage. Your line is now open. The first six months  political higher than the period for the first six months of , it's very back end loaded. So, our expectation is it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to be very  but again, these are orders that we get last minute  heavily skewed towards the end of the  and beginning of the fourth quarter. From where we see today, we would be disappointed if we had less and 2018 results and that's all I can say on that topic. Well, when you think about our local businesses, most of our local business revenues is really local direct and local agency. And when we look around the country in terms of our direct local business  they continue to be functioning pretty well, unemployment is low. We are mindful of recession that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve talked a lot about in press and on the news, but at this  the local business is still chasing constructively and we just have to look to see if that continues. So, as a reminder, our pacing down  incorporates weakness in national and network strong political expectation, strong digital and fairly balanced local spot business. Your line is now open. As you could see, we continue to build the capabilities of the marketing services business. And so, what we've generally had is advertising campaign products and those have been central to our growth over the past few years, but by adding what is a full suite of integrated presence products, so it's listings, as we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve said in reputation management website development. And so, essentially the way we look at it is there's lots of small digital agencies that have built paid digital media capabilities. We're talking businesses 0 to 50 employees, the full spectrum of digital marketing solutions. And unlike others, we often combine the audio and the digital advertising seamlessly to \u00e2\u0080\u0093 for improved IRIs for our clients. We are leveraging the relationships that we have already with tens of thousands of local and regional businesses to tap into the growing market, and we do it with our sales force. political in 2018, Jim was $20 million and our expectation in internal models are to be at least the same as  . So, we do look at everything across our portfolio for opportunities to be bigger, be more efficient, cut costs, enhance revenues, and enhance EBITDA, enhance our growth strategies from a business perspective. It's not to say there's an opportunity on our base business, legacy  to increase the strength in the market. We're always looking and are fortunate to have the balance sheet and liquidity to do so, which I think really differentiates us. Your line is now open. In our press release, you will see  that the key categories,  of revenue in the second quarter. Broadcast spot revenue was   and there are two categories within broadcast spot, there is spot in which you should think about really as our local business  national that was 127 million,   was just under 49 million. And as Mary   of our revenues, and other category of 23 million that's basically non-traditional revenue, like concerts, events, , etcetera. And then I thought you mentioned in the opening remarks, now you secured digital audio streaming rights in NFL, and correct me if I misheard that, I apologize, but I think I heard it correctly. So, what that means is, we're now able to combine broadcast impressions with, you know, the new digital impressions. And what I would say is that we're in the early days of monetizing the incremental audience opportunity, but we do have strong sponsorship interest for the upcoming season. So, it's really too early to quantify and not   to the company as a whole, but it does provide EBITDA upside to the relationship we believe with what is a very high value premium content franchise. Thank you all for joining us today, and we look forward to our call in the next quarter."
