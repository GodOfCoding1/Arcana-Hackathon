    "content": " In the first quarter of 2022, Cumulus delivered strong results reflected across a number of key financial metrics, including robust revenue growth, improved operating efficiency and significant additional deleveraging of the balance sheet. This top line growth in combination with the meaningful cost reductions we've implemented over the last several years also yielded significant bottom line improvement with first quarter year-over-year EBITDA up 250% and to $31.2 million from $8.9 million, with an EBITDA margin improvement of 900 basis points. To remind you, by the end of 2021, we achieved annualized permanent fixed cost reductions of more than $75 million versus the 2019 baseline, which translated into $22 million lower expense versus that baseline in the first quarter alone and will provide a continuing benefit to operating leverage. As Mary mentioned, given our first quarter results, free cash flow outlook and strong balance sheet, we announced a $50 million share repurchase program, which we expect to begin this program in the very near term."
