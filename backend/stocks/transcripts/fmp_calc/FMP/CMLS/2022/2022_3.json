    "content": " Collectively, these efforts resulted in 5% year-over-year revenue growth in the quarter across our three digital businesses, streaming, podcasting and digital marketing services. We delivered streaming revenue growth of 11% year-over-year for the quarter as our focus on continuing to deepen and increase engagement with current listeners, and bringing new listeners to our content to create sellable impressions that we monetize through local, national, network and programmatic ad channels is paying off. As Mary mentioned, revenue in Q3 was down 2% driven primarily by ongoing weakness from national advertisers as well as lower activity from local advertisers which in aggregate, negatively impacted broadcast revenue, partially offset by continued growth in our digital businesses. Total expenses in the quarter decreased by approximately $5 million year-over-year, driven by benefits from our continued cost reduction actions as well as lower variable costs and lower revenue. These cost reductions, which more than offset ongoing session -- inflationary increases from items like personnel and insurance costs help us drive growth and EBITDA for the quarter of 2% year-over-year to $46.6 million. And so how that worked through in the guidance is since a large component of our revenues comes from our local spot business, instead of adding contribution versus last year to the extent it stays flat, it declines a little bit that impacts the pacing from the overall company perspective, which of course is offset by the digital growth that we continue to have in our business."
