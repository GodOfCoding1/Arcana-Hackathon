    "content": " The gross profit margin, 53.4%, improved by 390 basis points compared to the prior year period of 49.5% driven by our continued higher level of full price sell-through, growing CPM revenues and a higher share of countries with prepaid duties charged to the customer, as for example, in the U.S. During the second quarter, marketing expenses increased to \u20ac23.8 million compared to \u20ac19.7 million in the prior year quarter, primarily due to the increase in the number of customers acquired."
