    "content": " Second, our multiyear growth potential evidenced by the two year growth rate in GMV of 65.3% in the first quarter of fiscal year 2022 over Q1 of fiscal year 2020. In addition to new customers, we also again grew our top customer base, which is a key source of profitable growth over proportionally by 41.0% in the first quarter compared to Q1 of fiscal year 2021. With more clarity now on the agreed season for the model switch, we expect the CPM share for the full fiscal year 2022 to be well below the 20% maximum share guides. We expect similar growth rates in fiscal year 2023 due to selected brands shifting from the wholesale model to the CPM, after which net sales will be growing again, more in line with GMP yearly growth rates. The first quarter of fiscal 2022 Mytheresa reported an adjusted operating income of \u20ac11.8 million, compared to the \u20ac8.4 million in the previous year quarter, and thus representing a solid growth of 14.7%. As stated before, we expect the CPM share in our business for the full fiscal year 2022 to be well below 20% of our total platform revenues and in the medium term, we expect the share to be not higher than 35%. Your line is open. Please ask your question. And thus, the sales growth for technical reasons will slow down as on the CPM, we don't book the transaction that transacted gross merchandise value as revenue, but the transacted fee or the charge platform fee and for us, the business continues to grow fully in line with the 22% to 25%. Your line is open. Please ask your question. Your line is open. Please ask your question. Your line is open. Please ask your question. Your line is open. Please ask your question."
