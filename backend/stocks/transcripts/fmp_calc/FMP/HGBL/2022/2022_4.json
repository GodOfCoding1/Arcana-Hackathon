    "content": " We closed 2022 with strong operating results in the fourth quarter, which included operating income of $3.1 million, improved profitability and EBITDA of $3.3 million driven by solid results from both our industrial and financial asset divisions. Throughout 2022 activity and our industrial assets division showed continued momentum, and we closed out the fourth quarter with a 310% increase in asset sales to $6.5 million, compared to asset sales $1.6 million in the fourth quarter 2021. Based on the past several years of taxable income and projected operating results for the next five years, the company determined that it is more likely than not that it will utilize a significant portion of its net operating loss carry forwards and thus really 7.1 million of its valuation allowance against his deferred tax assets. In our financial assets division, we saw growth of 193% to $5.9 million in operating income compared to $2 million in prior year."
