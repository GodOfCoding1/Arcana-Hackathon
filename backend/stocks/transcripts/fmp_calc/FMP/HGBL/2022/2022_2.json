    "content": " Operating income in the Industrial Assets Division was $3.3 million in the second quarter of 2022, a significant increase as compared to $433,000 in the second quarter of 2021. In our Financial Assets Division, we saw growth of 156% to $1.2 million in operating income compared to $462,000 in the second quarter of 2021., Net income was $2.6 million or $0.07 per basic and diluted share compared to net income of $587,000 or $0.02 per basic and diluted share in the second quarter of 2021. So that in the end, NLEX is actually at a point in time where I think it can actually beat its post pandemic highs that tied into the fact that about a year and a half or two years ago, we opened up Heritage Global Capital to lend that business wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t growing as fast as we\u00e2\u0080\u0099d hoped during a pandemic when most of the assets were being sold to the large public companies and the people buying borrowing from us were basically not that strong in the market as they are today."
