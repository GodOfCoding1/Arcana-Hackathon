    "content": " Our third quarter built on the momentum we experienced in the first half of the year as reflected in our strong operating results, which included operating income of $3.5 million, improved profitability and EBITDA of $3.6 million. Our financial performance during the third quarter and the nine months ended September 30, 2022, reflected strong performance from both our Industrial and our Financial Assets division. We continue to see a substantial increase in the number of principal transactions executed in our Industrial Assets division, where we reported more than 350% increase in asset sales for the third quarter 2022 compared to the same period in 2021. Services revenue also grew significantly in the third quarter related to an increase in volume as the current economic environment is driving increased consumer spending, which is resulting in more charge-off loans becoming available. On a consolidated basis, operating income for the quarter was $3.5 million compared to $533,000 in the third quarter of 2021. Operating income in the Industrial Assets division was $3.1 million in the third quarter of 2022, a significant increase as compared to $765,000 in the third quarter of 2021. In our Financial Assets division, we saw growth of 249% to $1.6 million in operating income compared to $449,000 in the third quarter of 2021. Net income was $2.3 million or $0.06 per basic and diluted share compared to net income of $474,000 or $0.01 per basic and diluted share in the third quarter of 2021. EBITDA of $3.6 million was significantly improved as compared to EBITDA of $638,000 in the third quarter of 2021 and adjusted EBITDA grew to $3.8 million for the third quarter of 2022, up from $740,000 in the third quarter of 2021."
