    "content": " Looking at the two segments; net operating income in the industrial assets division was $846,000 in the first quarter of 2022 as compared to $1.3 million in the first quarter of 2021. Within our financial assets division, we saw a significant growth resulting in net operating income of $731,000, an increase of 59% as compared to $461,000 in the first quarter of 2021. Finally, our balance sheet remains strong with stockholders equity of $33 .4 million as of March 31, 2022 compared to $32.6 million as of December 31, 2021 and networking capital of $8.8 million. Let me break it down across all five revenue streams; beginning with our financial asset division, both our index brokerage of non-performing loans and our lending business to buyers of these assets are rapidly now shifting to post pandemic supply increases of product we offer and more active current requirements from additional sellers."
