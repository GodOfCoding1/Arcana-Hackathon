    "content": " 06:57 According to Gartner, by twenty twenty four, sixty percent of organizations will have switched to a DevOps value stream delivery platform to streamline application delivery versus twenty percent in twenty twenty one. For the quarter, we had over four twenty customers with ARR of at least one hundred thousand, up from over three eighty and over two forty customers compared to the prior quarter and year, respectively. For both our five thousand dollars and one hundred thousand dollars customers, I think it is important to note that we have already well exceeded the number of new customers we've added to our platform compared to FY twenty twenty one and over FY twenty twenty. For the fourth quarter of FY twenty twenty two, we expect total revenue of sixty nine point five million dollars to seventh point five million dollars, representing a growth rate of fifty one percent to fifty three percent year-over-year. We now expect total revenue of two hundred and forty four million dollars to two hundred and forty five million dollars, representing a growth rate of sixty percent to sixty one percent year-over-year. They see that grown to sixty percent by twenty twenty four, but right now it's all about customers replacing their point solutions with a platform and convincing them that that is the way forward. Those are our expansion points and we're investing there and especially Secure has driven a lot of up tiering to Ultimate, because it's really important for customers to test one hundred percent of their projects one hundred percent of the time."
