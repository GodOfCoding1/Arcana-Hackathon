    "content": " To quantify these benefits based on a study conducted by Forrester Consulting and commissioned by GitLab, our customers saw a 407% return on investment within three years of deployment of our DevOps platform. If you look at our guidance at the midpoint, we're going to deliver approximately $160 million of additional revenue this year over last year at an improved absolute operating loss than what we did last year, if you take away JiHu and some of the one-time events that we went through. We are certainly seeing that with customers that say, \"Look, we need to consolidate, and we want to move to fewer tools, and that's why we're considering GitLab.\" And so, I think the awareness of just a DevOps platform and GitLab helps and then also the time to value and business outcomes that we're driving and a number of people wanting to get rid of point solutions, get on a platform for the efficiency."
