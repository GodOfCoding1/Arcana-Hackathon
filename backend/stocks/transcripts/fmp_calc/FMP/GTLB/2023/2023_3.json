    "content": " These business results are rooted in four main areas: reducing costs of software as a result of choosing a single platform vendor over multiple point solutions, reducing costs associated with tool chain integration, creating higher developer productivity and a better user experience and increasing revenue due to faster cycle time of application releases. Customers can get data residency to get more isolation, private networking, and we're excited having that in the market and talking with customers, for people wondering about pricing, it's going to be mainly per user with an infrastructure component as well, and we were excited to announce that at re:Invent."
