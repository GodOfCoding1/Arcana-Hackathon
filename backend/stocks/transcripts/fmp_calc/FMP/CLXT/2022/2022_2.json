    "content": " Throughout the second quarter of 2022, the Calyxt team tangibly advanced each area of the business, including progressing our development and sale of customer demand-driven plant-based chemistries, the procurement of infrastructure partners to greatly expand our manufacturing capabilities and technology and plant trait licensing. In the second quarter, Calyxt received 9 new chemistries from potential customers for evaluation, bringing the total number of chemistries cumulatively evaluated poor development with our PlantSpring platform and for production in our BioFactory to 95. Leveraging the 31 customer demand-driven chemistries that have passed our TPP criteria, Calyxt is currently negotiating term sheets with several potential customers for the development of a select number of those plant-based chemistries."
