    "content": " As of late April, Calyxt has evaluated 28 molecules identified by potential customers for development within our PlantSpring platform and for production in our BioFactory. Liz brings over 15 years of chemistry and purification expertise to Calyxt and will be responsible for pilot to commercial scale production of the company\u2019s customer demand-driven compounds and, along with an R&D leader, the verify stage of product development. In summary, Calyxt\u2019s PlantSpring technology and the BioFactory production system are differentiated from our peers in synthetic biology in many ways, including our business model. As part of Calyxt\u2019s ongoing validation of its platform technology, we are on track to realize several important milestone targets across PlantSpring and the BioFactory, first, within PlantSpring, and building on our current gene targeting capability, to have AIML capabilities for the identification of pathways in the design phase of development by midyear 2022. Now, we don\u2019t have a signed development agreement as it relates to that individual compound, but we are using that within our pilot BioFactory to further advance its capabilities and scale, while we are simultaneously having those discussions with the potential customers now with regards to those 28 molecules. But it sounds like you\u2019ve identified this compound as potentially being able to be developed in the BioFactory and you\u2019ve also had multiple customers come with this compound and saying, hey, this is something we would be interested in having you produce. So as we, in parallel, have conversations with these customers that we\u2019ve outlined about the specific demand-driven molecules, it\u2019s a great utilization of it to be able to assist in the development of the capabilities and the scaling of the pilot BioFactory."
