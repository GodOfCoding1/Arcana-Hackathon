    "content": " Our net loss for the quarter was $3.6 million and our adjusted EBITDA loss was $0.9 million, which translates into a 56% and 94% improvements year-over-year, respectively. For the full year 2022, our revenue of $28 million exceeded the high end of our guidance range of $27 million, representing 66% year-over-year growth driven by our healthcare information offerings. First, as previously announced in February of this year, we completed the strategic divestiture of our cannabis software operating subsidiary, BioTrack, on February 10, for $30 million in cash proceeds, which has enabled us to streamline our operations and dedicate more resources to our core healthcare business. As in prior quarters, our year-over-year growth was driven by healthcare information products, which increased $1.9 million or 64% over the same quarter last year to $5 million. The improvement in loss from operations resulted from the $2.2 million of revenue growth discussed above, and a $2.4 million reduction in operating expenses, primarily resulting from lower G&A expenses when compared to the same quarter last year. Adjusted EBITDA, which excludes the stock-based compensation, depreciation, amortization and certain other non-recurring costs for the fourth quarter, was negative $900,000 compared to negative $4.5 million in the same quarter last year and negative $2.1 million in the previous quarter of this year. We expect 2023 revenues to be in the range of $20.5 million to $22.5 million, reflecting an increase of 25% to 37% over the prior year healthcare information revenues."
