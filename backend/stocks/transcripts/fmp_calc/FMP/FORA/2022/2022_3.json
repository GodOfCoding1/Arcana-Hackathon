    "content": " In the third quarter, the company generated revenue of $7.2 million and net loss of $5.1 million, and adjusted EBITDA loss of $2.1 million, respectively. As we had discussed on last quarter's call, we continued to execute against our cost optimization efforts, which netted improvement in net loss and adjusted EBITDA of $1.9 million and $2 million this quarter, respectively. The improvement in loss from operations resulted from the $2.2 million of recurring revenue growth discussed above, and a $200,000 reduction in operating expenses resulting from lower G&A expenses, partially offset by increased spending on research, development and sales expenses when compared to the same quarter last year. Adjusted EBITDA, which excludes the stock compensation depreciation, amortization and certain other non cash costs for the third quarter was negative $2.1 million compared to negative $4.1 million in the same quarter last year, and negative $3.2 million in the previous quarter this year. Regarding our financial outlook for 2022, we are on track to exceed the high end of our previously issued guidance with revenue growth of 60% over 2021 or $27 million, and expect to be able to realize the benefits of our revenue growth in the form of improved adjusted EBITDA loss during the second half of 2022, while achieving a positive adjusted EBITDA contribution in the second half of 2023."
