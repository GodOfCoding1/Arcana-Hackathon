    "content": " The segment's outcome-based business continues to be impacted by a contraction in year-over-year demand from our call center specialty, but growth in other outcome-based specialties has more than offset that headwind and total outcome-based revenue was up about 3% for the quarter. In our P&I segment, we began to see some softening in staffing demand in the third quarter, not unusual since this segment typically is the first impacted by a slowing economy, notwithstanding year-over-year contraction in our call center business, our outcome-based P&I specialties delivered growth in the quarter."
