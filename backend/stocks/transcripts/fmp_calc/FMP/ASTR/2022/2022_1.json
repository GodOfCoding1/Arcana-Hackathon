    "content": " In Phase II of our strategy, we plan to leverage our frequent, low cost per launch access to space and vertical manufacturing capability to rapidly develop space technologies into space qualified market-leading products that are needed by Astra and our customers as we build next generation space services. Like cloud computing has enabled tech companies to build new applications, without investing in upfront capital, buying servers, leasing data centers and operating networks, the Astra Space platform will allow our customers to focus on their applications instead of buying dedicated launches, building custom satellites and operating constellations. In January NASA ordered Astra, the Venture-Class acquisition of Dedicated Rideshare contract, along with other launch and space service providers, this award represents a $300 million opportunity over the next five years. As our production and launch operation teams, manufacture and launch rockets to provide launch services for our customers this year, we are increasingly focusing on Launch System 2.0, which will introduce the next version of our Rocket 4.0, which is designed for a weekly production rate in our new rocket factory with increased payload capacity, decreased material, labor and launch operations costs."
