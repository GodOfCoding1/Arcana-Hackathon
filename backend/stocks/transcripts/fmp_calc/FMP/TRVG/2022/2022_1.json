    "content": " In our segment Developed Europe, we saw steady improvement every week since the beginning of the year, when qualified referrals were at approximately 50% of 2019 levels, until the invasion of Ukraine by Russia which led to a temporary decrease in traffic volumes in our core European markets in the weeks following the invasion. In Americas, traffic volumes during the first quarter were relatively stable with qualified referrals at 60% of 2019 levels. As qualified referrals recovered from Omicron and auction dynamics continue to be healthy across many of our core markets, our global referral revenue increased significantly year-over-year and was at around 50% of 2019 levels in the first quarter of 2022. As we have improved our marketing efficiency and performance marketing channels and we're still cautious with brand marketing campaigns in the first quarter, advertising expenses were still significantly below pre-pandemic levels at around 35% of 2019 levels for the same period. We are seeing the strongest recovery in Europe where qualified reverse were above 70% of 2019 levels in April, closely followed by Americas at around 65%, while rest of the world recovered to around 45%."
