    "content": " In Americas, qualified referrals relative to 2019 levels decreased slightly sequentially from 59% in the third quarter to 56% in the fourth quarter, primarily driven by qualified referral declines in Latin America, resulting mainly from a large-scale market test in Brazil that led to a significant decline in qualified referrals in that country. In addition, positive ForEx exchange and country mix effect were similar to what we already observed in the third quarter, leading to an overall increase of revenue per qualified referrals in America of 33% relative to 2019. Revenue per qualified referrals increased around 20% year-on-year in the segment, decelerating from the 44% year-on-year increase in the fourth quarter as positive foreign exchange and country mix effect and/or monetization were lower compared to Q4. In Rest of World, we have a single-digit increase in qualified referrals in January year-over-year, while revenue per qualified referrals increased significantly, driven by strong increases in booking conversion, average booking values and positive country mix effect. Please go ahead, your line is now open. Please go ahead, your line is now open. Please go ahead, your line is now open. Please go ahead, your line is now open. Please go ahead, your line is now open. Qualified referrals increased by more than 10% year-on-year in Europe and around 5% in Rest of World, while qualified referrals decreased slightly year-on-year in Americas due to the decline in Latin America, which more than offset the increase in North America. Please go ahead, your line is now open."
