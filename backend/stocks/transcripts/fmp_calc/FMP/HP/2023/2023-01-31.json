    "content": " H&P generated approximately $185 million in operating cash flow during the first quarter of 2023, which was generally in line with our expectations. As of today's call we have 185 rigs contracted and we expect to end the second fiscal quarter of 2023, with between 183 and 188 contracted rigs. Regarding our International Solutions segment, International Solutions business activity increased by one rig to 13 active rigs at the end of the first fiscal quarter, we added a rig in Argentina as expected, which brings our working rig count to nine in that country. As we look toward the second quarter of fiscal 2023 for international, we will incur costs to reactivate a rig in Bahrain, which we expect to begin working in the middle of the quarter bringing us to two or three rigs working in that country. As we look toward the second quarter of fiscal 2023 for the offshore segment, we expect that offshore will again generate between $8 million to $10 million of direct margin. Capital expenditures for the full fiscal 2023 year, are still expected to range between $425 million to $475 million, with the remaining spend to be incurred over our last three fiscal quarters. What we're simply saying is, as John said in his prepared comments, 520 super-spec working and David's question was if you lost 5% or 10% of that, I mean, that's 26 to 52 rigs, but that's still 95% to 90% utilization of the super-spec fleet."
