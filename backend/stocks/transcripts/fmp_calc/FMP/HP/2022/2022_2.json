    "content": " Well, Taylor, we still have 40% of our rigs that are on performance base type contracts and we've had that now for several quarters, obviously, much improved from when we very first went on this journey two years ago, like you mentioned. And we're still saying it that 22, we at least we expect is going to play out very similar to 21 where the fourth calendar quarter we've got a lot of rigs going back to work first calendar, quarter a lot of rigs going back to work, then it gets, a little flatter, you get choppy, a lot of churn. I'll take a stab at that, it's that technology, and then that digital software that we have focusing on down hole operations improvement for our customers, as we've long talked about straighter and better placed wellbores, which actually help with our customers overall, total cost of ownership of a well, we as a driller are about 20, to 25%, of an AFP for well, and we can affect a lot of the other 75% plus costs with the drilling in a better well, I think that's proved evident in our uptake in performance contracts. So I think the uptake from a couple of years ago not having performance contracts to the day having 40% of the fleet on those and it's those contracts that are driving the 30,000 plus revenue per day, really at the top end of our fleet of our fleet, and helping us to get to the margins that we've talked about, we need to get to John, if you have any. For a couple of quarters, I think the Middle East has had a really steady recount, through the compared to the volatility of the US shale play over the last 15 years, there's not really been a rig replacement cycle there, that you couple that with the what is a burgeoning gas play with several countries in the region, including for their own energy strategic gas independence reasons, as well as potential LNG export reasons."
