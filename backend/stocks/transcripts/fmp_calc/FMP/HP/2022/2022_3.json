    "content": " Revenues were sequentially higher by $77 million due to pricing increases for our flex rigs in the spot market as John mentioned, and as we discussed on the second fiscal quarter call. Looking ahead to the fourth quarter of fiscal \u00e2\u0080\u009822 for North American solutions, as of today's call, we have 176 flex rigs contracted, and we expect to continue at that level through the end of the fourth fiscal quarter of 2022. As mentioned, we still expect capital expenditures for the full fiscal year drains between $250 million to $270 million with remaining spend and approximately 85 million at the midpoint to be incurred in the last fiscal quarter. Guy, I would be surprised personally to see all of those rigs reactivated in 2023 for a number of reasons that we've already talked about related to just the supply chain and the capability to be able to provide the equipment sets required to get those rigs back into working back to working condition, because we as an industry we've utilized equipment sets off of those rigs that have been idle now, as Mark said, rover will be for over two and a half years. The service industry is displaying that and there's no reason to rush, even if the supply chain was there, there's no reason to rush to try to capture all this, any additional market share that you might be able to capture, one of the things that that we experienced in this last quarter, and you heard us talk about churn, we actually had 18 rigs that were given back to us for various reasons. We, I think there's some that, haven't didn't completely follow from our last call that we said, hey, we're recounts, going to be at the most 176 rigs this fiscal year. So we're going to be very cognizant of that theme, as we think about your last question and figuring out how many rigs to put in the market and in our first fiscal quarter, to get to a 1231."
