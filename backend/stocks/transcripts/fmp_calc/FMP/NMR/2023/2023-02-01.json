    "content": " By strengthening our segment based approach and providing detailed consulting services tailored to each client's needs and the changing market conditions, we were able to increase flow revenue by 22% driven by sales of stocks, investment trusts and foreign bonds. As shown on the bottom left, Global Markets revenues slowed by 15% to JPY154.3 billion, mainly due to a slowdown in rates and ForEx emerging markets. In our core business, we started to see an improvement in sentiment among investors and corporates and retail and investment banking revenues rebounded, giving us an ROE of over 8% for the first time in four quarters.
