    "content": " Although last quarter included \u00c2\u00a511.5 billion from the reversal of losses arising from transactions with a U.S. client, revenues grew quarter-on-quarter thanks to strong performance in Fixed Income as well as yen depreciation. Regarding your first question about the earnings in the Americas, and as you pointed out, last year -- or in the previous quarter, there was the litigation expenses related legacy assets, legacy transactions, which declined. And going forward, if the market factors subside, then you should be able to generate about \u00c2\u00a527.5 billion per quarter as you used to generate or as you mentioned earlier, in order to achieve KGI, do you -- is there room to conduct a quite a thorough review of the cost structure please?"
