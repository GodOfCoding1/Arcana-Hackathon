    "content": " Net revenue, first, let's say at the 9-month period to the end of December, net revenue declined 17% year-on-year to \u00a51.0231 trillion, and income before income taxes declined 55% to \u00a5177.1 billion. The decline was mainly due to a slowdown in brokerage commissions from sales of stocks and investment trusts in retail and the normalization from a strong market rally last year, particularly in fixed income in macro products such as rates and FX in wholesale. Recurring revenue accounts for 32% of retail revenues and the recurring revenue cost coverage ratio is 41%, both up 10 percentage points from the third quarter last year, contributing to a more stable revenue mix."
