    "content": " As noted before, we're excited about this industry for a lot of reasons, other than just being passionate about drones and what the impact will have on society, but also because today it's a $20 billion industry, which is primarily a military focused industry in terms of those revenues, but it's growing to a $40-plus billion industry over the next number of years. Strategically we have \u00e2\u0080\u0093 we believe or at least our realization around work in Ukraine is that in the coming years in particular in the light military and in the commercial and industrial space, if you weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t present in Ukraine, if you did not have operations in Ukraine, if you were not in their learning, developing improving your products, your services, your techniques, your training, all of that type of stuff with the various players and stakeholders in that environment, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to be asked why in a couple years from now, why you weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t there. So whether it's a long form, inspection pipelines, power lines infrastructure facilities, forestry, inventories things like that, that's we're going to continue to see that proven use cases, ROIs there, and now they're just looking for reliable providers and suppliers again, typically North American built in order to do and provide that."
