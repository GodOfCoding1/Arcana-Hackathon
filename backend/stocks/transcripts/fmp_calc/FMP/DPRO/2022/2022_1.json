    "content": " Today\u2019s call will follow the same format as previous ones, which means it will start with our CEO and now our President, Cameron Chell discussing first quarter operational highlights; from there CFO, Paul Sun will jump in and discuss the financials as were reported earlier today. While we\u2019ll try to address them all, I apologize in advance, if time doesn\u2019t allow us to do so. I\u2019ve already talked to so many of you, but remember, you\u2019re always welcome to reach out to me anytime, investor.relations@draganfly.com. In fact, certainly within the industry, we\u2019re known as the oldest commercial drone manufacturer in the world. And in fact even recently this week, I got a -- some pictures and the text from a shareholder who was in North Carolina, at a police museum, and they actually had old Draganfly drone controllers in the police museum as the first drones that were used in public safety and public service. And I think what\u2019s really important to note there is that in our 24-year history, we\u2019ve only had two employees that have left, and one of them retired and one of them was stolen by Google a number of years ago. And so, that -- the combination of the expertise that we are able to bring to the table, not just from an engineering perspective, but from an industry and a relationship perspective is something that\u2019s really propelling us forward in the market today, as it opens up. Basically, we have 24 patents, because we\u2019re 24 years old. But it\u2019s a bit more of a cultural thing for us, when we put our engineers\u2019 names on the patents that they sort of deliberately shouldn\u2019t  be there. So, we really rely on that as a credibility piece with our customers, and demonstration piece for our culture, but it\u2019s really all the other hundreds of pieces of IP that we keep as trading secrets that really help us have a competitive advantage with our customers. We are really strong in new product development, and we\u2019ll talk a bit about that on today\u2019s call. So, we\u2019re not a shop that\u2019s building things necessarily on spec. But if we don\u2019t see customer demand really pushing in that direction, if we don\u2019t see our relationships on a regulatory basis pushing in that direction, we won\u2019t invest in technology just because we think it\u2019s cool. The underlying premise of the drone industry today, as opposed to the last 20 years that we\u2019ve been in it is that it is finely scaling. But the reality is, none of them are in the drone business or even in business today, because they were trying to scale into an industry that didn\u2019t yet exist. And that guidance is now given a reference point for the commercial industry to build ROI models and have a clear direction as to how the drone industry is going to work and how commercial drones will work within the infrastructure, within our society and within the airspace. Literally within weeks of that announcement coming out from the FAA a couple of years ago, I went from spending my days dialing for dollars quite basically, grinding it out for customers to really being overwhelmed with the inbound orders. It\u2019s taken us about a year and maybe a year and a half to tool up, to build our capacity to meet that customer demand, which is why we did the public offering that we did. And with our rich history of 24 years of service, to the public safety and to our military contracting community, we have those credentials, and that\u2019s another reason that we are starting to see scale. A lot of the new drone startups or even if they\u2019re not startups, but companies that have been around for 4 or 5, 6 years, they\u2019re just -- they are still building hardware and all credit to them. And they\u2019re still figuring out how to get those clearances and build those relationships, and they are doing a fine job of it. And it\u2019s great business, it\u2019s high margin, it\u2019s low volume. It helps us to attract the best talent in the industry, and it\u2019s one of the reasons that we have been able to keep our talent for so long. We get to work on really incredible projects, blood delivery on the battlefield or counter drone technology, autonomous and AI type of technologies that have -- we\u2019ve been now working with for, in some cases a decade, which are now only starting to become prevalent in the commercial market. And when we deliver terabytes of data, whether it\u2019s a LiDAR data, mapping data, environmental data, whatever the case is to customers, more and more, they are asking us to house that data. And I would suggest that in coming years in some industries, we\u2019ll be one of the largest data repositories for those particular industries in the world. In terms of our product and services, as I mentioned before, we\u2019ve got fixed wing, we\u2019ve got medical response drones, our whole DFR drones, the first responder aspect of our business is growing immensely right now. In terms of flight services, we\u2019re very specialized in mining, agriculture, forestry and power lines, or long form infrastructure, which could be powerlines or pipelines for example. So, we can provide information back to these companies that other flight service organizations can\u2019t. And so, we\u2019re able to build and do things with drones that simply a lot of other companies just can\u2019t. At this point, what I\u2019d like to do before we get on to talk about some of our customer highlights from this last quarter is I\u2019d like to turn it over to our CFO, Paul Sun to talk about our financial results. So, looking at this slide here, if you looked at the left table, that\u2019s basically an income statement. So for the quick snapshot of Q1 2022, you\u2019ll see that revenue for the first quarter was up 32.8% to just over $2 million, up from $1.53 million in the first quarter of 2021. First quarter revenue comprised of $1.64 million from product sales, with $406,000 coming from drone services with the balance coming from engineering services. You\u2019ll see that gross profit increased by $301,000 or 58.5%, this quarter over the same period last year. But for some of our investors that have been with us for a while, they\u2019ll recall that there\u2019s an accounting treatment where a non-cash change in fair value from derivatives are included in these numbers. So, in this quarter, there\u2019s a non-cash expense of $1.2 million from the derivative liability along with a non-cash recovery of $771,000 from receivable. Now, looking at the middle table about our balance sheet, you\u2019ll see that total assets decreased by from $42 million to $37.59 million from the year-end, which is largely due to the deployment of cash. So here, we\u2019ll talk about the quarter over changes between Q1 of this year in Q4 of last year. Again, that\u2019s due to sales mix but pretty much steady. And again, you\u2019ll know that that includes a noncash change in fair value of derivative liability of $1.23 million and that recovery of a no receivable of $771,000 versus what we saw in Q4 of $23.4 million. And with that, I\u2019ll pass it back to you Cam. Paul, I know it\u2019s a really challenging environment to ensure that all these numbers get in and we just had a new ERP implemented in this last quarter and a bit. But I think it\u2019s worth mentioning is that first of all, this is organic growth. We\u2019re up 25%, again, over Q4, which was a record quarter, which I think we\u2019re up about 20% on that quarter as well. We\u2019re up over 30% year-over-year, organic growth based. And certainly, I don\u2019t see any insight in ongoing growth in this measured fashion. This is a drone, it\u2019s very unique to Draganfly, that you\u2019ll see the box or the payload that\u2019s on that drone that\u2019s a temperature managed box so that we\u2019re able to deliver 35 pounds of things like pharmaceuticals, blood, insulin, epipen, temperature sensitive medical supplies. This particular drone has about a 20 kilometer capability, effectively about 10 kilometer end-to-end when you\u2019re running these things. This came particularly out of the work that we were doing with Texas Emergency Medical Services over the last year for standing up a drone first responder program there, where we\u2019ve got actual medical delivery that can get to accident sites or victims or emergency situations quicker than trucks or personnel camp. But getting these drones over into Ukraine with this credible organization isn\u2019t just a feat of engineering and isn\u2019t just a great product, but it\u2019s also like the logistics and the training and such. We are going to be supplying, not just these medical response drones, what we refer to as the MRDs, but we\u2019ll also be supplying search and rescue drones, which is a smaller drone version, primarily equipped with a thermal camera to look for heat signatures. It\u2019s a much smaller unit, much faster unit. We\u2019ll also be providing situational awareness drones, which are effectively a reconnaissance drone to help to provide situational awareness for search and rescue teams that are on the ground to ensure that they remain safe or there aren\u2019t potential threats coming into their area. Since this initial 13-unit order, we\u2019ve got another 5 orders that have come in on this. The other thing that\u2019s really happened because of this particular customer is, the inbound inquiries around other types of drones. He\u2019s had over 240,000 employees at Homeland Security that ultimately were responsible and reporting up to part of his executive team. So, I really am looking forward to -- glad that John\u2019s accepted this position. As part of this, I\u2019m taking over the not just the CEO but the President\u2019s position of the Company, as Scott Larson, who\u2019s been our interim President for almost two years now, will remain a lead director with the Company, will continue to work very closely with myself on a lot of the M&A and the larger business development initiatives that we have going on. We\u2019ve done a great job in my opinion of populating our sales teams, our management infrastructure, and our capability to deliver incredible products and services to our customer who is really what we focus on. And before you scale, you\u2019ve got to demonstrate to a highly credible customers that you can do that. And I think we\u2019re starting to see -- not starting, not thinking. We\u2019re not starting actually, we are definitely in the midst of seeing that scaling start to happen. So, if it wasn\u2019t already friendly enough in terms of what the FAA was doing in the delivery market and beyond visual line of sight space now, what the world is seeing and regulators are seeing around what\u2019s happening in Ukraine and the uses of drones and how effective they can be, we\u2019re seeing a lot of incredible international exposure for Draganfly and inbound inquiries there. And then, finally, I think it\u2019s really important know note the seasoned executive team that we have. When you start considering people like Paul Mullen and John Mitnik and Andy Card and Julie, it\u2019s just -- we are hitting way over our weight class, in my opinion, in terms of the type of talent that we\u2019ve been very fortunate to attract. So, if we think about team, I think we\u2019re at the top of our game. If we think about traction, we\u2019ve got demonstrated Q-over-Q and year-over-year growth as fast as our capacity will allow us to grow. And we\u2019ve got traction -- I mean, technology, excuse me. We\u2019ve got a demonstrated IP portfolio, we\u2019ve got hundreds of pieces of IP, we\u2019ve got new product that\u2019s hitting the market that\u2019s in front of our competitors. So, on that note, what I\u2019d like to do, with great pleasure, is I\u2019d like to ask Scott, who is our Lead Director, Scott Larson -- first of all, again, to thank him for his service and his leadership, his friendship and his mentorship to the Company and to myself over the last two years. So, as we\u2019ve done in the past, a number of people have emailed in questions beforehand, some of which were worked into the presentation. We\u2019ve had questions that have come in just during this, that some have been addressed, some haven\u2019t. And so, we\u2019re just kind of going to make our way through the -- through here as best as we can. A few, I\u2019ll send back to Cam. Cam, why don\u2019t I start off -- start this one off with you. Well, I\u2019m not particularly concerned about it, because the same thing that we face, every single one of our competitors faces. So, some customer expectations are in line with what\u2019s happening with inflation and what\u2019s happening with supply chain challenges. So, where before, I would even say pre-COVID, people had an expectation that you had next day delivery and/or 3-week turnaround time, now 12 to 18 weeks isn\u2019t out of question. Now, we\u2019re -- to give you an example, when we had the Ukraine opportunity come into us, we turned that entire thing around in less than four weeks. So, we did some big inventory purchases, I think we\u2019ve done what we can to make sure that we\u2019re in a good position to be able to meet the demand. But as it relates to the entire industry, I think we\u2019re delivering as quickly and certainly with as much passion and vigor as anybody could expect us to. So, I don\u2019t have big concerns around it just because customer expectations are in line with what\u2019s real. We\u2019ve talked about growing organically, as well as going through acquisitions and kind of large partnership deals with, I don\u2019t want to step over any disclosure lines here, but certainly, this has been something that Draganfly has mentioned previously. So, a big thing we\u2019ve done too in the past few years, and so it\u2019s not outside of what we do, but we look at them at a case by case basis. And, I think we\u2019ll expect to make some prudent decisions, but it certainly is part of our strategy. So, it\u2019s not like we have an incredibly rich currency in order to go out and make these acquisitions. But, there are a couple of real gems out there that Scott\u2019s cranking. Some of the things we are looking at -- we\u2019ve talked about it before, of course. So, we are really looking forward to what\u2019s happened in that regard, as well as the other travel industry. And so, we seem to have some great inroads into corrections and into sheriff\u2019s departments. Now, that that kind of seems to be fading, we are actually talking about the real scalable businesses out there, and that\u2019s a pretty exciting time for us. Maybe we\u2019ll just take a couple more questions, and they\u2019re -- they keep coming in. If we don\u2019t have time to get to all the questions, feel free to follow up with us afterwards. You can, of course, contact Rolly at the IR, email it in and we\u2019ll try to make a way through as many of these we can here. Looking at the most recent filing, and Cam, I\u2019ll send this back one to you. We are looking at what\u2019s happening in the pipeline, what products need to be produced, what machining and tooling we have to put in place for the orders to be had or orders we expect out, and then building the capacity to meet those. So we have done a number of things, I think very creatively in order to -- in our product line, standardizing some of our base platforms, much more product stuff will be coming out in this next quarter that we\u2019ll be talking through in order to not have to overload capacity or build two types of machining things or tool too many things overall. We\u2019re very conscientious of cash in particular, in this market. And, we\u2019ve got sufficient cash burn. So hopefully not have to be thinking about doing any financings in the near-term, unless it\u2019s acquisition based. So, listen, we\u2019re just going to keep driving revenue. And so, to the extent that that is hardware, it\u2019s hardware that always leads to a bigger solution, that always leads to a software or a reoccurring revenue base. So, we\u2019re very fortunate to be in a strong cash position. We\u2019re very fortunate to have a governance organization that\u2019s focused on, making sure that we are doing things that -- be able to generating cash and shareholder value. Cam mentioned this already, it\u2019s easy for us to operate. And so, I would say -- and I\u2019ll let Cam give a little more color on this as well. We\u2019ve had inbound calls related to this coming in from Asia, Europe, and the Middle East and Africa as well. But I think the overall Draganfly strategy is to keep working on technology, keep making sure that we come up with technology that\u2019s relevant to the market, as Cam mentioned, but then also looking for services and ways that we can scale this, not only here in North America, but globally. And I don\u2019t know, Cam, if you want to add another comment or two on that. It is interesting to us, the international work that\u2019s coming in where the regulations aren\u2019t quite as onerous as they are in North America. That said, we\u2019re really focused on being experts here in North America. But the international inbound has really been much more than I would have expected, not that we didn\u2019t have some expectation around it. And like you said, we\u2019ll just keep meeting demand and keep hitting numbers. Final question here, maybe, and then we\u2019ll look to wrap it up. And it\u2019s kind of a tricky conversation, of course, because we\u2019re not given guidance here. So, I think the saving grace that we\u2019ve got here is, if you look at every other drone company out there, the charts are pretty much the same. And on top of it, we\u2019re in a pretty tough market right now, in particular, for micro caps. So, again, for us, we\u2019re in a fortunate position, we got a strong balance sheet, we have an excellent management team, and we\u2019re growing revenue organically. That\u2019s what we\u2019re going to focus on, incredible products for incredible customers and keep driving that revenue. We\u2019ve got a solid plan, we\u2019ve got a capacity built out, we\u2019ve got our infrastructure in place, we\u2019ve got our ERPs done, we\u2019ve got -- like, we\u2019re in a spot where we\u2019re going to be able to produce the results. The downturn in the stock or maybe -- just I think people are just getting out or looking for other opportunities or exiting the market, or they don\u2019t like the micro caps, whatever the case, may be, I view it as a buying opportunity. And I feel really, really confident about where this company is going to go, how we\u2019re doing it, where the industry is going to end up. And I think that\u2019s what we\u2019re focused on is just we\u2019re focused on the fundamentals, we\u2019ve been super consistent, we\u2019ve hit all our numbers, everything we\u2019ve committed to doing, we\u2019ve got done. The market may be what the market is going to be, but we\u2019re going to be the winner at the end of the day. So, listen, it\u2019s 45 minutes after we started. I know it\u2019s late, particularly for folks on the East Coast. And so, I think with that last question, we\u2019ll look to wrap this up, I just want to say thank you to everyone who joined us, for this. So, Cam, I\u2019ll let you close it off. Well, first and foremost, to our employees, I really want to thank everybody for the commitment that you\u2019ve done -- you\u2019ve shown in the last quarter for the incredible growth. And to our shareholders, it\u2019s a grind out there. So, we can\u2019t thank you enough for your consideration and for sticking with us and being part of what I think is going to be the next multibillion dollar drone company."
