    "content": " As this represents the 15th consecutive quarter that we've delivered NRR of greater than 120%, we are proud of maintaining best-in-class retention rates, proving that our go-to-market strategy is bearing fruits and our existing customers continue to spend on our technology resulting in 25 large deals closed in the quarter. Revenue for the third quarter was up 9% from the third quarter of last year and reached $71.7 million, whereas subscription services revenue were up 31% and continue to be a primary driver of total revenue. Total subscription revenue grew 8% year-on-year in the third quarter off a strong compare from our Q3 of last year, in which we had some outsized deals with large upfront revenue recognition that benefited term license revenue. As we saw the U.S. dollar significantly strengthened against European and other major currencies, then relative to Q3 2021, our total revenue and total subscription revenue were favorably impacted -- in favorably impacted by changes in ForEx rate of approximately $3.1 million and $2.5 million respectively, representing adjusted year-over-year growth of 13% on both total revenue and subscription revenue. So if I look from -- I would say from the early of Q3 to the end of Q3, from an ARR perspective, it was about between $2.5 million to $3 million impact on ARR. So we would've expected our ARR to be instead of $232 million, more towards the $234 million -- $235 million I would say, if there were no ForEx, if we would look at the ForEx impact as of the beginning of Q3. But if I think about that $2.5 million to $3 million impact on ARR in at the end of Q3 versus the beginning of Q3, is it safe to think that it's probably a similar $2.5 million or $3 million impact on the 4Q ARR or is it more or less have -- how do I think about the guidance for the rest of the year now?"
