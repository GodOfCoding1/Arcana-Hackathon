    "content": " With that being said, we have seen some moderation on the physical damage side of things when we compare the first half of the year to the second half of the year, but those trends still remain above what I would view as kind of the long term historical levels, and our expectation going into 2023 is that they will continue to moderate but remain above the historical levels, which is why we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve focused a lot of our activity on the rate actions that both Marita and Bret described, and we have a slide in our investor deck on Page 14 which lays out how we think rate\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to flow in country-wide throughout 2023, which is going to produce about an overall 18% to 20% increase throughout 2023, and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s on top of the 5.4% that we raised rates during 2022."
