    "content": " Our operating results clearly benefited from strategic actions we've taken in recent years, while also illustrating the value of diversifying our earnings base with our new worksite division, adding $13.2 million to core earnings in the quarter. Like auto, our property pricing strategy is proactive and average premiums have risen almost 8% over last year's second quarter, due largely to inflation adjustments to coverage values. First, catastrophe losses, in line with our July 13th announcement, cat losses were $45.7 million, contributing 31 points to the combined ratio, well above our 10-year average for the second quarter of $26 million and bringing year-to-date cat losses to $53 million. If we assume our average historic level of LP returns, the P&C segment would have annual LP earnings around $15 million, but as you've seen in the quarterly results, the period-to-period earnings can be volatile. Sales of voluntary supplemental products were $2.2 million in the second quarter, an 83% increase over prior year with persistency remaining very strong at 92%. I would say that what we're seeing in terms of some of the changes and for example, in things like lumber, gives us perspective that the trend over the second half of the year, the inflationary trend is going to be quite similar to what we had originally thought in our plans when we put forth our original cat plan for the year."
