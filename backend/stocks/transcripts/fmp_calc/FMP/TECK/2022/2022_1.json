    "content": " Solid operational performance and continued strong commodity prices drove a quarterly record of $3 billion in adjusted EBITDA, which is more than triple the same period last year. As stated earlier, we delivered $3 billion in adjusted EBITDA in the quarter, notwithstanding global inflationary pressures, which increased our overall operating cost by 13% compared to last year. Going forward, we will consider additional buybacks in the context of market conditions at the time. Record quarterly copper prices of $4.53 per pound and higher contributions for byproducts drove EBITDA of $523 million in the first quarter, which is an increase of 25% from last year. On Slide 8, our steelmaking coal business unit delivered yet another record quarter, generating $2.1 billion in EBITDA, a fivefold increase compared to $415 million last year. Adjusted site cash cost of $77 per ton and transportation costs of $46 per ton in the quarter reflect continued inflationary cost pressures, including substantially higher diesel prices profit-based compensation, demurrage costs and fuel surcharges. Our energy business delivered $119 million of EBITDA in the first quarter, driven by the significant increase in the price of Western Canadian Select and Fort Hills ramp up to a two-train operation. Copper prices reached an all-time quarterly record average of USD 4.53 per pound in the first quarter, while zinc prices increased by 36% to an average of $1.70 per pound. Going forward, we will consider additional buybacks in the context of market conditions at the time. If you look at our guidance in terms of to go capital and you look at the guidance for 2022, you'll see there's a reasonable amount of capital carried over into the first half of next year, and that could be $600 million or $700 million."
