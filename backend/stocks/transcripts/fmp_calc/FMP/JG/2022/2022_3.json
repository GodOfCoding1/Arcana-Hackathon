Our Market Intelligence Services delivered strong revenue growth, up 23% quarter-over-quarter and up 24% year-over-year to RMB8.9 million. All three components within the operating expense category have recorded year-over-year reductions, in particular, R&D expenses decreased by 31% to RMB38.3 million, mainly due to lower headcount, reduced salary costs and associated share-based compensation and a decrease in cloud costs as a result of improvement and optimization of our cloud platform. In this quarter, we have had the lowest operating expenses for the past 16 quarters since Q4 of 2018 at RMB80 million, decreased 23% year-over-year.
