    "content": " Lowest operating expenses for the past 14 quarters since Q1 of 2019, at RMB 87.7 million, down 17% year-over-year. Adjusted EBITDA at negative RMB 8 million, significantly improved by 40% year-over-year, highest level of net cash inflow from operating activities since Q4 of 2020. Development services revenue was down 10% year-over-year to RMB 55.2 million, which was mainly due to the decrease from value-added services, while our subscription service recorded a stable 2% year-over-year growth. Value-added Services revenue decreased by 28% to RMB 16.9 million, which is in line with what we expected last quarter as the overall ad market has been relatively weak this quarter. In the Financial Risk Management segment, revenue decreased by 22% year-over-year to RMB 12 million, mainly due to: one, the slowdown in economy, which resulted in lower demand for our services; two, delays in contract signing and several major cities were locked down. In particular, R&D expenses decreased 25% to RMB 40.8 million, mainly due to lower headcount and reduced salary costs and associated share-based compensation. Selling and marketing expenses decreased 14% to RMB 23.3 million, mainly due to the decrease in marketing expenses this quarter. Secondly, the total deferred revenue balance, which represents cash collected in advance from customers exceeded RMB 100 million at quarter end for the 9th consecutive quarter."
