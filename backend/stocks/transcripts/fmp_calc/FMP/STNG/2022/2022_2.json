    "content": " Assuming product tanker rates were to average $35,000 a day for the year, the company would generate almost a billion dollars in free cash flow before debt repayment or a little bit over $20 a share close to a 50% free cash flow yield from yesterday. I guess, you asked about we've seen in the release, you booked nine ships on these three to five year charters at good rates and really rates we haven't seen probably, at least these terms, going back to maybe pre financial crisis.

They're going up, asset prices are going up as a result -- primarily as a result of the charters coming into the market, the security, the income provides ability to finance that, combined with stronger spot cash flows, has created more cash and capital into the market, and a tremendous scarcity of new building deliveries and the requirements of many companies to renew their fleets."
