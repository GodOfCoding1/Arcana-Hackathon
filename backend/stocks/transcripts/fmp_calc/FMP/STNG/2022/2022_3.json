    "content": " I would simply suggest not shorting STNG, just take a look at the cash, and certainly not paring us against being long crude oil tankers, as we can already see the crude market has moved up, shipping oil to China and India, and it's going to only be a matter of weeks or days before India and China step up their exports and product out. Wanted to ask about the LR2s, the chief guidance so far for the fourth quarter is, I would say, pretty, I guess, exceptional, right, $58,000 for over half the quarter, and I'd say that's pretty -- well above maybe the $40,000-$45,000 maybe that the market has \"Averaged.\" Well, we could I mean it's partly to do with that, Greg but it's also right now right now, we clearly have the surplus cash with beyond what we consider is on needs to pay down debt because in three and a half months we've used $120 odd million to buy back stock. Yes, so I would say with  , which is about half of its capacity, it should get to full capacity by the end of this year, early next year, 400,000 barrels, and outsource 600,000 barrels, and then might come on a little bit earlier, you've got probably about 1.4 million barrels that could come online, definitely one well, that's about 600,000 barrels of ultra-low sulfur diesel that the market really needs. I mean, to that end, I mean, Emanuele opened the call and he was talking about the growing confidence from your customers as well, and that's evidenced by the increase, and one-year time charter rates, I think they're up 70% or 80% in the last six months despite the OPEC cuts in macro environment. So, the customers, actually, when they're taking shipping at 35 they obviously think the market's going to be higher than 35, otherwise they wouldn't be bothering to pay the shipping."
