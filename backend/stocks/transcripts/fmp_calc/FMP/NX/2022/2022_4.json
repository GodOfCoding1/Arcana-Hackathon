    "content": " On a consolidated basis, we reported net sales of $307.5 million during the fourth quarter of 2022, which represents growth of 5.4% compared to $298.1 million for the same period of 2021. For the full-year 2022, net income increased by 55% to $88.3 million or $2.66 per diluted share, compared to $57 million or $1.70 per diluted share for full-year 2021. For the full-year 2022, adjusted EBITDA increased by 20.3% to $152.5 million compared to $126.8 million in 2021. Now for results by operating segment, we reported net sales of $178.2 million in our North American Fenestration segment for the fourth quarter of 2022, which represents growth of 14% compared to the fourth quarter of 2021. For the full-year, we reported net sales in this segment of $687.5 million or 18.9% growth compared to last year. Adjusted EBITDA was $90.8 million in this segment for the full-year or 20.5% higher than 2021, which equates to margin expansion of approximately 20 basis points year-over-year. We reported net sales of $68 million in our North American Cabinet Components segment in Q4 of 2022, which was 2.1% higher than prior-year. We reported revenue of $62.1 million in our European Fenestration segment in the fourth quarter, which represents a decrease of 10.9% year-over-year. Moving on to cash flow in the balance sheet, cash provided by operating activities was $48.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2022 and $98 million for the full-year 2022, which represents increases of 54.4% and 24.7% respectively compared to the same periods of 2021. One moment for our next question. I think in addition, specifically in the North American Fenestration segment, I think we're still finding opportunities to gain share in a couple of our product lines, where labor outsourcing is still a big driver for our growth, and even with falling demand, in terms of volumes, the labor pressures for everyone still exists. One moment for our next question. One moment for our next question. One moment for our next question."
