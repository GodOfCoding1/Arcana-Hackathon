    "content": " We reported net sales of $184.7 million in our North American Fenestration segment for the third quarter of 2022, which represents growth of 25% compared to the third quarter of 2021. We currently expect revenue to decrease in this segment in Q4 versus the comparable quarter of 2021, due to the foreign exchange impact and the softer demand backdrop in Europe, but we anticipate that we can protect margins as price increases continue to catch up to inflationary pressures and we flex our cost structure appropriately. The value of our inventory continued to increase during the quarter due to inflationary pressures, which had a negative impact on working capital, but we were still able to generate free cash flow of $46 million for the quarter, mainly due to the significant increase in net income. From a cadence perspective, the fourth quarter of this year versus the fourth quarter of last year, we now expect about 15% revenue growth in our North American Fenestration segment and low single-digit revenue growth in our North American Cabinet Components segment. So, we're not -- we don't have a firm view on volume for next year across product lines, but I can tell you that from a revenue standpoint, just based on what we're seeing in the raw materials markets and costs coming down, if you think about -- we've talked in the past about adding surcharges in specific situations."
