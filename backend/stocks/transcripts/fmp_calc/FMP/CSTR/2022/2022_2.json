    "content": " However, recent events, we've seen a dramatic increase in market rates in the second quarter, causing TriNet originations, values to decline, the rapid increase in market rates, in addition to reducing the value of TriNet loans, it also caused a decline in the demand for these loans. Significant part of that driver is salary and benefits, which were down $1.1 million for the quarter, due (ph) number one to increase deferred costs associated with loan growth with new loan originations, as well as the Q1 severance and retirement expense of $385,000; and number three, lower mortgage incentive accruals and benefit expense, reflecting lower mortgage revenue. Your line is open. But if you go back to 2018 and \u00e2\u0080\u009919, like, I said in the first quarter, we believe in a more traditional rate environment, which there is not such a thing, but an environment unlike second quarter, we believe that the business development capabilities we have in our historical spreads that we could earn on or about $750,000 a quarter that it could be a $3 million contributor. Your line is open. So, I mean, I think we've been coming off the past few years of an environment where it's been all balance sheet and the margin has been compressing and now we're shifting to the margins higher, but maybe the average balance sheet doesn't grow all that much because you guys with your markets you probably continue to grow loans, but you got to fund that and cash is going down and deposit given what we've been talking about with deposits. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. TriNet's pipeline wouldn't be in there, nor our SBA unit, which we're really trying to increase their funnel so we can get that up to $750,000 a quarter. Your line is open."
