    "content": " Tri-Net loss, Tim discussed, the $2.1 million loss related to sale and transfer of remaining Tri-Net loans and to held-for-investments and consistent with our outlook on the last call, our SBA team demonstrated solid progress this quarter with fees in Q3 exceeding the sum from the first and the second quarters. Your line is open. Hey, good morning, guys. Your line is open. Hey, good morning, guys. Your line is open. And so again, we're being cautious in this environment and not being overly aggressive that if we can grow 8% to 10% and we've already got our expenses down, so let's make sure we manage that and moderate the growth of it, we think we'll have a great year. So part of it is, again, I'm personally kicking myself, I've got $130 million of Tri-Net on my books that I capped that not only where there's some realized losses and unrealized losses that caused reserve and it took up $125 million of funding. Your line is open."
