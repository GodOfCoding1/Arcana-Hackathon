    "content": "  As we've said on the last call and I know we're hearing more of this in the industry, we are being more disciplined and somewhat limiting our loan growth maintaining disciplined pricing which I would say we've seen more challenges on the deposit side from a pricing standpoint, we've seen I would say the summary expects the flip side of that on the loan side middle of last year when the Fed was hiking 75 basis points, every meeting ratio going up sharply along the curve, as we mentioned on earlier calls we were remaining disciplined, but seeing more competitive pricing that hadn't caught up to where market rates have gone. And I guess, specifically on the loan side, you mentioned home bank getting 7.1% just wondering what you guys are seeing on new production today that's in the pipeline and what you can expect to see hit the balance sheet this year in terms of loan yield and then also I guess if you could share what your pricing wholesale or brokered CDs at right now that would be helpful as well?"
