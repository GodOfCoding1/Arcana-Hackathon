    "content": " So first to note is, as part of our drive to strengthen the senior levels of the company, we continue to hire key personnel, including most recently, Zach but also Jason Baran, who will, together with Zach jointly oversee Fusion U.S.A. Later in the presentation, I'll provide more details on our personnel developments overall but you'll see there's been huge advances in that department and we still expect to increase the significantly the talent in the fab. In the first quarter, we also entered into agreements with AESA regarding projects aimed at decarbonizing the industrial sector and hydro mobility projects in Spain, as well as with Hive to develop an already established portfolio of projects with Fusion Fuel's technology. As we continue to pioneer this market in Iberia, we built a pipeline that represents over 20 projects, totaling $140 million capital costs, 65 million grants that have been submitted for a net capital exposure of $75 million. Building off our early successes with Evora and GreenGas which most of you all are aware of, we've advanced our pipeline to seven projects with a total of $43 million capital costs with $14 million grants submitted for or have been awarded for a net capital exposure of $29 million. And so, we will see what generates the best returns for our shareholders on these if we do win some of these grants, these will be very profitable projects and we'll take a look at what options generate the greatest accretion to value for the shareholders, whether that's raising capital to enable the company to take those projects on themselves or whether it's the company using some sort of SPV project company structure that -- in which we use third-party equity for those projects."
