    "content": " Excluding the impact of the unrealized mark-to-market adjustments, propane unit margins for the first quarter increased $0.06 or 3.2% per gallon compared to the prior year, primarily due to effective selling price management during a period of declining commodity prices, that helped offset the impact of inflationary pressures on our delivery costs and other expenses. With respect to expenses, excluding acquisition-related costs of approximately $1 million during the first quarter combined operating and G&A expenses of $137.8 million increased $12.3 million or 9.8% compared to the prior year, primarily due to continued inflationary pressures across most areas of the business, including higher payroll and benefit-related expenses, higher vehicle lease and fuel costs and higher provisions for doubtful accounts."
