    "content": " With the strong earnings, we utilized excess cash flow in a balanced manner to continue investing in the build-out of our renewable energy platform, supporting the growth of our core propane operations as well as to reduce debt by more than $42 million, bringing our total leverage metric down to 3.6x from 3.96x at the end of last year. To be consistent with previous reporting, I'm excluding the impact of unrealized non-cash mark-to-market adjustments on our commodity hedges, which resulted in an unrealized loss of $27.9 million in fiscal 2022 compared to an unrealized gain of $43.1 million in the prior year. Excluding these items, net income for fiscal 2022 improved to $171.1 million or $2.71 per common unit compared to $101.9 million or $1.62 per common unit in the prior year. Excluding the impact of the mark-to-market adjustments on our commodity hedges that I mentioned earlier, total gross margin of $817.3 million for fiscal 2022 increased $57.1 million or 7.5% compared to the prior year. And with respect to expenses, combined operating and G&A expenses increased $43.1 million or 9% compared to the prior year, primarily due to inflationary pressures across most areas of the business, including higher payroll and benefit-related expenses and higher vehicle lease and operating costs. Net interest expense of $60.6 million for fiscal 2022 decreased $7.5 million or 11% compared to the prior year through the refinancing of two tranches of senior notes at lower rates in the third quarter of fiscal 2021 and from a lower average level of outstanding debt, partially offset by an increase in base interest rates for borrowings under our revolving credit facility."
