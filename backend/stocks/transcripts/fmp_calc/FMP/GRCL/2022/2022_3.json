    "content": " I will then turn the call over to our CMO, Dr. Wendy Li, to provide insight on our first clinical data from ongoing IIT evaluating GC012F in newly diagnosed multiple myeloma, which was accepted for an oral session at ASH 2022. Specifically, as of June 8, 2022 data cut-off, following enrollment completion of 29 patients, a single infusion of GC012F has achieved 100% MRD negative rates in this group of heavily pretreated patients, of which 90% were classified as high risk. For the past ten-and-a-half months in 2022, we have delivered all promised milestones, including starting several IIT studies, opening our first Phase 2 trials and providing clinical data updates at major medical conferences. As William mentioned, the abstract for first-in-human data from ongoing Phase 1 open label IIT evaluating GC012F in newly diagnosed, transplant eligible, high risk multiple myeloma patients was selected for an oral session at ASH 2022. So, my first question is, with the encouraging newly diagnosed data that you have here, I'm curious how you envision 12F being used eventually in the myeloma treatment algorithm, if you could see it being used ahead of transplant or antibody-based therapies. We're focused on preparing the IND applications for the US and China agencies, and look forward to presenting the first clinical data from the newly diagnosed multiple myeloma IIT at ASH next month."
