    "content": " Dr. Wendy Li joined Gracell as the Chief Medical Officer on August 1, and she is based in the U.S. Dr. Li will oversee Gracell's clinical development activities, including advancement of our rich pipeline of autologous and allogeneic product candidates across the FasTCAR and TruUCAR technology platforms. I have several years of experience in the CAR-T field and also held oncology clinical development roles with increasing responsibilities over the past two decades, including leading early and late-stage clinical trials for several therapeutic candidates for the treatment of hematological, malignancy and solid tumors and overseeing more than 30 successful IND filings, new drug applications and biologics essence applications in both the U.S. and China. Your line is open. Yes, yes, I guess I'm specifically asking about the newly diagnosed frontline myeloma trial that I think noted is open and enrolling and whether that's an initial data set we could potentially see sometime later this year. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open."
