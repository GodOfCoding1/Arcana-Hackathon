    "content": " 02:58 Finally, we retired $37 million of debt and lease liabilities in the quarter and repurchased another $10 million of our preference units in the open market, bringing the total repurchase to $28.4 million at par value on average since the repurchase program was initiated last summer. 07:09 Adjusted EBITDA was $61 million, a decrease of $3 million or 5% from the first quarter of 2021 due to higher operating expenses and general and administrative expenses, both discussed in the next slide in detail. Finally, our adjusted earnings was $0.41 per unit, which decreased compared to the first quarter of 2021 due to these higher expenses, as well as a year-over-year increase in the number of common units outstanding. We expect to continue strengthening our balance sheet, beginning with a scheduled retirement of approximately $114 million of debt and lease principal payments in aggregate in 2022, which is more than covered by our contracted cash flow over this period, reducing debt balances and making opportunistic repurchases of preference units will further reduce the Partnership's cash flow breakeven levels over time and increase our free cash flow generation potential, enhancing the partnership's equity value."
