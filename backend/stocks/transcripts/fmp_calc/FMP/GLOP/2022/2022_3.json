    "content": " Revenues for the third quarter were 96 million and 19% increase from the third quarter of 2021 driven primarily due to an increase in revenues from our vessels operating in the spot market, as well as from no dry-docking of holidays in the third quarter of 2020 to compare to 59 of has a since the same quarter last year. Adjusted EBITDA was 73 million, an increase of approximately 16 million or 28% from the third quarter of 2021 primarily due to a 15 million year-over-year increase in revenues and a decrease in operating expenses of 1.9 million. The decrease in operating expenses was primarily due to the favorable movement of the Euro, USD exchange rate in the third quarter of 2020 to fully absorbing deflationary pressures on our costs, as well as the in-house management of the Solaris, following the vessels for delivery in April 2022 from Shell. Our results were also impacted by a four million increase in indirect expense due to an increase in LIBOR rates compared to the third quarter of 2021, partially offset by the leveraging achieved during the last 12-months. We expect to continue strengthening our balance sheet, beginning with a scheduled retirement of approximately 111 million of debt and lease principal payments in aggregate over the next four quarters, which is more than covered by our contracted cash flows over this period. U.S. LNG supply remains static quarter-on-quarter despite the Freeport outage, small increase from other regions due to seasonal increase exports, or recovery from outages led to an overall increase of 6% in the LNG supply compared to the third quarter of 2021."
