    "date": "2023-01-26 10:06:04",
    "content": " Operating expenses were decreased by $0.9 million, mostly due to the favorable movement of the EUR/USD exchange rate in the fourth quarter of 2022, as well as the sale of the Methane Shirley Elisabeth in the third quarter of 2022, partially offset by the in-house management of the Solaris after her redelivery into our managed fleet on quarter two 2022. Daily general and administrative expenses increased to $3,240 per vessel per day in the fourth quarter of 2022 from $2,543 per vessel per day in the fourth quarter of 2021 due to an increase in the administrative service fees for our fleet, which was partially offset by a decrease in the size of our fleet following the sale of the Methane Shirley Elisabeth in the third quarter of 2022. As a reminder, the changes in the vessel management, commercial management and administrative service fees compared to the prior year are in line with our commentary in the previous quarters and are disclosed in detail in our 20-F. Our results were also impacted by a $6.3 million increase in interest expense due to an increase in the base interest rate, LIBOR or SOFR, compared to the fourth quarter of 2021, partially offset by the deleveraging achieved during the last 12 months."
