This also doubled our net revenue from the first quarter of 2022, which followed the buy-in that we saw in Q4 2021 and also a challenging Q1 due to the COVID Omicron surge at that time. AMPYRA net revenue for the second quarter was $18.2 million, that's a 17% decline over Q2 2021, but a 22% increase over the first quarter of this year as, again, specialty pharmacy buy-in in the fourth quarter had a rollover effect into Q1. INBRIJA launched in Germany, which we were delighted to see in June, and we recorded $1.9 million in revenue from ESTEVE for the initial launch shipments under our supply agreement and an additional $900,000 worth of drug was shipped in July. ESTEVE has benefited from our learnings in the U.S., which we transferred to them, particularly regarding the importance of training about proper inhalation technique, and we believe they're also benefiting by not launching into the onset of the pandemic. And our other partner, Biopas is continuing to work toward launches of INBRIJA in the 9 largest Latin American markets, including Mexico and Brazil. Regarding AMPYRA, which is the -- I'm sorry, FAMPYRA, which is the ex-U.S. version of AMPYRA that is marketed by Biogen, our obligation to health care royalty partners has been fulfilled and the double-digit royalties for FAMPYRA reverted to Acorda as of late June. OpEx for 2022 is $2.5 million lower than our Q2 2021, and we are maintaining our 2022 OpEx guidance of $110 million to $120 million. The amendment to the Catalent supply agreement that was effective from July 1, 2021, through June 30, 2022, resulted in a $4.6 million in savings from the minimum commitment. First, continuing to drive INBRIJA's growth. We were encouraged to see that new prescription forms grew in the second quarter through July following the dip in Q1, which was associated, as you heard, with a large fourth quarter buy-in as well as the extreme Omicron wave at that time. And as the effects of the pandemic continue to recede, we believe that people with Parkinson's are anxious to become more active again, especially since activity is an important part of managing their Parkinson's. These compellingly demonstrate INBRIJA's potential benefits, and I encourage you all to visit the imbrija.com site to see them for yourselves. We're also gratified to have begun to receive initial revenues from our ex-U.S. INBRIJA partnerships, and we're looking forward to additional launches from our existing partners as well as additional partnerships for new territories moving forward. While we expect the brand to continue to decline against generics over time, that decline has been flattening, and we've been encouraged by AMPYRA durability to date. We're continuing to provide our support programs, have our field force call on MS offices, and we're reiterating our net sales guidance of $68 million to $78 million in 2022. And as the Biogen royalties on the ex-U.S. sales of FAMPYRA have reverted to Acorda, we'll receive the full value of these royalties commencing in the third quarter. We're also building on the ARCUS technology platform, which has now been validated by the approval of INBRIJA in both the U.S. and the EU. We're in discussions about potential collaborations with other companies who've expressed interest in formulating their novel molecules for pulmonary delivery with ARCUS, and we've already been performing feasibility studies for a number of these opportunities. As Mike Gesser just shared in our presentation, we had been aiming to be cash flow neutral to reach cash flow neutrality on a run rate basis by the end of this year due to the outsized impact in the first quarter of both the fourth quarter buy-in and the tremendous Omicron surge. And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the Acorda Therapeutics Second Quarter 2020 Financial and Business Update."
