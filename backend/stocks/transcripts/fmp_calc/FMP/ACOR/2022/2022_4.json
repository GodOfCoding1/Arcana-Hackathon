    "content": " The slope continues to flatten through 2022 and for 2022 -- excuse me, 2023, we expect AMPYRA net sales between $65 million and $70 million. Next slide, we project that AMPYRA sales over the next 5 years will stabilize at approximately $60 million a year or higher based on these trends and something really encouraging to note about 200 doctors wrote prescriptions for branded AMPYRA in 2022, who had not written since it went generic in 2018. In addition to our U.S. revenue, we reported $2.9 million of INBRIJA ex-U.S. sales, $11.7 million of FAMPYRA royalties, $2.6 million in royalties for Neurelis and $500,000 from Asieris Pharma for the clinical assets we licensed to them. And we're also, as you just heard from Mike, reducing operating expenses further in 2023 over 2022 by between $9 million and $19 million, and that follows a total of $64 million in reductions that we've already made between 2020 and 2022. I'm told that I misspoke when I was presenting the slide on 2023 INBRIJA U.S. sales projections, I'm not sure I said the right range, but the correct range is $38 million to $42 million, $38 million and $42 million in the U.S. for 2023. And as you can appreciate, if you just look at the last 6 months, let's say, and all of the things that we announced that we had previously been working on, you can get a sense that especially as we're working to build back the value of the company and engaging in all kinds of initiatives, it's highly likely that at any given time, we may be in possession of that information. So I would say it's been more like approximately 6 months or less, where the country has really opened up to an extent and particularly our part of the country, which is the physicians, the patients there -- by the way, walk into a lot of hospitals and doctors' offices today, they're still all requiring mask."
