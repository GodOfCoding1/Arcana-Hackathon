    "content": " Our guidance calls for the delivery of another strong quarter in Q4, carrying our momentum into fiscal year 2024, which we expect to be another solid year for BRP given the strength of our product portfolio where structurally it is driving higher margins, the strong progress we made in terms of market share gains, especially with side-by-side, the continued momentum with new products such as the Sea-Doo switch and the new Manitou Pontoon, all of this supported by better utilization of our increased production capacity."
