    "content": " Year-to-date, in addition to the funding of our quarterly dividend, we have bought back 15% of our total Class A common shares outstanding based on our March 31, 2022 basic share count via open market repurchases and net settled shares to satisfy employee tax obligations in lieu of share issuances upon vesting of equity grants. As Peter mentioned, revenues for the second quarter totaled $151 million, a decrease of 41% from the prior year period. Our adjusted non-compensation expense was $31 million for the second quarter, up 4% year-over-year, although down 4% quarter-over-quarter and represented 21% of our revenues. As such, year-to-date, we've returned nearly $70 million through the repurchase of more than 7 million shares in the open market, the net settlement of over 600,000 shares to satisfy tax obligations in lieu of share reissuances and the payment of $13 million in pro rata distributions to limited partners, which allows PWP to pay its dividends of $6.6 million."
