    "content": " On the expense side, in the first quarter, we accrued adjusted compensation expense at 64% of revenues, within the range of our previously communicated medium-term mid-60s guidance and in line with our expense accrual level in 2021 and our current expectation for the full year. And I would just say, generally, with respect to our top line revenue, that in the same way that when we had an up 84% quarter in the first quarter of '21 or when we had an up over 50% quarter for the year of 2021, it's all part of our growth story, which will be up and down and will not be quarter-to-quarter."
