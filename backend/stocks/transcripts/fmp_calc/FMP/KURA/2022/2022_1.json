    "content": " As mentioned, I'm pleased to report, we recently completed enrollment of the patients in the Phase 1b portion of KOMET -001, required to identify a recommended Phase 2 dose for Ziftomenib. We remain on track to identify the recommended Phase 2 dose for Ziftomenib, and to report top-line data from the Phase 1B study in the third quarter with a more complete dataset from common 001 reserved for presentation at a medical meeting in the fourth quarter. For our Menin Inhibitor program, identified the recommended Phase II dose of Ziftomenib, and report top-line data from the Phase 1b study in the third quarter, present updated data from comment 001 at a medical meeting in the fourth quarter. We see good balance and that gives us confidence that as we've said all along, from our perspective, we think there's going to be one recommended Phase 2 dose to treat both patient populations. I don't want to speak to the specifics just given the timing and some of the sensitivities, suffice it to say, today it's significant and that we've completed enrollment of the 24 patients needed to support the Phase 1b."
