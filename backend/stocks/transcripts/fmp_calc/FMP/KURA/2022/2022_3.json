    "content": " For ziftomenib oral presentation of the Phase 1 data from KOMET-001 at ASH in December, and initiation of the Phase 2 registration directed portion of KOMET-001 and a Phase 1 combination study in frontline and relapsed refractory AML in the first half of 2023, pending FDA review of the recommended Phase 2 dose and protocol. With regard to our data, I think the most important point will be the point that I made about at ASH, you'll see potentially N equals 30 patients at the recommended Phase 2 dose. What we'll show you, I think, is a comprehensive data set at what we believe and what we have proposed to the agency is our recommended Phase 2 dose, you'll see a full safety package, you'll see a full efficacy package, I think you'll have a very clear idea as we do, as to how that's going to read through into not only the monotherapy registrational studies, but the combinations as well. And I'll have more to say, I know appreciate that may be a little bit unsatisfying, but because of the strong signal we saw in Run, because of the meaningful clinical activity, we've seen in AIM, potentially, there's a way to harvest this data for patients. Because the decisions that we've made that we're recommending to the FDA, they set the foundation for every future study, not only the dose, but how we're handling DS, what we're seeing, the agency will look back on this Phase 1 data package as foundational for the future development ziftomenib."
