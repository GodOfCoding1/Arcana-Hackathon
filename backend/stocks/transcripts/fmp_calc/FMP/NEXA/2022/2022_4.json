For 2022, cash costs achieved guidance by increased to $0.28 per pound compared to that $0.21 per pound in 2021. In slide number 5, regarding the operating performance of the smelting segment, metal sales totaled 167,000 tons in the fourth quarter of 2022, up 6% from the fourth quarter of 2021 and up 3% from the third quarter of 2022. With respect to cash cost in the fourth quarter of 2022, smelting cash costs decreased to $1.20 per pound, compared to the $1.28 per pound in the fourth quarter of 2021. When we compare the fourth quarter of 2022 with a third quarter of 2022, cash costs decreased by $0.16 per pound, due to lower LME prices. As you can see, beginning with a chart on your upper left, total consolidated net revenue for the fourth quarter increased by 15% year-over-year, due mainly to higher metal sales, compared to third quarter of 2022, net revenues increased by 11%, mainly driven by the mining sector. Looking at the full-year in 2022 consolidated net revenues reach $3 billion versus $2.6 billion in the same period last year, an increase of 16% primarily due to higher prices. In the mining segment, net revenues for the fourth quarter of 2022 totaled 350 million down 3% versus the same period of last year. For 2022 as a whole, net revenue for the mining segment totaled 1.25 billion compared to 1.16 billion a year-ago, mainly due to higher sync LME prices and the increase in copper, lead and silver volumes. Regarding adjusted EBITDA on your upper right, fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA for the mining segment was 78 million, a reduction of 36% year-over-year mainly driven by lower prices and higher TCs. Compared to the third quarter of 2022, adjusted EBITDA increased by 22%, mainly driven by higher prices and higher byproduct contributions. Finally, adjusted EBITDA for the mining segment in 2022 was $440 million compared to $477 million last year, mainly due to increases in operational cost and also Aripuan\u00c3\u00a3 effect. Switching over to the Smelting segment, net revenues in the fourth quarter totaled $606 million, an increase of 19% versus the fourth quarter of 2021. Compared to third quarter of 2022, net revenues decreased 1%, mainly due to lower metal prices. Now for the full-year 2022, net revenue for the Smelting segment totaled 2.5 billion compared to $2 billion in the same period of last year, mainly due to the increase in zinc metal prices. When we look at adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter of 2022, we see that the Smelting segment reported $46 million, up 44% from the fourth quarter of 2021. Compared to the third quarter, adjusted EBITDA for Smelting segment decreased by 21%, mainly explained by a non-cash impact of 40 million related to the update of environmental liabilities and related provisions in Brazil. Finally, the Smelting segment\u00e2\u0080\u0099s adjusted EBITDA for the full-year 2022 totaled 326 million, compared to $271 million a year-ago. For 2022 and starting from our $760 million of adjusted EBITDA without Aripuan\u00c3\u00a3 expenses and investments, we can see that cash flow provided by operations before working capital changes was $806 million. In 2023, corporate production at the midpoint of the guidance range is forecasted to increase by 1% on average, compared to 2022 also mostly driven by Aripuan\u00c3\u00a3. Consolidated 2023 runoff mine mining costs at the mid range of the guidance are estimated to increase 2% year-over-year, primarily driven by Vazante due to a scheduled trunnion maintenance, in addition to expected higher energy prices and inflationary pressures on costs. In terms of cash cost, which does not include Aripuan\u00c3\u00a3, we estimate mining cash flows between $0.49 per pound and $0.54 per pound in 2023, compared to $0.28 per pound in 2022. The main reasons for these are, on one hand ongoing inflationary cost pressures and on the other factors like higher TCs, lower by-product credits as we assume lower base metal prices compared to 2022 and also a decrease in sync volumes from our current operations without Aripuan\u00c3\u00a3. On the other hand, consolidated smelting cash costs in 2023 are expected to decrease year-over-year, primarily due to an estimated decrease in zinc prices and higher TCs, which should be partially offset by lower byproduct rates."
