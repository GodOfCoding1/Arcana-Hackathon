    "content": " In the Smelting segment, net revenue in the first quarter totaled $62 million and rose 20% versus the first quarter of last year, also supported by higher LME prices. Adjusted EBITDA was $82 million, a slight decrease compared to the first quarter of last year, but a strong recovery from the fourth quarter of last year, and this was explained by higher LME prices, the expected reverse in hedge book difference as we explained in the previous quarter and higher byproducts contribution and higher TCs."
