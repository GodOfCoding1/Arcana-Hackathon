    "content": " Our plan was to fund those investments with the equity from sales of some of our least-efficient and most capital-intensive communities, as well as long-term fixed rate debt, and that is what we expect will happen in the coming months, as we have 1,500 homes under contract today and we've rate locked a $90 million mortgage for 12 years at just over 5%. On a blended basis, this is fourth quarter rental rate growth of 4.2% During 2022, overall, our same-store portfolio achieved an average new lease increase of 8% while renewals increased 8.4%. As of December 31st, 2022, we had total debt of $1 billion with a weighted average maturity of 5.8 years and a weighted average interest rate of 3.62%. However, we expect to refinance approximately $90 million of our current floating rate debt that's fixed rate secured debt at a coupon of 5.04% and a maturity of 12 years as we were able to rate lock during a brief window of time when the 10-year yield dipped slightly below 3.6%. Pro forma for the refinancing and asset sales, our weighted average interest rate as of year-end would have been 3.5%, our weighted average maturity would have increased by over a year and a half to 7.5 years and our variable rate exposure would decline by -- to approximately 1% of the total debt balance post the paydown."
