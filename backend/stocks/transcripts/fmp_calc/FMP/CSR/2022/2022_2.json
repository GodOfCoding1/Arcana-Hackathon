    "content": " As Anne mentioned, revenue growth was extremely strong in the second quarter and the positive leasing trends continued through July, prompting us to raise our revenue guidance to an increase of 9.75% year-over-year at the midpoint. While we do expect the year-over-year growth rate to moderate during the second half of 2022, we expect expenses to be higher relative to our prior expectations and are accordingly adjusting our guidance to a year-over-year increase of 8% at the midpoint. Your line is now open. We do think that there's potentially some moderation in leases going forward, although our July results were really strong, and we expect -- the blended lease rate growth in July right around 10%. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. Your line is now open."
