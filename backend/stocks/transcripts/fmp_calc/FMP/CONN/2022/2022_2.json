    "content": " On a consolidated basis, total revenues were $418.4 million for the second quarter, representing a 14% increase from the same period last fiscal year. Total retail revenues for the second quarter were $347 million, a 24% increase from the same period last fiscal year. During the second quarter, Conn's credit sales increased 37.2%, which we achieved by capturing a greater share of wallet of higher credit quality consumers within our core demographic rather than by approving applicants further down the credit spectrum. Cash, credit card and third party finance sales grew nearly 12% during the second quarter of fiscal year 2022. Retail gross margin for the second quarter was 37.7%, an increase of 80 basis points from the same period last fiscal year. As a result, our credit spread for the second quarter was 12% compared to 2.2% for the same period last year and 8.4% in the first quarter of this year. Consolidated SG&A expenses for the second quarter were $137.9 million, a $22.6 million increase from the prior period due to the addition of 14 new stores, higher variable operating expenses associated with sales growth and lapping of certain COVID-19 related expense reductions. And in the first quarter, as I mentioned, our -- second quarter rather, as I mentioned in our prepared remarks, the Conn's credit segment was up almost 40% year-over-year on a dollar basis. And as you think about credit over the balance of the year and really over the next 12 months, given where our 60 plus day delinquency is at the end of the second quarter, lowest percentage in a really long time, we would expect to overshoot that 1,000 basis points of spread into the back half of this year before normalizing back to 1,000 basis points of spread over the long term."
