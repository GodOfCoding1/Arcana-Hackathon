    "content": " And we\u2019ve just started taking some additional risk here at the end of the first quarter and now into the second quarter, we believe we can capture a significant portion of those Conn\u2019s finance customers that we were declining in the past back over the coming year because our Conn\u2019s business was down 20% plus in the \u2013 throughout the pandemic. And now with the new lease-to-own partners, the combination of Conn\u2019s and lease-to-own in the lower end of the \u2013 mid to lower end of this credit spectrum in conjunction with that larger addressable market at the higher end, we believe positions us extremely well here, not only for the balance of this year but going forward into the future. And the reason that we\u2019re able \u2013 the reason we\u2019re doing that or able to do that is we don\u2019t have to go as far down the credit spectrum with Conn\u2019s financing because our lease \u2013 the two lease-to-own partners that we\u2019ve added, we\u2019re letting them pick that lower credit quality customer up that in the past, when we\u2019ve taken more risk, we\u2019ve gone deeper in the credit spectrum. We can get the higher credit quality on the Conn\u2019s side, but also cannot lose those customers on the lower credit quality side because of our lease-to-own partnerships have strengthened so much with the addition of the two partners. So, if you look at those metrics going forward, our expectation is that we can maintain a very strong credit portfolio simultaneously while growing the business through Conn\u2019s financing, through lease-to-own partnership as well as at the higher end of the credit spectrum as well. So, our expectation is we can continue to capture incremental Conn\u2019s finance sales here going in through the second quarter and on the balance of the year and do that while maintaining credit risk at an acceptable level. I don\u2019t expect it to be \u2013 to ever get back to those levels, primarily because we don\u2019t want to grow Conn\u2019s financing at the expense of taking sales from lease-to-own or one of the other segments on the credit spectrum. And as you heard me in both our comments as well as in some of my answers to the questions here that we are really \u2013 as we are taking risk here, we are doing it in a very different fashion than we have historically, certainly, in the 6 years that I have been here with the company and that we are not going deeper in the credit spectrum because what we don\u2019t want is we believe we don\u2019t want an issue in the future where, because of risk we are taking, that it comes back to bite us from a credit standpoint down the road. So, our intention is to make \u2013 to push that credit risk on those lower credit quality customers to the lease-to-own partners and for us, with our Conn\u2019s financing to go with a greater share \u2013 to capture a greater share of wallet with a higher credit quality customer."
