    "content": " As we convert third-party LTO sales to in-house LTO transactions, we expect our operating income this fiscal year to be negatively impacted by approximately $15 million. For the fourth quarter, the company reported a GAAP net loss of $1.79 per diluted share compared to net income of $0.26 per diluted share for the same period in fiscal year 2022. On a non-GAAP basis, adjusting for certain charges and credits, we reported a net loss of $1.53 per diluted share for the fourth quarter compared to net income of $0.33 per diluted share for the same period in fiscal year 2022. Due to lower retail sales, SG&A expenses were 38.1% of retail sales for the fourth quarter compared to 31.6% for the same period in fiscal year 2022. For the fourth quarter, Retail segment operating loss was $19.5 million compared to Retail segment operating income of $10.9 million for the same period in fiscal year 2022. This compared to non-GAAP adjusted Retail segment operating income of $13.6 million for the same period in fiscal year 2022, which excludes charges and credits for non-recurring excess import freight costs related to congestion in U.S. ports. During the fourth quarter, the credit provision for bad debts was $44.1 million compared to $28.2 million for the same period in fiscal year 2022."
