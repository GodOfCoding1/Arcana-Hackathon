    "content": " Actions underway to reemphasize our core value proposition are focused on enhancing our marketing efforts, leveraging the sophistication of our credit platform and ensuring our retail strategies and sales execution support customers along their in-store and online journeys with Conn's. Year-to-date, eCommerce sales have increased 16.7% to $55.1 million, while third quarter sales declined 8.9% to $17.5 million as a result of a shift of focus from our Conn's core financed customer and the re-platforming actions we completed during the quarter. The 24% year-over-year decline in retail revenue was driven primarily by the trends Norm discussed in his prepared remarks, including an atypically strong retail results last year, the impact inflationary pressures and recessionary fears are having on consumers' behavior this year, lower year-over-year lease-to-own sales and a shift of focus away from our core customer. Despite higher annualized net charge-offs during the third quarter, our credit spread for the 3 months ended October 31, 2022, was 9.8% compared to 14.6% for the same period last year. Because I believe with our differentiated credit infrastructure and the team we've built from both an underwriting and a collection standpoint, bringing that critical segment of the customer base, which should be 10% to 15% at a minimum of our sales in line with our Conn's financing and being able to underwrite that all as one group, I think, creates significant opportunity for us from a growth standpoint."
