    "content": " First one, $5 million from Gilead for the completion and delivery of a regulatory support package for their Phase 1 clinical trial of a therapeutic cure for chronic hepatitis B using HB-400 and the second $10 million payment from Roche. For the 2022 results, I want to start by pointing out our significantly strengthened cash position, which we achieved through our $75 million capital raise in the first quarter and cash inflows from partnering, including $19 million from Gilead and $25 million from Roche. So in brief, if we make 40% objective response rate, there's a clear go ahead signal that we will be looking at the totality of the data in making that final decision, but because you know that this is going to be a Phase 3 trial with a fairly significant investment."
