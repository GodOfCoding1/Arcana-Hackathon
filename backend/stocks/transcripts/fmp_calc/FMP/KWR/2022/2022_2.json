    "content": " This above-market result was driven by net new business wins of almost 3% year-over-year, which was a strong result considering we have lost some volume due to our strategic pricing initiatives, as well as the macroeconomic and geopolitical factors that have negatively impacted our markets in the quarter. So adjusted EBITDA will be closer to flat year-over-year without these onetime headwinds, this is despite lower end market demand, compared to a year ago, and also this is in the face of the significant inflationary pressures we've experienced on our gross margins and SG&A. Our segment's operating earnings were strong in our Global Specialty Businesses and Americas, but EMEA was behind the prior year due to continued gross margin pressures, and Asia Pacific decreased due to the COVID-19 disruptions in China."
