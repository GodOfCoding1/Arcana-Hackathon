    "content": " Quaker Houghton delivered first quarter results that were in line with our expectations, despite another quarter with an extremely challenging backdrop, we delivered record net sales and growth of approximately 10% compared to the first quarter of 2021. The continued inflationary pressures on our raw materials, manufacturing, and other costs were the primary drivers of the downward pressure on our gross margins in the first quarter of 2022 compared to the prior year. First quarter net sales were 474 million, which increased 10% compared to the prior year, and marked another record sales quarter for our company. What I said was we did have some working capital investments this quarter, anticipate further working capital investment given the rising raw material costs as well as pricing side of that but not in the level of last year and I anticipate still strong operating cash flow in the given year."
