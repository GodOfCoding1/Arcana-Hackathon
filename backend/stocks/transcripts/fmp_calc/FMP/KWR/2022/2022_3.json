    "content": " Pricing in the third quarter increased 25% year-over-year as a result of our ongoing value based pricing initiatives, but was partially offset by lower sales volumes and foreign exchange headwinds. Specific to the fourth quarter, our pricing initiatives are expected to continue to drive year-over-year organic top line growth, partially offset by slower end market demand, continued inflationary pressures and foreign exchange. It is important to note however, that on a year to date basis, our volumes have outperformed our underlying markets, which are down mid single digit percentages due to the net new business wins, even when considering the impact of our value based pricing initiatives. Volumes declined 5% compared to the second quarter and increased volumes in the Americas for more than offset by softer conditions, uneven order patterns in EMEA and Asia Pacific as well as a 3% foreign currency headwinds, which is another record operating earnings in our Global Specialty Businesses and Americas segment.
