    "content": " We delivered double-digit sales and EBITDA growth, compared to the prior year, driven by continued execution on our value-based pricing initiatives and disciplined cost management, which in turn drove an improvement in gross margins. Gross margins were 32.2% in the fourth quarter, an increase of approximately 100 basis points compared to the prior year period. Our ability to continue to earn net new business contributed approximately 1% to volumes in 2022, which includes the impact of volumes we declined due to our value-based pricing initiatives. In the fourth quarter, we delivered net sales of $485 million, which was an 8% increase compared to the prior year. From a segment perspective, excluding foreign exchange, the Americas, EMEA and Global Specialties Business delivered double-digit sales growth compared to the prior year, driven by significant increases in the selling prices. Our volumes declined sequentially across the Americas, EMEA, and Global Specialties Businesses, while Asia-Pacific increased due to the timing of uneven demand patterns resulting from the impacts of COVID on our customers. Our fourth quarter non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $1.39, which was up 8% compared to $1.29 in the prior year, reflecting the improvement in our operating earnings year-over-year.
