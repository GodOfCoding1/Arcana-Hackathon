    "content": " During the quarter, we delivered strong revenue and EBITDA performance, delivered a robust book of orders across all regions and made significant progress on our FY '23 strategic agenda of driving above-market revenue, margin expansion and profitability initiatives and the formation of strategic partnerships that can create value for all stakeholders. While we have seen some improvements in the supply chain environment over the course of the past year, our teams continue to battle and ride the challenge every day, driven by accountability to Accuray's higher purpose of ensuring that our customers have access to the highest precision radiotherapy tools available, so they can provide advanced cancer care to improve lives. I'd like to begin by thanking our global class functional team to execute with the intensity to deliver a strong second quarter of fiscal 2023 despite ongoing macroeconomic challenges, including supply chain shortages, global inflationary pressure and FX headwinds in our non-U.S. markets. Net revenue for the second quarter was $114.8 million which was down 1% compared to the prior fiscal year, primarily due to supply chain constraints and $6.1 million of foreign exchange headwinds. We ended the second quarter with a backlog of approximately $515 million which is 11.4% lower than prior year due to $41.4 million of orders that aged beyond 30 months within the quarter, mainly driven by customer installation timelines. While we delivered strong results in Q2 and continue to navigate through supply chain constraints, the headwinds associated with foreign exchange have had a $12 million impact on our top line in the first half of fiscal 2023."
