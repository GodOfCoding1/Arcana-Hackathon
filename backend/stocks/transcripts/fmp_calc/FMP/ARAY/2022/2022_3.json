    "content": " Accuray's fiscal 2022 third quarter performance continues to reflect the healthy demand environment we are seeing globally, which has been primarily driven by strong interest in the most recent innovation upgrades on our Radixact platform like ClearRT, our helical kVCT imaging system and Synchrony, our motion compensation and automated target tracking technology. For the first three quarters of 2022 revenue was $319.9 million, up 12% over a prior year representing strong customer demand for product innovation. And I think that while these things are \u2013 they're frustrating from a delay and a timing standpoint, I would encourage our investors to realize that through three quarters of this year, we've got 6$ million in incremental revenue in China that we didn't have quite frankly before we implemented a strategy, put the JV in place and started down the path strategically to be a bigger company in China."
