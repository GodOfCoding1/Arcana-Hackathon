    "content": " Despite these impacts, our sourcing and production teams successfully mitigated many risks in these areas that allowed us to overachieve our production forecasts, which resulted in product revenue growth for the quarter of 45% over prior year. First orders for the second quarter were $85.4 million, an increase of $10 million or 13% over the prior year period from strong innovation-driven order momentum. During the second quarter, we had approximately $4 million of net cancellations and we ended our second quarter with backlog of $581.3 million, a decrease of 3% from December 31, 2020, driven by increased order to revenue conversions. Total revenue is being increased to an expected range of $420 million to $430 million compared to the prior range of $420 million to $427 million, which represents year-over-year growth at the midpoint of the range of 7% and reflect strong customer demand for our products. It's -- the impacts from a cost input standpoint, Jason, were very definitely more strongly felt on the service margin side, combination of inflationary costs related to higher price, either prices related to inventory, we're purchasing to support production, early buys, commitments to longer purchase order, hard purchase order requirements, but also higher logistics costs, higher freight, for sure."
