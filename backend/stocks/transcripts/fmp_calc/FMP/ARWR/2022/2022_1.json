So first, with ANG, this was always a focus for ANG given what we saw in the Phase 1/2 study, given what we saw in nonclinical studies and given what we've seen in GWAS analysis we know -- or at least we think we know that this drug candidate is good at lowering LDL and lowering triglycerides, and there's a clear need for that. I think it's a real benefit to be honest, to have those two drugs because I think we're going to learn a heck of a lot in these Phase 2b studies and potentially in Phase 3 studies about how these drugs work and what kinds of patients they can help. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. So, I think this is a target where the magnitude of the target suppression correlate with the clinical or the pharmacodynamic effect\n And I think -- so if you look, again, it's very difficult to compare these because we haven't seen their data really in these two separate studies. And I think that that if our data -- put it this way, I think if our data continue to roll out the way we've seen them so far in the Phase 1/2 study, I think that, that would be -- that, that would give us good confidence to go into an outcome study. Your line is now open."
