    "content": " All the information offered during this presentation and statements that may be made during the call referring to business outlook protection and operational goals are based on the beliefs and assumptions of the company management, as well as on information currently available. Investors should understand that general economic conditions, market conditions, and other operating factors could impact the future performance of GPA and lead to results that differ materially from those expressed here. We have with us, the CEO of GPA, Marcelo Pimentel, the CFO and IRO, Guillaume Gras, the CEO of Groupo Exito, Carlos Mario Giraldo, and the CFO of the Exito Group, Ruy De Souza. We have adjusted the strategy and reviewed our priorities.Based on this work, we have been able to set forth strategic pillars and priority projects of the new management and the work plan for the short and medium term. I have had the opportunity of talking to you personally over the last few months in greater detail about the mandala that you now see on the screen, which shows us the six strategic pillars of the new GPA. The basic goal is to maintain the focus on operations, improve execution and pursue growth in a profitable and sustainable manner. The top line is led by our new CEO, Joaquim Souza, who arrived at the company a little over a month and will lead the entire commercial strategy. In the second quarter, we were able to have the stockout of products with a greater turnover, and we have reduced the total rupture by 1.7. In terms of the NPS pillar, we improved the customer experience and service level in stores.This quarter, we have already been able to register an evolution of approximately 15% in the indicator vis-a-vis the fourth quarter '21, an advance that we have also noticed in the digital channel. I would like to take the opportunity to announce the arrival of Marcello Rizzi, our new CTO, who took over in June and is the sponsor of this pillar. In this quarter, we recorded an important increase in the digital sales reaching 15% growth comparatively. Among the drivers for this evolution, I can cite the launch of the hub stores that create a synergy so that the Pao de Acucar and Extra markets serve both sites, the availability of evening hours on weekends and the express sales coming out of our proximity stores. Finally, this quarter, we had the opening of the dark store in Morumbi, focused on the sales of ultra-convenience and an operation that encompasses James, Pao de Acucar, Extra Clube platforms and our last-mile partners. Until the first half of July, we carried out 12 conversions of hypermarket supermarkets into Pao de Acucar, Mercado Extra, and Compre Bem stores. Well, there the goal is to improve profitability by focusing on operational efficiency to drive margin expansion. Now to close this slide and by closing my opening, we have the ESG and culture pillar responsible for the social, environmental and government agenda. And for monitoring the progress of indicators, such as the number of women in leadership and gas emissions, Guillaume will show you in greater detail our strides during his speech. And as we're speaking about culture, I would like to take the opportunity to mention that GPA was certified for the second consecutive year with a Great Place to Work seal. GPA reached the second position in the retail sector ESG ranking and the 9th position in the category of the most environmentally responsible companies, great achievements for all of us that make me very proud and very proud of the team. I would now like to give the floor to our CFO, Guillaume, who will continue on with the presentation. On slide seven we present the consolidated performance numbers which consider all of the operations of GPA Brazil, excluding the discontinued operation of the hypermarkets, drug stores and stores under conversion and the results of the Exito Group. Consolidated sales represented BRL 10.1 billion sales in the second quarter, up 9.3% vis-a-vis last year. As a result of the growth in Brazil and the strong performance in Columbia, which represented 44.1% of sales in the period, in the quarter we recorded an adjusted EBITDA margin of 7% with a drop of 1.4 percentage points versus the second quarter '21, mainly explained by impacts in Brazil that I will explain later on. On slide Number 7 we see that the company continues with a solid cash position of BRL 3.9 billion, 1.4 times short-term debt, and maintains a low leverage level of 1.9 times net debt EBITDA. When we consider a pro forma vision, including Assa\u00c3\u00ad's receivables up to January of 2024 of BRL 2.9 billion, the pro forma net debt adjusted EBITDA ratio is 0.7 times. On the pro forma view, that considers the apportionment of certain expenses that cannot be reclassified to net income from discontinued operations in accounting as they are only partially related to discontinued operations. In Pao de Acucar, the 4.2% growth was driven by higher customer flow in stores, consistent increase in premium assortment at the banner and a gain in market share vis-a-vis the premium market. In the mainstream banners, Mercado Extra and Compre Bem, same store sales growth was 4.8%. The result of growth in e-commerce sales and acceleration of the royalty \u00e2\u0080\u0093 sorry, loyalty program in the proximity format. The strong growth of 13.6% is explained by the excellent execution of the plan to increase the share of perishables, mainly bakery, fruit and vegetables, growth in the flow of passing stores and a higher number of stores serving the last mile partners. Finally, our digital channel grew 15% vis-a-vis the second quarter '21 when we excluded the hypermarket sales and total BRL 408 million in the quarter with a penetration of approximately 11% of total sales. Selling, general and administrative total BRL 804 million in the quarter, accounting for 19.3% of net revenue, improving 0.2 PP compared to the first quarter of 2022. Finally, our adjusted EBITDA amounted to BRL 325 million in the quarter, with a margin of 7.8%, down 2.7 PP year-on-year. One, not passing on all the inflation to our customers, and two, increase in the cost of transformers in our stores. For the future, with a focus on the most profitable formats in our expansion and conversion plan, we expect to have a dilution of fixed costs and consequently an increase in our profit margin. We now move on to slide nine with the results of Grupo Exito, which presented significant sales growth with same-store sales growth of 27.7% versus the second quarter of 2022, reaching BRL 6.6 billion in total sales in the period, with gross sales of 12.5%. This growth was driven by the growth in the three countries in which we operate, but mainly in Colombia, which continues with an excellent trend toward innovative formats. Expenses totaled BRL 1.1 billion in the second quarter of 2022, accounting for 17.8% of net revenue, a decrease of 0.3 PP compared to the same period of 2021, reflecting the operational efficiencies in all units of businesses that favor the growth of expenses below the performance of sales. This results in an adjusted EBITDA of BRL 466 million in the second quarter 2022, with a margin of 7.9%, 0.8 PP better than in the second quarter of 2021. During the week, we had seven events with the participation of 1,800 employees, where topics such as climate change, food, lower waste, sustainable supply chain, FX and compliance and social impacts were all addressed. At Exito, I highlight the volume of 408 tonnes of those consumer recycled waste in the first half of 2022, 39% more than in the same period of 2021. On the promotion of diversity front, I would like to highlight the conclusion of the development program for blacks with the participation of 130 employees and the beginning of a new exclusive training program for black women, which has 70 employees involved. As a result, we ended Q2 2022 with 52% of black employees and 39.3% of blacks in leadership positions. Grupo Exito celebrated for the second year in a row the LGBTQIA+ Pride Month, and this month three training programs were held involving about 1,700 people. And finally, in social impact where we raised more than BRL 2 million in partnership with ahead on that movement, benefiting 11 partners, social institutions that work in the causes of food and education for people in situation of social vulnerability. Through Fundacion Exito foundation, Fundacion Exito, we reached 36,200 children favored by the zero malnutrition program, an increase of 51% when compared to the first quarter 2022 and in line with the year's goal of assisting 60,000 children by the end of 2022. We also increased the share of same-day delivery with expansion of service hours, optimization of fleets and the use of James delivery personnel. We will have the implementation of ultra-convenience at - with deliveries of up to 30 minutes, and we have opportunities mapped with potential sales growth with partnerships in 3P as well in addition to the results of improvements in the digital operations in stores that we have in progress in our stores. As to expansion, we have initiatives in 12 stores, and we plan to open from 25 to 30 Minuto Pao de Acucar stores, still in the second semester. Finally, we have a lot of work ahead, a lot of opportunities mapped out and already in progress. The prospects are positive for the business in the next quarters and I am convinced that with focus, pragmatism and with the right leverage, we will resume the results level that to be and may reach with this powerful team that we have. At Exito Group, we continue making headway with constant investment in innovative formats, expanding the participation of omnichannel, which is an international benchmark and the ESG initiatives with a solid and significant agenda for the group. You may proceed, ma'am. Good morning, Marcelo, Guillaume. In terms of sales, we saw a relevant recovery in this quarter. In relation to the first part of the question, considering the context of profitability. So here we are talking not only about operational efficiency in terms of management of offices, stores and distribution centers, I mentioned that we have been working on, since Joaquim started. We have been working intensely with our suppliers as partners, and we are reviewing all the commercial model and all the logistics model as well. But now we have the opportunity to see Pao de Acucar go back to the place of innovation, with the place where we launch a new product. And the third pillar related to stock management, where \u00e2\u0080\u0093 which is an area on which we have been working and we are going to be working on the structural reduction of inventory so that we can have more optimization so that we can reduce the levels of markdown that we still have some because of the liabilities of Extra inventories that have been decreasing dramatically in the past few months in relation to the previous year, but that affected the margin when we were having to address those inventory levels. So the expectation is, yes, we want to be able to show a recovery of the margin in the next quarters. In relation to efficiency, we are \u00e2\u0080\u0093 we have been working on this, looking at the opportunity of gaining efficiency in all dimensions. And we have already shown some improvements, and we want to move on, gaining more efficiency in the top line, so that this can come from the dilution as well or the results. And we have seen opportunities, for example, as I mentioned before, in the digital side where we are opening inventories for the third shift for deliveries on the same day. And also to include deliveries \u00e2\u0080\u0093 the orders that were made up to 6 p.m., we are going to start delivering those products. And also, we are going to increase the delivery on Saturdays and Sundays. We have also seen, as I mentioned, especially in the renovated stores with the G7 model. And again, this will help us increase the margin and also resume this. So I believe that in order to summarize an answer, both in profitability and efficiency, they're moving together hand in hand, and we are likely to see a gradual improvement quarter on quarter. Thank you very much. Our next question comes from Joao Pedro Soares, sell-side analyst of Citi. You may proceed, sir. Marcelo, I would like to just a little bit more the point you talked about the legacy inventory of Extra and also something you mentioned in the release that you're not passing on the total costs. We understand the inflation is high, and we have \u00e2\u0080\u0093 we would like to understand what is related to legacy and what is macro. So we would like to understand how you see those dynamics, whether or not we are going to be able to reach those numbers in the second half. Well, it is doubtless that the macroeconomic situation that we're undergoing exerts pressure, especially in comparable items and baskets and commodities, especially in the Extra markets and everything that does not refer to impulse purchases. GPA is somewhat more protected in this sense despite the fact that we could not ignore the fact that at the beginning of the month, this customer has had the opportunity of having access to different market players in terms of cash and carry. And this is the work that we're doing in our partnerships, understanding the ideal assortment and sales. Once we have the ideal assortment in our stores, we should not have to increase assortment in some of the categories, we have to reduce the assortment for other categories. So category per category, we will gain an understanding of the ideal assortment and thus guarantee assortment on the shelves. But the remaining inventories of Extra which nowadays are much lower if we compare the levels to last year, our inventory has already been halved adjusting to the new model of the new TPL. Now regarding the EBITDA margin, what we have observed as part of our strategy of double access Pao de Acucar and being the premium point and Pao de Acucar Minuto stores, proximity stores and Extra stores, what we have done is carry out important tests that have helped us to deal with our price positioning in a smarter way. For example, if you look at Minuto Pao de Acucar, we have two models for the location of these stores. And in the pool of the pass ways stores, we are able to have greater elasticity in terms of margin. Nowadays, we have 15 stores that are on a pilot program. In Pao de Acucar, the great lever here will come from a better share of perishables, especially in bread, in the butcher and FLV categories, as well as on a consolidation of the areas where we stand out, the dairy products, premium dairy products and wines. These are categories that help us strengthen not only the sales, but to stand out online. We believe that in the second half, based on your question, we will continue to see enhancements. We are going to reach perhaps not the 9% level, but we will have a double-digit vision of EBITDA for the year 2023. Secondly, regarding your results this year, some of them seem to be less relevant vis-a-vis last year. If you could refer to this, please. We began to work strongly in April in all of the banners, as well as in our digital channels. During this quarter, we collected 15%, and there is a highlight here for Pao de Acucar, who is the leader in this. To give you an idea, we're looking at all of the banners and all of the channels, including our gas station operations. And I have mentioned this to some of you, 40% of all of the digital sales are carried out on click and pick up. Now when you look at our G7 stores, we already bring all of the digital parts to the forefront of the store. Another point that we have made strides on in terms of NPS and the digital experience was to simplify the model of Meu Desconto, my Discount in the app. And doubtlessly, this was a point of friction that we had with some of our customers based on their feedback. Nowadays, we have the one click where you can release all of your offers through a single click, and this has had very good acceptance on the part of our customers. I should also highlight that in terms of experience, we have a partnership with Stix. And nowadays, this represents 90% of the redemption of points. And queues, of course, in these two points we have significant reductions, double-digit reductions, a reduction of queues at the checkout point and an increase in availability of products on their shelves. And in those stores, the NPS evolution is from 7 to 20 percentage points. There is very little to do in terms of sales discounts in terms of this, and we do hope that there will be a recovery in the near future so that we can benefit from this. If you could refer to this, please. Well, we cannot offer guidance, but July continues at levels that are very similar to what we have observed in the second quarter. Thank you very much. You may proceed, ma'am. Good morning and thank you for taking my question. My second question, the G7 model, if I'm not mistaken, has already been in existence since 2017-2018 as a prototype. You had spoken at some point about G8 and G9, a subsegment for the remodeling of the Pao de Acucar stores for consumers who still need more innovation, considering the G7 that has already been around for some time. As I mentioned, we are being very cautious to carry out important work in this context. First of all, so that we will not increase the number of problems and to guarantee that we know which is the ideal assortment for Pao de Acucar, Mercado Extra and the Proximity banners, it's very important to work with category management. We're enhancing this area, as well as the processes to ensure that when we design a category projection, or a project, this will remain stable for some time. And this will enable us to go into phase two, which is the work of the supply team. And this is a change that we're implementing in the supply chain to guarantee that the chain will have full independence in terms of the inventory and the organization, ensuring that we have what we need so we can have the right product at the right store at the right time. We need to understand the logistic capacity of our suppliers to guarantee that at the end we can obtain a better situation or a better level compared to the levels we have in our DC, in our internal logistics operation. And once again, this is very important, not only for the perception of availability of products by the client side, but also to our margin or sales because these are extremely important product. And for sure, in the months to come, we are making the structural decisions that will allow us not only to have improvements, specific improvements, but also structural, consistent improvements for the months and years to come. In relation to tier seven, today we are already at 35% of all the infrastructure of the stores already renovated in the G7 model. Obviously, this model underwent some adjustments when compared to the original model of 2016, 2017. But for sure, at this time around, we do not have the ambition of our \u00e2\u0080\u0093 in other words, the distraction to look at other models. And the share of perishables is above 50%, and this is something that we do not see in the non-renovated stores. And before attempting anything new, we are going to complete the renovation of 100% of all Pao de Acucar stores in this model so that we can offer this to the client and so that we can offer the stability of experience of Pao de Acucar. And we also understand that we are also making some adjustments, assortment adjustments. We're also making adjustments to the strategic vision that those models will help us not only with the in-person sales, but especially in the Express sales that-whose delivery will be within 30 minutes for high population regions. We are making partnerships, and we're doing tests with our partners so that we can make the deliveries within 30 minutes, and we are doing very well in this regard. And we believe that for this model, not only will we have the good news that we already see in the physical experience, but we also migrate this to multichannel dimension as well. Thank you very much. Our next question comes from Vinicius Strano, sell-side analyst of UBS. You may proceed, sir. Considering the long-term expansion of Pao de Acucar, you mentioned 100 new stores along the period of three years. In relation to expansion, as I arrived here, I'm reviewing all the models of the business models and all the capex allocated to the models. Without any doubt, we are very committed to the expansion of premium dimension of the business, both considering Pao de Acucar model and also Minuto and Proximity. Obviously, in relation to expansion for sure for the short term we have bigger opportunities in the Proximity stores considering the opportunity that we have in greenfield in the field that we see that has not been populated yet, especially in the state of Sao Paulo. Considering cost of construction and also a higher interest rate, it's important to validate the model and to ensure that the expansion should be done. However, I reserve myself the right to review all the models and the strategic proposals so that this can be one that would add profitability to the business, not only numbers. But in this initial moment, I believe that we will have more alignment in the proximity models. In relation to the G7 model, I would like to say that we have seen improvements both in top line and margin delta as well. Considering the higher share of perishables, as I mentioned before, also the share of wines and special cheese, these are highly important for us. And we want those stores to gain a new way of exposure so that they can be connected to the environment of cheese, and this is \u00e2\u0080\u0093 this has improving the department. And this has made us successful in the category of beer, especially special beers that brings us a lot of differentiating factors. Our next question comes from Joseph Giordano, sell-side analyst of J.P. Morgan. You may proceed, sir. And how can we think about the distribution structure, the tripod that you mentioned and if it's ready to ensure a homogeneous level of service across the areas. Let's start talking about expansion, and then Guillaume will talk about the reduction of the supporting structure that we have been experimenting after Extra left the business. And in this expansion model, considering the opportunities to be more present in the state of Sao Paulo, considering the strength of the brand in the state of Sao Paulo. By the way, at the end of this call I'm going to fly to Fortaleza and where we are going to open a new store in Fortaleza, Iguatemi. So in other words, we are going to go for growth whatever we already have the brand with a very strong presence. And we believe that in the short term or in the medium term, we are not going to look into new regions where we would have to make greater \u00e2\u0080\u0093 much greater effort to introduce the brand. So while we see opportunities in those places where we are already present, we are not going to lose the focus and try to do something different. So yes, we are going to look at the banner, proximity banner with our focus basically concentrated in Sao Paulo in the neighborhoods of AB class level where we already have a share and participation and a presence which is very strong. Well, when it comes to the structure, it represents 10.5% and 2.5% for the hypermarkets. The second question refers to your working capital dynamic, which I have seen in your balance. You spoke about a reduction that is happening naturally as you no longer have the impact of procurement for the hypermarkets, but I would like to get your feeling on the main lines, the suppliers, inventory and receivables and which will be their behavior in the new GPA that is more aligned. During the call, we have spoken about your focus on the six main pillars, your operating challenges, of course. We do have of course those labor contingencies that you mentioned, which are due to the reduction of personnel that we carried out in previous quarters. Thiago, on my behalf, and to be highly objective, I believe that this focus arises from putting the entire organization, the board of management, which is also aligned with the six pillars, as well as all of our store personnel, same message so that we will not disperse a company of the size of GPA and because of this opportunities can of course become distracted with things that could be opportunities. When you ask about the main focus, now what the company urgently needs is to have further sales growth. And as we deliver the basics in the retail market in a consistent way, we will once again have growth, and the opportunities will increase for the multichannel market. We want to go back to working with consistency in the food retail market, which is what customers expect. You may proceed, sir. Good morning and thank you for taking my question. Well, most of the questions have already been answered. Thank you very much. Well, we have observed not only at the G7 stores, but also at the top 30 stores, and that will consequently be replicated to other stores that have not undergone this transition so far. Thank you very much. Our next question is from Andrew Ruben, sell side from Morgan Stanley. You may proceed, sir. Now this platform has become revitalized, and we plan to continue to grow it as we increase the use of technology at the stores and as we open up slots for evening service and services on weekends. Now beginning in August, when it comes to technology, we will be launching the operation for express delivery, which is a same-day delivery for 100% of our connected stores. When we speak about our partnerships, and I would like to speak about our B2C partnership, initially we have had significant growth with three platforms. iFood that has grown and has more than doubled its share vis-a-vis one year, Mercado Livre with whom we have expanded, and we foresee opportunities for a further expansion to the northeast and to the south. And together, they correspond to the other 50% of our multichannel sales. They have more than 1 million customers registered, and they deliver beverages. We can complement that order with grocery items, and this brings about opportunities for new sales. Our next question, Mr. Vinicius from the Bank of America sell side. Good morning, Marcelo, Guillaume. In the release, you mentioned an improvement in the customer flow in GPA. We have seen a resumption of customers, as well as a growth in number of customers. We're working with CRM in obtaining new customers and seeking out customers based on the customer data platform, where we not only offer generic promotions or offers, but through discounts we're also able to make more customized offers for the customers. I mentioned about expansion, and we have a partnership with six Coalition where GPA has a majority share, and we have access to the pool of clients of Drogasil and Raia drug stores. We have a team which is highly focused on this process, and we have identified more than 1 million people who are have not purchased that GPA. And we have \u00e2\u0080\u0093 we can see a very good opportunity to go after those clients that already have Stix and these clients can be offered a discount in our stores and this is something that we are looking at, so that we can increase the basis. And from the commercial side, as I mentioned, we want to bring in more clients and once the clients are with us, we want them to purchase more and part of this buying more will come from an initiative of making headway into work that we have been doing. Thank you very much. We continue focus, we have a lot of work ahead of us and we are confident that we are gradually advancing. Adjustments take time, but I am convinced that we have the right plans and the best positioning and the right team, so that the new GPA will continuously move toward more consistent and sustainable results."
