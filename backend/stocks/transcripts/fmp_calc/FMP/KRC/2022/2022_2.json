    "content": " First question, it was just in terms of Oyster Point, maybe you could frame out, where you're seeing leasing demand in that market right now because I know there's been a sense that going on -- what's going on with biotech index and DC funding, et cetera. And I feel like this is -- it's kind of similar to a period that frankly the markets were in better shape, but when you might recall, when we had the exchange of construction, which was three quarters of a million square feet in South San Francisco, we were looking to get starting. It's the same market as the exchange, we'll start it if we have a tenant for it, or if we've made significant leasing at the exchange, but we're not going to just add it other 400,000 feet on top of 700,000 square feet that was underway in the same market spec."
