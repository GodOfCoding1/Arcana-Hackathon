So we're not seeing a letup -- in fact, I've seen over the last six to seven months, an uptick in smaller tenants taking space and a lot of those, as I said earlier, in those numbers for San Francisco, these are relocations to better space upgrades. The thing that I would say that is across the board, and Rob made a comment about this about what's happened at San Francisco with roughly  or 85% of the stuff that was leased in the first quarter was all high-quality space. Your line is now open. But right now, there's probably a $15 a foot gap between Class A rates and what I would call Class A minus to B rates, and then that gets further impacted when you look at 43% of the space, that is sublease space on the market has a term of about 2.5 years on it. Your line is now open."
