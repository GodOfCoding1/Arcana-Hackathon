    "content": " Considering expected loan and deposit activity, including some acceleration of our deposit pricing, along with the September 30th forward curve, we forecast net interest income to grow by 4% to 5% in the fourth quarter relative to the third quarter. In addition, we modeled a catch-up of a 25% cumulative beta since -- when rates began to rise in March on top of the 100-basis-point up scenario, which resulted in an estimated $35 million headwind to net interest income. On the other hand, if deposit betas take some time to catch up, say, sometime after the first quarter or through midyear, and deposits start to level off -- the runoff starts to level off in the beginning of 2023, then I think there's a reasonable chance we could be above that run rate. And second question, just on some of the loan buckets, I know you're talking about 1% growth sequentially average in the fourth quarter, but there's always a little bit of ups and downs in some of those national businesses."
