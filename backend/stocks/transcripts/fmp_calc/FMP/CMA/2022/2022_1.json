    "content": " Non-interest income, as outlined on Slide 10; warrant-related income decreased $14 million following elevated gains on monetization's in the fourth quarter. Based on the balance sheet as of March 31, we estimate a $160 million increase in annual net interest income over 12 months as rates gradually rise 100 basis points and the benefit would be slightly greater again in year two. Your line is open. Your line is open. So I think we're always going to benefit from rates rising, but it's important to us to lock in opportunistic rates like we're seeing today and take advantage of putting - take advantage of putting those really in income stream for the next several years. Your line is open. Your line is open. And I think, as the year unfolds, you'll continue to see - I've tried to communicate to you all that on - if you look at that quarterly chart in the appendix, it's up and to the right over a long period of time, and we're focused on adding new customers and increasing that overall warehouse lines that we have out, and we think we'll be able to continue to do that. Your line is open. Your line is open. And so the way I think you should think about this is that it's really a continuation of a path that we've been on for some time, and we're finding ways to accelerate our progress in terms of our retail branch delivery and sort of the customer experience there, continued investment in digital and in our real estate footprint. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open."
