    "content": " These include expanding our technology platform and peripheral product portfolio, generating best-in-class clinical data supporting our image-guided approach and advancing our coronary product development program to enable us to enter into new large markets with existing reimbursement codes. And third, advancing our two new peripheral devices through the regulatory approval process in preparation for commercial launch in 2023, which we believe will broaden the appeal of our product portfolio and create new usage drivers for our platform. Gross margin for the third quarter was 35%, a 4 percentage point increase from 31% in the second quarter, reflecting increased revenue levels and a shift in product mix to more capital sales in the third quarter, supported by availability of our new Lightbox 3 imaging console."
