    "content": " We've also filed FDA 510(k) submissions for two new image guided catheters, Tigereye ST for CTO-crossing and Pantheris LV for atherectomy which bring important new features and benefits to our peripheral portfolio and provide the opportunity for two new product launches this year. Over the past several months, we've made significant progress in the development of our first coronary product application, establishing a clinical advisory board made up of highly experienced interventional cardiologists in the fields of Coronary CTO crossing and intravascular imaging, and gaining important feedback on design prototypes for further development and evaluation. In addition to our new Pantheris LV filing, in the third quarter of 2022, we filed a 510 (k) submission for our new Tigereye ST catheter for CTO crossing in the peripheral arteries. Taken together, we believe the anticipated commercial launch of our Tigereye ST CTO crossing device in the first half of the year and launch of our new Pantheris LV atherectomy device in the second half of the year will bring excitement to our platform and expand addressable case opportunities for our products. Operating expenses for the fourth quarter were $4.5 million, flat with the third quarter and decreasing 15% from $5.3 million in the year ago quarter as we complete peripheral product development activities and continue to control operating expenses while investing in our core strategic initiatives."
