    "content": " During the limited phase, physicians use the new Lightbox 3 with Avinger's, TigerEye CTO crossing, and Pantheris atherectomy catheters at 12 clinical sites throughout the U.S. Users were extremely impressed by the enhanced high-definition imaging which facilitates the identification of disease morphology and arterial wall structures. Operating expenses for the first quarter were $5.2 million down from $5.5 million in the first quarter of 2021 with the completion and commercial release of the Lightbox 3 console, we have seen our R&D expenses decline even while we are investing heavily in development efforts for our new or two new  catheters and the coronary CTO crossing device. And boy, we're really thankful that we have what we believe, and I think what our data is showing, the best-in-class below the knee atherectomy device, which is almost fully targeting these CLI patients and enable -- enabling us to perform cases even when electric procedures may be delayed or limited. We believe it's an opportunity for us to create a market with the current 50,000 procedures that we're seeing done now and growing with the ability to expand that to more hospital centers and more physicians, with the estimated 30% of total CABG procedures which are done related to CTOs. And all of this access would immediately access even though a highly disruptive and completely new approach in technology, it would access the currently -- the highly attractive reimbursement situation currently in place, both for percutaneous CTO crossing in the coronary arteries and also OCT diagnostic imaging reimbursement via CPT codes that are already in place for the coronary arteries."
