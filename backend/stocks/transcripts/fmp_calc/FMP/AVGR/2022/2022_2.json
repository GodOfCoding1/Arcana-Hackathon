    "content": " During the second quarter, we advanced several strategic initiatives that we believe will be important growth drivers for the company as we expand our technology platform and build our peripheral product portfolio, generate compelling clinical data supporting the differentiating benefits of our technology and meaningfully advance our coronary product development program. Total revenue for the second quarter of 2022 was $2.1 million, a 13% increase from $1.9 million in the first quarter as we experienced reduced impact of COVID-19 in our markets, offset by the lingering headwinds of hospital staffing challenges and the contrast die shortage in the second quarter that Jeff discussed earlier in the call."
