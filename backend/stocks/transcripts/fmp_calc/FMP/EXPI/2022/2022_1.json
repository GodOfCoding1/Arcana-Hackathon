    "content": " The global network, 21 countries and counting, we'll certainly announce some additional countries next quarter, but that network has been growing dramatically well in excess of 100% year-over-year growth in our global agent count, and we see a lot of opportunities as we continue to grow into multiple markets around the world. And then, international, we want to get to as many countries as we can, as quickly as we can and recognizing that it takes a little bit of time before they get to positive cash flow, but we've already got to positive cash flow in a number of countries that we expand to because of our low-cost operate, but we still want to continue to keep our foot on the gas to get to those countries, learn what we're going to learn, entering those new countries as we can, so we can make the pivots and adjustments so we can become major players. And so a big portion of that sale -- those sales were literally to pay the taxes, which were something akin to $16-something million that was -- that came from just an exercise and then trying to rebuild a little bit of just my own personal cash reserves for me personally, but that's been -- and I did it has a, I think, 9,000 shares a day, because it was a really small amount, as opposed to just doing one big whack of options exercised in sales."
