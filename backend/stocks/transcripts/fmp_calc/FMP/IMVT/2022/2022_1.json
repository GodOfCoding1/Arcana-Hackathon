    "content": " In particular, the flexibility in dosing does not only enable Immunovant to design programs to target the ideal level of IgG suppression in a particular disease, but we believe also will enable Immunovant to design dosage regimens where changes in albumin and LDL outside of normal limits will be mostly either modest or of short duration during an induction phase, for example. So I think given that the dosing in Thyroid Eye Disease is likely to be of a shorter term duration, then it may be that there is nothing particular that needs to be done for lipid management, given that shorter term excursions in LDL for the vast majority of patients, particularly with some modest inclusion, exclusion criteria changes, won't really be an issue."
