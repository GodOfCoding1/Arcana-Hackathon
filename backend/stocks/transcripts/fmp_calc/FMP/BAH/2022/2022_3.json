Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. We asked ourselves if we were the right player by ourselves to capitalize on the growth in those commercial markets and we came to the conclusion that those businesses would grow better, faster with a different investor base and with partners, we remain involved as minority owners in those businesses because we believe in them and we're excited to see where that will take us and frankly, we're learning a lot about how to both, make venture investments and the minority partners in these fast growing entities and then how do we take advantage of all of that IP and those market positions that are getting created to drive growth into the core of our defense Intel and civil markets and again, I think the future is bright on that front. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open."
