    "content": " Lastly, we delivered strong operating cash flow of $255 million in the quarter, an increase of 418% over the prior year. At the top line revenue increased 6.4% for the full fiscal year to $8.4 billion, which includes $340 million from inorganic contributions. Moving to the bottom line, adjusted EBITDA for fiscal year 2022 was $935 million, up 11.3% from the prior year period. Capital expenditures for fiscal year 2022 were approximately $80 million, down 8% over the prior fiscal year resulting in free cash flow of approximately $657 million and a free cash flow conversion rate of 116% of adjusted net income, which supports our strong balance sheet and capital deployment priorities. For fiscal year 2023, our guidance outlook is centered around growing adjusted EBITDA to $950 million and $1 billion. Achieving adjusted EBITDA margin in the mid to high 10% range, which reflects our long-term expectations for an incremental step down in margins as unallowable spend and billable expenses continue to normalize and make strategic investments in our business to fuel growth. Specifically, we expect to pay approximately $550 million in cash taxes in fiscal year 2023, which includes approximately $150 million associated with Section 174. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. I haven't done the math precisely, but I think there's at least $0.5 billion of new ceiling in there as the mission, the scope continues to expand and frankly, the impact of our work makes our clients need and want more, as you know, we were expecting this to be done earlier in the year, but it's we're poised to ramp up there. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open."
