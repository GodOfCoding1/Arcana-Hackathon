    "content": " In defense, revenue grew by approximately 5% over the prior year period, reflecting our second consecutive quarter of positive revenue growth as we continue to build momentum across the entire portfolio. Adjusted EBITDA was $253 million in the first quarter, up 6.1% from the prior year period. Today, we are also pleased to announce that the Board has approved a quarterly dividend of $0.43 per share, payable on August 1 to stockholders of record on August 15, as well as an increase of $400 million to our share repurchase authorization, bringing our remaining available capacity to approximately $1 billion. And I would say that as we look towards next quarter, we're really seeing, as you point out, continuing to be a seasonally strong quarter for us, and we're already seeing larger awards being released, an uptick in RFPs and strong indications that our clients are going to move out before the end of the government fiscal year. So when you put all of that together, I feel really good about the first quarter because it demonstrates that we're both building momentum and resilience against this year and the potential volatility in the second half, or more broadly against the time frame of our entire investment thesis and the fact that VoLT is working."
