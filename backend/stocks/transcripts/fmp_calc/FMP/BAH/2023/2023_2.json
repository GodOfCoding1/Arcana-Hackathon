    "content": " At the top line, revenue grew 9.2% in the second quarter, reflecting growth across all of our markets and particularly strong performance in our Civil business. These results reflect another exceptional quarter of organic revenue growth driven by the ongoing strategic repositioning of our business, strong demand for our solutions, headcount growth and higher staff utilization compared to the prior year's quarter. Your line is open. And so when you look at our investments in health and DVA that were in our prepared remarks, when you look at our digital battlespace investments, National Cyber and the like, we think that that's the right path of evolution is to take everything we learned over the last few years and really pour it into these key mission technology intersections that are prime for hyper growth. Your line is open. Your line is open. And all of that, I think Booz Allen is -- really has a unique position that we built over the last decade at the intersection of mission and technology where we are bringing these very new technologies, sometimes do all use technologies between commercial and government in a way that they're scalable into these massive challenges. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. The second dynamic, which I talked a little bit about on the key -- on the prepared remarks, is that one of the things Kristine has really has all of us focused on is not just on hiring, but on the process of going from hiring to somebody getting fully billable, which is a process that, frankly, used to take too long at Booz Allen, and we're shortening that significantly. Your line is open. With 4.2% year-over-year consulting staff headcount growth and the momentum we see in the business, that's right on track with where we want to be, and I think it's in line with the model that you articulated."
