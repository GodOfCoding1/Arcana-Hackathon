    "content": " Over the past 5 years, we have worked diligently to optimize our portfolio, including our strategic entry into the Kaybob Duvernay and the execution of multiple noncore dispositions, prioritize our balance sheet strength by reducing our net debt by $3 billion, prove our capital discipline by executing our programs on budget, illustrate our technical capabilities with consistent operational excellence and affirm our commitment to returning capital to our shareholders. As we look to 2023, we are on track to generate $1 billion of excess cash flow at $75 WTI pricing, allowing us to return over $600 million of capital directly to our shareholders, while also delivering per share growth and further net debt reductions. Altogether, our 2P net asset value reached $21.50 per share at year-end 2022, while our 1P and PDP NAVs were $15.14 and $10.38 per share, respectively."
