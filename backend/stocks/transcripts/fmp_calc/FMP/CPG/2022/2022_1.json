This conference call is being recorded today and will be broadcast along with a slide deck, which could be found on Crescent Point's website home page. The complete financial statements and management's discussion and analysis for the period ending March 31, 2022, were announced this morning and are available on the Crescent Point, SEDAR and EDGAR websites. During the call, management may make projections or other forward-looking statements regarding future events or future financial performance. Additional information or factors that could affect Crescent Point's operations or financial results are included in Crescent Point's most recent annual information form, which may be accessed to the Crescent Point, SEDAR or EDGAR websites or by contacting Crescent Point Energy. We've had a great start to 2022, building upon our balance sheet strength and sustainability. We generated $290 million of excess cash flow in the quarter, which allowed us to further reduce our net debt by $230 million and accelerate our return of capital to shareholders. As a result of our significant excess cash flow generation, we are now on pace to achieve our near-term debt target of $1.3 billion in the third quarter. Of these planned repurchases, we have already executed approximately 13.5 million shares or more than 70% of our plans for the first half of the year. As we reach our near-term debt target, we expect to be in even stronger position to increase the level of excess cash flow we return to shareholders. As a result, we expect our development capital expenditures will be between $875 million to $900 million, which is within our prior guidance range. I'm pleased to report that we have surpassed our GHG reduction target 3 years ahead of schedule and continued our Board renewal process, putting forward a new independent director for election at our AGM next week. For the quarter ended March 31, 2022, adjusted funds flow totaled $534 million or $0.92 per share diluted driven by a strong operating netback of $62 per BOE. Development capital expenditures for the quarter, which includes drilling and development, facilities and seismic, totaled approximately $204 million. Our net debt at quarter end totaled $1.8 billion, which was down $230 million since year-end 2021. To further supplement this core dividend, we remain active on our buyback program and expect to complete the purchase of approximately $150 million of our shares by midyear. Since December 2021, we have now repurchased for cancellation approximately 13.5 million shares for a total consideration of $110 million. Overall, our allocation of capital continues to demonstrate our commitment to a model that generates value through a combination of capital return to the shareholders, including a dividend and debt adjusted per share growth. For the quarter ended March 31, 2022, our production averaged 132,788 BOE per day comprised of over 80% oil and liquids. During the first quarter, we commenced completion activities on our second fully-operated, multi-well pad in the Kaybob Duvernay play, which we expect to bring on production in second quarter. Initial production rates from our first fully-operated, multi-well pad in the play remains strong, exceeding our expectations and continue to demonstrate the high-impact nature of this asset. Our annual average production guidance remains unchanged at 133,000 BOE to 137,000 BOE per day despite temporary lower production levels in second quarter resulting from power outages caused by a late April snow storm in North Dakota. We anticipate that up to 1,500 BOE per day of annual average production may be impacted as a result of this unexpected downtime or approximately 1% of our annual guidance. However, our production guidance range remains unchanged and continues to forecast higher production during the second half of the year based on our development program planning. Our production profile for the second half of 2022 continues to benefit from higher expected quarterly production, including the positive impact of 16 net wells in Kaybob, which are expected to come online during the balance of the year. Our execution in our Kaybob play continues to progress as demonstrated by our most recent pad, where we successfully reduced average drilling days per well to less than 15, a 30% reduction from our initial pad in late 2021. On a similar note, we continue to drive our drilling days lower in North Dakota, where we have achieved record drill times, lowering drilling days to less than 10, which is a 15% reduction from 2021. During the first quarter, we surpassed our emissions intensity reduction target of 50% relative to a 2017 baseline, reaching an emissions intensity of approximately 0.02 tons of CO2 equivalent per BOE. We have met these targets 3 years ahead of schedule as a result of our continued efforts to reduce vented, flared and fugitive emissions across our operations. Before I hand it back to Craig for some closing comments, I would like to thank our employees and especially our field staff for all their hard work, persistent dedication and continued focus on safe operations throughout the first quarter. Our first quarter results demonstrate our continued capital discipline, operational execution and robust excess cash flow generation. We are on track to generate $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion of excess cash flow in 2022, assuming $80 to $100 per barrel WTI pricing for the remainder of the year. Our asset base continues to benefit from high netback production in low-risk, high-return plays generating considerable excess cash flow. Our strong asset level returns and excess cash flow profile are further insulated by our significant tax pools, which currently total approximately $10 billion. As our balance sheet continues to strengthen, we expect higher levels of excess cash flow to be returned directly to shareholders, which we plan to detail on our upcoming framework. First on hedging, it looks like you're only about maybe 6%, 7% hedged next year. As far as the hedge book, so as you're well aware, this year, we're fairly hedged out at around 50% of our volumes for 2022. So for us, look, for us going forward, as our leverage continues to come into shape, so you look out over the year here and we get down into that, call it, 0.5 turn at some point, look for us to be a little bit lighter hedged on that. So somewhere in that neighborhood of, I would say, somewhere between 20% to 30% as the balance sheet is providing that protection. We are hedgers, probably not moving up to the volumes that you've seen us do here in the past just based on the strength of our balance sheet. And then as far as the base level dividend, happy to have now had grown that over 3 quarters here when you look at us bringing it back in September and then increased it again in December and now increasing that again here this quarter. We always back test that to a $50 price deck to ensure that it's sustainable in a, call it, more of a lower price environment, so around $50. It's about a $0.12 -- sorry, a 12% simple payout at that level. But so when you look at us here on guidance, we're on track for that 133,000 to 137,000 for the remainder of the year. So I would expect somewhere in Q2 for us to be I don't know, somewhere in the neighborhood of 125,000 to 126,000-ish BOE per day, with the bulk of that in that 80% still being -- a little bit over 80% being liquids. As we mentioned last quarter, our average IP30 rate of those is around 800 BOE per day, 80% liquids. And so using that production profile and those wells coming on second half, obviously, ramps up our Q3, Q4 production to ultimately hit our -- within our guidance range of 133,000 to 137,000 BOE per day. And then I see on your guidance, you've got a revised annual operating expenses slightly upward, about $0.50 in the range. Yes, that $0.50 upwards revision on a per BOE basis is around 3% to 4%. So all in, that works out to about 3% to 4% kind of cost increases and hence, the slight guidance increase to around $14 per BOE at the midpoint. But for us, look for us going forward to be somewhere, like I'd mentioned to Mike, somewhere in that 20% to 30% range. And as you look out at our leverage, we do have a nearer-term debt target of $1.3 billion, which is 1x debt to cash flow at $55. When you look to a $50 price environment like you had mentioned, we'd like to be somewhere around 1 time -- or sorry, $1 billion of absolute debt, which would be somewhere in that neighborhood of about 0.8, 0.9x debt to cash flow. So look for us to continue to strengthen the balance sheet in that fashion, but also look for us to continue to have a little bit of a hedge book built out in that range of 20% to 30%. So yes, when you look across our entire portfolio, we're seeing up to 15% cost increases. So I think our operations & supply chain management teams have done a pretty good job forecasting that and understanding where the bulk of those cost increases lie for us, casing, fuel, and are fracking, even though we have our pricing for fracking on a WTI realized price basis. And so when you look across our asset base, we have probably over 80% of our remaining capital spend either contracted or controlled and only less than 20% of our services and costs even though secured, can still vary slightly. Also a little bit of onetime annual increases on stuff like property tax, surface leases, power, et cetera."
