    "content": " Subsequent to the quarter, we released our fourth annual sustainability report, which sets ambitious environmental performance targets, including reducing our GHG emissions by 38% by the year 2030, and reducing freshwater use and enhancing the strategic management of our water resources. Given our success in strengthening our balance sheet, we have accelerated our return of capital to shareholders, including an updated framework to return up to 50% of our discretionary excess cash flow beginning in the third quarter of 2022. So as we progress through the year, look for us to build up a little bit of a hedge book into the back half of 2023, but I would say it's going to be in that range of in and around 20%. So of that 50% excess discretionary cash flow that we're allocating toward shareholders, the other 50% is staying within the business for us to continue to solidify the balance sheet, continue to pay down debt, and at the same time, use for reinvestment, whether that's inorganic or organic."
