    "content": " For the quarter ended September 30th, adjusted funds flow totaled $577 million, or $1.02 per share fully diluted, driven by a strong operating netback of over $59 per boe. Based on our continued execution, the attractive returns we have achieved and significant running room to develop our assets, we now expect to grow our Kaybob production in a disciplined manner from approximately 35,000 boe per day in 2022 to over 50,000 boe per day by 2027 subject to commodity prices. In addition to setting our 2023 budget, we have also updated our five-year outlook where we expect to generate up to $6 billion of cumulative after-tax excess cash flow at $85 per barrel WTI pricing. Our disciplined five-year plan assumes production growth to approximately 145,000 boe per day by 2027, subject to commodity prices with a continued focus on returns and sustainability. So for us, I think and we think as the management team and the Board here at Crescent Point that 50% is a very compelling strong return on that discretionary funds flow, especially when you add in the base dividend and then that other 50% is going to stay internal here for us to continue to reinvest in the business and whether that's some type of organic growth, lay on a bit more capital here and do a bit of organic growth or in the event of an acquisition where maybe it's some inorganic growth."
