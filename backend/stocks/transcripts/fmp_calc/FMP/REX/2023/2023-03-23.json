    "content": " Our cash is approximately $280 million at the end of the quarter -- at the end of the year consolidated and we have our uses of cash -- the cash over the next couple of years include carbon capture, which again, Zafar will discuss. As I mentioned, that with the expansion from $150 million to if we go to $175 million and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s about $25 million more ethanol production and if we look at the benefit of 45Z or if we are able to achieve all those carbon intensity, which we are working on carbon sequestration, and as I was -- what had mentioned, that a couple of years, even before the 45Z, we were trying to make sure that we reduce our carbon intensity. And also, as I mentioned, that we will expect to have our modular unit, which will be compressor facility will be delivered by the end of this year and then we will have -- construction will start around that modular unit because that will take also at the six months to seven months or longer, because there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a lot of pipes that need to be connected, electric, building needs to be built around it. But in the meantime, they are valuing their companies more than they did a year or two ago, for sure, because of the opportunity, because of the legislation that just passed that, Zafar mentioned, we now can get up to $1 a gallon for 45Z, $85 a ton for 45Q, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a lot of money to be distributed to different people."
