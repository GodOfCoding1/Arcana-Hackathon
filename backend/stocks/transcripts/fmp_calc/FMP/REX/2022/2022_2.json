    "content": " Ethanol pricing improved by 20%, dried distiller grains improved by 21%, and corn oil pricing improved by 53% for this year's quarter over the prior year's second quarter. SG&A increased for the second quarter to $9.1 million from $6.2 million in the prior year, $1.1 million of the increase is due to the increase in the number of ethanol contracts that require the freight to be paid by us compared to the prior year and approximately 900,000 from increased incentive compensation. I don't think any of the really good plants would sell for less than -- we have not seen any recently that would sell -- that I know of that would sell for less than replacement value or less built in a new plant in the years past, there have been some and we tried to buy some unfortunately where we've been out there. But specifically looking at it, carbon sequestration, as I mentioned earlier, $50 tax credit, we were still -- when we original projection, we looked at it, we were profitable and now is $85 and that will be -- certainly will help us to get more profitable."
