In our company, we're a well-run ethanol company that makes money that -- consistently over the years has made money in ethanol, and also have great hopes for the future in carbon capture, we feel our carbon capture is well -- is far more advanced than almost everyone else is trying to -- just trying to get into this industry. And that's certainly is one of the bright side in this business at this time, and as you can see corn is trading today about $7.60, which is -- don't compare to last few weeks, it was up almost $8.15, and natural gas is trading $9.20, ethanol is $2.75.
