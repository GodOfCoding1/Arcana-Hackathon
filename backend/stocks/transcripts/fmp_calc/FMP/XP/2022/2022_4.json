    "content": "  Also, after a record third quarter, third quarter last year was our best quarter, when our gross revenue reached the R$3.8 billion helped by anticipated deals and traded volumes in Institutional and Corporate & Issuer Services, that in the fourth quarter faced a lesser favorable quarter, as previous signaled in our last call -- earnings call. Looking at the full year 2022, which we believe is the best way to look at the results of XP last year because of the disparity that we had among quarters throughout the year, our gross revenue grew 10% relative to a strong 2021, the high of the bull market cycle, which reinforces what I said earlier, the resilience of our business even tough scenarios."
