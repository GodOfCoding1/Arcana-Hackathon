    "content": " This change was motivated by: one, growth of the Corporate business, which was irrelevant until the end of 2021 last year, and has been gaining traction throughout this year, as you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to see throughout the presentation as well; and number two, different profile of clients as well; and third, we have opened the Retail revenue base on its main product classes, I think this is the main change in terms of disclosure that we are making from now. And then, we have on the right side the breakdown of Retail Client Assets per products as we have done in terms of Retail revenue, we also are going to disclose the total Retail Client Assets break down by the same buckets, and here it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pretty much clear from year-over-year view mix shifts in terms of investment allocation. And you compare to Funds Platform in the third quarter last year to keep the same seasonality, that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll reach R$1.8 billion, so this R$400 million per quarter if you annualize that you would reached almost R$1.5 billion in annual revenue profit. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s interesting to note that in our \u00e2\u0080\u0093 we had this quarter and all time high quarterly securities placement revenue of R$525 million, you can see that in our earnings release that number is as per our accounting income statement. When you have uncertainty as an individual investors, a fluent client, with a lot of uncertainty in the market, where if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to buy a longer duration, secured, fixed income security, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to get a nominal remuneration that is less than the one that you can have with daily liquidated, and then it makes hard, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a headwind, and even in that scenario, net new money that is about R$10 billion as per month."
