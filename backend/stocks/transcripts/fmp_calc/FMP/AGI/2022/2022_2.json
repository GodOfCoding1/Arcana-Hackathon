    "content": " Following the completion of the shaft in 2026, production is expected to more than double from current levels to average 287,000 ounces of gold per year with all-in sustaining costs through the larger expansion -- 43% larger mineable resource and lower capital per ounce costs, all contributing to a significantly more valuable operation with a $1.8 billion valuation at current gold prices. Total cash costs averaged $895 per ounce and all-in sustaining costs were $1,170 per ounce, a significant improvement from the first quarter, reflecting higher grades at Island Gold, the strong start at La Yaqui Grande and the weaker Canadian dollar."
