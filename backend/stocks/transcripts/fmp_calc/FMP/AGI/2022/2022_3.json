    "content": " Production of 123,400 ounces of gold was near the top end of guidance and represented a 19% increase from the second quarter, total cash costs of $868 per ounce and all in sustaining costs of $1,178 per ounce were both below our annual guidance and down approximately 7% from the first half of the year. We expect the strong performance to continue into the fourth quarter that will La Yaqui Grande, driving another increase in our production to a range of 125,000 to 135,000 ounces. Despite industry wide inflation, we also expect a further decrease in our costs in the fourth quarter, reflecting the ramp up of low cost production La Yaqui Grande, higher grades at Island Gold, and the weaker Canadian dollar. A significant improvement from the first half of the year, reflecting strong ongoing results from our Canadian operations and the benefit of a full quarter production from La Yaqui Grande as well as a weaker Canadian dollar. We expect a further decrease in costs in the fourth quarter to the lowest levels of the year, driven by higher grades that Island Gold and additional low cost production growth from La Yaqui Grande. We expect the rate of our capital spending to increase on the Phase 3 plus expansion in the fourth quarter through our full year spending is likely to be lower than guidance that Island Gold, with some of the construction capital deferred into the next few years. With the rainy season now over and mining and stacking rates at La Yaqui Grande continuing to ramp up, we expect a further increase in production from LaYaqui Grande in the fourth quarter at lower costs."
