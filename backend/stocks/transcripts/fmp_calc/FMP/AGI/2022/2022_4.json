    "content": " Mining depletion was more than replaced with a 2% increase in our global reserves to 10.5 million ounces of gold along with a 3% increase in grades, driven by higher grade additions at Island Gold and Mulatos. All in sustaining costs are expected to decrease 4% in 2023 and 17% by 2025 to approximately $1,000 per ounce, driven by low cost production growth for La Yaqui Grande and Island Gold. Total cash costs of $810 per ounce and all-in sustaining costs of $1,138 per ounce were below full-year guidance and the lowest level of the year, benefiting from higher grades at Island Gold and low cost production growth from La Yaqui Grande. Free cash flow increased to 18 million in the fourth quarter, up substantially from earlier in the year, driven by the ramp up of low cost production from La Yaqui Grande and a strong ongoing contribution from Young Davidson. Total cash costs of $942 per ounce and mine site all-in sustaining costs of $1,284 per ounce in the fourth quarter were up from earlier in the year, but both were in-line with guidance on a full-year basis. Over to Slide 8, Island Gold had a strong finish to the year producing 40,500 ounces in the fourth quarter at a total cash cost of $605 per ounce and mine site all-in sustaining cost of $863 per ounce. The Mulatos District produced 49,100 ounces in the fourth quarter, a 15% increase from the third quarter with all-in sustaining costs decreasing 19% to $922 per ounce. With a full-year of low cost production from La Yaqui Grande in 2023, Mulatos District production is expected to increase 34% to between 175,000 and 185,000 ounces, a 21% lower mine site all-in sustaining costs. Over to Slide 11, La Yaqui Grande produced 37,300 ounces in the fourth quarter, a 47% increase from the third quarter at 22% lower all-in sustaining costs of $545 per ounce."
