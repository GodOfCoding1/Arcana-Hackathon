    "content": " Without VTR, which was still consolidated until the end of Q3, our revenue would have been $4.4 billion and up by 3% on a rebased basis, driven by top line growth across all reporting segments particularly our Liberty Costa Rica, C&W Networks and Lat Am and our C&W Caribbean businesses. Finally, to our 2023 priorities and integration updates on the right of the slide. Finally, to our 2023 priorities and integration updates on the right of the slide. Excluding VTR, our revenue increased year-over-year by $55 million helped in part by the contribution from our Q3 acquisition of Claro Panama and modest rebased growth of 1%. On a full year basis, excluding VTR, revenue was up 8% on a reported basis and 3% on a rebased basis to $4.4 billion as each of our 5 operating segments grew year-over-year, especially our Costa Rica and C&W Networks and Lat Am businesses. We reported $367 million of revenue in Q4, reflecting 3% rebased growth and $138 million of adjusted OIBDA or 10% rebased growth. Wrapping up with Costa Rica on the far right, we generated Q4 revenue of $117 million and $36 million of adjusted OIBDA, reflecting strong rebased revenue growth of 3% and an LLA segment leading 17% rebased adjusted OIBDA growth. First, we incurred $225 million of P&E additions in Q4 and $816 million for the full year, with the latter representing 17% of revenue, a little better than our 2022 guidance. We are pursuing mid to high single-digit rebased adjusted OIBDA growth, P&E additions of approximately 16% of revenue and adjusted free cash flow before distributions to partners of approximately $300 million."
