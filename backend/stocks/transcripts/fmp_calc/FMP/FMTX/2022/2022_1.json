    "content": " We want to emphasize that such forward-looking statements reflect our current expectations and assumptions regarding timing, enrollment, success, and data announcements of our current ongoing clinical trials, therapeutic potential, hypotheses of mechanisms of action and clinical benefits, and safety of our product candidates, planned regulatory submissions, our financial condition and capital requirements, our business operations, development plans, the potential impact of COVID-19 on our business and clinical development and relationships with third parties and collaborators and are neither predictions nor guarantees of future events or performance. Actual results could differ materially from those stated or implied by these forward-looking statements due to risks and uncertainties associated with our business including those under the heading entitled Risk Factors in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31st, 2021 and in our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31st, 2022 that will be filed with the SEC today and in subsequent reports including our current reports on Form 8-K. Before turning the call over to Frank, I'd like to mention our upcoming R&D day with investors that was outlined in today's release. The increase was primarily attributable to the increase in research and development staff to support the advancement of Etavopivat and other programs, an increase in equity-based compensation, the conduct of our Phase 2/3 trial in sickle cell disease patients, and study startup costs related to our Phase 2 trial in thalassemia."
