    "content": " During the quarter, we saw increases in the cost of burner and diesel fuel impacting profit by $4 million, compared with the second quarter of the prior year. During the second quarter, sales volumes decreased year-over-year as  shortages in various markets reduced aggregate sales across the group, while project delays in California adversely impacted volumes in the state. Second quarter net ORP losses to Granite, which excludes non-controlling interest, were 18 million on revenue of 49 million, compared to a profit of 4 million on revenue of 115 million in the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA and EBITDA margin from continuing operations for the second quarter was 39 million and 5%, compared to 62 million and 8% in the prior year. Adjusted net income from continuing operations for the quarter decreased 13 million year-over-year to 17 million, and adjusted diluted income per share of $0.38, compared to adjusted net income of 30 million, and adjusted diluted income per share of $0.66 in the prior year. The decreases in adjusted EBITDA and adjusted net income were driven by increased ORP losses in the quarter with SG&A remaining relatively unchanged as a percentage of revenue, compared to the prior year. On a year-over-year basis, cash and marketable securities are lower, reflecting share buybacks of approximately 50 million through the ASR in the second quarter, debt repayment, timing of capital expenditures, and a decrease in operating cash flow. While overshadowed by the ORP losses, in our second quarter financial results, we are making progress to increase profitability in our Construction segment with 14% gross profit margin   we would in the ORP."
