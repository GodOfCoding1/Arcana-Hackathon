    "content": " It's typically kind of two years to revenue, and if you kind of rewind the clock, we, we've been in a lot of these international locations for two plus years, and you're starting to see kind of the same trajectory and trend that we had in the U.S back in 2019 where you, start getting into 2, 3, 4, 5 different customers. So, it's too much to answer in one question, but you can imagine we could make like a three by a two by three matrix or, or table or something and say, we're first solar panels, more than 50% or less than 50% of sales in the fourth quarter and or in the backlog or in the pipeline or international sales, above the 50% or below the 50% mark, fourth quarter backlog pipeline, whatever, you're kind of comfortable talking about it. So as, as Sean talked about when we talked about guidance in terms of q1, it is a relatively narrow range, we're feeling very good about the bookings we've had in q4, obviously to your point where a project based business we're supporting projects if there's a delay of time in any individual products that can delay for revenue recognition. That's when I say two years, really when you put the boots on the ground and enter a new geography from time to ultimately revenue because it takes time to, to build the relationships, get certified, build, everything around kind of the, the product portfolio and backlog. I mean, I think kind of the expectation as you look at non-UFLPA whether it's domestic or international, the, the cycle time to revenue is obviously much shorter because these projects have modules and they're, and they're moving forward in kind of accordance of what we would call a normal course business."
