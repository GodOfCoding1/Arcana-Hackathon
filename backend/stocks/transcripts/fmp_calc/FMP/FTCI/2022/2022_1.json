    "content": " The results for this quarter compares to a gross profit of $0.1 million in the prior year period, with the difference driven primarily by the reserve and reduced production volume versus the prior year and an increase in employee count and other overhead expenses to support the Company's growth. But as we get up to the higher levels as we exit the year with the new products that are taking advantage of the DTV initiatives as well as the improved logistics environment as well as steel content, that's where we're going to exit with the margins that we shared there on slide 6. So I first want to ask about these international projects that's really cool to see, and it's something I think it's challenging because I think of companies who've been successful in the United States is often being very focused on reducing man hours per megawatt, and that's such a key part of what makes the product attractive in high-wage markets like the U.S. And then that doesn't always necessarily translate well into lower wage markets."
