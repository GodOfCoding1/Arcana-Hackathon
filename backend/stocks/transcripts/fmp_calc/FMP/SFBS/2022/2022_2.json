Net interest margin, as Tom mentioned, loan growth, exclusive of PPP forgiveness was $803 million for the second quarter. So, we had net average loan growth of $542 million in the second quarter. Deposits decreased by $637 million in the second quarter, $532 million of this decrease related to correspondent banks. Loan loss provision, our provision increased by $4.2 million in the second quarter as our loan production, excluding PPP, increased by $314 million for the first quarter. First, salaries and benefits, as a result of our market expansions, total salaries increased by $732,000 in the second quarter and by $1.9 million year-over-year. End of the second quarter of \u00e2\u0080\u009821, correspondent \u00e2\u0080\u0093 total correspondent balances, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all Fed Funds, DDA, everything was $2.4 billion. And if you look back a year, the end of the second quarter of \u00e2\u0080\u009821 to today, correspondent balances are up $580 million. So, when we \u00e2\u0080\u0093 maybe like a very top-level way of asking it is like if we look at a run rate, I think it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s like $39.8 million this quarter."
