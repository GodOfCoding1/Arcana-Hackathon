    "content": " Good afternoon, and welcome to our third quarter earnings call. We will have Tom Broughton, our CEO; Bud Foshee, our CFO; and Henry Abbott, our Chief Credit Officer, covering some highlights from the quarter, and then we'll take your questions. and good afternoon, and welcome to our third quarter conference call. I am going to review a few highlights of the quarter, before I turn it over to Bud, to go over the numbers in a little bit more detail. We are seeing lower pipelines in loans, because we certainly can't keep growing at the torrid pace that we've been growing in the last two quarters. So, we expect the loan growth to moderate in coming quarters. More at our historical growth rates, we did see some run-off in the deposits in correspondent area in the third quarter, while the general bank was stable. Our general bank had year-over-year deposit growth, even though we did not focus on deposit growth until this past quarter. On the loan quality side, Henry Abbott will certainly discuss it in more detail, but we continue to see strong credit metrics in our loan portfolio. And I think, we had one credit that was a problem in this past quarter that was most of what we had on the charge-off list. One reason we're pleased is that we have a moratorium on adding new banks for over six months, so we can start adding agent banks again in the covered area. We did add 13 new bankers in the quarter after 15 bankers, last quarter with growth in Piedmont, Northwest Florida and Nashville regions. We continue to see opportunities and are being very selective but we are seeing better quality bankers than we've seen in a long time, in fact, we got a call this morning about a team of community bankers in a very nice market. In mid-June, we decided to spend investment purchases based on our strong loan growth. In the third quarter, we were able to reinvest $76 million on maturities and mortgage-backed paydowns into higher-yielding loans. Net interest margin -- loan growth, exclusive of PPP forgiveness was $677 million for the third quarter. Average loans, excluding PPP, increased by $776 million in the third quarter. Average PPP loans decreased by $45 million, so net average growth was $731 million. PPP fees and interest income were $432,000 in the third quarter of 2022 compared to $6.4 million in the third quarter of 2021. This increased our loan loss provision, we will not receive a positive net interest margin until the next quarter. In the fourth quarter of '21, it was 2.71%. First quarter of this year, it was 2.89%. A primary factor in the increase related to the national forecast increase from a range of 3.9% to 4.3% at June 30, 2022, to a range of 4.4% to 5.8% at 9/30/2022. During the third quarter, we had a preliminary settlement of litigation and write-down of a private investment, resulting in charges of $2.4 million net of income taxes or $0.05 per diluted share. As a result of our market expansions, total salaries increased by $871,000 in the third quarter and by $3.7 million year-over-year. Earnings credit rate on correspondent DDA balances increased from 0.4% at September 30, 2021, to 3.25% at September 30, 2022. At the same time, we continue to be conservative with our underwriting and interest rate sensitivity analysis, given the persistent inflation in the marketplace as well as being more selective on new commercial real estate exposure, which is income-producing versus our core bread and butter of owner-occupied real estate. Past-due loans were mere $10.8 million on par with the second quarter, and that figure equates to past due to total loans of 10 basis points, which continues to be near historic lows. While the long-term impact to the region are unknown, we feel like our loan portfolio in that area fared very well. To date, we've only uncovered three severely impacted commercial borrowers, and we believe they were appropriately insured. We grew our loan loss reserve for the quarter by $12.6 million, which amounts to an ALLL to total loans of 1.25. The increase in reserve is not associated with a specific credit or any deterioration, but rather the model is impacted by changes in economic outlook as Bud previously mentioned. While we have not seen any major changes in the loan portfolio and our four key credit metrics continue to be near historic lows, we did feel it prudent to increase our reserves. Of the $3 million in charge-offs, roughly $2 million was related to one specific credit. We were proactive in addressing the issue and the remaining exposure we do have to the borrower is less than $500,000 and is fully impaired, while charge-offs were slightly elevated. Changes to the reserve aside, I feel very good about how the bank's loan portfolio is positioned in the diversified markets we serve. And yes, we're glad to get good news after Hurricane Ian down in Florida. Just in general, I mentioned that I've always thought, I think anybody thinks the core deposits, the key to building the value of a banking franchise. We're certainly well positioned compared to many of our competitors in the industries because our balance sheet liability side is funded with core deposits, not federal home loan advances and brokered deposits. Our compound deposit growth rate in the past five years is 14% and from the inception of the bank, it's 33% in 2005. We think we have the best platform for commercial bankers, which is one reason we've attracted a number of bankers in the last 17 years. We are pleased with the quarter with an outstanding return on equity, return on assets and efficiency ratio. It's a good win but every 15 years, I don't blame you. I wanted to ask, Tom, you talked obviously, another great quarter of loan growth. Can you maybe frame up for us a little bit more kind of what in your mind is sort of in dollars, maybe what a pullback in loan growth would be kind of vis-\u00c3\u00a0-vis all the people you've hired. I know you're focused on deposits, but that's obviously a big part of it with your loan-to-deposit ratio now at 102%. Our loan-to-deposit ratio was back where we've been for most of the last 17 years, except for two periods of time, which were the pandemic in the '08, '09 recession. Brad, I just think a 25% annualized growth rate is not -- clearly not sustainable. So something in the -- by quarter, you think 10% to 15% is sort of where we had our targeted growth in loans and deposits and we think we'll get back to those levels over the next several quarters. In fact, we're already seeing, we see surge in deposits coming. So if that gives you any idea, we're still holding the we say we're a disciplined growth company and we mean that we're going to be disciplined on both sides of the balance sheet, Brad. So are you kind of referencing quarterly margin, which was 3.64-ish, I believe? So to break it down, I guess what we're talking about is really from one Fed increase to another. So what happens from a loan standpoint, we've got right at $2 billion debt reprices, whenever an index changes that reprices. Well, that's about equal to what correspondent has in money markets and Fed funds. Now over the next month, you're going to have about $1.8 billion in loans that will reprice. Whatever the index is, you've got a different reset date during the month, but you'll have another $1.8 billion that will raise price and then you've got your money market, I guess, in money market is what we can, you'll have some of the money markets increasing over time. So loans -- the $1.8 billion is going to go a little less or right, then your deposit side, it's going to reprice during the time period. To stress just from a Fed increase standpoint with... And the comment about earlier, I think Bud in your comments, you talked about the outlook for general bank deposits to grow. They've had some really nice wins in the last few weeks, some major new customers have joined us. So we feel like we're back to the core and are headed in the correct direction, Kevin, from. And also, I mean, we've got we layer in incentive for year-end for all of our commercial bankers to -- we didn't have much of a component for deposit growth when we started the year and so that we've added that in. So they are focused on improving deposits and adding the right way, not adding high-rate deposits. And Tom, I think early in your comments, you mentioned about getting a call just today from a new team, what might prove to be a new team of bankers -- is that -- I know you can't get too detailed, but is that a market you're currently in or not in. In is a community bank -- community banking team, which we've added a number of those in the last few months. Besides the Piedmont region, we've added some nice community teams in Tallahassee, Panama City, Ashville, just to name a few. Despite that, you guys are continuing to do a yeoman's job in terms of holding the line on salaries and employee benefits. Just curious, I saw that decline 5% linked quarter. It became obvious to us that all of our banks were going to exceed their loan goals for the year, Dave. And then the bankers you're talking to, just curious the conversation that sort of compels them to jump to ServisFirst. Is there a commonality in terms of a theme where they choose you over the current bank or another suitor out there because, obviously, there's a lot of shares moving around down there. Well, I think the banks don't have consistent incentive plans. In fact, we've had a number of bankers that joined us that found out that right at the end of the calendar year, the incentive plan was changed and they didn't like that for that current year. There are a lot of reasons, but I think a lot of people have found that we're a good platform to work from. And we support them in every way, and it's not about the management team in Birmingham is about the operating people out in the regions, and we do everything we can to empower them. We don't spend weeks putting people through the ringer on either -- if we're going to turn it down, we turn it down quickly, and that's how you -- that's what customers want to hear. So really, we're just focused on good customer service. Services what wins us customers and we feel like we're offering the best service in the industry, our compliance person was telling me how a few complaints we get this morning because we try to work with customers and try to resolve complaints. And then a continued nice growth or stability in the credit card income, you mentioned the new agent relationships. And in fact, besides our customers, we issue credit cards for 140 other banks, call it our agent credit card program. For the last six months, that is -- that has been put on hold as far as onboarding any new agent banks because we were going through this conversion. So for the fourth quarter, we'll be ramping back up, adding agent banks and we have somewhere around 6 or 7 in the queue right now. We had some adjustments in the third quarter -- that would take annually at some of our proprietary tax credits, and that was an adjustment we make in the third quarter of this year. Bud, you mentioned last quarter that you thought, I think $750 million was kind of a floor for liquidity or Fed funds. Brad, I believe we're 1.5% of assets is what we can go down to before we need to take some action. And just on loan repo -- go ahead, I'm sorry. And just on loan repricing, we've seen 200 or so basis points change in the Fed funds rate over the last year. Your loan yields are up maybe 40 basis points, excluding PPP. I was thinking you had about 35% of your loans that kind of repriced immediately with Fed funds, but that beta is closer to 20. I think the first time the Fed increased, we only had like $700 million in loans that the reprice because you had so many below floors. No, but I can -- I'll e-mail it to, Brad I don't have to bring a lot of months before, I guess, on that side. I'll go back and look at that number of loans that repriced our quarters, but I think we had a very long numbers first Fed increase. I think we're position for future growth, and we're excited about all the new people that have joined our company."
