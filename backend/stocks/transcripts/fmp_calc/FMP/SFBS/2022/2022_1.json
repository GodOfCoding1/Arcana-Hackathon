We do have a lot -- what we did -- we did a static balance sheet break shock based on March\u2019s numbers, where Fed would increase in their May through December meetings, 50% deposit beta except for the correspondent money market accounts, and we used 100% beta and 100% beta on Fed funds purchased. So, I think that gives you a little bit better flavor of what happened because first the -- second and third quarter really aren\u2019t impacted, a small decrease, then you have a bigger decrease in the fourth quarter than the first quarter of 2023. So, we go from -- let\u2019s say, we had $717 million repriced in March, by that last Fed rate increase, you would have over $2 billion."
