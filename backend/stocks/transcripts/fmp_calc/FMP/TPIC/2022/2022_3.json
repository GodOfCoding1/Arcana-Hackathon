    "content": " Given the near-term challenges the wind industry is facing, we are commencing multiple cost savings initiatives to better position us for 2023 in the long-term, including optimizing our global manufacturing footprint, reducing headcount primarily in geographies most impacted by demand and reducing or eliminating loss-making operations. The decrease in wind blade sales was primarily driven by an 11% decrease in the number of wind blades produced due to a temporary production stoppage in one of our Mexico plants as the OEMs implemented a blade redesign, a brief labor disruption in T\u00c3\u00bcrkiye as we work with the union to resolve inflationary pressure on wages as well as a reduction in manufacturing line, transitions of existing lines and currency fluctuations, which were all partially offset by an increase in average sales price per blade due to the mix of wind blade models produced and the impact of inflation on blade prices. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. And then Enercon, too. And then Enercon, too."
