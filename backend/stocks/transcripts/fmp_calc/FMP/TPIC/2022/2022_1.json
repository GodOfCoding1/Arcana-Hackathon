    "content": " Although adjusted EBITDA on a billings basis was a loss of $5.3 million, it was better than planned as a result of tight cost controls and cost reductions globally, excellent execution, including on multiple transitions, which enabled us to deliver additional blade volume during the quarter. We've reiterated our long-term ESG goals to promote a zero-harm culture focused on eliminating unsafe behaviors to achieve 33% female and 33% racial and ethnically diverse persons on our Board of Directors by 2023 to achieve 25% female representation on our global leadership team by 2025, achieve 25% racial and ethnically diverse persons on our U.S. leadership team by 2025 and become carbon neutral by 2030 with 100% of our energy being procured from renewable sources. Domestic logistics have been impacted, but thanks to the efforts of our local and global supply chain teams, we met our Q1 production targets and continue to deliver blades on time from Yangzhou as well as export the raw materials that we still source in China on a timely basis. Net cash used in operating activities was approximately $81 million, primarily due to an increase of accounts receivable of $31 million, the majority of which was to one customer, a decrease in our accounts payable of $19 million and an increase in contract assets, which was the result of increased procurement of customer-specific materials to minimize the risk of potential production disruptions that may occur given the recent COVID-19 impacts in China and geopolitical uncertainties, including the ongoing war in Ukraine."
