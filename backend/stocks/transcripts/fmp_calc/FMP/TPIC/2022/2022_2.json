    "content": " Execution, cost control and liquidity are at the forefront of our priorities while continuing to move forward on multiple strategic initiatives to enable TPI to capitalize on the expected long-term growth in the wind market, including expanding our global service offerings and leveraging our expertise in blade design while also expanding our capabilities around logistics and recycling. This improvement was due primarily to a $22.1 million decrease in income tax expense and $16.4 million in favorable foreign currency changes, partially offset by the increase in preferred stock dividends and accretion as well as approximately $8 million in non-restructuring related operating costs that were associated with certain manufacturing facilities in Newton, Iowa; Dafeng, China; and Juarez, Mexico, where production has stopped. I think from a wind standpoint, the Inflation Reduction Act can have a huge benefit on the offshore side just given the advanced manufacturing credits that will be available to build the supply chain that today doesn't exist for offshore in the U.S. And again, if IRA 2022 ultimately gets signed into law, that could have a nice benefit for offshore in general both on the East Coast, West Coast and in the Gulf, of course."
