    "content": " For the fourth quarter of 2022, we recorded total revenues of $31.7 million, an increase of 31% compared to the prior year period. Adjusting for the foreign exchange revenue was $32.5 million, up 34% versus last year's fourth quarter. Our gross profit increased to $19.3 million for the quarter compared to $14.1 million for the same quarter last year, representing a gross margin of 61% this quarter versus 58% in Q4 last year. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter ended was $4.7 million, an increase of $1.6 million from last year's Q4. Our gross profit increased $14.9 million to $66.5 million for the year compared to $51.6 million last year, representing a gross margin of 61% versus 59% last year. As you heard Scott say earlier, our outlook ranges are total revenues of $125 million to $130 million, adjusted EBITDA of $14 million to $18 million and first quarter 2023 revenue outlook of $23 million to $25 million. But on a constant currency to finish 32.5 for the Q4 and 112 annually in the middle of our range and pulling the $12 million of EBITDA, we feel pretty good with Asia lockdown all year still on COVID throughout all of 2022 and some of the supply issues that we had along with the lumpiness. Well when you look at the Intuitive Surgical, was certainly one of those bigger customers that we've been selling to for years and placed that $14.5 million order on us over 18 months."
