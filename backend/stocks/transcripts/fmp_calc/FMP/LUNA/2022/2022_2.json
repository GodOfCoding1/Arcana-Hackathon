    "content": " For the second quarter of 2022, total revenues were up 19% to $26.2 million compared to the prior year's quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was $1.2 million in Q2 2022, an increase from last year's EBITDA of $1 million. These are, first, a tough comp against last year's second quarter as a result of roughly $1.8 million of benefit from both tax and discontinued operations that did not repeat in Q2 2022. Revenues grew double digit versus Q2 last year, driven both by a full quarter of LIOS as well as strong demand for legacy Luna products. As Scott noted, our revenues for Q2 2022 were $26.2 million compared to revenues of $22 million for Q2 2021, representing a 19% year over year increase. Gross profit was $16 million for the quarter compared to $12.6 million for the same quarter last year, representing a gross margin of 61% in Q2 2022 compared to 57% in Q2 2021. Operating expenses were $18.4 million in Q2 2022 versus $14.6 million in Q2 2021, $2.1 million of this increase was driven by the OpEx of LIOS and the associated amortization. First, a tough comp versus the Q2 2021 quarter as a result of roughly $1.8 million in benefit from both tax and discontinued operations that didn't repeat in Q2 2022. And finally, adjusted EBITDA was $1.2 million for Q2 2022 versus $1 million for Q2 2021 and adjusted EPS was a loss of $0.02 per share for Q2 2022 versus profit of $0.03 for the prior year quarter."
