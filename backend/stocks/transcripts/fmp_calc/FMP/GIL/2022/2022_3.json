    "content": " So fleece sales historically are strong in the fall and it's taken a little bit longer for them to kick in but the sales in fleece are actually very strong now, which is continuing to support the outlook of the distributor business as we move into Q4. But I would say that as we move into 2023, we worked hard this year and we have quite a few new opportunities that will occur which will support I think growth for us in that environment despite the negative comps on current programs and current POS. And then on inventory, Brian I mean if you look at the inventory increase and I called out in the remarks what's driving that but I would say probably 40% of the increase is related to our raw materials and our WIP and that's driven by cost. So we had good strength on the distributor side as we've talked about whereas the retail side and the international side, there you saw because of the \u00e2\u0080\u0093 effectively the POS weakness destocking, I would say tougher comps from last year negative volume. I mean, I think if you actually look at where we are as we move into the first quarter of next year yes, obviously the annual -- the comps really step-up and the price impact really reduces as we move into Q1 and Q2 of next year. Just trying to get an understanding of -- also if you can share some magnitude of shifts between whether a North American distributor channel, how that's trending versus international just so we can understand how kind of the next two to three quarters may look at current backdrop. So look, we're -- I think, moreover, we're confident in delivering our operating margins and we'll be in that range as we move into 2023 and supported by sales growth. That's the part that we really have to have a crystal ball on, but we're well positioned I think in doing all the things we can in our power to support growth."
