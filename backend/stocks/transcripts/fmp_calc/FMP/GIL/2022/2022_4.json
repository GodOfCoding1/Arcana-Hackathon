    "content": " Turning to free cash flow, for the quarter we generated $131 million, up from $160 million in the prior year quarter, mainly driven by focus working capital management efforts, which combined with insurance recoveries, more than offset the impact from inventory built in the quarter and higher capital investments during 2022. With our 2022 revenue base of over $3.2 billion and our full year adjusted operating margin of 19.7% coming in at the higher end of our target range of 18% to 20%, we believe our business model is positioning as well to deliver on our long term profitability and return targets. Your line is open. Your line is open. The good news is I think that as we've sort of gone through January and February, we're actually seeing in our distributor business, at least POS picking up almost flat two last year, which is I would say relatively strong two months before we had to tell us that. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open."
