    "content": " Net sales declined 30% year-over-year to $245 million, largely due to channel inventory correction and softer conditions in certain markets such as Europe and Canada. Distributors are reducing safety stocks built up during the period of strong demand and significant supply chain disruption, and we estimate a reduction of approximately $80 million occurred in the third quarter 2022 compared to a meaningful inventory build in the prior year period. As a result, for the full year 2022, the company now anticipates a decrease in consolidated net sales of approximately 6% and adjusted EBITDA of $365 million to $370 million. So right now, when you look at the end of September, let's call it, rounded up $315 million on the balance sheet, we, by the end of mid to third quarter next year, expect that to be down to around about $220 million to $225 million."
