    "content": " We delivered another very strong quarter marked by net sales growth of 23% year-over-year to a record $410 million net sales, which was on top of an exceptional growth of 96% in Q1 of 2021 over Q1 of 2020. Hayward's growth in these categories continues to outperform the industry, supported by recent new product launches including ColorLogic LED lights, Omni PL controls, XE Variable Speed pumps, Small Footprint Universal Gas Heater and AquaRite S3 chlorine salt generator, all of which have increased our new product vitality index by 37% year-over-year. As Kevin mentioned earlier, we are pleased to report record results in the first quarter of 2022 driven by the continued adoption of our pool products that we are seeing throughout the channel, particularly our increasing suite of Omni connected SmartPad and lifestyle products, supported by healthy aftermarket adoption and improved operational capabilities with excellent production results in the quarter. Net interest expense decreased 48% to $9.6 million for the first quarter compared to the prior year, primarily due to debt repayment and lower interest rates as a result of the second quarter 2021 amendment to the credit facilities. Adjusted EBITDA increased to $126.2 million in the first quarter, representing an increase of 18% as a result of the higher net sales and operating income. So again, with that driving 80%, and that's not a full new pad necessarily, we feel very comfortable that even in the environment of increased interest rates that, that incremental piece or a couple of pieces will continue to be installed here in 2022 and beyond despite different economic circumstances or inflationary circumstances."
