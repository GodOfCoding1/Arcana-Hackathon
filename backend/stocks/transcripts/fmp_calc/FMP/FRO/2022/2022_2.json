    "content": " So in the second quarter, Frontline achieved $16,400 per day on our VLCC  $6,500 per day on our Suezmax fleet and very impressive $38,600 per day on our LR2/Aframax fleet. So far, in the first quarter of 2022, we have booked 73% of our VLCC days at $28,100 per day, 73% of our Suezmax days at a solid $45,000 per day and 62% of our LR2/Aframax days at even more impressive $46,200 per day. On the right hand side of the slide, we show the adjustments made this quarter, which consists of a $8.9 million gain on derivatives, a $6.1 million share results of associated companies, a $1.3 million amortization of acquired time charters, a $0.8 million gain on insurance claim, $12 million loss on marketable securities and $0.4 million loss on termination of leases. And the increase in interested net income was driven by an increase in our time charter equivalent earnings due to the higher TCE rates in the quarter, but it was partly offset by an increase in ship operating expenses of $7.5 million, mainly as a result of higher drydocking costs and other movements in income and expenses. We estimate average cash cost breakeven rates for the remainder of 2022 of approximately $24,900 per day for the VLCCs, $20,000 per day for the Suezmax tankers and $17,200 per day for the LR2 tankers. In the second quarter, we recorded OpEx expenses, including drydock of $8,100 per day for the VLCCs, $10,400 per day for the Suezmax tankers, and $8,400 per day for the LR2 tankers. Based on historic Clarkson TCE rates for non-eco vessels in the period 2021, adjusted for premiums on scrubber and eco vessels, Frontline has a free cash flow per share of $2.34 and a free cash flow yield of 20%."
