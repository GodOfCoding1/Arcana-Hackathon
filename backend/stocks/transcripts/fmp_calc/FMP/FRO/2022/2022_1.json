    "content": " The adjusted net loss in this quarter decreased $3.1 million compared to the fourth quarter and the decrease in adjusted net loss was driven by an increase in our time charter equivalent earnings due to the higher TCE rates in the quarter, partly offset by other movements in operating gains and expenses. We recorded OpEx expenses including drydock in the first quarter of $8,200 per day for VLCCs, $7,000 per day for the Suezmax tankers and $7,900 per day for the LR2 tankers. So in essence, 2 million barrels of oil per day is diverted compared to what's regarded the global trade of oil or seaborne oil, which is around 38 million barrels per day, this amounts to 6%, and 6% of oil is now traveling at least 50% longer, if not twice the distance and some even argue 2.5 times the old distance. And that would be kind of -- that could -- even though Venezuela end up in a situation where they're limited to export to Europe, it will basically shift the balance, meaning that's what more risks we can go to China, for instance, that would also be for the sea business."
