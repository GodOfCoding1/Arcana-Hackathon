    "content": " In the third quarter, Frontline achieved $25,000 per day on our VLCC fleet; $41,100 per day on our Suezmax fleet; and $40,200 per day on our LR2/Aframax fleet. So far, in the first quarter of 2020 -- sorry, in the third quarter of 2022, we have booked 75% of our VLCC days at the solid $77,200 per day; 76% of our Suezmax days at $65,400 per day; and 70% of our LR2/Aframax days at a cool $58,000 per day. VLCC fitted -- eco VLCC fitted with scrubber will earn $24,200 per day compared to non-eco non-scrubber; the same relationship is at $13,500 per day for Suezmaxes; and $12,300 per day on the LR2s. We estimate average cash cost breakeven rates for the remainder of 2022 of approximately $25,000 per day for VLCCs; 20,200 per day for Suezmax tankers, and $17,200 per day for LR2 tankers, which with a fleet average estimate of $20,900 per day. The fleet average estimate includes start-up of two vessels, one VLCC and one LR2 tanker in the remainder of 2022, with an impact of about $380 per day. We reported OpEx expenses including dry dock in the third quarter of $8,800 per day for VLCCs, $7,500 per day for Suezmax tankers, and $8,900 per day for LR2 tankers. Based on historic Clarkson TCE rates for non-eco vessels in the period 2000 to year-to-date 2022, adjusted for premiums on scrubbers and eco vessels, Frontline has free cash flow per share of $2.37 and a free cash flow yield of 18%. And you can see this on the chart at the bottom left here where global crude oil exports is around or about 40 million barrels per day, but the yellow line, global oil in transit, is actually flirting with the levels we saw in Q1 2020 when Saudi and Russia were engaged in a crude oil price war. And if you look at the two kind of under the European import, two blue columns on the right, they amounted 1.3 million barrels per day."
