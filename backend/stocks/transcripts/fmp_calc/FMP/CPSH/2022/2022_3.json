In addition, I'm also glad to share with you that our team successfully qualified several new hermetic packaging products, with a key new Tier 1 customer, resulting in an initial production order valued at $1 million and future initial projections at 2x to 3x that starting in fiscal year '23 and continuing for years. I will say that our recent success in passing first article test and reverting to low rate initial production, with a key aerospace customer in Q3, we are demonstrating our business development and tech team's ability to identify and convert new material solutions."
