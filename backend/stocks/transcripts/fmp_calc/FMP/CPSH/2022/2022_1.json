    "content": " Revenues totaled $6.7 million in the first quarter of 2022 compared with $4.9 million generated in Q1 of 2021, an increase of 37%. Compensation costs made up a little over half of this increase, in particular increased accruals for variable compensation due to the better results in Q1 2022 as compared to Q1 2021, share-based compensation being postponed to Q2 in 2021 but done as usual in Q1 of 2022 and three additional members of our sales team that were hired subsequent to Q1 2021. A way out still but our past success in the luxury end of the EV market has a lot of synergies with the defense market and I'd like to highlight the link between military platform electrification and the importance of size, weight, power and cost, SWaP-C and how this aligns directly to CPS' core competencies and value proposition of reduced weight, superior properties and high reliability that directly contributes to the military's goals of high operational availability."
