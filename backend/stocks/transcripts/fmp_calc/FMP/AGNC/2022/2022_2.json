    "content": " This significant outperformance was due to three primary drivers: extremely strong dollar roll performance in the second quarter, higher asset yields as we shifted the portfolio up in coupon and our large pay fixed interest rate swap position, which as expected largely offset the increase in funding cost. Said another way, we are operating with lower leverage as you pointed out, but also a much more defensive portfolio position, which actually has the effect of using up more liquidity, in particular, our hedge ratio being so high at close to 125% has given us tremendous protection against short-term rate increases as evidenced in our earnings."
