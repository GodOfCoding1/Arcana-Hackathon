And then based on our own disclosures that we put out, we had at the beginning of the -- of this quarter, a duration gap like we announced in our prerelease of about a year given the fact that rates moved 20 basis points on five years and 40 on 10, so on average maybe 30 basis points, that would translate to about 3% hit to book value. Thank you for the question. And if you look at the performance of mortgages and you look at that graph that we show, I think it's clear to everybody when you look on Page 7, that mortgage spreads have gone in one direction only for the better part of the last 18 months, 65 basis points wider, if you will from August to now. Thank you for the question. Yes, thank you for the question. Yes, thank you for the question. Yes, thank you for the question. Thank you for the question."
