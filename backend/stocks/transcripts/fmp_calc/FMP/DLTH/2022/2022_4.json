    "content": " Turning back to the fourth quarter merchandise performance, our women's business grew 1% overall led by improvements in our new product expansions, the launch of AKHG in the spring of 2022 and overall improvement in our inventory position. Selling expenses as a percentage in net sales increased 10 basis points to 16.5% compared to 16.4% last year, and was the result of a slightly greater mix of store sales versus direct sales during the quarter. Advertising and marketing costs were $29.8 million in the quarter compared to $33.9 million last year, and as a percent of sales decreased 20 basis points to 12.3% compared to 12.5% last year. Our cash balance is down $31.5 million from last year end due to our decision to receive inventory in earlier before the end of the year and avoid the gap in seasonal transition receipts from last year's supply chain disruptions, plus an increase in our capital outlay for the new Southeast fulfillment center."
