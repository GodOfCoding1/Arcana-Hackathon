    "content": " Combined, our women's business increased to 31% of total sales in Q3, compared to 28% last year and has grown significantly up 35% since 2019. Men's AKHG also saw a healthy growth of mid-single-digits in the quarter, driven by new programs such as Blackburn and Crosslayer, which features pullovers, hoodies and vests and in Meltwater base layers, dramatically improved in-stock positions compared to last year helped drive increases in our Boar's Nest and cross-style collections which features sweatpants, sweatshirts and flannels. For the third quarter, we reported net sales of $147.1 million, up 1.3%, compared to $145.3 million last year and up 8.6%, compared to the same period in 2020. Selling expenses as a percentage of net sales increased 70 basis points to 17.1%, compared to 16.4% last year and was driven entirely by higher shipping cost on outbound customer shipments due to fuel surcharges and a greater mix of direct sales versus store sales during the quarter. Advertising and marketing costs were $19.6 million in the quarter, compared to $17.7 million last year and as a percentage of sales increased 110 basis points to 13.3%, compared to 12.2% last year. We expect our advertising and marketing costs will be below last year in the fourth quarter, but will it include a greater mix of digital media tactics up nearly $2 million focusing on new product arrivals and innovation. Our outlook for the full year of CapEx is reduced to $35 million reflecting the reprioritized technology initiatives, but continued investments in logistics automation, the expansion of our fulfillment network with the new facility in the Adairsville, Georgia, and retail store test and learn initiatives such as the women's footprint expansion that Sam discussed."
