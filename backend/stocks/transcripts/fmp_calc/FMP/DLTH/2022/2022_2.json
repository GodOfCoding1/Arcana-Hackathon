    "content": " Additionally, our cleaner inventory position this year weighed on the top line sales growth, with sales of clearance goods down roughly $13 million compared to the second quarter of last year. As a reminder, we ended our second quarter last year with inventory levels down 20% against the prior year, in which we missed sales in the second half due to these delays. Importantly, nearly 90% of the increase in inventory is made up of year round goods with our total inventory in a much better position and with an improved flow of new seasonal receipts we believe our better in stock positions will support overall sales growth. For the second quarter we reported net sales of 141.5 million down 5.1% compared to 149.1 million last year, and up 3% compared to the same period in 2020. Selling expenses as a percentage of net sales increased 100 basis points to 15% compared to 14% last year, driven by the higher hourly wage rates implemented across our store fleet and fulfillment center networks in the back half of 2021. Advertising and marketing costs as a percentage of net sales increased 210 basis points to 10.3% compared to 8.2% last year because of our increase in paid digital media advertising, as we continue to shift from traditional catalog marketing to brand and product messaging aimed at target customer audiences in the social and search platforms."
