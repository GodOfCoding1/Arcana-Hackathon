Looking more closely at procedures, 20% growth is up from 14% last quarter and above our three-year compound annual growth rate of 16% during the pandemic. Simultaneously, we saw headwinds from the strong U.S. dollar, lingering supply chain issues and inflation, which together negatively impacted pro forma operating margin by approximately 2 percentage points compared to the third quarter of last year. Using a three-year compound annual growth rate, third quarter utilization was consistent with historical averages, increasing almost 5%. As a result of our procedure and capital performance, Q3 revenue was $1.56 billion, an increase of 11% from the third quarter of 2021. Third quarter Ion procedures of approximately 6,400 increased 211% on a year-over-year basis. Third quarter 2022 pro forma net income was $429 million or $1.19 per share, compared with $435 million and also $1.19 per share for the third quarter of last year. Our overall third quarter 2022 procedure growth was 20%, compared to 20% for the third quarter of 2021 and 14% last quarter. In the U.S., third quarter 2022 procedures exceeded our expectations with growth at 18% year-over-year, compared to 16% for the third quarter of 2021 and 11% last quarter.
