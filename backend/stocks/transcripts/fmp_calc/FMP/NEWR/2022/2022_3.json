    "content": " The second real theme, and it's an important thing to understand about how we're shifting resources in the go forward year is we're shifting from a business in transition, where most of our go-to-market organization last year was focused on helping customers understand the new business model, migrate to it and embrace the full platform. And over the course of the year, we've seen steady improvement to the health of the business and if we exit as we've guided, we'll have added more than 75 million above the original guide and delivered on full year-over-year revenue growth of 17%. On the commitment side, if you think back to last year, we introduced a brand new platform, brand new pricing model and this new consumption business model to market customers, even those who've been with us for a while, didn't know how that would work, how that would play out how they might use the whole platform. So when we talk about expansion and reaching that 25% year-over-year growth rate, it is really based on mostly customers who have embraced the platform, upwards of a year or so that contributes the majority of revenue and revenue acceleration."
