    "content": " As a reminder, we entered FY '23 with four key priorities: first, return revenue to market growth rates; second, improve our non-GAAP gross margins to the mid-70s and achieve modest non-GAAP profitability exiting FY '23; third, accelerate the number of new paying customers; and fourth, drive increased platform adoption across our customer base. As I'll share in a moment, we are now looking to improve our full year bottom line from an adjusted non-GAAP loss of close to $50 million last year to modest non-GAAP profit this year, even as we continue to invest in the business to reaccelerate top line growth."
