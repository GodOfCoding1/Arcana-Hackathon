Revenue from Bumble App grew 31% to $694 million driven by paying user growth of 34% to 2 million, leading to more than 0.5 million net adds during the year. For Q1, we expect the following: total revenue between $238 million and $243 million, representing a growth rate of 15% year-over-year at the midpoint of our range. We expect Bumble App revenue to be between $190 million and $193 million, representing a growth rate of 24% year-over-year at the midpoint. And so there is still such a huge opportunity here to take this strong demand for love and connections, which -- that is incredibly durable in and of itself, but to really continuously optimize our already very unique product and just drive exceptional value with strong engagement growth and as you see record paying user additions, I think we offer a very compelling cost effective and really efficient alternative to the big spooky world of dating in the real world."
