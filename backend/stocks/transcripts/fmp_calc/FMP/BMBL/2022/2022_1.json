    "content": " Q1 revenue grew 38% year-over-year to $155 million, fueled by growth in both paying users and ARPPU. At a group level, paying users grew 7% to slightly over $3 million, and our people increased 14% to $22.76, primarily driven by mix shift towards Bumble App. Bumble App continues to perform well, with Q1 revenue growing 38% to $155 million. Revenue growth was driven by an increase in paying users, which was $1.8 million, up 31% year-over-year. We expect Bumble App revenue between $16 7 million and $169 million, representing a growth rate of 31% to 33%, supported by accelerating net adds. For Bumble App, we expect to be at our previous guide of 34% to 36%, which includes approximately $15 million of FX headwinds, $4 million higher than what we had originally estimated.
