    "content": " Bumble App continued its momentum in Q3, gaining download share in both core and international expansion markets while exceeding our expectations for both new user growth and reengaged users. Bumble App revenue grew to $181 million in Q3, up 28% year-over-year. Total Bumble Inc. revenue in Q3 was $233 million, up 17%, driven by growth in Bumble App. At a group level, revenue growth was driven primarily by growth in paying users which increased 15% to $3.3 million, while our people increased by 1%. Badoo App and other paying users declined 10% year-over-year to $1.2 million but grew sequentially by $106,000. Total revenue between $232 million and $237 million, representing a growth rate of 12% to 14% year-over-year. We expect Bumble App revenue to be between $184 million and $187 million, representing a growth rate of 23% to 25% year-over-year. Excluding FX headwinds, our guidance for Bumble revenue growth would be 29% to 31% year-over-year. This assumes $44 million of year-over-year FX headwinds and excluding the impact of FX and the Ukraine conflict, our guidance for total revenue growth would have been 26% year-over-year. I think the -- we have been -- we have a very unique marketing approach that is not something that you see in the industry, typically, a lot of focus on the micro and the brand elements of this, we've seen even in Q3 and Q2, a fairly considerable amount of competitive spend and we have continued to gain share without just by relying on our historical differentiated marketing product."
