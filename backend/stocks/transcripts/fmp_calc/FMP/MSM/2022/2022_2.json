    "content": " And we said we would achieve this by leveraging growth, by executing on gross margin initiatives and by delivering structural cost takeout of at least $100 million, helping to reduce OpEx as a percentage of sales by at least 200 basis points from our fiscal 2019 baseline. We\u2019re continuing to see strong execution and growth initiatives with vending, in-plant and mscdirect.com, each growing roughly 100 basis points or more as a percent of total company sales versus the prior year. As Erik mentioned, our fiscal Q2 gross margin was 42.5%, up 90 basis points sequentially from our first quarter and up 440 basis points from last year\u2019s fiscal Q2. Excluding this write-down, our prior year Q2 adjusted gross margin was 42%, 50 basis points below the current year\u2019s quarter. So what we\u2019ve shared, if you take government in total, that\u2019s federal plus state, and it\u2019s moved around a lot, particularly through the last two years during the pandemic but tends to run high single digits as a percent of total company sales. I mean, if you\u2019re thinking about how \u2013 about margins for the second half of the year, what I\u2019d share is, obviously, in second quarter, we took the price increase in late January, which is mid-to-high single digits. If we\u2019re thinking about this year, specifically with the annual operating margin framework, the mid-single-digit growth scenario, tough to see a path to above 12%."
