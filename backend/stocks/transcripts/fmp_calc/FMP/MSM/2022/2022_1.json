    "content": " It's worth noting that our fiscal quarter operating expenses include just over $5 million of expense add back from prior year COVID cost containment measures, as well as $2.5 million of vaccine incentive costs in the current year. It should be roughly aided that to the volume increase, COVID cost add backs of $5 million, vaccine incentive $2.5 million, the balance with some of the inflation we see happening because of things like freight, higher wage inflation that we've talked about before, and then getting the net favorable spread on Mission Critical and then general productivity initiatives kind of sprinkled in."
