    "content": " As Erik mentioned, our gross margin for the fiscal third quarter was 42.9% up 40 basis points sequentially from our second quarter and up 60 basis points from last year's fiscal Q3. With annual sales of roughly $60 million the business will be about 30 basis points diluted to our gross and operating margins in the fourth quarter, roughly neutral to EPS in fiscal 2022 and accretive to EPS thereafter. And to be able to do that, it basically means we're getting enough of a favorable spread from price cost that it offsets that mix headwind that we've kind of been seen in the business steadily over the past several years as some of our growth initiatives, which are margin headwinds as those continue to grow."
