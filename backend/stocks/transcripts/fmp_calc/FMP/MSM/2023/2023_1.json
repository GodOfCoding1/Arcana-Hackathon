    "content": " We expanded operating margins by 140 basis points over prior year or 100 basis points on an adjusted basis, driven by the continuation of our mission critical initiatives, which yielded additional savings of $6 million in the quarter. Our gross margin for the fiscal first quarter was 41.5%, down 10 basis points on a year-over-year basis and up 30 basis points organically driven by increased price more than offsetting product cost inflation. As a reminder, our fiscal 2022 fourth quarter acquisitions dilute operating margins by approximately 20 basis points in fiscal 2023, their first full-year with us. On my math, you saw about a 700 basis point contribution this quarter, presumably the range of expected contributions for the year would be significantly lower than that, just given the comps, but if there's any way you could frame what's reasonable for the full-year, that'd be helpful as well. Yes, in terms of our numbers and I'm pretty sure this is all sort of baked into what we gave as the guidance range at start of the year, we did anticipate that we would lap the very high pricing of prior year and that's going to happen during our fiscal second quarter in the next month or so here. Like if we think about, kind of metalworking inventory versus MRO, but I wouldn't give you a specific range at this point, but I'd definitely say if you think about the 100% operating cash flow conversion there's sort of a range of inventory contemplated within that that we feel confident in."
