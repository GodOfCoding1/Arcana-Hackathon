As compared to our February outlook for full year adjusted EBITDA of between $266 million and $297 million, some of the changes are the result of the deconsolidation of Marquee, timing of the D2C launch within the second quarter and slightly higher subscriber churn along -- with still high single-digit percent offset by the audit settlement benefit and slightly better ad revenues and expenses. Thank you very much. Thank you very much."
