    "content": " Media expenses were 7% higher in this year's second quarter versus last year on higher network programming fees, digital expenses on the higher digital revenue and timing of tennis tournaments, but were favorable to guidance with about half of the favorability related to timing with the expenses expected to be incurred in the back half of this year in part due to supply chain challenges and the other half the result of cost controls and open positions. Third quarter adjusted EBITDA is expected to be between $197 million and $215 million compared to $190 million pro forma last year, with the increase primarily the result of higher political revenue, partially offset by the management fee deferral, higher network programming fees, technology and infrastructure upgrades sales cost on the higher revenues, news content and NextGen initiatives."
