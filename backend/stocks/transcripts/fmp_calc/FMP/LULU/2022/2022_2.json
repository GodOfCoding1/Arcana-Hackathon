    "content": " Revenue increased 29% versus last year and 28% on a three-year CAGR basis, representing an acceleration from quarter one. Overall, momentum in our international business remains strong, with revenue increasing 35% versus last year and 40% on a three-year CAGR basis. Square footage increased 19% versus last year, driven by the addition of 66 net new stores since Q2 of 2021. Looking forward, on a one-year dollar basis, we expect the inventory growth rate at the end of Q3 to be slightly higher than the levels we saw at the end of Q2, before the growth rate moderates to 50% to 60% at the end of Q4. When looking at total revenue, our guidance implies a three-year CAGR of approximately 26%, which continues to be higher than our three-year revenue CAGR of 19% leading up to 2020 and higher than the target of approximately 15% growth we set forth in our new Power of Three x2 growth plan. And I think the first half of this year is really a consistent narrative of new category expansion, driving awareness through a number of earned media opportunities, as well as us continuing our investment in collective and community and reactivating some events, great product that's driving new guest acquisition and an existing guests that continues to be engaged in the expansion of both our core and play activities, be it golf, tennis, hike, those are resonating very well."
