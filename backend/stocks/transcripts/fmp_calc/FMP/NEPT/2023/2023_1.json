    "content": " We believe the results achieved in the first fiscal quarter of 2023 with sprout and Biodroga, both delivering a multi-year records for revenue demonstrates that our renewed focus on our core business areas are the best choice for Neptune going forward. We expect Sprout\u00e2\u0080\u0099s gross margins to increase to 22% by 2024, largely driven by four key drivers: One, the improvement of the distribution and warehousing costs as a result of the move to a full turnkey model as well as improved logistical cost management; Two, a full year price increase; Three, an improved product mix; and Four, the realization of certain volume discounts with the level of sales increasing. It's important to note, while the strong revenue was partly due to the timing related Q4 supply chain delays, it still would have been the best quarter for personal care and beauty in two years even removing the roughly $1 million timing benefit that shifted into Q1 from Q4. Moving onto our B2B personal care and beauty segment, which includes Biodroga and Forest Remedies, we were pleased to report sales of $5.1 million, our largest revenue quarter in over two years for personal care and beauty, up 70% compared to the same period year ago. These new initiatives as well as new product lines for existing customers, all translated to significant sales growth in the first fiscal quarter, which we expect to continue through fiscal 2023."
