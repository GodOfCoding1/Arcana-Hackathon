Last quarter, we announced the addition of a new display featuring the CoComelon co-branded product at 2,500 Walmart doors in August and September, which was a major contributor to an approximate 31% increase in net sales for the first half of this year versus the same time period during the prior year. Revenue for our second quarter totaled $12 million, a decrease of 4% from the same quarter last year despite the adverse impact on net sales of our existing the cannabis business. This improvement reflects that Q2 last year included the impact of a $3 million impairment to cannabis inventory as well as the effects of steps that were taken over the past year towards becoming a pure-play CPG company, which have translated into margin growth in organic foods and beverages, where our principal brand is Sprout. Q2 cannabis revenue was $55,000, a decline of $1.1 million as compared to the same period last year, while gross margin improved $420,000 to a loss of $780,000 versus a loss of $1.2 million in the same period last year. Year-to-date fiscal year '23, Neptune net sales of $28.3 million, up $5.7 million versus the same period last year, an increase of 25%. Excluding this year's cannabis -- this year's first quarter cannabis inventory impairment charge of $3.1 million, gross margin for fiscal year '23 year-to-date would have been a $1.3 million profit. Biodroga net sales year-to-date totaled $8.2 million, an increase of 13.7% compared to the same period last year, while gross margin of $2.0  million in Q2 was up from $1.9 million last year."
