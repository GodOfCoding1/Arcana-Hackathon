    "content": " Our first quarter fiscal year 2022 revenue amounted to $12.4 million, which increased 10% versus the comparable year ago period and increased 83% versus our fourth quarter fiscal year 2021 revenue of $6.8 million. These declines in gross profit and gross margin were primarily due to ramping up our new cannabis brands, Mood Ring and PanHash into 80% of the Canadian market, exiting the extraction business and Sprout integration. But Michael, just looking back at last year, $28 million, I believe that\u2019s USB right, so let\u2019s call it about $35 million Canadian for the quarter it looks like a run-rate about $28 million Canadian."
