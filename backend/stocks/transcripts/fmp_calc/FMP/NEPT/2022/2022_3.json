    "content": " Neptune reported third quarter revenue of $18.4 million, a sequential increase of 17% from our second quarter revenue of $15.7 million. The sequential improvement in revenue was driven primarily by our cannabis brands, which generated $4.4 million of revenue, a sequential increase of 190% versus Q2, and a new high watermark for us in cannabis. Sprout organics, our organic baby food brand generated revenue of $8.7 million, stable from the prior quarter of $8.9 million with the current quarter traditionally slow for seasonal reasons and impacted by timing of shipments and continuing supply chain challenges. Our nutraceutical brands also showed stable revenues of $4.9 million in the current quarter, versus $5.1 million in the prior quarter as we continue to manage supply chain challenges. Net loss attributable to Neptune for the quarter was $21 million, which decreased versus a net loss of $74.9 million in the comparable year-ago period."
