    "content": " During Q4, we continued to make significant strides in positioning our core business areas for continued growth including: one, Sprout Organics, our primary baby and toddler food brand; two, Biodroga, our B2B personal care and beauty brand. We expect gross margins at Sprouts to increase to 22% by 2024, mainly driven by four key items: one, improvement of the distribution and warehousing costs as a result of the movement to a full turnkey model as well as improved logistic cost management; two, the full year of price increase; three, improve product mix; four, the realization of certain volume discounts with the level of sales increasing. The divestiture of the cannabis division will achieve a 50% reduction in workforce over 30% reduction in total payroll costs and an estimated annual cost savings of $5.8 million, resulting in significant cost savings and improved operational efficiencies."
