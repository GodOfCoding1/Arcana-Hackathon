    "content": " Our adjusted EBITDA and our adjusted EPS performances were positively impacted by higher pricing in our core business, offsetting a considerable portion of our raw material cost for this quarter and the full year. And if I may, Rob, just to complement Stefan's point, I think, to your point, I think it's going to be something around between the quarter 4 and Q1 of the following year, but the intended effect is to see a smoothening down of the volume decline as the year-end and then gradually get back to normalization in 2024 and regaining momentum on the volume side at that time."
