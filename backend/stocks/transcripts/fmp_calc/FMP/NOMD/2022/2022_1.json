    "content": " I would even argue, if you don't mind, that as a private label, you're starting from a lower baseline in terms of price, but you're facing exactly in absolute terms the same kind of COGS increase, which means that in the relative terms, if you - if and when you're going to pass the COGS increase in relative terms, it's going to be a steeper increase. I would say, overall, when you take the total map, what we see effectively is a bit of a steady inflation impact across the quarter, more or less, if you have a bit of a ramp-up of gradually, I mean, coming from, let's say, the end of last year getting into this year. You will just - I mean, I'm sure that you're familiar with all of the food business, but an institution like us where you have effectively fish pool free and veg and so on, it's not necessarily in the best interest even of the supplier to really lock in an entire year. It's something that we knew from the start that we need to obviously read, let's say, improve the quality of the assets is something we're doing right now just in the last piece of it right now for this year. So we're starting to come back to a pre-COVID situations in terms of ice cream because this is obviously, let's say, out-of-home, imports was a bit on obviously has been, let's say, there were some issues during COVID. Some of them was a bit on the high end of the, let's say, single-digit, the other one we're really closer to the mid-single, but the average is probably around the mid-single from the least price execution standpoint, not after promotions least price. So from a general standpoint, if you want, as we generate cash, if you want, let's say, quarter-after-quarter, we're looking at effectively the best way to allocate this capital."
