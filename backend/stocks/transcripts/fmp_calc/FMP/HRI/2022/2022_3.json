    "content": " As you saw in our press release, based on third quarter results trend and our outlook for the rest of the year, we updated our 2022 guidance for adjusted EBITDA to 1.22 billion to 1.25 billion, which implies a 36% to 40% increase over our 2021 results. Adjusted EBITDA grew 40% over the prior year with an adjusted EBITDA margin up 160 basis points to 46.3% in the third quarter of 2022, driven by the growth of our rental business and focus on operating leverage. We disposed a $54 million of fleet at OEC in the recent quarter, only about $10 million more than last year's third quarter as we continue to be prudent in managing our fleet to meet strong customer demand and address supply chain constraints. All of this is manageable for Herc within the context of 36% growth in rental revenues, and as it's clear with our performance, we can invest in our business and in our people and continue to improve our adjusted EBITDA margin and investor returns. So, most of us coming from fleet growth that's been received steadily throughout the quarter and continues to come into Q4 as well as, sort of acquisition activity that was consummated during the year that builds into Q4. So that will start loosening up and towards the end of the year potentially, but I think we've got more growth into 2022 that sort of creates more CapEx into 2023 and that's, kind of our first look at this stage. And consequently, we've been able to work with our suppliers on their supply side and our demand side to get acceptable levels, although we still see delays of 30 to 60 to 90 days, but that won't change much throughout next year and we don't hear anything different from our suppliers other than that they're hopeful and I use the word hopeful in parentheses."
