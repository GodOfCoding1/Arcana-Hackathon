    "content": " Equipment rental revenue was $526.8 million in the first quarter, an increase of 32% or $126.4 million compared to the prior year. Our enhanced scale and focus on operating leverage improved year-over-year adjusted EBITDA margin 100 basis points to 41.7% in the first quarter of 2022, another record. Our ProSolutions business also continued to contribute double-digit growth year-over-year in the first quarter of 2022 as we continue to expand our market share in the rental of power generation, climate control, remediation, and pump equipment. As we said in our fourth quarter call, we had most of our 2022 equipment orders in early last year, so the inflationary impact to our 2022 orders should be modest, in the mid single-digit level As shortages, inflation, and labor costs impact the industry, we do anticipate that industry fleet costs will continue to rise in 2022, and next year. Please go ahead with your question. Please go ahead with your question. We've got mostly volume growth, and the cost increases if you sort of break them down, but there is cost pressure and inflation in lines like fuel, and maintenance, and wages that are impacting the expected flow-through for '22, still above 50% but less than our sort of long-range sort of target range of the sort of 60% to 70% range. Please go ahead with your question. Please go ahead with your question. Please go ahead with your question. Please go ahead with your question. I mean, I think you'll see the same cadence -- well, you will see the same cadence going through the quarters where SG&A as a percentage of rental revenues is the highest in Q1, as it is in any quarter of the year, it will reduce as a percentage of rental rates going through the year, just with -- as the revenues increase and you get more leverage off of that. Please go ahead with your question. Please go ahead with your question."
