    "content": " I point out on the initial page, the main financial indicators for our fourth quarter and full year of 2022, starting with net revenue, an emulation of 8% compared to the same period of the previous year, reaching more than BRL 14 billion in the fourth quarter and BRL 53.8 million in the year, more than 11% growth versus 2021. Next, we report an operating cash flow of more than BRL 1.3 billion is, 16% higher than the cash generation in the same period of the previous year, which once again put a sequential upward trend since the beginning of 2022. I would like to discuss some points related to Brazil, starting with volume, where we see a drop of 1% year-on-year in spite all of the gains in market share that we see in all categories of processed food."
