    "content": " With creators, in addition to focusing on marketing messages around the strong consumer signals we're seeing in market, help increase their confidence to sign up and publish new events, we also took action to increase their probability of success once on the platform specifically, around three areas. One, we accelerated the pace of Boost adoption, which puts the most critical marketing tools into the hands of our most active creators resulting in 63% more ticket sales for Boost-promoted events. We chose to focus on frequent creators for three reasons; their popular repeating events drive a disproportionately high share of ticket volume and revenue, they exist in every category, every format, and every geography, and winning this segment of the market builds our bedrock business among successful high LTV customers. With 100,000 new creators joining Eventbrite in Q3 alone, 98% of our creators coming through our self-sign-on channel, it's imperative that we continue to think about ways in which we can make it easier for those creators to get started. We have \u00e2\u0080\u0093 I think done a great job of focusing on the things that matter the most and making it very clear what our priorities are, which are to help frequent creators be more successful on the platform to help all creators drive demand for their events and to really strengthen the adoption of tools that help creators become more effective marketers and promoters of those events."
