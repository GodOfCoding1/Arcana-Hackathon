As we said, as new creators are coming on the platform, we're seeing if you look at the first 60 days, the first 90 days or first 120 days, the number of events that those new creators are having, or the number of ticket sales that they're bringing on is better than it's higher, they're being more successful than going back two, three, four years ago."
