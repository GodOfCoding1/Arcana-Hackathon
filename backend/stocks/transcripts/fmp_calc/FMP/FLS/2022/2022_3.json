    "content": " In addition to the $0.19 of ERP systems issues and corporate expense items that was disclosed in our September update, we also incurred other unexpected costs and headwinds in late September that further deteriorated our margins and earnings, such as higher-than-expected bad debt and under-absorption expenses as well as project true-up costs coming from inflation-related impacts in our highly engineered businesses. We capitalize on high activity levels and delivered third quarter bookings of $1.2 billion, which is the highest quarterly level since 2014, and it represents a year-over-year increase of 34%. With our success on Jafurah as well as a number of other large projects, both of original equipment bookings increased over 60% versus prior year to $680 million, which represents our highest OE bookings level since 2014. Despite the strong dollar, we generated $544 million in aftermarket bookings, which represents a year-over-year increase of almost 10% and over 16% on a constant currency basis. Near-term visibility supports our view of continued year-over-year bookings growth in the fourth quarter in both MRO and project work, and we expect to secure another quarter of over $1 billion in orders. Absent these items, our third quarter would have looked much more like our second quarter results, and it would have been even better had we not seen a pickup in bad debt expense as well as headwinds from an increase in estimates to complete certain projects. With another strong quarter of bookings, our backlog at September 30 was up 30% since year-end to $2.6 billion driven by a year-to-date book-to-bill ratio of 1.3. Despite the stronger dollars, the third quarter marked the fourth consecutive quarter with aftermarket bookings exceeding $500 million as operators continue to catch up on previously deferred maintenance and avoid costly unplanned downtime while still running their facility at high -- facilities at high utilization rates. The decline was driven by the third quarter-specific disruption in our highly profitable North American seals business due to the ERP system conversion, which resulted in roughly $5 million of unabsorbed costs and deferred an estimated $30 million in revenue and associated margins. Other contributors to the margin challenge included an approximate $2 million project write-down primarily on aged backlog; almost $3 million related to the effects of increased costs on our estimates to complete certain large projects; and higher freight costs, which were partially offset by a 200 basis point shift in mix to aftermarket and the impact of our price increases earlier in the year. Third quarter reported gross margins decreased 190 basis points to 27.4% due to the headwinds discussed earlier, partially offset by a $3 million decline in adjusted items. Third quarter SG&A increased $23 million to $224 million due to certain discrete items of roughly $18 million, primarily for incurred but not reported expenses related to our annual actuarial assessment, the non-cash lease accounting adjustment and the in-process R&D technology investment. On a reported basis, third quarter SG&A increased $20 million year-over-year, including the impact of the charges I just mentioned, partially offset by the reduction in adjusted items of $3 million. Third quarter adjusted operating margins decreased 460 basis points to 2.4% year-over-year due to FPD's decrease of 420 basis points, while FCD's adjusted operating margin was flat with the prior year at 10.5%. Based on the improved shipment levels and the $0.22 of items impacting the third quarter that are not anticipated to repeat in the fourth quarter, we expect to close the year with reported and adjusted EPS of at least $0.40, which would imply adjusted operating margins in the 8% to 10% range. The decline in expected margins is attributed to lower absorption in our engineered facilities due to the timing of large project bookings that we had anticipated occurring earlier in the third quarter, which would have allowed for more absorption, revenue recognition and associated margins in the fourth quarter."
