    "content": " After growing more than 500% year-over-year last quarter, North American revenue grew over 300% year-over-year to $6.2 million in the second quarter. Adjusted for fair value movements, adjusted operating expenses were $14.8 million, an increase of $7.6 million. On a constant currency basis, adjusted operating expenses increased by $8.4 million, a difference of $1.2 million. Net income totaled $0.05 million, which is an immaterial amount per diluted share, compared to net income of $2.4 million or $0.08 per diluted share in the prior year. Adjusted for fair value movements in contingent and preferred consideration, adjusted net income in the quarter was $3.1 million and adjusted earnings per share of $0.09 per diluted share. The quarter-on-quarter decrease of $1.9 million is primarily a result of the settlement of acquired working capital related to the Q1 acquisition of BonusFinder.com and payment for domain acquisitions acquired in previous quarters, which was partly offset by our operating cash flow. On a constant currency basis, adjusted operating expenses increased by $16.7 million, a difference of $1.3 million. We recorded net income of $4.5 million or $0.13 per diluted share, compared to $6.9 million or $0.22 per diluted share in 2021; adjusted net income of $7.6 million and adjusted earnings per diluted share of $0.21. Compared to a euro to USD rate of 1.15 implied in our initial guidance, revenue was negatively affected by $1.8 million and adjusted operating expenses were positively impacted by $1.5 million in the first six months. With all that being said and in spite of the adverse currency movements, we are reiterating our guidance for 2022 of revenue in the range of $71 million to $76 million, representing growth of 68% to 80%, and adjusted EBITDA between $22 million and $27 million, representing growth of 20% to 47%."
