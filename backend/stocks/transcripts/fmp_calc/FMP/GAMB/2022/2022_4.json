    "content": " Fourth quarter revenue rose to 107% to $21.3 million, reflecting a more than 300% increase in North American revenue and continued strength in the UK and Ireland with revenue growth of 54%. After growing almost 300% year-over-year in Q3, fourth quarter North American revenue grew 364% year-over-year to $10 million. We expect North America will continue to be our primary growth driver in 2023 and will represent a majority of Group's revenue for the full year, complemented by continued growth in our more mature markets outside North America. It is notable that, we achieved this growth more than 10 years, after we entered into regulated markets in Europe, which illustrates a key investment team we continue to highlight, that as online gambling markets mature, performance marketing affiliates are increasingly important to consumers in those markets and thus increasingly critical and valuable to operators. As Elias will highlight in his review of our guidance for the full year, we are not currently projecting any additional states to come online for either sports betting or iGaming over the balance of 2023 yet we have multiple levers to drive organic growth over the record 2022 levels. Turning to the financial results for the full year, revenue grew 81% to $76.5 million or by 103% in constant currency inclusive of $4.6 million impact from currency headwinds. We are issuing our 2023 guidance for revenue in the range of $93 million to $97 million, representing growth of 22% to 27%, and adjusted EBITDA between $32 million and $36 million, representing growth of 33% to 50%."
