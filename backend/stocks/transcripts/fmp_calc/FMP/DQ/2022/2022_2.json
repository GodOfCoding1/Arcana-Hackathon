    "content": " And for the next year we believe there is not too much new polysilicon come out as we see that, even though just like I said, some new player come in because of the design time, because of construction time, because of the technology, because of the increments, I think the made, design made and also installation, all these factors add together. So even though considering the polysilicon come out, the price I think jumped back last year, let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s say second half of last year, some new comer come in. We think you know the polysilicon price is possible linked to module price and we think \u00e2\u0080\u0093 I think in one year or more, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think the price will do down."
