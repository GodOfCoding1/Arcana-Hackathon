    "content": " I think right now -- I think in the first quarter, I think the China manufacturing in total, I think, around like 160,000 tons. So based on all of these, I think -- we think the next year, China, I think the meaningful supply, maybe around like -- I think 1.2 billion tons, I think that's next year. So basically, if we compare the first quarter cash cost level in RMB terms, I think it's still kind of close to RMB15 or RMB20 higher than our earlier kind of level kind of compared to when the industrial silicon price is still low. This industry anyway need more polysilicon and because the potential -- the end market right now demand is so hot if, let's say, by the year 2025, really, the market reach to 800 gigawatts, 500 gigawatts, we need -- 500 gigawatts, we need, I think, 1.5 million metric tons polysilicon."
