    "content": " Despite a more than 50% volume increase in polysilicon supply in the first three quarters of this year compared to the same period of last year, the profitability of polysilicon continued to improve, which was driven by stronger-than-expected solar PV demand and relatively faster capacity expansions in downstream sectors, particularly in the wafer segment. Revenues were $1.22 billion compared to $1,24 billion in the second quarter of 2022 and $586 million in the third quarter of 2021. Polysilicon sales volume was 33,126 metric ton in Q3 2022, compared to 37,545 metric ton in Q2 2022, despite a 11.8% decline in polysilicon sales volume when compared to the previous quarter, we achieved similar revenues supported by a 10% increase in polysilicon ASP.
