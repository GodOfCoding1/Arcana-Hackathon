    "content": " After everything settles, we anticipate about $2.5 million of additional quarterly G&A due to the additional personnel and various other G&A costs that come along with 50 additional vessels and a new regional office in Singapore. As we mentioned on the last call, we anticipated free cash flow in the first half of 2022 be weighed down by a significant drydock expense and vessel reactivations during the quarter, of which we spent $13.6 million during the first quarter. Vessels and lab costs of $1.4 million in the first quarter, down 23% quarter-over-quarter and down 75% year-over-year. Conversely, we\u2019ve seen that in the smaller PSV and AHTS segments, where we only have about 36% of the OSV fleet operating we are still leading the push in day rates and recent 8% to 18% day rate increases in regions like Mexico and the Middle East for those sizes of vessels. Our operating loss of $7.3 million for the quarter decreased by $19.7 million from Q4 due to the absence of the $13.5 million asset impairment and $1.4 million affiliate credit loss incurred in the fourth quarter, along with modestly higher revenue and lower vessel operating expenses. We expect the second to be another heavy drydock quarter with spend of around $21 million, including about $2 million of drydocks associated with the recently acquired Swire vessels. During the first quarter, we sold five vessels for proceeds of $4.6 million and transferred wood vessel back to the active fleet, leaving our vessels held for sale at 12 with a value of $8.6 million."
