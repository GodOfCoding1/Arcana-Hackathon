    "content": " Our energy segment saw a healthy increase as well, growing to $4.6 million in the second quarter of 2022 from approximately $1.3 million in the same period of the prior year. Looking at growth profit, you will see the increase in revenues between the second quarte, this year versus the same quarter last year translated to greater profits, particularly due to the high margins that Bitcoin mining brings. When comparing the Company's performance to the most recent quarter, gross profit decreased approximately $2.9 million to $29.5 million from approximately $32.4 million, representing a 9% decrease. As you will note, our gross margins contracted between the two sequential periods decreasing from 79% in the first quarter to 71% in the second quarter, which is directly attributable to the fluctuations in Bitcoin pricing. It's also worth noting that with the decrease in Bitcoin prices, the impairment expense was also lower in the current period, decreasing almost 90% from 6.2 million in the first quarter to 811,000 in the second quarter. Reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA to net income can be found in our earnings release and Form 8-K. You will see the theme of profitability continued as adjusted EBITDA was 22.5 million for Q2, an increase of more than 10 times over the second quarter from last year, which was approximately 1.9 million. Professional fees saw a decrease of almost 73% or 2.4 million between the periods, as a first quarter included significant expenses related to the preparation and filing the Company's Form 10-K and its first time compliance with certain provisions within the Sarbanes-Oxley Act."
