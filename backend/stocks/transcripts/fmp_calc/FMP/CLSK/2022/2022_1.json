    "content": " When comparing the company\u2019s performance compared to the most recent quarter, gross profit increased approximately $12.5 million to $32 million from approximately $20 million, representing a 63% increase. During the first fiscal quarter 2022, the company raised almost $6 million to $8 million in equity proceeds, most of which was used for growth CapEx and purchase of Bitcoin miners. And I want to point out that this $117 million is already paid for using proceeds previously raised through conversion of Bitcoin and issuance of equity, the remaining cash commitment for the deliveries is just shy of $40 million and we expect to make these payments and take delivery monthly through October of this year."
