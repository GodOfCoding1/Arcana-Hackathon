    "content": " Additionally, as I've mentioned in previous quarters, our stock-based compensation was expected to come down as this number was relatively flat compared to the stock-based compensation expense in Q1 of last year and decreased from $14 million in the immediately preceding fourth quarter. But right now, we're really managing on a day-to-day basis because Zach sees a lot of deal inflow, whether it's infrastructure or bitcoin miners that are available on the market. And then lastly, it's making sure we're pulling every single string we can on the technology side to be in the right position because I think from a competitive landscape, there's going to be a lot of hashrate that drops off when it occurs for the low performing or the least efficient miners. But really looking and having if bitcoin is not at, call it, close to $40,000, we think that there's going to be a lot of smaller miners and potentially private miners that can't access the capital markets."
