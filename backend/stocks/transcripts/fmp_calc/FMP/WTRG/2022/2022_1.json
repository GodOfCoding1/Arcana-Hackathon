    "content": " The largest contributors to the increase in revenues for the quarter were the recovery of higher purchased gas costs and additional revenues from rates and surcharges, increased gas volumes and water and wastewater customer growth. Rates and surcharges, increased gas volumes due to colder weather and customer growth and volume from our regulated water segment provided an additional $23 million towards the revenue increase which was offset by $2.8 million of other items. As a reminder, the chart on the right shows how residential natural gas consumption in Pennsylvania was distributed throughout 2021 noting that just over 80% of the gas was consumed during the heating season, meaning the first and fourth quarters of the year with the largest portion of gas being sold in the first quarter. Looking at operations and maintenance expenses for the first quarter, expenses increased 14% to $142.6 million, compared to $125.1 million for the same period in 2021. But as we've explained before and noted on the heat integrated day slide, the seasonality of the natural gas segment earnings -- the seasonality, I should say, it shifts earnings to the first and fourth quarters as a result of winter weather. I don't want to say \u2013 I should be careful in my terminology but certainly as I said, if we look across the whole of the O&M waterfall there, if we remove the onetime expenses and we remove the customer assistance program increase, we would get to about a 3.5% year-over-year increase higher than normal, higher than we think about our 2% to 2.5%, 3% type of range."
