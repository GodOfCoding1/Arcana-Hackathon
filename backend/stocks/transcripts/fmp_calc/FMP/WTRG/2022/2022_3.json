    "content": " And in addition to delivering annual earnings growth in-line with our guidance and raising our annualized dividend, Slide 8 here demonstrates that we've grown the rate base and customer-base of the company from nearly $3.5 billion and 958,000 customers to approximately $9.5 billion and 1.8 million customers over that time. Increased volumes and growth from our regulated water segment contributed an additional $15.7 million and other provided $3.4 million towards the revenue increase, which was offset slightly by reduced volumes from our regulated natural gas segment. If we subtract off the one-time incentive compensation that I mentioned, as well as the O&M costs related to growth and the increase in the customer assistance program costs, we get to about $6 million or just over a 4% increase year-on-year. Beginning on the left side of the slide, GAAP EPS for the third-quarter of 2021 was $0.19, rates and surcharges contributed $0.074 and increased volume and growth from our regulated water segment combined added another $0.04."
