    "content": " Our focus on operational efficiency and infrastructure improvement and service-related priorities led us to another strong year, reporting earnings per share of $1.77, which is 6% better than last year and the mid-point of our 2022 guidance. Higher natural gas commodity prices continued through the fourth quarter, and therefore, purchased gas costs increased by $109.4 million year-over-year. Operating income was up 9.7% to 661.2 million, and year-over-year net income increased 33.6 million or 7.8% from 431.6 million to 465.2 million, and GAAP EPS increased 6% to $1.77, which was in the middle of our $1.75 to $1.80 guidance range for the year. In 2022, we completed rate cases or surcharge filings in our regulated water segment in , North Carolina, Ohio, and Pennsylvania, and we completed a rate case in our regulated natural gas segment in Kentucky, for a combined total annualized revenue increase of approximately $88.8 million. We're confident in the three-year earnings per share growth of 5% to 7% through 2025, and we'll be investing approximately  on regulated infrastructure, which is an increase of about $100 million annually over last year's plan."
