    "content": " Turning to deliveries, our closings declined by 1% from a year ago, primarily due to the impact of Hurricane Ian in our Florida markets during the last 10 days of the quarter where we saw approximately 75 delivery shift from the end of the third quarter to the fourth quarter. However, given the decline in market conditions that I discussed earlier, new contracts for the third quarter in the Southern region decreased by 26% and decreased by 40% in the Northern region. Specifically we ended the quarter with record shareholders equity of $1.9 billion, an increase of 26% over last year, a book value of $71 a share, cash of $68 million and zero borrowings under our $550 million unsecured revolving credit facility. Revenue increased 12% in the third quarter, reaching a third quarter record, $1 billion. Our average closing price for the third quarter was an all-time record $487,000, a 13% increase compared to last year\u00e2\u0080\u0099s third quarter average closing price to $430,000. Our earnings per diluted share for the quarter increased to $4.67 per share from $3.03 per share last year, up 54%. We spent $15 million on share buybacks in the third quarter and during the first nine months of this year, we repurchased 1.2 million of our outstanding shares for $55 million, which leaves $93 million available under our current repurchase authorization. And in the last five quarters, we have spent $107 million buying stock back repurchasing 7% of our outstanding shares. Revenue decreased 3% from last year to $20.1 million due to a lower volume of loans closed and sold, and we continue to experience lower pricing margins due to competition for purchase business."
