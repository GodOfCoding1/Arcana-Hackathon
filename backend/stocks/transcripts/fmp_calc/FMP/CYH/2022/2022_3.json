    "content": " In the third quarter, same-store admissions were down 2.2% on a year-over-year basis reflecting a lower COVID impact as well as continued migration of certain surgical and cardiac procedures through outpatient status. So, we would expect our fourth quarter results from a contract labor expense to continue to trend in the same direction, albeit probably not reduced as much as the 33% reduction we saw sequentially in Q3, but we would still expect Q4 contract labor to be lower than Q4. And then on cash flow, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve done just say about $300 million of operating cash flow year-to-date on a $1.06 billion, EBITDA baseline, including cares, but you maintain your cash flow guide that would suggest also a pretty sizeable step up and cash conversion in four quarter. If you think about the progress we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve made already coming down from $240 million in the first half of the year, $100 million in the third quarter and continued reduction that we expect in the fourth quarter."
