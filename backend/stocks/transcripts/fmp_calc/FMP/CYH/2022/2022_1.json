    "content": " Although we anticipate contract labor to remain elevated and to cause some near-term headwinds on our progress, our contract labor usage and rates are declining in April and we expect this to continue to decline throughout the remainder of the year due to lower COVID case counts coupled with a number of the internal initiatives that Tim walked through earlier. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. As we continue to kind of focus as we said our balanced approach of organic growth in our markets, capital investments in our markets and margin improvement program, we believe in the longer term, we'll be able to step over some of these labor issues and the increased rates that we're seeing both in employed labor and contract labor. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open."
