    "content": " Several factors came into play in Q2, resulting in our adjusted EBITDA decline, the most pronounced being lower than forecasted net revenue, continued pressure on the SWB line and contract labor expenses, which improved sequentially and remained well over prior year. In terms of net revenue, the decline was due to lower-than-forecasted volumes in a post-COVID surge quarter based upon past history, and lower net revenue per adjusted admission than anticipated due to the continued site-of-care shifts, payor mix and generally lower acuity of our medical ignitions. Still contract labor remains at very elevated levels versus prior year without the higher acuity inpatient revenues previously seen in the COVID pandemic, which partially offset its EBITDA impact. However, on a year-over-year basis these two markets, which have historically had lower than company average EBITDA margins accounted for 20% of the total company EBITDA decline during the second quarter. As Tim mentioned, our second quarter results came in well below our expectations, as lower than anticipated volume and net revenue per adjusted admission impacted the top line. During the second quarter of 2022, contract labor was approximately $150 million compared to $50 million in the prior year quarter. Looking out longer term, we believe the stronger return of deferred care, the execution of our growth and strategic initiatives, our successful expense management and continued focus on cash flow and capital structure management will allow the company to achieve its medium-term financial goals, which includes targets for 16%-plus EBITDA margin, positive annual free cash flow generation and reducing our leverage below five times."
