    "content": " These planned exits are expected to reduce top line revenue However, are expected to also reduce the rent, tenancy, and building operating expenses and once fully implemented are expected to contribute approximately $140 million of annual adjusted EBITDA. At our budget foreign exchange rates, revenue will be 868 million this quarter, up 33% year-over-year versus consensus of 865 million. Turning to guidance, we expect fourth quarter revenue to be 870 million to 890 million, adjusted EBITDA to be negative 65 million to negative 85 million, and adjusted EBITDA accounting for our ownership stakes of consolidated and unconsolidated operations, which is defined as adjusted EBITDA attributable to WeWork to be negative 55 million to negative 75 million. As we mentioned, excluding that impact, total revenue would have been $868 million for the quarter and up 33% year-over-year. Next, our adjusted EBITDA loss in the third quarter was $105 million, a $29 million sequential improvement from the second quarter and over a $250 million improvement versus last year, driven by higher revenue and lower overall expenses. So, you're sitting at roughly 500 million in cash, you still have some cash burn from here on till this, and I think in the past, you've mentioned when the portfolio is at 74%, 75%, you actually start to generate \u00e2\u0080\u0093 you are at least break-even on EBITDA."
