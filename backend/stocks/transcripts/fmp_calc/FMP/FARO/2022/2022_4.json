    "content": " Our fourth quarter demand continued to improve throughout the quarter, which enabled reported revenue to grow 27% sequentially and 8% year-over-year to approximately $100 million despite a strong dollar exchange rate and supply chain challenges, which muted our overall revenue level for the quarter. Illustrating the potential for this solution, in the fourth quarter, we signed a mid-6-figure annual recurring revenue deal with one of the world's largest retailers who is deploying HoloBuilder across all U.S. stores as a part of a new space management initiative. Turning to the fourth quarter, revenue of $100.2 million grew 8% when compared to the fourth quarter of 2020, as a result of continuing market demand improvement compared to last year's market softness caused by the pandemic. operating income was $3.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2021 compared with an operating income of $2.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2020, primarily due to fourth quarter 2021 revenue growth. read between the lines, there's a little bit included in the fourth of the -- there's a reasonable amount of it also included in the fourth quarter, and it's more meant to help guide you relative to that 55% to 60% range because that did not include any of that material headwind. We are pleased -- just to finish your -- we are pleased with Quantum Max and I do believe that because of the value that it brings compared to what's available in the market we've seen -- actually, as we said, I think in our script we were -- it exceeded our expectations, which was fantastic."
