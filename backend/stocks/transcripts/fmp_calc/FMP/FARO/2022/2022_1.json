    "content": " First quarter revenue of $76.7 million was approximately equal to the first quarter of 2021, primarily driven by increased demand for our Quantum Max ScanArm, offset by impacts from the Shanghai lockdown and ongoing supply chain shortages Michael mentioned earlier, as well as the nearly 3% currency headwind that resulted from continued U.S. dollar strengthening. But I think that, by and large, we would expect to be towards the lower end of the 55% to 60% as we commented, as well as we can dip below it, depending upon where revenue is just like we just reported, right, with just almost 54%, but revenue at about $77 million."
