    "content": " In summary, I'm very pleased with the VONJO's launch progress and growth in the third quarter when we recorded $18.2 million in net revenue, a reflection of the clear unmet need that exists for cytopenic MF, our customers' excitement for VONJO's differentiated clinical profile and our team's strong execution in the field. VONJO's role as a potent ACVR1 inhibitor and its clinical benefits on anemia continues to be studied, and we look forward to presenting new data in oral presentation at ASH next month. Where we're getting the majority of our patients at the moment, as Jim said, it's a very important area of growth for us, is in the second line setting because they're prevalent patients and there continues to be a very high degree of dissatisfaction with ruxolitinib, particularly low dose ruxolitinib."
