    "content": " This approval was based on the Phase III PERSIST-2 trial, a study that enrolled myelofibrosis patients with platelet counts less than or equal to 100 times 10 to 9 per liter, making it the only randomized controlled study specifically designed to recruit the cytopenic myelofibrosis population, that is patients with thrombocytopenia and anemia. In addition, we were recently pleased to announce that VONJO is now included as a recommended treatment in the latest National Comprehensive Cancer Network or NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology for Myeloproliferative Neoplasms, increasing the treatment options for patients. Initial utilization of VONJO has been both as first-line and second-line therapy in patients with platelet counts less than 50,000 as well as spontaneously in patients with platelet counts above 50,000. While early adoption has been robust in the academic accounts, I'm particularly pleased to report that the uptick in the community setting has been higher than we expected potentially driven by the level of dissatisfaction to the suboptimal therapy of low-dose ruxolitinib and the potential to optimally treat cytopenic patients with an effective full dose of VONJO. In conclusion, I firmly believe VONJO will continue to make a meaningful difference in the lives of patients with cytopenic myelofibrosis who have platelet counts below 50,000 in the coming months and years ahead. And within that, as I said, we have guide -- there are recommendations that allow for patients -- well, that recommend patients VONJO therapy in patients with platelet count less -- greater than 50,000. But to have one dose they can use at the full dose, 3 patients who have cytopenic myelofibrosis who have a worse prognosis by the fact that they've got low counts is -- has been such a big compromise to them all these years."
