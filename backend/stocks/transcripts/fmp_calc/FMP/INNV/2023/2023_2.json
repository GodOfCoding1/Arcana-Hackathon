    "content": " For the second quarter, we reported center level contribution margin of 22.6 million, and a corresponding center level contribution margin ratio of 13.5%, compared to first quarter fiscal year 2023 center level contribution margin of 21.4 million, an increase of $1.2 million. Revenue declined by 2.2%, compared to the first quarter of fiscal year 2023, primarily due to a decrease in member month associated with the sanctions, coupled with a decrease in Medicare Part D revenue commensurate with pharmacy rebates received during the quarter. External provider costs were $93.5 million, a 2.7% increase, compared to the second quarter of fiscal year 2022. Our cost of care, excluding depreciation and amortization of $51.4 million was 19.7% higher than the second quarter of fiscal year 2022. Center level contribution margin, which we define as total revenue less external provider costs and cost of care, excluding depreciation and amortization was $22.6 million for the second quarter, compared to $41.4 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2022 and $21.4 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2023. As a percentage of revenue, center level contribution margin for the first quarter was 13.5%, compared to 23.6% in the second quarter of fiscal 2022, and increased from 12.5% in the first quarter of fiscal 2023. Adjusted EBITDA, which we calculate by adding interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, one-time adjustments for transaction and offering related costs and other non-recurring or exceptional costs to net income was a negative $2 million, compared to $14.8 million in the second quarter of fiscal year 2022 and negative $3.8 million in the first quarter of fiscal year 2023."
