    "content": " This represents an increase of approximately 7.2% compared to the first quarter of fiscal year 2021, when including Sacramento census, which was not consolidated in the first quarter of fiscal 2021. We reported strong first quarter revenue of approximately $173 million, an increase of nearly 13.5% compared to the previous fiscal year as a result of census growth and an increase in rates. Compared to the prior year period, when including Sacramento census, which was not consolidated in the fiscal first quarter of 2021, this represents an ending census increase of approximately 7.2%. We reported over 20,900 member months for the first quarter, a 7.8% increase over the prior year when including Sacramento census in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 and an increase of over 2.5% over the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021. Revenue of $173.1 million in the first quarter of fiscal year 2022, increased by 13.4% compared to the first quarter of fiscal year 2021. External provider costs in the first quarter were $90 million, a 22.2% increase compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2021. Compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, external provider costs increased 5.8% primarily due to higher housing costs associated with an annual increase in rates in Colorado and Virginia, coupled with an increase in housing utilization. Our cost of care, excluding depreciation and amortization, was $40.7 million for the first quarter, a 6.4% increase over the first quarter of fiscal year 2021, driven by an increase in census, and a 5.8% increase over the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, primarily due to an increase in cost per employee associated with annual merit and market increases coupled with an increase in overtime, contract, services, and temp labor. Center-level contribution margin, which we define as total revenue less external provider costs and cost of care excluding depreciation and amortization, was $42.3 million for the first quarter, compared to $48 million in the previous quarter, and $40.6 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2021. As a percentage of revenue, center-level contribution margin for the quarter was 24.5%, compared to 28% in the previous quarter, and 26.7% in the first quarter of fiscal 2021. While the normalization of medical costs that we are seeing began in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, our center-level contribution margin in that period benefited from a revenue adjustment due to risk score and Part D bid true-ups and a rate estimate adjustment, and slightly lower cost of care due to gradual reopening of centers, which are the key drivers of the quarter-over-quarter decline in center-level contribution margin as a percent of revenue. Sales and marketing expense for the first quarter was $6.3 million, an increase of $2.2 million compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2021, primarily due to an increase in headcount to support growth and costs associated with new advertising campaigns to raise PACE awareness. Corporate, general, and administrative expense for the first quarter was $21.1 million, a decrease of $50.5 million compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2021, primarily due to $58.5 million in fees incurred as a result of the APAC transaction in fiscal 2021. Adjusted EBITDA, which we calculate by adding interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization and one-time adjustments for transaction and offering-related costs and other nonrecurring or exceptional costs to net income, was $18.2 million for the first quarter, a 5.7% decrease quarter-over-quarter, and a 21.2% decrease year-over-year. The year-over-year change in adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin is a reflection of three primary dynamics: one, as discussed earlier on the call, the impact of medical cost normalization on center-level contribution margin as COVID transmission declines; two, higher sales and marketing expense as a result of our investment in digital marketing and other sales initiatives; and three, higher corporate, general and administrative expenses, partially as a result of the costs associated with being a publicly traded company. The quarter-over-quarter change in adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin is primarily a function of, one, the revenue adjustments recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021; two, increased housing utilization, coupled with higher cost of care, as mentioned previously; and three, partially offset by a reduction SG&A as compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021."
