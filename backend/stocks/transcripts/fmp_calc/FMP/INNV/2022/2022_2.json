    "content": " As a result of this new wave, we\u2019re seeing and anticipate seeing elevated participant cost trends, specifically inpatient, medical and social respite costs related to skilled nursing facilities are increasing due to higher morbidity resulting from COVID. Similar to my comments last quarter, while some of this variance is due to census growth, we continue to experience higher per participant cost in three areas: one, outpatient and specialist care as participants catch up on services that were delayed as a result of the pandemic; two, increased inpatient and respite utilization as a result of the Omicron surge; and three, increased housing rates as mandated by certain states."
