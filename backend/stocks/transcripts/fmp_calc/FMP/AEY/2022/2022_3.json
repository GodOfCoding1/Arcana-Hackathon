    "content": " This was another record quarter for us with positive net income of $875,000 and a 63% increase in revenue compared to last year, and 17% over the previous quarter. To put our improved financial performance into context through nine months of fiscal 2022, we have surpassed revenue for all 12 months of fiscal 2021 by more than $8 million or about 13%. Our Telco segment had a great quarter and while the global supply chain and chipsets issues were the original catalyst for the growth in our Nave and Triton businesses, the revenues and margin growth primarily have been caused by a pivot and focus by the new leaders of those business units, more heavily towards the optical transport switch router and enterprise network offerings to the optical fiber network providers. Consolidated sales increased $10.8 million or 63% to $27.8 million for the third fiscal quarter, up from $17 million for the three months ended June 30 2021. The increase was due to an increase in the Telco segment of $3.1 million and $743,000 increase in gross profit from the wireless segment, due to both increased revenues and stronger margins. Consolidated selling, general and administrative expenses include overhead which consists of personnel, insurance, professional services, communication and other cost categories increased $550,000 or 16% to $4.1 million for the three months ended June 30, 2022 up from $3.6 million for the same period. Net income for the quarter was $875,000 or $0.07 per diluted share based on 13.2 million shares compared with a net loss of $2.1 million or a loss of $0.17 per diluted share on 0.5 million shares for the same quarter last year."
