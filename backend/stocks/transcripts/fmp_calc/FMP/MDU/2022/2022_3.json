    "content": " Our construction businesses, both reported all-time record quarterly revenues and combined record third quarter backlog, now standing at $2.9 billion, which is up over 50% from the same time a year ago. The company also reported a record third quarter backlog of $895 million, up 37% from the same time last year, and expects to complete an estimated 92% of the backlog, on record, within the following 12 months. So I think it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a little early to hypothesize, I guess, maybe where things would end up after the fact, but just want to be focused on the fact that we really are seeing Knife River as a stand-alone pure-play materials company, and the future state for MDU Resources will be a stand-alone pure-play regulated energy delivery company."
