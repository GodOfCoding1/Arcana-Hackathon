    "content": " Construction Services ended the quarter with all-time record backlog now standing at $1.92 billion, and that's up 46% from the prior year, and we have numerous projects underway across all of our markets, which are expected to contribute to our 2022 results. As mentioned previously, we are well positioned that our construction companies to benefit from the infrastructure investments and Jobs Act and also at our construction services and electric utility from the recently announced approval of MISO's $10.3 billion of investments in the Midwest subregion. Knife River will also remain headquartered in Bismarck, since its first acquisition going back 30 years to 1992, Knife River has grown into a leading vertically integrated aggregates producer that will continue providing construction materials and contracting services throughout the Western, Central and Southern United States. It looks like $0.25 EPS reduction at the midpoint outside of the nonqualified benefit plans, could you quantify what the weather impact was to the construction businesses year-to-date or what's embedded in that full year guidance reduction?"
