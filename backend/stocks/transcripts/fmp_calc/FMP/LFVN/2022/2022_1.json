    "content": " The program was very well received by the distributors who attended our global convention and we are confident that it\u2019s the right level of engagement and aligns our work better with distributor base, allowing them to focus on consumer acquisition, while we support them with a stronger presence on consumer retention. Well, our products, we think are competitively priced right now but if we feel a lot of pressure on our margins and you saw we were down about 500 basis points -- 50 basis points in our margins last quarter, if we continue to see that margin pressure, we\u2019ll look at it but right now, we think we can manage it through just our cost management."
