    "content": " It is a longer term build around kind of the right principles and behaviors that we want our distributors to be focusing on and I mentioned, just in the one month that we've had, we had a 37% growth in the achievement of a goal associated with that and so again, cautiously optimistic, but that those behaviors that we're now reinforcing around distributor enrolments and retention are helping to turn this tide in terms of both the distributor and then ultimately, the customers will come. It's what our distributors, we have a very highly educated distributor force with a lot of people from the medical profession, and that's what they rely on as they talk to potential distributors and customers around the science behind that, and much of the technology that is built into Protandim also exists in other products that we provide in including our skincare line. Yeah, Ron, this is Steve, and I appreciate your question and wondering if you might want a job at LifeVantage thinking through the revenue growth strategy, because we've spent a lot of time and I couldn't agree more with you that, well, first and foremost, revenue growth is what's ultimately going to drive the best long term shareholder value. Two, the initiatives that we have in place are focused absolutely a 100% on those areas of growth and your comment around focusing and these are maybe my words, not yours, but, on those distributors earlier in their journey to incentivize, motivate, inspire them to understand the opportunity that they have to participate both from a product standpoint and a business opportunity is very high on our list of priorities, accelerating and bringing people in earlier to understand just the magnitude of this opportunity and getting them excited about that is where a lot of our focus and attention is."
