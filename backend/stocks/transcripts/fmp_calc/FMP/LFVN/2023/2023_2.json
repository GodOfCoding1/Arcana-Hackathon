    "content": " Second quarter revenue of $53.7 million was up 2.8%, our first year-over-year increase in 10 quarters. Customer acquisition similarly benefited from our liquid collagen product, which accounted for approximately $9.1 million or approximately 17% of Q2 revenues. Second quarter revenue was $53.7 million, up 2.8% on a year-over-year basis and up 3.6% sequentially from the first quarter. Excluding the negative impact of foreign currency fluctuations, second quarter revenue was up $3.9 million or approximately 7.4% compared to the prior year period. Revenue in the Americas region increased 14.4%, including a 15.4% increase in the United States, compared to the prior year period to $39.7 million, driven primarily by the launch of our TrueScience Liquid Collagen product and partially offset by a 7.1% decline in total active accounts in the region. Revenue in our Asia-Pacific and Europe region decreased 20.2% to $14 million, driven by a 12% decrease in total active accounts and negative impacts from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Adjusted net loss was $0.8 million, or $0.07 per fully diluted share, in the second quarter, compared to adjusted net income of $0.6 million, or $0.05 per fully diluted share, in the comparable period last year. Adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter was $0.8 million, or 1.5% of revenues, compared to $1.9 million and 3.6% in the same period a year ago."
