    "content": " While the operating environment remains challenging, we are seeing positive signs in several areas, including our U.S. business, where revenue was up 1.1% versus the prior year period as a decline in the number of customers was more than offset by higher average revenue per account due to strong results from new product launches. Revenue in our APAC Europe region increased over 7% versus a year ago, excluding the impact of currency fluctuation reflecting an 18.2% increase in the number of active independent distributors in this region, in part driven by continued momentum from our recent launch in the Philippines. This launch has also allowed us to introduce the Protandim Tri-Synergizer in these markets, which has been a top-performing product stack in the U.S. We are encouraged by a 28.9% penetration rate of NAD amongst distributors in Japan since its launch in mid-September through October 31, and look forward to continued results in the coming months. First quarter revenue was $51.8 million, down 2.7% on a year-over-year basis, and up 1.6% sequentially from the fourth quarter. Excluding the negative impact of foreign currency fluctuations, first quarter revenue was up $1.2 million or approximately 2.3% compared to the prior year period."
