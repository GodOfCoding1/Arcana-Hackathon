    "content": " We delivered record top line revenue in the third quarter of $67.3 million, which is up 5% compared to Q3 of last year. So cross-selling, better account management, organic growth, levers between applications that show more kind of benefit to customers, are all examples of why those -- we have those objectives, which would show higher growth rates and say we've been able to deliver through parts of the pandemic, and in the first half of this last year. But one chart, I would probably point you to in the Investor Day's slide deck where you get a sense of what our remaining performance obligations are, you can see kind of how that behave over the past four to five years and get a sense of how much revenue if you're looking for visibility or kind of what's currently under contract, that might give you another indicator. So I mean, you would expect us to have those programs we do, I'd say we're getting more expensive, more focused on it and more experienced in managing software development pipelines and making sure our cap allocation, which turns into cap our software costs, we can really get good leverage out of them in the future, and making sure we're putting money into the right products at the right ratio."
