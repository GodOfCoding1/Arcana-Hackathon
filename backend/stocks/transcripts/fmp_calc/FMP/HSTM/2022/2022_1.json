    "content": " As you look out over the next couple of years, do you feel like you have the right pieces in place, at least from a platform perspective, where M&A maybe isn\u2019t going to be play as big of a role in kind of building out some of these areas, or as you look out over the next couple of years and given the balance sheet and the strong cash flow that you\u2019re going to continue to kind of find those tuck-in opportunities to kind of build out some of your platforms a little bit broader. And so that\u2019s a way of coming back around and saying, well, I think this is all a tailwind for us because at the end of the day, you have to get staff -- even staff that\u2019s going to turnover faster, you have to get them competent quicker, like it\u2019s not an excuse sale, I won\u2019t invest and train them because if they are only going to be there nine months, you better make them an effective team member in two months, instead of six months."
