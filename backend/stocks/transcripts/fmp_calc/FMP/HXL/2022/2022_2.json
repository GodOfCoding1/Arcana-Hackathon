    "content": " With almost 50% growth in our Commercial Aerospace sales year-over-year, we are confident that the pull for lightweight advanced composites for next-generation aircraft is strong where older muddle aircraft remain parked and backlogs continue to grow for lighter, more fuel-efficient and aerodynamic aircraft that are content rich with our innovative technology. Second quarter Commercial Aerospace sales of $227.6 million increased 49.5%, compared to the second quarter of 2021 with strong growth in narrowbodies, the A350 program and business jets. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. But I think we're getting to sort of a steady-state mix now, and it's really top line growth that's going to continue to give us the leverage over the overhead to drive double-digit margins this year and then increase as we go forward. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open."
