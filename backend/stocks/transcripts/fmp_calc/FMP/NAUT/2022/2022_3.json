    "content": " On this call, we'll share our results for the third quarter of 2022 and provide some insight on the expected value of our platform, our progress towards commercialization and a quick observation on the market landscape, but first, I want to thank our growing teams in the Bay Area and Seattle for their focus on short-term development milestones and longer-term commercialization goals. For example, our patents and patent applications are directed to our platform, assay and protein identification processes and methods; our proprietary probes; our proteome scale protein arrays, including our proprietary chemistry and biochemistry for building those arrays; our sample preparation methods; key components of our instruments and consumables; and  and processes for applying proteome-level data to critical research questions."
