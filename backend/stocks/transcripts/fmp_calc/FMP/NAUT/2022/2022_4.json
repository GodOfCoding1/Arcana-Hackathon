    "content": " Conversations at HUPO and many others throughout the year, the strong submissions to our first access challenge and the enthusiastic response of our research partners, all serve to strengthen my belief that Nautilus will bring to the market a highly differentiated platform with a wide competitive moat, a platform that delivers an unmatched value proposition to researchers seeking to unlock the extraordinary potential of the proteome. Now that being said, as we start to move deeper into 2023, our intention will switch a bit not to these proteoform partnerships, but really switch to our early access program, which is a more formal program where the customer may take 24 or 48 samples, run them on our platform once we are capable of broad scale proteomic analysis. Number two, that one of the things that's really been great here at Nautilus is that there is quite a bit of inbound activity from potential partners and customers because of the excitement around our platform and the capabilities that we we've begun to show at scientific conferences. When we look at the capabilities of those platforms and how they've evolved over the course of the last 12 to 14 months if I include the first couple of months of 2023, I'm not seeing any major capability improvements or anything on the horizon that would--that would close the gap with the capabilities of our platform that we're building."
