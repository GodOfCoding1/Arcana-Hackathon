    "content": " So with respect to our affinity reagent development, kind of as background just to kind of get everyone caught back up on the strategy that we initiated last year, we have multiple affinity reagent pipelines internally that include different types of binders like aptamers and antibodies. But that's what's really driving our bring down of the forecast as well as one of the main things we're doing looking forward is that we're gating new investments based off of scientific milestones, and that just ensures that we're not spending ahead of where the business is at and that's what really allowed us to extend our cash runway well into 2025. One last thing I would add there, Stephanie, is that, I mentioned this a little bit in my prepared remarks, but one of the things that we've spent significant effort on in the first half of the year was really working through our reagent process development and manufacturing capabilities, working on improving those processes, scaling them up, focusing on yields and qualities so that we can bring the cost of reagents, which is a significant cost item for us down."
