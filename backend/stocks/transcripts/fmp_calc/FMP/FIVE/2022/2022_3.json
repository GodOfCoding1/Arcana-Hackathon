    "content": " We ended the quarter with 1,292 stores, an increase of 119 stores or approximately 10% versus 1,173 stores at the end of the third quarter last year. As a result, operating income decreased 50.7% to $20.9 million versus $42.4 million in the third quarter last year, with operating margin deleveraging year-over-year by approximately 375 basis points. We expect fourth quarter sales to be in a range of $1.085 billion to $1.110 billion based on opening approximately 48 new stores in the quarter, with comparable sales in the range of negative 1% to positive 1% versus last year's fourth quarter comparable sales increase of $0.034. Obviously, based on our guide where the quarter end, the quarter improved throughout September and October, I think it's largely a combination of the factors I outlined in my prepared remarks, which specifically were a combination of what we've done around the Triple-Double has really helped the improvement in transactions. And that is a really good sign that says our marketing is working, customers are looking for value and then what we'll be able to start to give all of you as we look at fourth quarter here and beyond is start to see what the mix of our customer is specifically who's coming in after we advertise."
