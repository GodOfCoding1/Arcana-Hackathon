    "content": " Earned rates for commercial continue to remain strong at plus 7% in the quarter and plus 9% excluding workers comp and based on the moderation of written rates we\u2019ve been experiencing, commercial earned rates ex- work comp we believe would remain at or above loss cost trends for the remainder of 2022. Our Q1 expense ratio of 31% is in line with expectations that were set out in last quarter\u2019s call and is 1.5 point lower than Q1, 2021. For licensed group, we had core income of $23 million for Q1, 2022 which was $13 million lower than last year\u2019s Q1 primarily from lower investment income and higher expenses. As a point of reference, our average book value has increased $1.4 billion from the prior quarter and while our average portfolio yields are lower relative to the prior year quarter, I am pleased to know that in this current rising interest rate environment, we are now achieving significantly higher yields on reinvestment relative to the last several years."
