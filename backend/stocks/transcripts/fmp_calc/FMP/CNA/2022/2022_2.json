We saw that in the data and increased our accident year lost ratio fixed considerably, which led us to start raising prices very early on at the expense of retention, and we increased prior year reserves through unfavorable prior period development of $210 million from 2017 through 2021, which we have spoken about on prior calls and we continue to maintain ongoing loss cost trends for this class above our overall P&C average. Core income of $245 million is down 28% as compared to the second quarter a year ago, leading to a current quarter core return on equity of 8.1%. For the second quarter, overall P&C net prior period development impact on the combined ratio was 1.6 points favorable compared to 0.2 points favorable in the prior year quarter. For Life & Group, we had core income of $6 million for Q2 2022, which was $37 million lower than last year's second quarter, primarily from lower investment income from limited partnerships. While higher rates are positively impacting the outlook for investment income, from a balance sheet perspective, they've continued to adversely impact our net unrealized investment position, which ended the quarter at a $1.8 billion loss, down from a $4.4 billion gain at the end of the fourth quarter 2021."
