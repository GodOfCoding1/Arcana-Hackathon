I think, as a result of that, what we saw this quarter and similar to what I just mentioned as far as our pipeline for the second half, we're moving into larger, higher-quality deals, resulting in, as I said, this quarter, we had six deals, large deals that are over $1 million, which is great to see. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. And this was evident, as you mentioned in our mix of customers with net new ACV being 70% plus as well as, as Frank mentioned, several $1 million deals as well as our strong NRR at 119%. Your line is open. I feel really good about the new business, the new lands that we've seen in the first half and especially in the second quarter, and also how that will continue in our pipeline going forward and then continued success with the expansion that the Cosan I just talked about. Your line is open. So as far as the new customer business, I would say that if I step back and look at both the new and the expanded business, what we're seeing is a continuation of some of the trends I mentioned earlier, as things have been progressing through the pandemic and the need for digital transformation as well as the enhanced need for planning and scenario planning. Your line is open."
