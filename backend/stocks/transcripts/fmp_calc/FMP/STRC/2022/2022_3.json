    "content": " As we have mentioned before, sales of these legacy products are not expected to form a material part of our revenue in the future as we focus on the commercial launch of our Guardian XT, Sapien 6M, Sapien Sea Class and Guardian XO lines. This increase was driven primarily by increased headcount from the addition of RE2, driving related expenses higher, as well as increased third-party service provider costs focused on the development of our Guardian XT, Sapien 6M and Guardian XO products. Excluding stock-based compensation expenses, we continue to expect year-over-year increases in G&A, R&D and sales and marketing expense for the remainder of the year as we work on the commercial release of our products next year, public company compliance efforts and incur additional costs relating to the acquisition of RE2. Excluding stock-based compensation expenses, changes in the value of our warrant liability and certain other items related to the closing of the acquisition of RE2, including the deferred tax benefit, our third quarter 2022 non-GAAP net loss per share was $0.12. Overall company inventory increased by $1.3 million during the third quarter, which included the purchase of approximately $1 million of parts and components related to the 2023 production of our commercial systems."
