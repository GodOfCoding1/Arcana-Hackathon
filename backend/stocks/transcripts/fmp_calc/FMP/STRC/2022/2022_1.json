    "content": " Even following the acquisition of RE2, Sarcos continues to have a substantial cash position, and we continue to believe we have more than sufficient funding to begin initial production of our commercial units of both our Guardian XO and Guardian XT as well as accelerate production of the Sapien products. Excluding stock-based compensation expense, warrant liability and certain other items related to the closing of the business combination with Rotor during 2021 and expenses associated with the acquisition of RE2 during quarter 1 of 2022, our non-GAAP net loss per share for the first quarter was $0.10. As we scale up in anticipation of the commercial production of our core products, we continue to anticipate that the average monthly cash burn from operations and capital expenditures for Sarcos, excluding the impact of RE2 will be approximately $5.5 million for 2022."
