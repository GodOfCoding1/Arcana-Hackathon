Just a few examples include the approval of Minnesota Power's integrated resource plan and the resulting $600 million expansion of our capital expenditure plan, increasing rate base growth to 11% over the next five years. The primary reasons relate to recording a full year of intermittent reserves in the fourth quarter for the outcome in the Minnesota Power rate case decision, further cost and losses taken out ALLETE Clean Energy on the now completed northern wind project, and weather impacts in the fourth quarter due to winter storm events. Turning to our other segments, ALLETE Clean Energy recorded fourth quarter 2022 net income of $1.3 million, compared to $14.6 million in 2021. We anticipate approximately $7 million in earnings from Minnesota investments in for ALLETE Investment in Minnesota Solar projects, and we expect similar earnings from BNI Energy and our investment in the Nobles 2 wind energy facility in 2023, a slightly lower earnings at ALLETE Properties. Yeah, great question Brian. Yeah, great question Brian."
