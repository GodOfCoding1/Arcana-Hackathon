    "content": " This increase was partially offset by a reserve of $2.9 million after tax or $0.05 per share for an anticipated loss on the sale of ALLETE Clean Energy's Northern Wind project, a negative impact of $1.7 million after tax, or $0.03 per share to reflect changes in the American Transmission company's estimate of a refund liability related to the ongoing MISO return on equity complaints. The net loss reflects a reserve of $2.9 million after tax for anticipated loss on the sale of its Northern Wind project, losses under the Caddo Wind Energy Facility's power sales agreements resulting from market volatility and transmission congestion in the Southwest Power Pool and lower wind resources compared to 2021. I'm very proud of our amazing and talented team of employees throughout ALLETE, and we're pleased with our execution and positioning thus far this year with more to come in the final quarter of 2022, including the results of Minnesota Power's IRP, the Superior Water Light & Power rate case; the addition of significant solar capabilities from New Energy Equity, as well as ALLETE Clean Energy's progress on build transfer projects and optimization of its portfolio."
