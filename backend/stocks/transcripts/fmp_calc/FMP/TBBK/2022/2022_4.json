    "content": " The Bancorp earned $0.71 a share in the fourth quarter, driven by 28% revenue growth, while expenses were approximately flat year-over-year. Book value per share at quarter end increased 10% to $12.47 compared to $11.30 a year earlier, reflecting retained earnings, partially offset by fair value adjustments to the investment portfolio resulting from the higher rate environment. When we started this process, we were more like 55% variable and that's -- with the growth of those variable rate businesses, it went up and we didn't buy any fixed rate exposure. We'll have at least 10% jaws between revenue and expense, will probably be significantly more than that but you won't see flat expenses this year due to -- mostly due to employee costs and core inflation."
