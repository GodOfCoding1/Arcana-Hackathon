Also reflecting the $1.2 million PPP reduction was $65 million of Q3 2022 net interest income, which nonetheless increased 27% over Q3 2021. Book value per share at quarter end increased 6% to $11.81 compared to $11.13 a year earlier, reflecting retained earnings, partially offset by fair value adjustments to the investment portfolio resulting from the higher rate environment. We're hoping that we don't -- if your inflation is 2.5% and you're at 0 interest rates, you're going to have inflation and you probably should have your Fed funds somewhere between 100 and 200 basis points higher than inflation in order to have a normalized economy."
