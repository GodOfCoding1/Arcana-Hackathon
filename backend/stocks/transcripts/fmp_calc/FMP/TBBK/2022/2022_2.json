    "content": " Car fleet leases have the credit worthiness of our borrowers, many of which are government institutional entities with an established history of minimizing losses through appropriate residual values on vehicle collateral, and our floating rate transitional multifamily loans are supported by new money from sponsors and rising rents that we believe offset the impact of interest rate increases. Q2 pre-tax income increased $4 million or 11% to $41 million in the second quarter compared to $37 million in Q2, 2021. Additionally, in Q2, 2022, funding costs contractually adjusted immediately to Federal Reserve rate hikes, and increased to 44 basis points from 18 basis points during Q2, 2021. Immediate funding expense increases and the lag loan rate adjustments noted earlier were reflected in a decrease in our net interest margin to 3.17% for Q2, 2022 from 3.19% in Q2, 2021. Total fees and related payments income of 22.4 million in Q2, 2022 increased 5% compared to Q2, 2021. Non-interest expense for Q2, 2022 was $43 million reflecting a decrease of 2% from Q2, 2021 notwithstanding $1.2 million settlement related to the cascade matter in 2022. Book value per share quarter end increased 7% to 11.55 compared to 10.77 a year earlier, reflecting retained earnings, partially offset by fair value adjustments to the investment portfolio, resulting from the higher rate environment."
