    "content": " In the first quarter, The Bancorp earned $29 million in net income or $0.50 a share from 5% year-over-year revenue growth, excluding the impact of PPP-related interest and fees with an 8% reduction in expense. Real Estate Bridge Lending has generated over $800 million in loans since inception, while Institutional Banking balances increased 32% year-over-year. However, due to continued growth in our existing and new programs, '22 first quarter was able to show a year-over-year increase of 2% in GDV even without this stimulus and additionally, with our Varo volume that exited the Bank in the second quarter. We were 15% to 20% GDV growth prior to the pandemic, that's what we're -- we think is going to happen. The good news, of course, is that as interest -- the interest rate environment normalizes to some place at least around the rate of inflation which is 2% or 3% toward the end of the year, we believe that net interest income will benefit significantly as the Fed finishes its rate increases. So we actually estimate that like right now in the -- up $200 million  might be a 5% or 6% increase, that's conservative."
