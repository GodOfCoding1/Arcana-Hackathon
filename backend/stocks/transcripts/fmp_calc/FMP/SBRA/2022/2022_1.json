    "content": " The headline numbers on the same-store basis are occupancy for the first quarter of 2022, excluding non-stabilized assets with 79.3% driven by a 190 basis point increase in our assisted living communities and partially offset by a 30 basis point decline in our independent living communities compared to the prior quarter. REVPOR for the period, excluding non-stabilized assets with $6,279 in our assisted living portfolio, a 5.6% increase over first quarter 2021 and $2,578 in our independent living communities, a 1% increase over first quarter 2021. Increases our investment in an area of healthcare, which has enormous unmet demands, creates organic growth through a proprietary pipeline of owned assets adapted for a new use, a process which is in Sabra\u2019s control, allowing us to grow net operating income without competing for assets and with less additional capital, delivers assets at better economic returns for both Sabra and the new operators. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2021 normalized AFFO per share increased $0.01 primarily due to higher NOI from our wholly-owned managed senior housing portfolio, higher normalized AFFO from the Enlivant joint venture and the recognition of Avamere\u2019s December 2021 rent obligation upon receipt in the first quarter.
