    "content": " REVPOR for the period excluding non-stabilized assets was $6,306 in our assisted living portfolio a 50 basis-point increase over the prior quarter and a 6.4% increase over third quarter 2021. Compared to the second quarter of 2022, normalized FFO per share and normalized AFFO per share decreased $0.03, primarily due to lower NOI from the Enlivant joint venture, as a result of receiving $3.4 million of government grant income last quarter, and lower NOI from tenants whose rent is accounted for on a cash basis. As of September 30, 2022, our annualized cash NOI was $448.4 million and our SNF exposure represented 60% of our annualized cash NOI, down 70 basis points from the second quarter and down 740 basis points from a year ago."
