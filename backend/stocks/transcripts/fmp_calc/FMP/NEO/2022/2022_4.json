So, we -- again, we don't -- we haven't disclosed the exact amount on RaDaR, but I will share that we've been very open, and we have disclosed that there will be no meaningful revenue for RaDaR in the clinical side of the business, that the meaningful revenue for RaDaR this year in 2023 will be in the pharma side of the business, and that's as much color as we've given. Andrew, your line is live."
