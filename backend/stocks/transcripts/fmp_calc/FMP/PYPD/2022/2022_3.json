    "content": "  For example, management is making forward-looking statements when it discusses our ongoing clinical trials and the timing thereof, our expectation to extend the company's cash runway into the third quarter of 2023, our intention to publish important results from the SHIELD I study in a medical journal as soon as it is practical, that the top line results -- indicate that patients undergoing complex surgeries with large incisions or patients with risk factors could potentially benefit from D-PLEX100; our intention to use the impressive data from SHIELD I in discussions with potential partners regarding future pipeline products, including in oncology; our belief that significant reduction in superficial and deep SSIs and large surgical abdominal colorectal wounds and in high-risk patients as well as the safety data are very encouraging; our intention to discuss with the FDA the lower-than-anticipated overall infection rate in the study, driven by COVID-19 safety restrictions that were in place while our trial is being conducted; our intention to discuss the regulatory pathway for D-PLEX100 for the prevention of SSIs in abdominal surgery with U.S. and EU regulatory authorities in the first quarter of 2023; and the potential of D-PLEX100 to prevent SSIs in abdominal surgery; the potential innovation behind our lead product and preparations with ADVANZ PHARMA; and discussions with other potential partners and the potential outcome of our anticipated meeting with the FDA and EU regulatory authorities."
