    "content": " In the quarter, cash decreased to $39.8 million, primarily related to funding our operations and working capital in advance of the anticipated launch of the combination COVID-19 and influenza test kit in the fourth quarter of 2022. GAAP gross loss and negative gross margin for the third quarter of 2022 was $99.6 million and \u00e2\u0080\u0093 289% respectively compared to a gross loss in negative gross margin for the third quarter of 2021 of approximately $1.5 million and 10% respectively. Our increase in GAAP gross loss in gross margin was driven primarily by a onetime non-cash access inventory related charge of $107.2 million due to a significant reduction in our sales forecast resulting from an unanticipated delay and FDA\u00e2\u0080\u0099s approval of our COVID-19 and influenza test kit has declined in COVID-19 testing demand."
