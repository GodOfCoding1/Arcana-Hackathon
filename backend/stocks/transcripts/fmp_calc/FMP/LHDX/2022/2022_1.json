    "content": " We are pleased with our performance and see COVID-19 testing as a proxy for what Lucira will become: a leader in the health care paradigm shift to a new category of decentralized diagnostic testing combined with rapid treatment, otherwise known as test to treat. Negative on Lucira's COVID-19 test but bedridden with fever and flu symptoms, telehealth providers still wanted the patient to visit the clinic for evaluation. This antiviral worked very well, but the telehealth process is in need of Lucira's COVID-19 and flu combo test, so that telehealth physicians can prescribe treatment medications with diagnostic confidence at the earliest sign of infection and without requiring a patient visit. The Lucira COVID-19 and flu combo test and the COVID-19 test, which also received CE Mark on May 6, are nucleic acid amplification tests with sensitivity and specificity comparable to lab-based PCR assays, miniaturized to run in Lucira's palm-sized test with no separate instrument or reader and producing results in 30 minutes or less. While COVID-19 testing accelerated our transformation into a commercial company, the upcoming launch of the COVID-19 and flu combo product, which provides a differential diagnosis with a single swab, is what customers are asking for, and it demonstrates the versatility of our platform."
