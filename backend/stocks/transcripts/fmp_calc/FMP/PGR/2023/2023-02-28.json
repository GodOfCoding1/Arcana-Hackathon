Lastly, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d like to share some exciting news that doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t involve using telematics data to more accurately rate policies but instead, builds upon our telematics heritage to provide a valuable service to our customers. So, it really is about following the customer and the more we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re able to offer them, even with the Progressive Advantage Agency where it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s -- we work with a lot of different partners ranging from life insurance to travel insurance to jewelry insurance, the more that the customers have and the more that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve earned their trust, the longer they stay. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m curious if maybe that could potentially have some kind of impact on frequency because I would think that there\u00e2\u0080\u0099d be a lot of customers with kind of smaller dollar claims that wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to tell their insurance company, they got in the crash and just to keep their -- the rates where they are."
