    "content": " During fiscal year \u201822, we invested $34.2 million in two new buyout investments and made an additional roughly $58.5 million in various existing portfolio companies and are primarily due to fund accretive add-on investments in those companies. During the year, we exited our investments in three portfolio companies, which resulted in over $25 million in realized capital gains on equity and success fee income of $5.4 million. Since inception in 2005 and through 3/31/22, it\u2019s always important to take a look backwards, we have invested in 55 buyout portfolio companies for an aggregate of approximately $1.5 billion, and we exited 27 of these companies over the years, generating approximately $263 million in net realized cap gains and over $36 million in other income on exit. So we continue to see improvement from the ongoing impact of the pandemic on our portfolio companies through the end of the fiscal year, resulting in total investment income of $72.6 million, adjusted net investment income of $1 per share and over $25 million in realized capital gains on exits. Using the current monthly distribution run rate of $0.90 per share per year and $0.30 per year in supplemental distributions that we paid in the fiscal year ending 2022, our fiscal year distributions would total $1.20 per common share or yield about 8.1% using yesterday\u2019s closing price of $14.82."
