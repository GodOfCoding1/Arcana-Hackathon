So during this quarter of fiscal year \u201822, the two portfolio companies that we exited resulted in a net realized gain of $22 million and success fee income of $3.4 million. Expenses decreased by $8 million this quarter, which was primarily driven by a $4.8 million decrease in capital gains based incentive fees due to the net impact of realized and unrealized gains as required under U.S. GAAP as well as an increase in fee credit. Consistent with prior quarters, distributable book earnings to shareholders remains solid, especially when considering that book earnings has been reduced by $28.7 million of capital gains based incentive fees, which equates to about $0.86 per common share, of which only $5.3 million is currently due. Assuming the current monthly distribution run-rate of $0.90 per share per year and $0.30 per share per year in supplemental distributions for the 2022 fiscal year in total, our annual distributions, which totaled $1.20 per common share or a yield of about 7.5% using yesterday\u2019s closing price of $15.90. Yes, I think well, Mickey, first of all, as you know, our general I don\u2019t know if you call it policy approach plan is first we focus on the monthly distributions, which we have been able to get up to $0.075 per share, $0.90 on an annual basis."
