    "content": " And as a result, we ended the second quarter of fiscal year \u00e2\u0080\u009823, which was on 9/30/22 with adjusted NII of $0.29 per share and total investments at fair value of $738 million, which is up from $690 million at 6/30/22. In the second quarter of fiscal year \u00e2\u0080\u009823, we generated adjusted net investment income of $9.7 million or $0.29 per share. With that in mind, and as previously announced in October 2022, our Board of Directors increased our monthly distribution run-rate to $0.96 per share per year and declared a $0.12 per share supplemental distribution to be paid in December of this year, using the new monthly distribution run-rate of $0.96 per share per year and the $0.24 per share in supplemental distributions paid and declared so far for the year, noting that this may not actually be indicative of what ultimately maybe declared for the year."
