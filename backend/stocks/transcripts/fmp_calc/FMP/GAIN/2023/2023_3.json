    "content": " So it accomplishes a few things, increasing our investment in a really good company, but also able to harvest income and also capital gains and these opportunities may present themselves from time-to-time and we will pursue them, because they do allow us, as I mentioned, increase our investment in a company where we know the management team, we know the business and we have a strong belief in its future. In the fiscal third quarter of FY \u00e2\u0080\u009823, we generated adjusted net investment income of $10 million or $0.30 per share, up from $9.7 million or $0.29 per share in the prior quarter. As a result, net investment income for the quarter ended December 31, 2022 declined to $8.6 million or $0.26 per share from $11.4 million or $0.34 per share in the prior quarter. Using the monthly distribution run-rate of $0.96 per share per year and $0.48 per share in supplemental distributions that have been paid or declared for the fiscal year, our aggregate fiscal year distributions would total $1.44 per common share or yield about 10.5% using yesterday\u00e2\u0080\u0099s closing price of $13.70. There are still good companies out there I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d say that we have seen even though I say frothy, frothy being defined really as from a competitive perspective still a lot of money out there to be put to work, so as a result of that the companies that are coming to market represented by good quality investment bankers, we are still seeing fairly aggressive I would call it multiples from a valuation standpoint."
