Please go ahead, sir. It's interesting, I feel right now compared to let's say, roll the clock back 3, 4 months ago, when we all obviously believed and felt like we're in somewhat of a, either certainly recessionary type, or certainly somewhat of a slowdown, we certainly see that through some of our portfolio companies and all the stuff we read, and obviously, the inflationary costs. And by the way, what -- some of the games that these sellers are playing, and obviously, I don't mean this in a bad way and the investment banks who are working for them, obviously urge them, they do these adjustments to EBITDA and in pro forma and what they're trying to do is say, look, what, we have these expenses to do with increased container costs as an example, or shipping costs, and they try to build that back in to the EBITDA and say, you normalize that it's not as bad as it looks, right. Please go ahead, sir."
