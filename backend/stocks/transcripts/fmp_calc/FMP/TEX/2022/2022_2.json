    "content": " MP's global demand remains strong, demonstrated by backlog of $1.1 billion, up 32% year-over-year, with an additional $100 million scheduled to be delivered beyond 12 months. We demonstrated solid execution in a dynamic environment, including significant supply chain challenges and continued inflation with reported sales of $1.1 billion, up 4% year-over-year, primarily due to increased prices. Although price/cost dynamics have improved sequentially from the first quarter, operating profit in the second quarter of $104 million decreased $19 million from the prior year as price realization was offset by continued cost increases, manufacturing inefficiencies caused by supply chain disruptions, and the negative impact of changes in foreign exchange rates. Supply chain challenges, inflation pressures, geopolitical uncertainty, and highly restrictive China COVID policies continue, but the team has successfully navigated these challenges for the first half of 2022 and we expect continued improvement in price/cost dynamics throughout the year. Based upon MP's successful mitigation of persistent input costs, supply chain challenges, and first half performance, we are increasing the operating margin range to 14.8% to 15.3% with relatively balanced margins throughout the second half of 2022. What we've said there, Steve, in terms of the margin improvement of Mexico is, over the next couple of years, '24, '25 time frame, when it's complete and the transition and movement of product lines in there, we anticipate about a 200 basis point overall margin improvement in our Genie business as a result of the complete utilization, if you will, of the Monterrey facility."
