    "content": " Operating margins of 9.9% improved 290 basis points from the prior year, and EPS of $1.34 increased 63%, reflecting strong execution by our team members. We proactively managed supply chain disruptions and inflation to deliver a 28% increase in operating income, a 41% improvement in EPS, a return on invested capital of 21.3% and we achieved price cost neutrality for the year. The AWP segment continues to be impacted by supply shortages, AWP segment operating margins of approximately 9% are expected to be comparable in the first half and the second half with the second and third quarters being slightly higher. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. It takes time to bring the plant up -- to get the plant up and operating, get the supply chain up and operating and stabilized and then over time, quite confident it's going to deliver that level of margin improvement for the Genie business. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open."
