    "content": " MP's global demand remains strong, demonstrated by a 24% increase in bookings and a record backlog of $1.2 billion, up 66% year-over-year. MP's end markets are also strong demonstrated by a 16% increase in bookings and a record backlog of $2.3 billion, up 77% year-over-year. First quarter earnings per share of $0.74 increased 32%, representing an $0.18 improvement over last year. AWP first quarter bookings of $1.1 billion, were up 16% year-over-year with particularly strong booking activity in the utilities business. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. And so based on the best information available that's how we've laid out our outlook for the second half of the year, and it's really in that $1.1 billion kind of range and that's the demonstrated capacity that suppliers have exhibited frankly for the last couple of quarters, and we're not anticipating a significant improvement. And I'm just trying to think mathematically, if it's sort of like $0.85 Q2, it has to go up roughly call $0.20, $.15 sequentially to get to that sort of $1.10 run rate in the back half every 100 bps of price cost improvement is about $0.10 right? Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open."
