    "content": " As a result of the team's continued strong execution in the third quarter and our backlog, we are raising full year EPS outlook to a range of $4 to $4.20 on sales of approximately $4.3 billion. MP's global demand remains strong, demonstrated by a total backlog of $1.2 billion, up 14% year-over-year. Based upon MP's successful mitigation of persistent input costs, supply chain challenges and strong performance to date, we expect net sales of approximately $1.9 billion with an operating margin range of 15% to 15.3%. Your line is open. So it didn't impact Terex overall at all of what $5.2 million related to prior period transactional foreign exchange and if we exclude that charge, the margins for the third quarter would have been 10.4%. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open."
