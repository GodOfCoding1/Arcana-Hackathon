    "content": " After excluding early termination fee revenue of $1.5 million in the prior year quarter, third quarter revenue of $10.2 million increased by $1.5 million or 17.2% reflecting rental income contribution from our acquisition of 16 properties during the first seven months of 2022. Excluding the early termination fee revenue of $1.5 million in the prior year period that I just described, revenue increased 12.9%, primarily reflecting rental income from our 18 acquisitions over the last 15 months, partially offset by the decrease in rental income from the sale of 12 non-core properties over the last 21 months."
