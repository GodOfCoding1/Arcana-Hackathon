First, Remember, because we're starting these relationships new with some of these retail partners in Q3 and Q4, there's a little bit of load in, right, into the stores, into the sales there. In terms of the gross margin impact, it wasn't 1 of the biggest drivers on a year-over-year basis, it was a little bit of the stuff that we laid out in the call were the things that we felt really like moved gross margin on land this environment, we feel pretty good about where gross margin landed for the quarter, especially very much in line of our expectations coming into the quarter. Your question on the model implications in the medium term, again, much like my response earlier, I think that's something we'll take on a little bit when we get into the Q4 call, we have a better sense on the ultimate size of the third-party business in 2023. But right now, if you look at where the consumer is at, I think when you look at the situation in the industry last year with a lot of companies reporting that they couldn't get the supply into the mix that they were looking for versus this year where there's a lot of inventory outstanding, things are going to look a little bit different in the trends."
