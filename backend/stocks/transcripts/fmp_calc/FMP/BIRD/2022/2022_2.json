    "content": " In fact 43% of Flyer sales in the first 30 days post launch were to new customers, which we believe is a strong proof point that our performance offering is not only resonating with our existing audience, but bringing new customers into the Allbirds' brand. Our updated 2022 adjusted net revenue guidance target is $305 million to $315 million up 10% to 14% versus 2021, including an estimated year-over-year FX impact of 275 to 350 basis points.
