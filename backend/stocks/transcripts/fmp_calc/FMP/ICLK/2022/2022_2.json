    "content": " As a result, iClick's total revenue for the second quarter 2022 declined by 51% year-over-year, amounting to $38.1 million and revenue from Marketing Solutions decreased by 62% to $24.3 million year-over-year. Revenue from Marketing Solutions declined 52% to $24.3 million compared with the $54.6 million for the second card of 2021, primarily due to our scale down of our Marketing Solutions business and the slowdown of the overall advertising market. Goodwill impairment charge of $24.9 million was recorded in the second quarter of 2022 for Marketing Solutions due to the scale down of our Marketing Solution business, which resulted in a short fall between the carrying value and the estimated fair value of this segment as of June 30, 2022. Okay, this is David. Okay, this is David."
