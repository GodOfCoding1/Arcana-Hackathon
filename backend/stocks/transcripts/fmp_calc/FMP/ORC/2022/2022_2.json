    "content": " I think there's a shift underway away from the roll market more towards specs, and maybe not playing out to the extent we would like in the next few months, but as we think going forward in the next year, especially if the economy were entering into a recession, that that trend would continue. And given where we are with respect to the Fed, and the chairman's statement that they're going to be data dependent just really means that the market will be hyper focused on the meaningful data points such as today, next month's nonfarm payroll number, CPI."
