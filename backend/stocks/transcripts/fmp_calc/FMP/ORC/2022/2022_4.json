    "content": " And that just reflects the fact that swap spreads are negative, SOFR swap spreads and more negative the further you go out the curve, and the ramification for that is somewhat significant, in the sense that if you look at swaps as a hedge instrument, 10-year swaps at about 360 as of close last night is still attractive hedge level, especially for lower coupon securities which have fully extended, it can be quite easily hedged with longer dated swaps. And even with these lower coupons, while they not cover the dividend in and out of themselves, in conjunction with the benefits of the hedge -- legacy hedge asset and the fact that they have such great total rate of return potential, even if there's a modest shortcoming -- shortfall in the near-term, which I'm not sure that would be, we still view this as much more desirable."
