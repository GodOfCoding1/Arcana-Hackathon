So, it's hard to guess when that point is and whether it's three months or five months, but once we pivot mortgages are going to do well because what's likely to happen is the feds going to have to tighten a lot, get the economy and get rates into restrictive territory, and then we're going to have a recession, and when we have a recession mortgages will do very well we have no risk component of our asset class rates are going to be the curve will be inverted.
