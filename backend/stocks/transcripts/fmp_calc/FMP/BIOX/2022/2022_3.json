    "content": " Comparable revenues for third fiscal quarter grew 72% year-over-year, reaching $60.1 million, a record high third-quarter revenue number for us. For example, where we reported revenues in the third quarter of fiscal 2021 were only $1.2 million higher than comparable revenues, this quarter's GAAP from IAS 29 adjustments was more than $9 million. Total comparable gross profit grew by 59% year-over-year, reaching $25.4 million, a record high third quarter figure, and in-line with our top-line performance. Flight expenses this quarter rose $1.6 million, a 165% increase versus last year without the corresponding profits that we expect to materialize in the fourth quarter. Particularly in the third quarter of the current fiscal year, HB4 related costs and expenses increased to $2.3 million from $0.5 million, effectors managed under the HB4 program rose almost threefold. Total financial debt reached $205 million increasing from $183.4 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2021, which explains higher LTM financial expenses on a relatively stable cost of debt. Following the recent soy upward in China and progress made in expanding our wheat footprint to Australia, it is reassuring to have now set target for HB4 Wheat and soy that imply contribution of $35 million to $45 million of additional EBITDA over the next two to three years, that will build on top of a healthy and growing baseline business. Got it, got it. Got it, got it."
