    "content": " So, as we improve background genetics and reduce the yield gap of the first generation materials in environment with yields above four tonnes per hectare, we can expand the HB4 opportunity to the entire wheat production area and this is what we are showing in the next slide with that close to 15% yield improvement observed in the highest yielding environments during the last season when compared \u00e2\u0080\u0093 when comparing the data from last year, from first generation materials to what we observed with second generation materials in the current year."
