    "content": " I am pleased to present our quarterly and annual results starting on Slide 5 with a $31 million profit for the fourth quarter of 2022, reaching a total of $92 million for the year denoting a 47% annual increase. Including another $0.9 billion in contingencies, mainly consisting of the issuance and confirmation of letters of credit Bladex commercial portfolio closed at $7.7 billion, an 18% increase from the previous year. In turn, net interest margin representing the yield of interest earning assets, including the portion financed by the bank's equity reached 2.11% in 4Q '22, an increase of 34 basis points from the previous quarter and of 69 basis points year-on-year, supported by both higher net interest spread and by the impact of increasing market rate on the overall yield of assets financed by the bank's equity. Moving on to Slide 11, we can see that the overall impact of rate increases on assets and liabilities supported by higher lending spreads and market rate, as I just stated, was the reason behind about half of the $61 million increase in net interest income for the year 2022. The other half is attributed to strong average credit growth, mainly on the loan portfolio, which increased by over $1.4 billion or 28% when compared to the year before, complemented by another $536 million growth in average credit investment portfolio accompanied by the related increase in financial liabilities and a continued prudent and proactive liquidity management. On Slide 12, fee income from letters of credit have shown an increasing quarterly trend throughout 2022, resulting in a total of $14 million for the year, representing a 16% annual increase from the previous year. Finally, Stage 3 or impaired credit represents merrily 0.4% of total exposure for a total of $35 million at year-end 2022, as we classified new credit, for a total of $25 million as impaired during the fourth quarter."
