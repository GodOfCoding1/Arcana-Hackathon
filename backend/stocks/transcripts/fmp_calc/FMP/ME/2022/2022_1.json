With over 80% of our 11.6 million genotyped customers opting in to participate in research, we believe that the 23andMe database is the world\u2019s largest crowdsourced platform for genetic research, and it has the unique potential to offer new insights about diseases and how it can be treated. On the earlier stage pipeline, it\u2019s \u2013 I would just take a step back and, I think if you think we signed the collaboration deal with GSK in the summer of 2018, then from the database we had over 40 programs."
