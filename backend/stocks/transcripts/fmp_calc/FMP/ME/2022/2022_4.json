    "content": " Our Research Services business will be sustained by GSK\u2019s election in January to remain our exclusive data partner for a fifth contract year, which starts in July of 2022 and comes with a $50 million payment, which is double the previous annual payment. Our revenue for the three and 12 months ended March 31, 2022 was a $101 million and $272 million, respectively, representing increases of 14% and 11%, respectively, over the same periods in the prior year. Our gross profit for the three and 12 months ended March 31, 2022 was $47 million and $133 million, respectively, representing a 6% and 14% increase over the same periods in the prior year. Operating expenses for the three and 12 months ended March 31, 2022 were $117 million and $387 million, respectively, compared to $112 million and $302 million for the same periods in the prior year. Looking at the bottom line, net loss for the three and 12-month periods ended March 31, 2022 was $70 million and $217 million, respectively, compared to net losses for the same period in the prior year of $67 million and $184 million respectively. Total adjusted EBITDA for the three and 12 months ended March 31, 2022 was a deficit of $30 million and $151 million, respectively, compared to deficits for the same period in the prior year of $11 million and $77 million respectively. Looking specifically at the adjusted EBITDA for the three and 12 months ended March 31, 2022 for the Consumer & Research Services segment, we saw a surplus of $3 million for the fourth quarter and a deficit of $30 million for the full-year compared to surpluses in the same periods in the prior year of $18 million and $13 million respectively. As a reminder, our fiscal year 2023 guidance carries the full-year impact of the consolidation of the telehealth business into the company's overall consumer segment versus only five months in fiscal year 2022, as well as including the current and anticipated effects of general inflation on certain of our costs. And then I think scale to the topline, returning back to a good growth profile as the new products rollout late in the year also super important because we have some fixed costs in G&A and some of the technical functions in the consumer segment that are \u2013 there's a minimum size to them to run the infrastructure."
