    "content": " And finally, our new AI-powered HFX iQ System is performing really well in our limited market release with positive feedback from physicians and patients regarding the ability to deliver personalized pain relief using our big data-backed HFX Algorithm and more on iQ later in my remarks, but I think this technology really has the opportunity to further differentiate our competitive position in this space. And that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an increase of 29% sequentially, compared to $13.4 million in the third quarter, which we attribute in large measure that the PDN referral sales organization expansion that was completed in June as well as our outreach initiatives with both physicians and patients. PDN represented 60% of worldwide permanent implant procedures, which was \u00e2\u0080\u0093 which results in approximately $17.3 million in PDN indication sales in the fourth quarter of 2022. Given this backdrop, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re guiding the first quarter worldwide revenue of approximately $94 million to $96 million, which represents 9% to 11% growth on a constant currency basis, and reflects the typical seasonal step down in revenue from Q4 to Q1.

Your line is open. Your line is open."
