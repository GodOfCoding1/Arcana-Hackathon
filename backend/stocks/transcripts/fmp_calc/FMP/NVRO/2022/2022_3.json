    "content": " If finalized, this will mean that Medicare and Medicare Advantage beneficiaries in all 50 states will have access to SCS for PDN, adding approximately 17 million covered Medicare lives and bringing coverage in the U.S. to approximately 66% of PDN patients. I'll begin with our worldwide revenue for the third quarter of 2022, which was $100.5 million, an increase of 8% as reported and 10% on a constant currency basis compared to $93.2 million in the third quarter of 2021. PDN represented 13% of worldwide permanent implant procedures, which resulted in approximately $13.4 million in revenue in the third quarter of 2022. International revenue was $14.3 million, a decrease of 5% as reported but an increase of 8% constant currency compared to $15.2 million in the third quarter of 2021. International revenue, particularly in the United Kingdom, continued to be impacted by COVID-related issues and foreign currency headwinds. We have narrowed our worldwide revenue guidance range for full year 2022 to approximately $403 million to $407 million from $400 million to $410 million previously, which implies growth of 4% to 5% over the prior year and growth in the fourth quarter of 8% to 11%. I think most models have something like $75 million to $80 million in PDN, which implies something like 5%, 6% growth in the base business in the U.S. Robbie, I know you can script the first part of my answer here, which is we didn't give quantitative guidance."
