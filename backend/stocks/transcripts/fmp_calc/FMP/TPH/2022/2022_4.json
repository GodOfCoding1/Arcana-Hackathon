Just to follow up on Steve's question and just for clarity, what -- and so, Linda, I think when you're saying the 6.1% quarter-to-date incentives plus the price decreases, just to be 100% clear, that, that 6.1% is part of the net 10% to 15% that we should be thinking about in terms of cumulative reductions, right? But again, it's all based on focusing in on pace over price as we go into this year and the repositioning that we put in place going into 2023 so far has generated good results."
