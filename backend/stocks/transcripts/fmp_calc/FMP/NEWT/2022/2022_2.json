    "content": "  In the Proxy Statement, we described the rationale that management team and the Board believes as well as 89% of the shareholders that this is in the shareholders' best interest, which relates to a) lowering our cost of capital to the company over the long-term, b) having less of a reluctance on having to issue high cost of equity to continue to fund their growth because we are clearly a growth company, you could see that in the way we've delivered growth in dividends, growth in earnings, historically, particularly as a BDC and going forward, we will be able to grow the business using more core deposits in debt than having to rely upon equity and that's based upon the fact that BDCs have a 2 to 1 leverage cap of which we've been very conservative of a much lower number."
