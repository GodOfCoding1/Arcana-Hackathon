    "content": " This $14.9 million year-over-year improvement was primarily driven by three factors: first, demand for our products and services was very strong as revenues in 2022 jumped up 92% over the prior year; second, a large part of our revenue growth came from high-margin imagery and analytics, which as I mentioned, represented a 92% incremental contribution margin in 2022, helping to drive improvements to our bottom-line; and third, we drove strong leverage through prudent cost management with operating investments primarily made to expand our sales team, software and AI technology."
