    "content": " Adjusted gross margin for the first quarter was 37%, up 400 basis points from 33% in the prior year, which was supported by the momentum we're gaining from diversifying our business. First-quarter sales were $147.7 million, up 15% compared to the first quarter of 2021, and up 11% sequentially from the fourth quarter of 2021. Sales to non-transportation and markets increased 30% year-over-year as the industrial and medical end-markets exhibited double-digit growth, excluding sales from our recent acquisition, TEWA Temperature Sensors, sales to non-transportation end-markets were up 28%. So first of all, on the TEWA side, we would see it on an annual basis, the revenue being in the -- your $12 to $15 million range for that business."
