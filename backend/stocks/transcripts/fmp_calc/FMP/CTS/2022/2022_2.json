    "content": " At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the CTS Corporation Second Quarter 2022 Conference Call. At this time, I would like to turn over the call to Mr. Kieran O'Sullivan, CEO of CTS Corporation. In addition, we finalized the acquisition of Ferroperm Piezoceramics at the end of June, further advancing our diversification strategy. I'm excited to have this talented team join CTS, which will allow us to expand our market opportunities and support a broader range of customers. Sales in the second quarter were $145 million, up approximately 12% compared to the second quarter of 2021. Second quarter adjusted gross margin was 36.1%, down 70 basis points from 36.8% in the second quarter of last year. As I already mentioned, during the quarter, we completed the Ferroperm acquisition, the acquisition is expected to be accretive in 2023. To the extent that today's discussion refers to any non-GAAP measures under Regulation G, the required explanations and reconciliation are available in the Investors section of the CTS website. Demand was solid across medical and industrial markets, while defense was softer. Adjusted gross margin for the second quarter was 36.1%, down 70 basis points from 36.8% for the same period last year. We are operating in a very dynamic environment as we continue to be impacted by rising commodity prices, supply chain headwinds and other macro challenges, which are likely to further pressure margins. However, we continue to partner with our customers to offset or share cost increases, and we expect freight costs to improve in the quarters ahead as Trans-Pacific container volumes to the U.S. return to more normalized pre-pandemic levels. As we move forward, we will continue to evaluate and refine our footprint to optimize our ability to serve our customers, while also enabling us to deliver improved operating leverage. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 22.4%, up 90 basis points from 21.5% in the second quarter of 2021. By continuing to focus on growth and diversification, we added 6 new customers in the quarter, 4 in industrial and 2 in medical. Additionally, we delivered samples for new products to multiple customers across all end markets. The quality of our material formulations supported by leading edge technologies, our deep industry experience and vertical integration leveraged over several end markets differentiate us from our competitors, helping us deliver long-term value to our customers. As we noted earlier, we completed the acquisition of Ferroperm during the quarter. The company was founded in 1952 and specializes in the design and manufacture of high performance piezoceramic components for use in complex and demanding medical, industrial and aerospace applications. Based in Denmark, Ferroperm has established a strong customer base across Europe and in North America. Ferroperm is located within a short distance of our existing ceramics business in Denmark, and we are already evaluating potential plans to consolidate operations into the Ferroperm facility. In the industrial market, demand for our micro actuators for use in industrial printing applications remains solid driven by online demand. Across temperature sensing, hot and cold applications, we continue to see good momentum with awards for HVAC and strong demand for industrial appliances as consumers return to service industries. Though lower, demand for pool and spa applications remains at reasonable levels. We also secured frequency product wins, and demand was solid for our switch product used in industrial applications, computing and entertainment equipment. Distribution sales were a little tempered, which we expected after the higher periods we have seen for several successive quarters. Across medical, we are seeing increasing momentum and long-term growth opportunities, building off our first quarter performance. Our targeted business development efforts continue to deliver, resulting in an expanding customer base. The sample qualification for handheld medical ultrasound that we discussed last quarter is now in the FDA approval process, which is expected to take between 6 to 9 months to complete. Further, we received multiple temperature sensing awards from existing customers, ranging from incubator to critical freezer monitoring and disposable applications, and added 2 new customers, 1 for a temperature cycling application and another for an application using body aesthetics. In aerospace and defense we continue to remain confident in the long-term prospects for this market driven by the geopolitical environment, as we improve our capabilities with new material formulations. For unmanned underwater vehicles, we continue to develop sample product with a Tier 1 defense customer and expect initial small volume production between late this year and early 2023. In RF filter applications, we experience some near-term softening due to program transitions, but expect to grow with new applications next year. We were also awarded the precision harsh temperature application for a space vehicle, and were also awarded extensions on existing timing products. We continue to advance our M&A strategy, which is focused on expanding our geographic reach, adding momentum to our end market profile and increasing the richness of our customer base. As I mentioned earlier, during the quarter, we successfully completed the acquisition of Ferroperm. Through this acquisition, we also gain industrial and defense product capabilities and new customers. As we have discussed before, our long-term strategic plan is focused on diversifying our end market profile. We plan to achieve this by expanding our range of technologies, products, customers and geographic reach to accelerate the revenue growth of our non-transportation business, while also strategically growing our transportation business. We believe this strategy continues to bear fruit, as we are seeing the diversification of our business, enhancing our quality of earnings, despite the challenging macroeconomic factors we are facing. The Ferroperm acquisition advances these efforts by supporting the growth of our non-transportation revenue, with the potential of expanding this portion of the business beyond 50% of total revenues. Our track record of thoughtfully expanding ceramic technology to support diversification, while at the same time leveraging our expertise to build and scale the temperature sensing platform through the acquisitions of QTI, SSI and now TEWA, demonstrates the execution of our strategic plan. We continue to focus on acquisition targets in the range of up to $50 million a year in sales, but we remain open to the right larger opportunities that will advance our long-term strategy. Our team continues to develop our pipeline of prospects, appropriately deploying capital, in line with our allocation framework is important. And we have maintained a healthy balance sheet, which enables us to maintain flexibility to drive organic growth and make strategic acquisitions, while returning capital to shareholders. To that end, in the quarter, we repurchased approximately $7.7 million of CTS stock. In transportation, we continue to perform in an environment where OEMs and Tier 1 suppliers saw sales declines in the quarter. We currently see robust demand in commercial vehicles, which we expect to extend into 2023. On the light vehicle side, while the sales softness remains given the supply side challenges across the industry, our positioning from a product and geographic standpoint has propelled us forward. We remain cautious on light vehicle demand, more from a consumer weakness sentiment than supply disruptions, and view demand trending flat for this year. However, longer-term we see the need for a growth cycle, given the recession level industry volumes of recent years. We continue to focus on strengthening our light vehicle sensor portfolio, especially around EV platforms. We are also developing new products to integrate into existing and future EV architectures such as our eBrake product, which has been prototyped and represents a future growth opportunity similar in magnitude to the existing accelerator module market. In addition, we are getting traction with our current sensor products and are working on potential position sensing products for EV motor application. Our value proposition in transportation has been built on packaging position sensing for safety, critical and harsh environments where our teams have developed deep industry experience. For passive safety sensors, we had two large Tier 1 wins across Europe and North America, the largest one for an EV application. Across the accelerator module products, we had multiple wins, 3 with Asian OEMs and additional wins with European and North American OEMs. Looking ahead and recognizing the macro uncertainty, we currently see good demand in industrial markets and strength in the medical market with some softness in defense as we transition programs. However, we expect market demand may soften throughout the balance of the year. And the semiconductor shortage impacted closer to 2 million units or more based on the trend we are seeing, which we feel is likely to end above 3 million units for the year. As I mentioned earlier, we are cautious on older build rates for this year and expect production volumes to grow in the low-single-digits versus the prior year with incremental gains in the years ahead despite a recessionary environment. We were able to maintain operations this past quarter, while ensuring a safe work environment for our employees during the Asian lockdowns. I'm pleased to say in this very challenging environment, our teams are working and adapting with speed and agility to support our customers. In terms of the financial outlook for the full year 2022, our updated guidance, including the Ferroperm acquisition, is for sales to be in the range of $570 million to $800 million -- sorry to $600 million, up from the previous range of $550 million to $580 million. Second quarter sales were $145 million, up 11.9% compared to the second quarter of 2021 and down 2% sequentially from the first quarter of 2022. Sales to non-transportation end markets increased 21.1% year-over-year, supported by another quarter of double digit growth in the industrial and medical end markets. Excluding sales from TEWA acquisition, sales to non-transportation end markets were up 14.1% year-over-year. We have continued to see momentum in our smart actuator products, which primarily go into commercial vehicle applications. Our adjusted gross margin was 36.1% in the quarter, down 70 basis points compared to the second quarter of 2021 and down 110 basis points compared to the first quarter of 2022. Inflationary factors and supply chain headwinds pressured margins during the quarter, which we were able to partially offset through pricing and operational improvements across our organization. As previously communicated, we are on target to achieve the lower end of the $0.22 to $0.26 of savings. However, some of these projects will extend into 2023 as we balance growth with the completion of the projects. Moving on to cash generation and the balance sheet, we generated $16.1 million in operating cash flow for the second quarter of 2022. Controllable working capital was at 17.7%, higher than the first quarter primarily due to the addition of the balance sheet from our Ferroperm acquisition. We repurchased approximately 216,000 shares of CTS stock during the quarter totaling $7.7 million. In total, we returned approximately $9 million to the shareholders in the second quarter and $14 million year-to-date through dividends and buybacks. We ended the second quarter with a cash balance of $98.7 million as of June 30, 2022 and our long-term debt balance was $91 million. During the second quarter, we funded our Ferroperm acquisition partly with cash outside the U.S. and the balance through our existing credit facility. So Justin, in terms of sales, we have talked about the acquisition delivering in the low to mid $20 million range. So, that'll give you a rough idea of how much to expect in second half of the year, $10 million, $11 million is how we are thinking about it. If I kind of reflect back on when the pandemic initially hit in 2020, I felt like you moved pretty quickly to adjust the cost structure lower. And in our prepared remarks, we said, we expect some softness in the second half of the year. And if you look back to the COVID period when we had to respond to a pretty down market where we saw huge drops even in transportation, we remain positive. And we tried to do that very thoughtfully, so that we're improving the long-term prospects of the business as well. Yes, Jon, I would say for the most part in the non-transportation markets, we're doing pretty well. And Jon, we expect it to help us penetrate the defense markets in Europe even more. Jon, both product areas are pretty important to us and we're moving on in several end markets with each of those. And I'd tell you, if we look today, we're probably closer to a 48-52 split, so that's before Ferroperm. I think, Kieran, I heard you say that the inventory levels at the customer level is close to equilibrium now. Jon when I was talking about inventory, it was more for the distribution side of the business, which is now approximately 10% of our sales, and just saying it's getting back to more normal levels. Transportation side, we're not seeing any inventory issues and in the other markets we're doing pretty well. First of all, the bookings, Kieran pointed out in his call that a lot of the strength in the booking compared to the first quarter came from the transportation market where we don't recognize sales from those bookings for a period of time, typically two to three years. The demand environment, we are expecting stable compared to Q2, Q1 for the transportation with potential to increase. And in the rest of the end markets, we are concerned about potential softening as we go towards the end of the year. Yes, so our working capital would be about 1.5 points lower without the Ferroperm acquisition. Just on that question, well, some of the wins in EV and some of the growth in EV today is from legacy product. And we mentioned in the prepared remarks that on the EV side our first wins on new product, so with current sensing where we have had two wins. On the eBrake product, Josh, we would expect revenue only in the second half of the decade beyond 2025.\n . So, without going into the details of operating expense levels, the overall profitability of the business will be accretive to CTS. And as we work through the initial integration period, then that's when we start expecting accretion as we get towards the end of this year, early next year. And Hendi, the quality of the earnings is something we like about the business. So on the high end, we would be looking at either no softening in the other end markets to maybe very marginal softening, and transportation remaining strong to slightly growing. And you could take the inverse of that on the lower end, where the markets on the other -- non-transportation side are softening as we expect and transportation is stable. It will have some legacy, but also some new customers. And actually we have been adding some new customers in that space already, Hendi. I'm confident that our diversification strategy, bolstered by our recent M&A activities and the breadth of our geographic footprint, will position us for profitable growth while navigating the macro uncertainty we all face."
