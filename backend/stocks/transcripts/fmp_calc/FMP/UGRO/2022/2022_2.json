    "content": " Revenue was $16.3 million in the second quarter of 2022, compared to $12.8 million in the prior year period, representing an increase of $3.5 million, or 27%. Gross profit was $3.5 million, or 22% of revenue in the second quarter of 2022, compared to $2.9 million, or 23% of revenue in the prior year period. So whether it's engineering design or architecture, or a combination or the full design build, which is at a market in many different ways, the acquisition of Emerald Construction, few months ago changed everything and the response and why I'm saying about that our model strong and working is because we've got tremendous support and interest and I look forward to announcing those contracts."
