    "content": " From a growth perspective, we're focused on three key areas; one, geographic expansion; two, expansion within the CEA's food-focused vertical farming sector; and three, continued expansion of our service capabilities, not only within the CEA sector, but further diversification of revenue through our growing client base in the industrial and health care sectors as well. And while the majority of their businesses is in CEA, they also have built relationships outside, as I mentioned, the CPG group, a healthcare group, hotel chains, like there's groups they've had really strong relationships with, and we didn't want to shut that down because the margin profile is the same regardless, if it's in CEA or non-CEA, until the acquisition of Emerald, it wasn't material. It historically for us has been with the acquisition of the 2WR entities that it's been a higher percentage of that backlog that then became revenues in the subsequent quarter, partly because with obviously the services, you're not dependent on a third-party vendor to really supply you with any kind of material."
