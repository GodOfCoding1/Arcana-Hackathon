    "content": " As noted in our Q2 earnings, going forward, we focus on NGS ARR as one of our core metrics as we believe it's indicative of the return we're seeing on our growth investments and also helps investors track the growing mix of this business within our revenue. We expect next-generation security ARR to be $1.775 billion to $1.825 billion, an increase of 50% to 55% versus a very strong performance in the fourth quarter of fiscal year '21. Now in a quarter where a lot of numbers really jumped out, the one, 73% growth in $5 million-plus deals and the fact that nearly half the Global 2000 has purchased all 3 platforms really jumped out to us. And I don't want to be way too optimistic, but the fact that we were able to tide over that pandemic moment as an industry to be fair in cybersecurity, I'm less worried about it right now given what's going on in the environment because I think on the flip side, as I said, you're seeing way more security awareness and concern more than I've ever seen."
