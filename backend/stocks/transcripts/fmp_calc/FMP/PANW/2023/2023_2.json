    "content": " Let me make a case why with petabytes of data from trillions of events, billions of sessions, hundreds of millions of URLs and tens of millions of flies flowing -- files, not flies -- flowing through our product across cloud, network and endpoints daily, we are best positioned to deliver security outcomes using AI machine learning. So far, we've closed approximately $30 million in business and have a growing pipeline of customers that are looking to transform security operations of the new platform. I think the pandemic really flipped the switch, coupled with the whole cloud transformations that are going on, our customers, especially larger customers, want to create a first -- first-class citizen of any user who's not sitting in the office or in the campus, and they want to get to Zero Trust. And couple that in the case of SASE, if you look at our large pipeline, it's clearly driven by a customer of Palo Alto, who is a firewall customer, or a potential SASE customer who's saying, listen, I know your security services, I know your Zero Trust policies, I want to be able to expand into it and deploy a full end-to-end SASE solution or a Zero Trust solution for you. And what's interesting is we've seen very early, we've had 15 customers of XSIAM in the last 12 weeks, and they're all north of $1 million."
