    "content": " These headwinds include supply chain constraints due to the global COVID-19 pandemic, delayed awards of several customer contracts due to an uptick in pandemic-related travel restrictions and lack of approval of National Defense Authorization Act for government fiscal year 2022, resulting in continuing resolutions and a tight labor market. While we're pleased with our results this quarter and still expect year-over-year growth across our business, we're adjusting our guidance for the full fiscal year 2022 to account for the headwinds we expect in the second half of the fiscal year. So these challenges in aggregate, namely global supply chain constraints, ongoing pandemic-related constraints, U.S. DoD's continuing resolution and tight labor markets, have led to a slower contract award environment in general and is hindering our ability to achieve the expected full-year results we initially intended. Revenue for the second quarter of fiscal 2022 was $122 million, a 32% increase from the prior year's comparable period."
