    "content": " Good morning, everyone and welcome to Data Storage Corporation's 2022 first quarter ending March 31, 2022 business update conference call. These risks should not be construed as exhaustive and should be read together with other cautionary statements including the company's quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2022, and annual report on Form 10-K and current reports on Form 8-K files with the Securities and Exchange Commission. And we're also with distribution, we have a direct sales force, we're going to be adding to that direct sales force that's focusing on the verticals and big push towards government, but for the most part on distribution with partnerships I would say, folks that have sold the equipment or software initially, or continue to and moving them because they get an annuity for the life of the contract. When you look at the ratio between one-time sales and recurring sales, it's rounded out, it's around 80:20, 80% on the recurring side, but Flagship is also cross selling Data Storage Corporations cloud infrastructure for disaster recovery and cloud infrastructure. Matt, it's coming from channel partners that are in their own businesses, they're companies that have sales forces, or owner operator that now go into our sales force for program salesforce.com, and they can configure for themselves, the proposal and that becomes a quote and a proposal and automatically gets generated to the client or delivered to the client from the pipeline."
