    "content": " Our fourth quarter revenue was $983 million, which represented a decline of 10.9% on a reported basis versus the prior year, largely impacted by foreign currency and a stronger US dollar. We also delivered strong operating cash flow in the fourth quarter, which came in at $142 million, translating to adjusted free cash flow conversion of 110%, up from 100% conversion in the prior year. For the first quarter, we expect year-over-year organic sales growth to be approximately 1%, driven by continued strong growth in our aligners business and growth in the US offset by continued headwinds in China, which we expect to gradually improve over the remainder of the year.
