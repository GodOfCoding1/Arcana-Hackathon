    "content": " Barb will share more with you about how the key drivers of underperformance impacted the quarter's financial results, including the weaker sales performance in the U.S., global supply chain challenges and unfavorable foreign exchange rates. Our CAD/CAM business declined versus last year due to lower sales in the U.S., while it grew outside of the U.S. As shared last quarter, in Q1, we executed on our plan for Primemill to focus available supply on needed spare parts. You may now go ahead. You may now go ahead. You may now go ahead. You may now go ahead. You may now go ahead. You may now go ahead. Yes, we're very pleased on the implant side with our PrimeTaper launch that's going very well and helping to drive robust growth across all the regions and Q1 was high single-digits, and we would expect to see continued performance with the market throughout the year. You may now go ahead. You may now go ahead. And once that -- once we get past the end of the year, there's no reason to think once the COVID situation in China resumes and lockdowns are a lot less frequent or non-existent, there's no reason to believe that the business wouldn't come back to the prior levels in 2021."
