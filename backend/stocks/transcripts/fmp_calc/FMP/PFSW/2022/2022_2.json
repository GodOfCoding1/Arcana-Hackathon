    "content": " We grew PFS Operations service fee equivalent revenue by 13% year-over-year, driven by strong fulfillment demand from both new and existing clients. While we continue to experience gross margin pressures in the business, primarily from wage inflation, we also continue to target 2022 estimated PFS stand-alone adjusted EBITDA percentage of service fee equivalent revenue within the range of 8% to 10%. While this represents a sequential improvement relative to the first quarter of this year, the year-over-year margin decrease primarily reflects the continued impacts of industry-wide wage inflation pressures and reduced higher-margin nonfulfillment-related revenue, such as technology-related services and project activity. As I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve shared on our past calls, we are executing a three-pronged approach to maintaining our top line growth momentum, which comprises the following initiatives: one, expanding our multimode fulfillment strategy to better serve our clients\u00e2\u0080\u0099 customers; two, converting our strong sales pipeline for continued growth; and three, driving our Fulfillment-as-a-Service product offering to allow for more dynamic and flexible fulfillment networks."
