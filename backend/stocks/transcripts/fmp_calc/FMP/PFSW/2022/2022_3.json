    "content": " Based on sustained strong consumer and fulfillment service demand across our core verticals, we are maintaining our previously stated 2022 financial outlook, which targets 2022 PFS annual service fee equivalent revenue growth in the range of 5% to 10%. As we continue working to mitigate wage inflation pressures on our service fee gross margin, we are also continuing to target estimated pro forma PFS stand-alone adjusted EBITDA percentage of service fee equivalent revenue to be within the range of 8% to 10%. So I think, James, the trends that we're seeing in the business currently around our ability to perform within the targeted gross margin range, mitigate any of the cost pressures that we do experience as we've done over the past couple of quarters and expect to continue to do as we move into Q4, those trends should continue into next year."
