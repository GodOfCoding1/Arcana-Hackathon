As you will see in our non-GAAP PFS presentation, our Q4 2022 service fee equivalent revenue, or SFE revenue increased 4% to 65.6 million compared to 63.1 million during the year ago period. We also expect annual total company consolidated adjusted EBITDA to be within the range of 6% to 8% as a percentage of service fee revenue, inclusive of our remaining public company costs, excluding our estimated public company related costs, we expect total company adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of service fee revenue to range between 8% to 10% of service fee revenue in 2023."
