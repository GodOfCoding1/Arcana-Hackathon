    "content": " VITAS\u00e2\u0080\u0099 net revenue was $308 million in the fourth quarter of 2022, which is a decline of 2.5% when compared to the prior year period. This revenue decline is comprised primarily of a 2.8% reduction in our days of care in a geographically weighted average Medicare reimbursement rate increase of approximately 3.2%, partially offset by 200 basis points as a result of CMS reimplementing the 2% sequestration cut that was suspended at the start of the pandemic in 2020. Adjusted EBITDA margin in the quarter, excluding Medicare Cap and other discrete items, was 19.8%, which is 189 basis points below the prior year period. Again, the adjusted EBITDA margin was negatively impacted by 200 basis points for the reimplementation of sequestration and an additional approximately 141 basis points due to the increased staffing and patient capacity from VITAS\u00e2\u0080\u0099 hiring and retention program. Roto-Rooter generated revenue of $239 million in the fourth quarter of 2022, an increase of 6.1% when compared to the prior year. In 2022, quarterly excavation growth was 5.9% in the first quarter, a slight decline of one-tenth of one percent in the second, an increase of nine-tenths of one percent in the third quarter and growth of 4.9% in the fourth quarter of the year. Adjusted EBITDA margin in the fourth quarter of 2022 totaled $69.3 million, which is an increase of 11.4%. And Joanna, if you think about it, so we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re guiding adjusted EBITDA margin ex cap in the retention program for VITAS of about 16.3% to 16.6%, but let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just go back to the last full year we had before the pandemic."
