    "content": " The increase in inventory was driven by overall cost increases and strong sales growth, combined with additional inventory on hand as a result of increased in-transit times and distribution and fulfillment challenges experienced in the second half of 2021. inventories are down from the end of last quarter slightly, including a $45 million reduction in in-transit inventory as we expect to realign inventory levels with sales growth and inventory purchasing strategies over the coming quarters."
