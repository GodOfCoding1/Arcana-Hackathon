    "content": " We received royalties of 50% of the net sales of OMIDRIA in the US, until the earlier of either January 1, 2025, or the payment of the $200 million milestone. As Greg discussed earlier, on September 30, we entered into an agreement with DRI whereby we received $125 million upon closing and are obligated to pay DRI up to $188 million out of the monthly royalties on OMIDRIA net sales between September 1, 2022 and December 31, 2030. We recorded $37 million of income in discontinued operations in our third quarter income statement, recognizing for accounting purposes, the $8 million of interest earned on the amended contract for the asset and $29 million in the remeasurement adjustments to the OMIDRIA contract royalty asset based primarily on the increase in OMIDRIA sales that we're seeing. One moment for our next question. One moment for our next question. We know that what we've seen with narsoplimab, it clearly exceeds particularly given the severity of the patients that we treated with narsoplimab clearly exceeds what's in the literature, and we think that likely the literature is reflective and frankly, likely over reflective of what is happening in the real world, just given publication bias, which would usually don't publish negative data as you know. One moment for our next question. One moment for our next question. One moment for our next question."
