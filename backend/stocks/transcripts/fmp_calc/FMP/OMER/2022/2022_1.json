    "content": " Also, under the terms of the Rayner transaction Omeros is eligible to receive a $200 million milestone, if before 2025, separate payment for OMIDRIA is secured for a continuous period of at least four years. One vehicle through which the $200 million milestone could be achieved is the enactment of the NOPAIN Act, which has been introduced in both chambers of commerce, and would provide separate payment for a renewable period of five years for non-opioid pain management drugs like OMIDRIA in ambulatory surgery centers or ASCs, as well as in hospital outpatient departments or HOPDs. As you may recall from our year-end earnings call, upon the closing of the Rayner transaction we recorded a $185 million OMIDRIA contract royalty asset, which represents the minimum expected net present value of future US royalty payments."
