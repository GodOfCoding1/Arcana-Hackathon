    "content": " Based on these data, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re developing a multiplex high throughput assay platform as a commercially available tool for hospitals and physicians to reduce morbidity and mortality by identifying COVID-19 patients at risk for becoming severely ill. Let's now discuss more broadly our MASP-2 program which as of this week, has two molecules in clinical trials. Given the required reclassification of OMIDRIA revenues and expenses, our revenues for the second quarter were reported as zero, and our net loss from continuing operations was $41.7 million, compared to $50.2 million in the prior year quarter. Under the terms of the Rayner transaction, Omeros is also eligible to receive a $200 million milestone should before 2025 separate payment be secured for OMIDRIA for a continuous period of at least four years. Omeros will continue to receive royalties of 50% on net sales of OMIDRIA in the U.S. until the earlier week of January 1 2025, or the payment of the $200 million milestone."
