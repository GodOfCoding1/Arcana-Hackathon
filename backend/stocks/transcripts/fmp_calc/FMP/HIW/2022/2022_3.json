    "content": " Even with $0.01 to $0.02 per share of higher anticipated interest expense in the fourth quarter the new range implies a midpoint of $4.03 per share, up 3.5% from last year on an apples-to-apples basis, excluding land sales. And as we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve talked about, we think that that headwind probably dissipates sometime over the next few quarters, because as expenses continue to move up, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to get back to the normalized expense levels where we were pre COVID, which means our recovery rates will be much higher on any future increases in expenses. So if I normalize for both kind of the higher expenses, net of recovery and the impact of higher straight-line rent, we think \u00e2\u0080\u0093 if you think \u00e2\u0080\u0093 if we look at the core of what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going on with same store, those trends are very positive and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s very much in the long-term range of where we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve grown at about positive 2.5% to 3% a year. And Michael, I'll just \u00e2\u0080\u0093 just from a balance sheet perspective, so without regard for the merits of any additional investment, I think when we look at our balance sheet and stress test that, as I mentioned just in the prepared remarks, we don't think that we will be above 6x based on \u00e2\u0080\u0093 6x debt-to-EBITDA based on the planned development spending that we have going forward."
