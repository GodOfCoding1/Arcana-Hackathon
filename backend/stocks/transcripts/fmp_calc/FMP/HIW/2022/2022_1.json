    "content": " The increase in the first quarter compared to the fourth quarter was attributable to the following: higher NOI contributed $0.04, including the aforementioned term fee; the remaining $0.03 increase was driven by higher average occupancy and lower OpEx; and lower expense contributed $0.01, primarily attributable to lower average debt balances, which were primarily offset by $0.03 of higher G&A, mostly due to the accounting impact of our annual long-term incentive grants, which are customarily made in the first quarter each year."
