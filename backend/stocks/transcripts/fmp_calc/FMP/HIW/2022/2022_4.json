    "content": " Second, in terms of volume for the quarter, Nashville signed 225,000 square feet and is nearing the finish line on hybridizing almost 1 million square feet of assets in Brentwood and Cool Springs, the two BBDs that garner the majority of leasing activity for the entire national market in 2022. The December acquisition of McKinney and Olive, a 550,000 square foot 99% leased tower in the heart of Dallas' uptown BBD, which was tops in the market for annual absorption and rental growth for 2022, we're on track for Dallas to contribute 6% of pro forma NOI to our bottom-line, following the completion and stabilization of our two development projects. And then we've got a couple of single tenant transactions in the market, but it's going to be a mix of typically what we've done in the last two or three large transactions where we go out and sell -- go out and buy an asset like we did in McKinney & Olive flex up a little bit and then pay off bring the balance sheet back down over time. That's as a reminder in the Plano, Frisco submarket 50-50 joint venture with Granite Properties a local sharpshooter that we're thrilled to be partners with that delivers in the fourth quarter so sort of towards the end of the year 12% pre-leased."
