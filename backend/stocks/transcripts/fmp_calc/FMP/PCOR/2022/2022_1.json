    "content": " And it's especially rewarding to see how Procore is helping our customers build more scalable and efficient businesses so they can tackle the industry's biggest challenges and focus on what they do best, which is building the world around us. I think when we think about the data that the Procore platform generates, that there's a tremendous amount of opportunities to help make our customers more efficient across a broader spectrum, everything from cost to safety to schedule. And the other thing is just because the industry is so large, and again, back to my supply and demand discrepancy, and there's so much demand for what needs to get built, we think that interest rates would have to go wildly out of control in order for us to even begin to see some sort of an impact on Procore. The other side I would talk about that you've heard me say a lot is that when we then think about the value of the cross-sell and how we get customers to want to adopt more products, it is less about calling out a specific product and more about how we continue to weave together these different workflows across products and drive that value."
