    "content": " Strong steady increases in the number of new surgeon users ending Q4 were 2,387 active surgeons, which is an increase of 604 during the year, up 34% year-over-year, a year-over-year increase in trailing 12-month surgeon utilization with an average of 10.3 kits per active surgeon in Q4 up from 9.8 kits a year ago and strong blended average selling prices of $5,907 per Lapiplasty kits sold in the quarter, representing 10% growth over the prior year, due to steadily increasing contribution from our Adductoplasty Midfoot Correction System, as well as our more recently commercialized   and our TriTome tissue instruments. As of the fourth quarter, our active surgeon base, which includes surgeons who performed at least one case in the trailing 12-months, has achieved approximately 24% penetration of the estimated 10,000 Foot and Ankle Surgeons who perform bunion surgery in the U.S. As our surgeon base continues to mature, we look forward to utilization gains with increased use of our Lapiplasty and Adductoplasty systems, as well as further adoption of our growing portfolio of complementary products, all supported by our expanding direct sales channel and patient awareness DTC initiatives."
