    "content": " Strong, steady increases in the number of new surgeon users, ending Q3 with 2,218 active surgeons, up 39% year-over-year; a year-over-year increase in trailing 12-month surgeon utilization with 10.1 kits per surgeon in Q3, up from 10.0 kits a year ago; and strong blended average selling prices of $5,794 per case, representing 6% growth over the prior year due to continued adoption of our Lapiplasty Mini-Incision System, complemented by increasing utilization of our Adductoplasty Midfoot Correction System and from early benefit from our very recently commercialized technologies, specifically our S4A Anatomic Plating System and SpeedRelease and TriTome tissue release instruments. As of the third quarter, our active surgeon base, which includes surgeons who performed at least one case in the trailing 12 months, has now achieved 22% penetration of the estimated 10,000 foot and ankle surgeons who perform bunion surgery in the U.S. As our surgeon base continues to mature, we look forward to utilization gains, not only with increased use of Lapiplasty but also our Adductoplasty system as well as further adoption of our growing portfolio of complementary ancillary products, all supported by our expanding direct sales channel and patient education and awareness initiatives."
