    "content": " We are extremely pleased by not only our top line growth but the continued positive trends in our underlying growth metrics, including our expanding direct focused bunion sales team, which accounted for 63% of our revenue mix in Q1; strong increases in the number of new surgeon users ending Q1 with 1,901 active users, up 40% year-over-year; continued year-over-year increases in surgeon utilization with 10.1 kits per surgeon used in Q1, up from 9.2 kits a year ago, representing an approximate 10% increase. Data on a total of 173 study patients, including 117 patients with at least 12 months and 40 patients with at least 24-month follow-up demonstrated early return to weight-bearing in a walking boot at an average of just 7.8 days; return to work within 25 days and to full unrestricted activity within 4 months post-surgery, on average; and significant improvement in radiographic measures of 3-dimensional bunion correction from pre-surgery to 6 weeks and maintained at 12 months for 108 reporting patients and 24 months for 38 reporting patients post-surgery and with 1 recurrence reported at the 12-month time point post-surgery for a 0.9% recurrence rate."
