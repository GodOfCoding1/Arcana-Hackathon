    "content": "  As of the second quarter, our active surgeon base, which includes surgeons who performed at least one case in the trailing 12 months, has now reached 20% penetration of the estimated 10,000 foot and ankle surgeons who perform bunion surgery in the U.S. As our surgeon base continues to mature, we look forward to surgeon utilization gains, not only with increasing use of Lapiplasty technology but also our Adductoplasty system and the adoption of our growing portfolio of complementary ancillary products, supported by our expanding direct sales channel as well as our patient education and awareness initiatives, which we believe help patients learn about our procedures and connect them with knowledgeable surgeons. Continued year-over-year increases in surgeon utilization with 10.1 kits per surgeon in Q2, up from 9.8 kits a year ago and strong blended average selling prices of $5,711 per case, representing 5% growth over the prior year due to positive uptake of our newer innovations such as the Lapiplasty Mini-Incision system and our Adductoplasty system for mid-foot correction and as our direct reps leverage their position in the OR and increasingly displaced competitive forefoot products with our complementary ancillary products."
