    "content": " Our average revenue per case for the quarter was $13,500, a 7% increase over the previous year's quarter and we are pleased that our average revenue per case on a sequential basis has remained consistent. Adjusted EBITDA included approximately $1.8 million of public company-related costs, which did not exist in the prior year quarter as we were a private company. We invested $4.6 million during the quarter, primarily related to opening new centers and purchasing equipment as part of our rollout of AirSculpt+, and our cash flow from financing activities was a use of $23.4 million, primarily due to paying the special dividend of $22.8 million during the quarter. Please proceed with your question. And if you kind of look at 120 days of physician vacations, kind of our average sort of estimate of a couple of procedures a day at our current rates, you can kind of get into that sort of estimate of an impact of close to $3 million in the quarter. Please proceed with your question. Please proceed with your question. So the number we've shared, John, was \u00e2\u0080\u0093 the impact in the quarter was about $3 million from doctors' vacations when we go back and look at the schedule and the days they were out And one of the things, too, that hit us, and Ron and Dr. Rollins, I think, both spoke of it in their comments as it relate to the de novo timing, we saw about $1 million impact from de novos that we'd expected to come on a little bit sooner. Please proceed with your question. Please proceed with your question."
