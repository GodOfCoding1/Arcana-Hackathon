    "content": " Our average revenue per case for the quarter was $12,200, a 6% decrease over the prior year's quarter driven by both procedure mix and some promotional activities, but we're still within our target range of $12,000 to $13,000. For the quarter, our adjusted EBITDA was $9 million and our adjusted EBITDA margin was 22.1%, which was a decline versus the prior year quarter and lower than our expectations, primarily due to our revenue per case being on the lower end of our projected range and a lack of progress related to rightsizing some of our infrastructure costs. Our adjusted EBITDA guidance is $48 million to $50 million, which represents year-over-year growth of 11% to 16% and margins of approximately 26% at the midpoint of both revenue and EBITDA guidance. Please proceed with your question. Please proceed with your question. And we think we'll probably get a couple million in year for that potentially we think on a run rate basis we're looking close to $5 million, so we're really taking a deep, deep dive into that. Please proceed with your question. Please proceed with your question."
