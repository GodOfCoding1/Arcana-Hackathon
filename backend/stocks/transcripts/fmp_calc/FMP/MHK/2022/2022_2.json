    "content": " Operating income as percentage of sales was 11.7%, which is a 220 basis point decrease versus the prior year, driven by lower volume as the business drove price, mix and productivity initiatives to offset significant year-over-year inflation and the impact of temporary plant shutdowns and FX. Operating margins percentage of sales was 9.1%, which is 210 basis points decrease versus prior year, as improvements in price mix and productivity initiatives were unable to compensate for the lower overall volumes and increased input costs, primarily in raw materials due to year-over-year inflation."
