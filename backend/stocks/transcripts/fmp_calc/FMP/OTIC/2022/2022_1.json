    "content": " Beginning with the OTO-413 Phase 2a results, this trial demonstrated that a single intratympanic injection of 0.3 milligram of OTO-413 provided clinically meaningful treatment benefit versus placebo across multiple speech-in-noise hearing tests as well as the Patient Global Impression of Change at consecutive time points of day 57 and day 85. Taken together, with the speech-in-noise data, we believe these results demonstrate a clear clinical signal for OTO-413 versus placebo when evaluated and presented in the same way as a successful Phase 1/2 trial, a finding further strengthened by repeated observation across two independent study populations. The primary endpoint is the same as reported for the successful Phase 1/2 trial, a responder analysis based on the proportion of patients who report a clinically meaningful improvement in the Tinnitus Functional Index, or TFI, from baseline to months one and two following treatment. And I think you can consider the -- looking at the initial levels of speech intelligibility impact that these patients have as being one of those potential criteria as we've done with the 313 study and program where we've increased the level of tinnitus required for entry, I think it's a very similar here. With regards to the time point since onset of tinnitus and its impact, clearly, in the Phase 1/2, we looked at patients that were 6 months or less, and we saw, obviously, the data that we've reported, which is a very clear benefit for 313 over placebo."
