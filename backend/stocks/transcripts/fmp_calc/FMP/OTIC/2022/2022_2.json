    "content": " So yes, so in terms of minimizing the placebo response, several steps that we've taken, first of all, I think it's important that it is a one-to-one randomization that does help based on historically looking at literature on placebo response, when you have more than two arms, the more arms you have tend to cause more placebo response. And then I think the final thing that really helps in terms of addressing placebo response is the multiple time points required to demonstrate that improvement in their tinnitus, that is that we require improvements at both day at both month one and at month two. As I mentioned, unlike the 313, where it is a safety evaluation, although we will have to TFI in one month, so we will be able to look into tinnitus, the patients weren't actually randomized to the same inclusion exclusion criteria that we had in the Phase 2 for tinnitus. And we think that's important as well for screening out maybe patients who are not really responding to the questionnaire appropriately, that will help us then address that placebo response as well. And I think I just point out, remember that there was only one patient that really drove placebo response as we looked at the higher levels of response and clinically meaningfulness in the Phase 1/2, so it was a very stark contrast with just that really one patient driving placebo response there. But I think it is a difficult thing when you are depending on what we see there, whether the ears respond differently, how that impacts the TFI, which is, of course, why in the Phase 2 trial, we've remained focused on only unilateral patients, it makes it a much cleaner study, we believe and really being able to look at that efficacy end point, clearly."
