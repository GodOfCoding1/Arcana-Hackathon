    "content": " So while shorter routes may not present construction at any given time and therefore, could be traversed by an autonomous vehicle without deep construction capabilities, to truly deliver on the promise of autonomous long-haul trucking, it's imperative for the Aurora Driver to be able to navigate these complex driving scenarios. As we continue to execute on our technical road map, we expect to continue to drive our policy intervention rate down and demonstrate capability specific progress like we've seen with our construction handling as we work towards launching Aurora Horizon, our trucking product in late 2023. We think that the strategy we're taking is the right one, this entering through trucking, where we see much -- a very clear demand, we believe it's going to be easier to scale operationally the business there and the economics we think are stronger than in ride-hailing."
