    "content": " For the balance of 2022 and the first quarter of 2023, our technical development work will focus on releasing the remaining capabilities that we expect Aurora driver will require like to drive commercial loads on our launch lanes. And turning to our pilots during the second quarter, we doubled our commercial miles driven across our pilots and lanes and also saw improved autonomy performance when compared to the first quarter, further demonstrating our progress towards the commercial launch of the aurora driver. This week we're launching our fourth pilot, Aurora powered trucks will autonomously haul freight under the supervision of vehicle operators for Schneider National, one of the industry's largest multimodal transportation providers. I guess first off, Chris, I just wanted to make sure I understood kind of your latest expectations around the timetable for commercializing the trucking product, it seems like you guys are tracking ahead of schedule on some of the technical milestones like fault management and the FedEx collaborations."
