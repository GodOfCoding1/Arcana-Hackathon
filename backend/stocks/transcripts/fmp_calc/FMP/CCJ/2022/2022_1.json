    "content": " Looking at where the market is today, and the growing risks to supply and origin of supply, it's easy to conclude that the current nuclear fuel market is more positive than we have seen in a very long time. And as we said in the comments just a few minutes ago, there's nothing like a security supply-driven market transition and signing contracts with great customers for a term, it's 5 or 10 years. That Russian replacement demand really hasn't hit conversion or uranium yet, which is the feedstock required to meet that new enrichment capacity that's being called for. It's something that we see now as kind of a triple threat for us with the discussion we're having this morning where you take 40% of the world's enrichment kind of tuck it away and say it's not available to the Western markets, all of a sudden, everybody is looking for enrichment."
