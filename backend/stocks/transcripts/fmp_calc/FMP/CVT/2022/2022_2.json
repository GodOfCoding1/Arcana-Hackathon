    "content": " While revenue associated with our virtual solution is still one of our top of event cloud revenue components, the acceleration in revenue growth in the quarter was the result of the return of in-person events and in comparison to a prior year period, when in-person events revenue was de minimis. Deferred revenue at the end of the second quarter was $268.6 million, an increase of 11.1% compared to the second quarter of the prior year due to year-over-year bookings growth across the business. As a result of our strong second quarter revenue results, we are increasing our full year 2022 revenue range to $624.9 million to $628.4 million, up 20.8% compared to the prior year at the midpoint and reflects a $2.6 million raise over the midpoint of the guidance, we shared in our last earnings call in early May. But on the Event Cloud obviously we've got a really big pivot when it comes to, what we call the triple threat where we can do not only in-person like we used to do pre-pandemic, but now we've got hybrid and virtual and there's just a lot more engagement and things that our clients are going to want to do there. And so yes I think there's probably -- it could outpace the revenue growth, it's not going to outpace it by a lot because our focus moving forward is our plan that we shared with the pipes back in May of 2021 is that we were going to expand margins and the plan was to do that starting the second half of 2022 and that's as you can see what we've been starting to do."
