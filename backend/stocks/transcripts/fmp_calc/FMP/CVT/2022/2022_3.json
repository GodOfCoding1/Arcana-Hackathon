    "content": " To prepare for more in-person events in 2023, a top cloud computing company and one of the fastest-growing SaaS companies in history, grew their total contract value in Q3 from $5,000 to nearly $1 million. Non-GAAP gross profit in Q3 was $117.4 million or 72.7% of revenue compared to 74.7% in the same period of the prior year due to a higher percentage of our total revenue in the quarter coming from onsite solutions and merchant services, which have lower margin profiles. As a result of our Q3 2022 beat, we are increasing our full year guidance range to $628.9 million to $629.9 million, up 21.3% compared to the prior year at the midpoint and reflecting a $2.8 million increase of the midpoint of the guidance we shared in our last earnings call in August. And we were talking about their saying what are other customers saying, but I think in the end, people are firmly committed to events and they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re trying to figure out if there is budget cuts, let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s say, for certain company, they could always do less in person, more virtual, because it tends to be less expensive."
