    "content": " Both Golden Ridge and MGI, are executing very well and generating strong top line growth and we saw double-digit growth in Core-SRB sales for the third quarter in a row. Second, our value-add SRB derivatives business while resolving the production issues we saw in the second quarter and beginning to catch up on its sales backlog, generated another quarter of negative contribution margin for the reasons Peter highlighted in his remarks. Adjusted EBITDA losses were $1.4 million in the third quarter, compared to adjusted EBITDA losses of $1.1 million a year ago. It's been a long haul but continuous improvements in operations, the completion of capital upgrades and most notably the installation of the new operating partner for Golden Ridge who can execute the primary book of business should turn these businesses collectively into a solid source of adjusted EBITDA that was envisaged when they were acquired."
