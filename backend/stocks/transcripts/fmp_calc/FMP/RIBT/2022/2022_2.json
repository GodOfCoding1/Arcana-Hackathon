    "content": " Importantly, this isolated challenge we store in our value-add derivatives business during the quarter, does not diminish our optimism and confidence that we have built a platform for profitable growth, strong growth in our core-SRB business and MGI in the second half of the year, supported by new customer wins, and largely completed capacity expansion, and return to normal operations for our value-add derivatives business, and the potential for a strategic dilution to Golden Ridge to drive significant improvement in our financial results in the second half, progressing for further improvement in 2023 and beyond."
