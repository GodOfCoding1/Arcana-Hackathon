    "content": " Total written sales for our retail segments were up 8% versus last year's third quarter, and same-store written sales comp at a positive 3% for the period. Against the pre-pandemic fiscal 2020 third quarter, total written sales for the retail business were up 22% and same-store written results were up 12% reflecting the sustained strengthening of our company owned stores. Turning to Joybird, while written sales were up 80% versus a pre pandemic fiscal 2020 third quarter, they were down 21% versus last year's Q3. On a consolidated basis, fiscal 2023 third quarter sales increased to $573 million versus the prior year quarter with pricing and surcharge actions and the positive effects of product and channel mix offsetting lower unit volume. Consolidated GAAP operating income increased to $43 million and non-GAAP operating income increased to $53 million, a record for a third quarter and an increase of 34% versus last year third quarter, primarily driven by strong performance in our retail segment. Operating margin increased to best ever 17.6% versus 12.2% in the prior year quarter, driven by higher delivered sales relative to selling expenses and fixed costs. For the quarter, delivered sales in our wholesale segment were $408 million, a 4% decline compared with the prior year period, driven primarily by a decline in delivered volume, partially offset by pricing and favorable channel and product mix. Consolidated gross margin for the quarter increased 480 basis points versus the prior year period and increased 60 basis points sequentially from Q2, primarily driven by the changes to our consolidated business mix with retail becoming a larger portion and carrying a higher gross margin than our wholesale business."
