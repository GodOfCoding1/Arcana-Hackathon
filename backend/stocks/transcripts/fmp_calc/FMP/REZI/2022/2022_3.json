Included in our third quarter results was an $8 million benefit associated with the tax indemnification accrual release and $17 million of costs related to a litigation matter that arose prior to our spin-off from Honeywell, as well as the impact of the sale of ADI\u00e2\u0080\u0099s India operations. Products & Solutions third quarter revenue of $707 million was up 12%, excluding $112 million from acquisitions and approximately $30 million of unfavorable foreign exchange impact. Products & Solutions\u00e2\u0080\u0099 operating profit was $124 million or 17.5% of sales, compared with $157 million or 24.9% of sales last year. Operating expenses for Products & Solutions were up $27 million year-over-year due to the $26 million in First Alert costs, as well as planned increases in R&D investments, offset by lower other SG&A. For the full year 2022, we now expect revenue to be in the range of $6.36 billion to $6.41 billion, implying year-over-year growth of 9% at the midpoint, consolidated gross margin is expected to be in the range of 27% to 28% and GAAP operating profit is expected to be in the range of $645 million to $655 million, implying 16% annual growth at the midpoint."
