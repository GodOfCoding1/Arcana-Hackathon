    "content": " At ADI, it\u2019s a different story, the supply constrain is with our suppliers and I would say incrementally that is, has gotten a little more challenging over the last couple of quarters, to the point where ADI's revenue growth in this quarter was constrained a bit by their inability to get product that they had orders for, and that's a little bit different right, just because of the different dynamic of the business. First Alert\u2019s gross margins are \u2013 they are accretive to the aggregate gross margins, but they are slightly dilutive to products and solutions gross margins at this point, because you know we\u2019re still \u2013 you know we're still working through the integration and we still got our synergy planned to drive through that. When you look at the numbers, if you look at the 325 of revenue at 25 a LOI for the year, that 25 LOI includes $10 million of integration costs, where you know because of the way we report, we\u2019re burdening First Alert with the integration costs."
