    "content": " Consolidated operating expenses grew by $16 million or 6%, reflecting $22 million from the addition of First Alert as well as continued planned investment in both businesses, all partially offset by lower corporate costs. ADI gross margin in the second quarter was again strong at 20%, up from 17.4% last year, reflecting improved product line margin, increased private brands contribution and the strong pricing environment. I think Tony really captured that well because as we're talking here on this particular question, ADI's success and execution on their digital expansion, their private label \u00e2\u0080\u0093 private brands expansion, they're on a very good trajectory and can help in a big way, manage that as we \u00e2\u0080\u0093 when the time comes that we start to see things change on the inflationary front."
