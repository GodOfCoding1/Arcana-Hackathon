    "content": " Looking at things segmentally starting with a brief recap of AMP global beverage can shipments grew by 1% in the quarter, reflecting a strong prior year comparable and driven by growth of 3% to North America. AMP today guided full year 2022 adjusted EBITDA of the order of 750 million, compared to previous guidance of 775 million, principally due to the increase in food costs seen in Europe in recent months. If I turn to glass packaging, shipments during the quarter increased by 6% compared to the same period last year, with double-digit growth in glass packaging Europe and the stable year-on-year out turning glass North America. Adjusted EBITDA of 108 million for the quarter was approximately 10% or 12 million below our expectation at the time, we last updated the market and this was due to higher energy and other costs in Europe and weaker than expected operating performance and higher costs in North America. In Glass North America, first quarter revenue was $438 million, an increase of 3% in the same period last year, shipments for the quarter were broadly in line with the prior year. We now anticipate full year 2022 adjusted EBITDA of the order of $1.27 billion, compared with previous guidance of $1.35 billion and including Console from 1 May, full year 2022 EBITDA is expected to be on the order of 1.4 billion, of which 750 million comes from AMP. But what I'm saying is that, there may well be to the extent that we don't recover costs and there's many costs here much more than just energy, you've got other input costs, like soda ash, like , like packaging materials, et cetera."
