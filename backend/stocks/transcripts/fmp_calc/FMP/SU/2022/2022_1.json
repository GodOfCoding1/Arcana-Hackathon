    "content": " Suncor's Board of Directors approved a quarterly dividend of $0.47 per share, which represents an increase of 12% over the prior quarter dividend and is the highest quarterly dividend per share in the company's history. With $4.1 billion of adjusted funds from operations for the first quarter, Suncor posted the highest quarterly cash flow in its history, beating the prior record set in Q4 of 2021 by over 30% on an absolute and per share basis. As Mark noted, our adjusted funds from operations per share of $2.86 is a 30% improvement compared to our previous quarterly record, which we just set in Q4 of last year and is more than double last year's results. These operating results with progress on our $2 billion of free funds flow program, are foundational to our confidence in delivering our capital allocation goals, including a record dividend of $0.47 per share, a 10% share buyback for this year and allocating an increasing proportion of free funds flow to shareholder returns. Once we get to the $9 billion, we've talked about -- and that allows us to devote all free funds flow to 100% of it to shareholder returns. And that's why we're able to come out and say, look, we expect to be at $12 billion of net debt by the end of this year and bought back substantially more shares than we would have expected as a matter of fact."
