    "content": " The company reported consolidated operating income of $8.4 million for the first quarter of 2022 compared to $15.4 million in the prior year period, a decrease of 45.5%, primarily due to the significant inflation of raw product costs, new business start-up costs and operational transformation expenses. Our Vehicle Solutions segment delivered first quarter revenues of $140.2 million, an increase of 13% as compared to the prior year ago first quarter, primarily due to material cost pass-throughs and new business wins, offset by shipment disruptions from China."
