    "content": " Our gross margin decreased a little bit to 8.7% compared to 13.3% in the second quarter of 2021, primarily due to a lag in price increases to offset cost inflation and $2.9 million of new business start-up costs, which we expect to have peaked this quarter. The company reported consolidated operating income of $6.2 million for the second quarter of 2022 compared to $16.3 million in the prior year period, primarily due to the previously mentioned lag in price increases combined with $2.9 million of business start-up costs and $1.8 million of restructuring expenses due to our continued execution of our core business optimization. Operating income for the second quarter was $1.5 million, a decrease compared to operating income of $8.2 million compared to the prior year, primarily resulting from the expected lag in our increased pricing to offset costs and increases in new business start-up costs."
