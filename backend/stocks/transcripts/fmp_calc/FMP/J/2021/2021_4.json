    "content": " During the presentation, we will be making forward-looking statements, including the anticipated timing of the impact of the recently signed U.S. Infrastructure Bill, benefits of our strategic investments in PA Consulting and our financial outlook, among others. We are also providing pro forma net revenue comparisons, which also exclude the impact of the extra week in Q4 fiscal 2020. Speaking on today\u2019s call will be Jacobs\u2019 Chair and CEO, Steve Demetriou; President and Chief Operating Officer, Bob Pragada; and President and Chief Financial Officer, Kevin Berryman. Kevin will provide a more in-depth discussion of our financial results, followed by an update on our Focus 2023 and M&A initiatives, as well as a review of our balance sheet and cash flow. Turning to slide four, before I review our results, I\u2019d like to share that we are in the final stages of completing our new strategy. First, we are putting in place a purpose-driven roadmap rooted in our values and strong culture to maximize our next stage of growth. Secondly, we identified and have aligned investment resources to capture three multi-decade growth opportunities, global infrastructure modernization, climate response and the digitization of industry. And third, we are taking a transformational approach to executing against these opportunities as we are unlocking the innovation engine at Jacobs, expanding our technology ecosystem, while accelerating our trajectory of profitable growth and durable cash flow generation. Now turning to our financial results, I am pleased with our strong fourth quarter and fiscal year performance, with net revenue increasing 7% year-over-year. More importantly, PA delivered this growth, while maintaining adjusted operating profit margins up 24%. For the full year, PA revenue surpassed $1 billion, far exceeding our deal investment model. As we look at overall Jacobs growth going forward, we now have certainty surrounding the unprecedented U.S. infrastructure funding with the passage of the $1.2 trillion Infrastructure and Jobs Act last week. And more broadly, global infrastructure modernization and national security needs are accelerating as our government and commercial clients address the challenges of climate change, advancement of their digitization strategies and increasing cyber threats. On top of that, our advanced facilities business is expected to show significant growth, driven by the need for additional semiconductor manufacturing capacity and post-pandemic life sciences priorities. Given these strong growth dynamics, we are introducing fiscal 2022 guidance for double-digit adjusted EBITDA growth. Looking beyond 2022, we expect our strong organic growth to result in approximately $10 per share of adjusted EPS in fiscal year 2025. We engaged in activities to accelerate solutions to ensure the world stays on track to meet the critical 1.5 degree Celsius trajectory, while preparing to adapt to the changes already locked in from climate change. As we move to slide six, given the nature of our business, it\u2019s clear that Jacobs\u2019 greatest opportunity to positively address climate change comes from a sustainable and resilient solutions that we co-create and deliver in partnership with our clients. To spearhead this effort, we have established a new Office of Global Climate Response on ESG to ensure that sustainability is woven into all of our solutions across markets and geographies. We are accelerating our established partnerships with the public and private sector to advance net zero carbon outcomes, climate resilience, natural and social capital, as well as ESG business transformation and alignment with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. Annually, we generate approximately $5 billion of ESG-related revenue and expect to grow significantly over the next several years, driven by strong capability in energy transition, decarbonization, climate adaptation and natural resource stewardship. During the fourth quarter, our CMS business continued its strong performance. Total CMS backlog increased 16% year-over-year, 7% on a pro forma basis to $10.6 billion, driven by our strategic new wins in cyber and intel, and nuclear and remediation. Three market trends that we see offering continued strong growth include cyber, commercial space and 5G technology for national security. The funding for addressing these threats are partially reflected in the unclassified federal government spending on cyber in FY 2022, which is expected to be over $20 billion, up 10% from prior year. During the quarter, we were awarded a $300 million seven-year contract with the National Geospatial Intelligence Agency to modernize the NGA\u2019s ability to rapidly gain and share insights from cross-domain imagery, including top secret data classification. And within the classified budget, we are awarded $170 million five-year new contract to develop highly secure and hardened software applications that are leveraging the latest advances in AI and machine learning. Our strong presence across the DoD and intelligence community, as well as our Digital Enablement Center, will provide the escape velocity for BlackLynx to commercialize and scale their solutions, resulting in highly profitable recurring revenue. Moving on to space, with a significant amount of capital being infused into the commercial space companies, the affordability of space tourism is becoming a reality, as well as other emerging opportunities such as acceleration of satellite-based technologies and the need to understand the impact of space debris. The U.S. Space Force selected Jacobs for a five-year contract to provide software and system support for its Patriot Excalibur System, which coordinates the scheduling, training and status of U.S. Space Force aircraft. Finally, our telecom business has had a strong quarter and we see the roll out of 5G investment from clients like AT&T, Verizon, DirecTV, T-Mobile and Dish Network accelerating in 2022 and beyond. In addition, the new bipartisan infrastructure bill includes $2.5 billion for 5G rollout at U.S. military bases and the DoD is investing heavily in 5G technology in support of national priorities. The CMS sales pipeline remains robust with the next 18-month qualified new business opportunities remaining above $30 billion, which includes $10 billion in source selection with an increasing margin profile. I will discuss our results across the major themes of climate response, pandemic solutions, infrastructure modernization and digitization. Starting with climate response, as the top ranked global environmental consulting firm, Jacobs is leading the effort to mitigate the impacts of climate emergency, advance transition to a clean energy net zero economy and rapidly respond to natural disasters. This quarter, Jacobs was awarded a multiyear contract by the U.S. Army Engineer Research and Development Center to integrate nature-based solutions that grow climate resilience across Defense Department facilities. Jacobs has recently been selected to reimagine New York\u2019s Rikers Island, taking the state through a full community revitalization with an equitable, resilient, multi-use approach incorporating our innovative social value analysis. As the first phase in a 20-year program across the entire city, Jacobs\u2019 plan will consolidate four aging wastewater facilities into a state-of-the-art 1 billion gallons per day water resource recovery facility that includes a renewable energy hub. In the transportation market, our specialists have pioneered advanced charging technology that enables clients to transition to decarbonized operation, a key focus of economic stimulus packages. With exponential growth forecasted in the electric vehicle market, Jacobs has become the go-to firm to support leading EV battery and vehicle manufacturing companies globally. We also announced a strategic partnership and investment in Microgrid Labs, a provider of commercial suite electrification and infrastructure solutions, including a proprietary SaaS platform. The green economy transition is driving increased investments in hydrogen and renewables, and our team is delivering diverse solutions for a range of clients, from our participation in the Bacton Energy Hub consortium in the U.K., to energy transmission plans for a potential offshore wind development in the U.S. and additional contracts with Iberdrola\u2019s Renewables Avonlie Solar Farm and the Swanbank Waste Energy Facility in Australia. Moving on to the theme of pandemic response, with ongoing impact to the supply chain, health systems and semiconductor chip shortage, Jacobs is gaining momentum with multi-year backlog across sectors with new wins in biopharma, such as the next phase of a new $2 billion biotechnology facility. Jacobs has successfully won several health opportunities in the U.S., Europe and Australia, as they rethink pandemic response operations. As the world\u2019s leading technical services provider to the semiconductor industry, we are poised for significant growth in the electronics sector this year and expect our electronics business to further accelerate over the next several years. Projects like Intel\u2019s new Arizona Fab, which is -- which Jacobs is designing, are scheduled to be fully operational in 2024. Interconnected with climate response, pandemic solutions, infrastructure modernization and digital transformation are leading to long-term transformative growth with significant wins across all markets. In highways, we were recently selected for transport to New South Wales along with consortium partners to undertake the $1.2 billion Warringah Freeway upgrade project to accommodate a third road crossing Sydney Harbor. And in air transportation, we were selected as the integrated program manager for the Solidarity Transport Hub in Poland, a greenfield airport and multimodal including a high-speed rail network with an initial planned capacity of 45 million passengers. Our longstanding relationships and existing framework agreements supported major wins with U.S. State Departments of Transportation and Transport for London, emphasizing our market-leading position for solving our client\u2019s most complex transportation challenges. Supported by an extension of consultative service to U.K.\u2019s National Health Service, PA\u2019s efforts have extended into a longer term vaccine deployment, testing trace and future pandemic-preparedness plan. Additionally, PA growth is being accentuated by recent digital solution wins for confidential U.S. biopharmaceutical clients in the areas of cell and gene therapy, and next-generation patient care model. The Jacobs PA team were recently awarded a biotechnology manufacturing plant expansion to provide an end-to-end life cycle solution, incorporating critical digitized clinical trial information into the process design and facility layout. As we have previously communicated, our fiscal fourth quarter 2020 had 14 weeks compared to our normal 13-week quarters, which impacted our quarter year-over-year growth rate by 7% and our full year growth rate by 2%. Fourth quarter gross revenue increased 2% year-over-year and net revenue was up 7%, including the pro forma impact from all acquisitions and adjusting for the year ago extra week, net revenue was up 6% for the quarter. Adjusted gross margin in the quarter as a percentage of net revenue was 27.2%, up 370 basis points year-over-year. Consistent with last year, the year-over-year increase in gross margin was driven by a favorable revenue mix in both People & Places, CMS, as well as the benefit from PA Consulting, which has a strong accretive gross margin profile of nearly 50%. Within G&A, during the quarter, we incurred an approximate $20 million or $0.12 per share charge to a legal settlement cost, which burned both GAAP and our adjusted results. Adjusted operating profit was $303 million, up 17%. Our adjusted operating profit to net revenue was 10%, up 85 basis points year-over-year on a reported basis. GAAP EPS from continuing operations rounded to $0.34 per share and included $0.45 primarily related to the U.K. statutory tax rate changes and other tax-related items, $0.40 related to the final mark-to-market of the Worley Stock and related FX impact, $0.23 of net impact related to amortization of acquired intangibles, $0.10 of transaction and other related costs and $0.06 from Focus 2023 and other restructuring costs. Excluding these items, fourth quarter adjusted EPS was $1.58, including the $0.12 burden from the previously discussed legal matter. During the quarter, PA\u2019s continued strong performance contributed $0.23 of accretion net of incremental interest. Q4 adjusted EBITDA was $310 million and was up 12% year-over-year, representing 10% of net revenue. Finally, turning to our bookings during the quarter, our revenue book-to-bill ratio was 1.3 times for Q4, positioning us well for the developing growth momentum we expect over the course of fiscal year 2022. Including the pro forma impact of all acquisitions and adjusting for the extra week in the year ago period, net revenue was up 3% for the full year. We continue to enhance our portfolio to higher value solutions, which is evident as gross margin as a percentage of net revenue was 26% for the year, up 235 basis points year-over-year. We expect mid single-digit reported revenue growth in the first quarter of fiscal 2022, with an acceleration in the second half of our fiscal year, driven by U.S. infrastructure spending and the ramp-up of new awards in our CMS business. Adjusted operating profit was $1.188 billion, up 23% and represented 10% of net revenue. GAAP EPS was $3.12 and was impacted by a $1.96 from the PA Consulting purchase price consideration and valuation allocation, $0.77 of amortization of acquired intangibles, $0.57 related to the U.K. statutory rate change and other U.K. related tax items, $0.35 of net charges related to Focus 2023 deal costs and restructuring and all of this being partially offset by a net positive $0.48 from the final sale of Worley and C3ai equity stakes. Excluding all of these items, adjusted EPS was $6.29, also above the midpoint of our previously increased outlook. As a result, while we are still reviewing key components of the plan, we expect the potential non-cash impairment charge ranging from $60 million to $70 million in the first half of fiscal 2022. Regarding our LOB performance, let\u2019s turn to slide 12. Starting with CMS, Q4 2021 revenue was down 5% year-over-year, but when adjusting for the extra week in Q4 2020 was relatively flat on a pro forma basis. When excluding the contract sign-off and adjusting for the extra week a year ago, pro forma CMS revenue was up double digits year-over-year. In 2022 Q1, we expect to -- we continue to expect an approximate $210 million year-over-year impact from these two contract rollout -- roll-offs and this will phase out in Q2. As a result, we expected report -- we expect the reported revenue in the first quarter of 2022 to be down slightly on a year-over-year basis, with underlying growth being much stronger. We expect the CMS growth trajectory to improve over the year, resulting in a reported mid-to-high single-digit full year 2022 growth rate. Q4 CMS operating profit was $115 million, up 7%. For the full year, CMS operating profit was $447 million, up 20%, with 8.8% operating profit margin. Moving to People & Places, Q4 net revenue was flat year-over-year. When factoring in the impact from the extra week, P&PS grew net revenue approximately 8% year-over-year for Q4 and was up 2% for the fiscal year 2021. In Q4, total P&PS operating profit was down year-over-year, driven by the $20 million legal settlement costs I described earlier. Adding back on legal settlement costs, operating profit growth would have been up 8% in Q4. For the fiscal year, operating profit was up 5% or 8% excluding the legal settlement. In terms of PA\u2019s performance, PA contributed $273 million in revenue and $66 million in operating profit for the quarter. Q4 adjusted operating profit margin was 24%, in line with our expectations. On a full year basis, PA Consulting grew revenue 33%, 24% in sterling, with adjusted operating profit margin of 23%. This increase, excuse me, was driven primarily by the expected increases in medical costs and IT investments related to our new ways of working. In fiscal 2022, we expect non-allocated corporate costs to be in the range of $200 million to $250 million given continued increases in medical costs and other investments. These corporate costs, as well as Focus 2023, CMS, P&PS investments will precede our expected acceleration in revenue growth and profit later in 2022. In summary, these increased investments ahead of our growth will likely result in our Q1 profitability and EPS being relatively flat versus our Q4 results, with Q2 then showing improvement and further acceleration occurring in the second half of the year. Turning to slide 13 to discuss our cash flow and balance sheet, during the fourth quarter, we generated $176 million in reported free cash flow as DSO again showed strong improvement. The quarter\u2019s cash flow included $22 million of cash related to restructuring and other items, with $16 million related to a real estate lease termination as we take advantage of virtual working. For the year, free cash flow was $633 million, which was mainly impacted by the $261 million of PA purchase price consideration treated as post-closing compensation that we discussed last quarter. Regardless, our reported free cash flow represented 133% conversion against our reported net income. For the whole year 2022, we will again target an adjusted free cash flow conversion of at or above 1 times. As a result of our strong cash flow, we ended the quarter with cash of $1 billion and a gross debt of $2.9 billion, resulting in $1.19 billion of net debt. Our pro forma net debt to adjusted -- expected 2022 EBITDA is approximately 1.3 times, a clear indication of the strength of our balance sheet. During the quarter, we monetized our Worley Stock for $370 million and executed a $250 million accelerated share repurchase program. And finally, given our strong balance sheet and free cash flow, we remain committed to our quarterly dividend, which was increased 11% earlier this year to $0.21 per share. We are introducing our fiscal 2022 outlook for adjusted EBITDA to be in a range of $1.37 billion to $1.45 billion, which at the midpoint represents double-digit growth. As we look beyond this year, we see substantial opportunities for sustained organic growth driven by infrastructure modernization, climate response and digital transformation. Steve, as you built the portfolio, it\u2019s clearly been a focus to bring together green businesses and because of the idiosyncratic ESG scoring unfortunately, you folks aren\u2019t getting much credit for that, ESG funds are 80% underweight Jacobs. Well, look, there are some investors that are holding back because of some of our work which is really a very small portion, probably, less than 2% of our overall revenue that is really focused around what I would call critical national security for the U.S. Government and we are reaching out to those investors to try to explain that we are not involved in things like the manufacturing of nuclear weapons or whatever is holding them back. But I really think that as people understand sort of the fact that we are probably the largest public company delivering ESG climate change solutions out there that, as they see that ramping up and get more clarity, I think, we are going to attract a lot more investors that want to be part of the ESG story. So, look, I think, there\u2019s a couple of things that we need to point out, specifically, the customers that Bob highlighted in the -- in his comments really about our advanced facilities, clearly very, very, very strong now. The last piece I would call out is our environmental business and energy transition business is touching the oil and gas space as well, where we are working with them to ultimately provide incremental capability sets that that will help them and then becoming a more viable, sustainable contributor to the global climate actions being taken around the globe. There were wide -- we are focused across a wide swath and actually a lot of them, given the work we do are very, very strongly focused on these areas, which we think will encourage incremental CapEx longer term. I guess first question the EPS target that you put out there for 2025, the $10, a support, obviously, good growth there. And so, I think, clearly, there could be potential upside to those numbers, but we are working through all of that with our strategy, which we will talk more about in March, as Steve outlined. And then if I think about other things, there\u2019s not going to be significant moneys on top of that, maybe 25 to 50 in 2022, and then 2023 and beyond, TBD, I would say. But, I think, Kevin, you said maybe 8% NSR growth, which is, I think, up from about 1.4% for the last couple of quarters. Look, we are in this period of time in our Q1 and Q2 primarily where the numbers aren\u2019t really going to be impacted yet by the stimulus. Having said all of that, I do believe our incremental growth going forward in Q1 and Q2 is going to be more solid than what we have been seeing over the last few quarters. And so we are starting to see some of that benefit of the advanced facilities, certainly not as much in Q1 but in Q2 and so I do think we will see some good solid growth in Q1 and Q2 on People & Places and then it will accelerate again, hopefully, into the Q3 and Q4 numbers. If we look at just what the way we started out the year from a bookings perspective, it\u2019s been solid. I think, Kevin you said that CMS margin would stay in the mid-8% range in FY 2022, but the margin had already risen to over 9% in the last quarter, despite still significant contribution from the lower margin contract work that\u2019s flowing through. So, CMS specifically, as you may recall, two years, three years, four years ago, when we did have these lower margin large contracts, we were in the 5% to 6% operating profit margin and we have now built over time that to the mid-8% number, which is great and it\u2019s consistent with our strategy. As we look about 2022 specifically, we will have ramp on some other lower margin business associated with Idaho and other nuclear remediation work. It\u2019s just going to hold it flat for 2022, and then in 2023 and beyond, we started to see incremental margin above that as well. It\u2019s just ebbs and flows when the big contracts come in, the margins associated with them. So just wanted to dig into PPS, I think you got so many opportunities ahead, the climate change, semiconductor, infrastructure, digitization. Chad, can you repeat the front end -- the front part of that question again, it\u2019s a little broken. Around advanced facilities, this is a multi-decade type of leadership approach that we have had specifically in semis, but also in life sciences that, that\u2019s been a legacy business of ours forever. Look, I think, what we do when we put forth our indications of what we expect our business to do, we think those are numbers that are obviously going to be able to be executed against. And so, yeah, there\u2019s a lot of moving pieces, and you are right, we will hopefully exit this year with a greater velocity than what we entered clearly and so we will see how that plays out. But I think, ultimately, what\u2019s clear is that we have got to, whether it\u2019s 12% or 11% or 13% or 14%, whatever it ends up being, we are going to have a long haul of good solid margin enhancing growth in front of us. Maybe, Bob, you can share a little bit of your thoughts on your recent acquisitions and other opportunities in the pipeline from CMS, certainly increasing your cyber/intel higher margin business. If you look at the last two that we did within CMS about a year ago with the Buffalo Group and most recently with BlackLynx, these are right down the -- right in the bull\u2019s eye of where we are going in cyber and intelligence. And so we are excited about both of those and coupled with long-term advisory platforms that we have had and the agencies that we are already in, that\u2019s going to serve us extremely well. With regard to prospects in the P&PS world, I targeted more towards it\u2019s not too dissimilar than our cyber and intelligence prospects around technology. We have got a strong position with our domain knowledge for several decades within those end markets that we are talking about, coupled with now technology-enabled solutions is really what our acquisition strategy has been as accelerants to our strategy. And so, our ability to scale, you hear about some of the labor shortages that and labor topics that are -- that we are faced with in the western hemisphere, we are scaling in multiple locations for jobs that are all around the world and that\u2019s a -- that\u2019s been a big piece of ours. But where our -- where PA sits in, a lot of the same clients that we have in that C suite, as well as in kind of the front end of technology as our clients are developing new innovative ways of delivering the global topics, we are seeing the collaboration accelerate, and hopefully, we will have some more wins to talk about. It\u2019s just shown that having the ability to offer expertise at this entirety of the life cycle of a project, to program or an issue is powerful and it\u2019s one that\u2019s picking up some significant momentum. And we are expecting increase in the DoD budget and we are pretty positive about space and cyber and in the growth rates, especially in the classified work where we are significantly aligned too and hypersonic and telecom and we feel very well-positioned at places like NASA and how the budgets played out there. And so as soon as that gets finalized, we see a few of these near-term prospects that we intended to unleash, whether that happens in December or the second quarter, I think, we are talking about sort of that kind of timing. Kevin, just so we are not missing anything here, to follow up on Sean\u2019s question, you guys just did the high end of your EPS range in 2021 and the midpoint is 14% growth. Prudent to put out numbers that are appropriate and we feel like we can get after, and by the way, that\u2019s four years from now. I just want to follow up on PA Consulting, because you recorded almost $0.50 of accretion in 2021. I think, Andy, the first thing is that, the acceleration in their growth, which is really the driver to what\u2019s been happening in 2022, a lot of it, a chunk of it is in related to that specific work Bob was alluding to on pandemic related and the work that they have been doing for the U.K. Government, really, really strong performance. Now they are -- as we look into 2022, they are going to be growing, but it\u2019s not going to be at that same rate that we have been talking about. So having said all of that, what they have done in 2022 or 2021 has been extraordinarily strong, good margins and they have been executing well. And actually, the exciting thing is the collaboration between PA and People & Places and CMS is very strong and we are seeing that develop into longer term growth opportunities for maybe PA, but certainly Jacobs as well. Maybe two areas that we knew about, we probably didn\u2019t fully give credit to the depth of the two things I am about to mention. The depth of relationships that PA has and where to connect in the client organization and really hone that relationship through performance has been extremely impressive and is, again, we knew about it, it\u2019s exceeded our expectation."
