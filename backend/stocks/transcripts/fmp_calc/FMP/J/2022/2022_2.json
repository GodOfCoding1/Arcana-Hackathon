    "content": " Critical Mission Solutions benefited from the large space intelligence win, we disclosed last quarter, and PA Consulting had another outstanding quarter with 15% reported year-over-year revenue growth and 19% growth in constant currency, while delivering adjusted operating profit margin of 23%. We\u2019re seeing material pipeline growth in our climate response and energy transition portfolio, as evidenced by wins with national grid in the UK to deliver innovative clean energy transmission, a wind farm in Australia, large coastal resiliency programs in Louisiana, and an offshore wind project in the Northeastern United States to convert and underutilized port to support one of the largest most advanced offshore wind facilities in the country. And then on the back of that, we\u2019re going to start to see the Americas business wrap up, we\u2019re already seeing the pipeline significantly increase, we\u2019ll start to see sequential growth in the second half of this year and P&PS U.S. And we expect that to really start to ramp up more significantly as we enter 2023."
