    "content": " Steve will begin by updating the progress we are making against our strategy and then discuss our data solutions strategy, including the acquisition of StreetLight Data; Bob will then review our performance by line of business; and Kevin will provide a more in-depth discussion of our financial metrics, followed by a review of PA Consulting\u2019s financial profile as well as a review of our balance sheet and cash flow. During the quarter, in People & Places Solutions, our Advanced Facilities business delivered double-digit revenue growth and over 20% growth in operating profit, driven by our work with Intel and other global microchip customers, along with growth in life sciences and the electrical vehicle market. We view the addressable market for StreetLight in three buckets: expanding market share with North American transportation-focused customer base; leveraging into other infrastructure segments such as water, environmental and the built environment; exploiting adjacent opportunities by expanding internationally and developing large disruptive use cases across multiple areas, leveraging Jacobs\u2019 portfolio of data and technology solutions, including geospatial technology and edge computing capabilities from recently acquired BlackLynx to create expanded market penetration, growth opportunities and solutions for our clients. Moving on to Slide 7 to review Critical Mission Solutions, during the first quarter, our CMS business continued its strong performance with total backlog increasing 11% on a pro forma basis to $10.8 billion, driven by strategic new wins in space, cyber and intelligence.
