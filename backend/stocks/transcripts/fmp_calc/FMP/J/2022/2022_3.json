    "content": " During the quarter net revenue grew 8% year-over-year and double digits on a constant currency basis, with growth across each line of business. We saw continued strong performance in our Advanced Facilities business as demonstrated by our 25% year-over-year top line growth and an acceleration in P&PS  bookings during the quarter within our Americas business, driven by awards related to the U.S. infrastructure modernization. A key to our successful partnership has been the close alignment of our purpose around creating solutions that have positive social impact, whether it's working together to improve healthcare for families through leading edge cell and gene therapy, addressing patient safety and emergency departments across the U.S., solving issues of connectivity and decarbonization for global rail market, delivering resilient solutions in the areas of deforestation and fire prevention in the UK, and the undergrounding of 10,000 miles of cable for PG&E to mitigate forest fires in California, and on the clean energy front, collaborating on analyzing investments for private equity and green hydrogen. Adjusted gross margin in the quarter as a percentage of net revenue was 25.8%, down 180 basis points from a year ago, primarily driven by our CMS line of business related to newly ramping remediation contracts and the timing of the ramp on higher margin federal contracts, and the investment in incremental resources in PA in advance of expected growth. Also on a constant currency basis, each People & Places segment demonstrated net revenue growth with strong year-over-year growth acceleration in our America's business as impact from U.S. infrastructure spending begins to materialize. It is important to note that relative to our fiscal 2022 forecast back in November, foreign currency translation has impacted our full year expected fiscal 2022 net revenue outlook by approximately $320 million, adjusted EBITDA by approximately $40 million and adjusted EPS by nearly $0.20 to ensure our change in annual guidance and EPS is effectively driven by currency volatility versus our original expectations.
