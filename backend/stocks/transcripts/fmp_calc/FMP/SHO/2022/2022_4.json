    "content": " While we saw meaningful year-over-year rate growth across our portfolio, our urban hotels continue to see the biggest gains and grew rates 20% in the quarter as compared to the prior year. So far, we have seen strong group booking activity at our hotels in Boston and Washington, D.C. in the first quarter, and both San Diego and San Francisco have strong citywide calendars for Q1 compared to last year. And then as we look through the rest of the year, while we do anticipate rate growth, and we anticipate more rate growth coming from those urban and group hotels than the leisure hotels that the composition will be more -- definitely more skewed to occupancy. If we back those hotels out, looking at the gains we expect, especially driven by the group in urban hotels our expectation is, is that we will -- even with the occupancy, we will have some margin increase at those hotels, but it will be minimal this year given that composition. It's a sizable asset, an asset that was performing really well, an asset that had money that was recently put into it that added more meeting space to allow it to increase its group component, which San Diego over the last few years did really well with transient and leisure but -- and there still is meaningful leisure demand there, but that hotel needs to have a meaningful amount of group for profitability. And so it's really getting that right, and that is where we put the focus in last year, and we're starting to see that where you'll see considerable -- you will see considerable EBITDA growth in each hotel this year, you'll see margin growth and -- but still that margin growth as far as where -- when do we get stabilized, that's a couple of years out, probably looking into next year or so."
