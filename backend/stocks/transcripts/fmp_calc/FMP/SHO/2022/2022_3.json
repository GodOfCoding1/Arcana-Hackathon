    "content": " While we saw meaningful year-over-year rate growth across our portfolio, the greatest increase was at our urban and group-oriented hotels, which grew rates 20% in the quarter as compared to the prior year. Following a strong Q2, Renaissance Orlando has an even better group performance in the third quarter with group room nights, 12% higher, rates, 13% higher and catering contribution 11% higher than the same quarter in 2019. Similarly, at Wailea Beach Resort group business in the third quarter generated a significant premium to 2019 with banquet spend per group room night, 31% higher. Hyatt Regency San Francisco, which has been slower to recover than many of our hotels, had more than nine times the group volume in house compared to last year, accompanied by catering contributions up 76% year-over-year and 14% higher than in 2019. In terms of transient business, which accounted for roughly 60% of our total room nights in the quarter, comparable rate came in at $317 and was 23% higher than the pre-pandemic levels that we saw in the same quarter of 2019. In 2019, our current 13 hotel comparable portfolio, which includes the Confidante Miami Beach, but excludes our two wine country resorts generated RevPAR of $212 made up of a $252 ADR at an occupancy of 84%."
