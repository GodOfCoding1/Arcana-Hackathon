    "content": " In terms of transient business, which accounted for roughly 55% of our total room nights in the quarter comparable transient rate came in at $314 and was 14% higher than the pre-pandemic levels that we saw in the same quarter of 2019. Post repositioning, we expect the hotel to generate a very attractive 8% to 9% yield on our total investment and we will own a fully renovated oceanfront luxury resort at an all-in basis of approximately $900,000 per key in a market where per key valuations for similar assets are well in excess of $1 million. Your line is open. And so the opportunity we see here is by investing the capital into an asset where our -- on our purchase price, the going in yield is a 5% yield on what the 2022 cash flow will be, which we think is pretty attractive for this market, but we have the ability to invest the capital, make it a true luxury product with a luxury pool experience that can rival other luxury hotels in the market. The other thing when you look at it and you look at our initial investment, you look at the capital and then you look at $900 a key all-in luxury beachfront mid-beach, which has some of the higher rated luxury hotels in it with the Faena, with the addition I believe there's another high-end luxury hotel that's under development or in the process of getting it development there. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Because remember, while our resorts are running in the mid-70s up to 80s over the next -- last quarter and next quarter our urban hotels and then the large group hotels Q1 ran around 50% occupancy and that's going to grow to the 70s and then, higher as we get into later quarters."
