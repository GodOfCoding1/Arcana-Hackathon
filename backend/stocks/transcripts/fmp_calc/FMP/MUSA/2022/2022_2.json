    "content": " Investing $0.02 to $0.03 when margins are $0.30 and prices are high, where consumers go out of their way to find lower prices is a different proposition than when margins are $0.15 and prices are low, where customers may not be as price-sensitive and you can't get the volume uplift to economically support the volume margin trade-off. In this environment, as lower trending prices temporarily prop up retail margins, our contribution margin growth dramatically is a function of a combination of both higher gallons and higher margins, which allows us to further invest in our low-price position, perpetuating the cycle of share gains. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. And so, when we look at the new construction cost or higher real estate cost or whatever the input would be, even higher labor cost or payment fees, we're also looking at the improvements we've made in merchandise, our expectations for volume and volume growth in the higher unit margin, and structurally, what is a range in which we can plan around at a minimum to establish returns."
