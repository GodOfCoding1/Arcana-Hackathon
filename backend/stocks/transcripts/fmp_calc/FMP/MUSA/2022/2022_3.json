So in those periods, you will see a decline in PS&W and instances in which prices are running up, you're going to see something over $0.02 to $0.03. Your line is now open. And as prices fall, given the volatility that we're seeing in the daily price movements, there's probably greater uncertainty as what's going to happen 24, 48, 72 hours. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. Like if we go back to a lower level volatility in the wholesale market and maybe even the PS&W supply market is not as tight, does that correspond with taking away like a pretty sizable advantage that you guys have had here recently because we've talked about how higher volatility really probably puts MUSA even in a more advantaged place versus peers given the optimization you've done on the fuel side and the fact that the smaller players are worried about changing price if it's going to run up the next day. Your line is now open. I think in the shorter time period as we come out of an inflationary in environment, if we continue to see high prices and I suspect we're going to have prices closer to $3 or higher than prices below $2, consumers are going to remain pressured, and they're going to continue to seek out value."
