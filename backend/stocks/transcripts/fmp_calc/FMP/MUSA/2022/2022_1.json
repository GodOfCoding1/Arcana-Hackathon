If you think about the residual margin that we've earned in the past, and the fact that we earned it again this quarter in the app yourself, well, what would you have to believe that continue earning it in the future, I think there's a few things we think about, I think in this quarter, we saw record absolute price increase, $0.90 a gallon, and you book in that to the Q1 of 2020 at a $1, you saw an equal and opposite effect there. I mean, I think this is where the Murphy Drive Rewards data is just so helpful when you've got a -- when you have your own 100,000 member panel data that you can look back, and you can see they've made purchases with us every single month across fuel, tobacco, and merchandise and see their behaviors and how they're navigating the current environment."
