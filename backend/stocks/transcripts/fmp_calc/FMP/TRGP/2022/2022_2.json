    "content": " And our strong execution continued across the second quarter, including record-high quarterly EBITDA, record volumes in the Permian, record NGL transportation and fractionation volumes, redemption of Series A preferred stock, completing the successful sale of our interest in Gulf Coast Express Pipeline, integration of our acquired South Texas assets, successful negotiation of our Delaware Basin acquisition and subsequent financing and $74 million of common share repurchases. Starting in the Permian, our systems across the Midland and Delaware Basins continue to perform well, averaging a record 3.1 Bcf per day reported inlet volume during the second quarter. We expect Red Hills VI to essentially be full when it comes online, and we have flexibility across our Permian Delaware system to handle additional near-term production growth from Eddy and Lea counties with connections to Targa plants. Targa's reported quarterly adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter was $666.4 million, increasing 6% sequentially as we benefited from higher commodity prices and higher volumes across our gathering and processing and logistics and transportation systems, partially offset by lower marketing margin and higher operating expenses. It is our goal as we add gas processing plants in the Permian, both -- whether it's with the Delaware acquisition that we recently did or new plants on the Midland side, our goal is to make sure that those volumes run along our transportation legs, whether it's current Grand Prix pipeline or future expansions that we may do."
