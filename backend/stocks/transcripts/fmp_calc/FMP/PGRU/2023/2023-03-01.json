As a result of both ARPA and the increase in agents, Singapore revenues were up 15% or S$19 million in the quarter and adjusted EBITDA was S$11 million or 61% margin. Turning to Malaysia, revenues were S$8 million, up 28% from the prior year quarter, and our adjusted EBITDA increased to a positive S$3 million from a negative S$2 million over that same period. Finally, fin-tech and data services combined revenue was up 70% year-on-year, adjusted EBITDA was a loss S$2 million. We really see it as very powerful, because if you look at some of the more developed real estate markets around the world, access to high quality real estate data in the form of a dashboard is sort of pretty critical, as well as workflow automation software, is core to the efficiency of everyone from valuers to real estate developers, when it comes to how they go about conducting their business."
