    "content": " This quarter, we were busy adding high quality talent as we move on -- move to expand our customer centric products in our core markets, while also looking to enhance innovation in areas like fintech and data. In terms of data, as far as mentioned, we've got a strong sort of product delivery schedule in the back end of the year, particularly in Malaysia, and that's certainly going to sort of drive strong revenues in the back half as we bring on new customers for our products."
