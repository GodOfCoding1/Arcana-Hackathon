    "content": " By field and by size these are some of the examples; valuable business companies in Japan and overseas about JPY300 billion; roll-up of existing asset management company approximately JPY200 billion; and the private equity investment deals in Japan, U.S. and Asia JPY250 billion; and domestic real estate development project, JPY250 billion; Osaka MICE-IR, JPY650 billion; and other new potential investments, JPY350 billion, in total JPY2 trillion. And the first quarter, in fact have managed to only capture January to March of this calendar year because, you see airport has started to suffer from February or mid-February to be precise, so the concession businesses -- I think we are going -- we are yet to experience the negative impact from COVID-19 from here down the road as opposed to the first quarter results. Thank you, very much. Thank you, very much. So therefore in the second quarter, as of today, whether we would for sure be making announcements for the full \u2013 I mean full year forecast or not is not to be concluded but we would like to of course continue to watch over the development in a vigilant manner. So at the time of fiscal year-end announcement Mr. Inoue, CEO has said that we are going to put a stop on all the investment because we have no idea how COVID-19 outbreak is going to unfold and we would have to prioritize a liquidity and nothing else. Of course, it is very much dependent on the terms and conditions from here down the road, but if the price is right and if there is a normalization of the pricing, we would like to take into consideration the possibility of acquisition or the expansion of asset management businesses and there are some offers as well I must admit. But the United States as well as auto, I don't think we have taken much time in explaining about those businesses at the time of full year announcement."
