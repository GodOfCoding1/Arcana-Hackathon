    "content": " The result was lower than the prior year, but we managed to achieve net income in excess of JPY 190 billion, which is provided as the guidance at the time of interim. On the other hand, the investment gains was JPY 89.3 billion, timely exit to ensure high return on investment allowed us to maintain a certain level of profit generation. So 2021 March end, net income was down by 36.4% year-over-year at JPY 192.4 billion. But for the full year, we will go to JPY 78 and JPY 250 billion of share buyback at 57% net ratio. Or if we cannot fully achieve JPY 250 billion for some reason, we want to point to JPY 78, and we want to do the share buyback of around JPY 50 billion regardless. But what I'm thinking, so therefore, is not achieving JPY 250 billion, but going beyond and going back to the level of JPY 300 billion. So we would need to be cautious somewhat, but the JPY 250 billion is not an unachievable target. With our existing assets, once the COVID-19 impact is over, JPY 99 billion or JPY 100 billion catch-up would be easily done and we also have new deals in place, which means that, by interim, we should have a bit idea about the outlook and give you a clearer idea. So we - so immediate target for us, of course, will be JPY 300 billion - JPY 250 billion and then JPY 300 billion and JPY 400 billion as on and so forth. Thank you for that, but I think last time, in 2024, JPY 400 billion and 2026 JPY 500 billion, we may have shared that. So in order for us to achieve our numeric target, JPY 300 billion to JPY 400 billion worth of new investment may have to be made every year. So if we do a good job of managing all this, JPY 300 billion to JPY 400 billion of an achievement is not that tough, of course, dependent on the market, I would add."
