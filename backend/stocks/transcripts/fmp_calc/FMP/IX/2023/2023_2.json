    "content": " Since ORIX first took capital stake in Daikyo in 2005, it has supplied a wealth of expertise through its complement the management business and the construction supervision division to the real estate segment, which develops commercial complexes and logistics facilities among others, like it has grown to the point where it contributes around \u00c2\u00a520 billion in best profits annually. We have carried out share buybacks of almost every year since FY '17 March end, and have already exceeded \u00c2\u00a538.7 billion of the \u00c2\u00a550 billion in buyback program for FY 23 March end -- that's the end of October regarding ESG efforts as a result of identifying material issues and the setting key sustainability goals, enhanced qualitative disclosure and the TCFD based analysis, ORIX ratings from ESG  ratings agencies are improving. So, therefore, rather than M&A or acquisition, we may consider perhaps making an investment in a greenfield manner as for the domestic market,\n So, far as inclusive of PPE investment, I don't think the situation has changed very much, but the overseas investors are turning quite aggressive, because you see other 30% discount, so, they can acquire the Japanese asset."
