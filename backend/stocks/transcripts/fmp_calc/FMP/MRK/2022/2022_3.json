    "content": " In cardiovascular, the top line results of the STELLAR Phase 3 trial evaluating sotatercept in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension achieved successful outcomes across both the primary and almost every secondary endpoint, suggesting the potential to transform the treatment of patients suffering from this devastating disease. Our alliance revenue grew 23% driven by continued demand in certain patients with high-risk, early-stage breast cancer based on the OlympiA study. We received four new approvals in Japan based on KEYNOTE-522 for KEYTRUDA in combination with chemotherapy in neoadjuvant, adjuvant, high-risk, early-stage triple-negative breast cancer; KEYNOTE-564 for the adjuvant treatment of certain patients with renal cell carcinoma following surgery; KEYNOTE-716 for the adjuvant treatment of certain patients 12 years and older with completely resected Stage 2b or Stage 2c melanoma; and KEYNOTE-826 for KEYTRUDA in combination with chemotherapy with or without bevacizumab in certain patients with advanced or recurrent cervical cancer.
