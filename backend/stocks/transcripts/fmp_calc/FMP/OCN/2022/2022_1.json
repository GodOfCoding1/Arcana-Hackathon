    "content": " We delivered net income of $58 million dollars strong annualized ROE in the quarter, and a 14% appreciation and book value per share from year-end 2021, we are taking a cautious and prudent approach to investing and managing our liquidity position, which has improved from year-end. Forward originations faced a challenging environment in the first quarter, while total servicing additions of $20 billion is up about 46% year-over-year driven by subservicing additions. Our balanced business model is working, servicing pre -tax income in the first quarter is up significantly versus the first quarter of last year due to MSR value appreciation, lower payout volume, expense productivity, and portfolio growth. Servicing income excluding MSR gains has increased by $23 million year-over-year, despite lower EBO gains industry driven fair value losses on repurchase loans held for sale. Consistent with our first half 2022 guidance, strong net income which resulted $56 million in MSR fair value adjustments, net of hedges, which included $13 million of evaluation assumption loss on delinquent Ginnie Mae loans scheduled for sale in the second quarter. Thanks so much, sir. Thanks so much, sir."
