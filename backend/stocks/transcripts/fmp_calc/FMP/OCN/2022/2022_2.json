    "content": " We're leveraging the strength of our balanced and diversified business model, we're driving prudent growth adapted for the environment, reducing our cost structure across the organization, optimizing liquidity, diversifying financing sources and repositioning for higher rates and allocating capital to maximize value for shareholders. Servicing GAAP pretax income in the quarter is up significantly versus the second quarter last year due to MSR value appreciation, slower amortization, expense productivity and portfolio growth. We're targeting annualized cost reduction of over $60 million across originations, servicing and overhead functions, and that's as measured by the fourth quarter over the second quarter of this year. So I think the business is -- and if you look at what we have to do to deliver on the forward -- our forward projection for the fourth quarter, 2 of the biggest blocks in  walk is, one, the nonrecurring losses from the asset sales and mark-to-market that we did in the second quarter and as well as our execution on cost reduction, which, again, 90% of the actions have either taken place or expect to be completed with that by the end of the third quarter."
