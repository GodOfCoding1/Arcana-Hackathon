    "content": " Servicing GAAP pre-tax income in the quarter is up significantly versus third quarter last year due to MSR value appreciation, which more than offsets decline in profitability and originations. Finally, before I leave this page, I want to reiterate our year to date ROE of 27% on an annualized basis, as well as remind listeners of the $105 million of net income that has been generated year to date, which is driving almost $12 of earnings per share through the first three quarters. The $6 million of servicing income was down from the prior quarter due to higher MSR runoffs, driven by higher owned UPB quarter over quarter and lower ancillary fees in the quarter, as well as some isolated rep and warrant expenses due to a few specific loans. We anticipate the total forward origination costs will continue to improve significantly into the fourth quarter as we rightsize this business for the current environment, while keeping a strong focus on both servicing our correspondent and direct retail customers and maintaining a high standard for risk and compliance. As we project out the fourth quarter on an adjusted pretax basis, we anticipate additional gains from cost reductions, growth in our subs servicing business and improved float income. Year to date, our balanced and diversified business model has delivered over a $100 million in net income, strong book value appreciation and an annualized gap return on equity of 27%."
