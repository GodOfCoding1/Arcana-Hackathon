    "content": " Early in the second quarter, we completed a recast of our corporate credit facility with a new $1.45 billion revolving credit facility that has a 4.5 year term, improved pricing that is 15 basis points lower than the facility it replaced, helping to ensure we can continue executing our growth strategy in the coming years. In the second quarter, AFFO grew by 5% year-over-year and 1.6% quarter-over-quarter to $45 million with AFFO per share of $0.43. Included in this leasing activity was a 10 year lease renewal with the GSA for a 28,000 square foot facility in Rapid City, South Dakota and two lease renewal as with FedEx for properties in New York and Texas, that totaled over 325,000 square feet, and that paid $29 million in annualized straight line rent. At the quarter end our $4.5 billion, 311 property portfolio has a weighted average remaining lease term of 8.3 years. In the second quarter, we completed the acquisition of two industrial and one office properties for total purchase price of $33.3 million. Combined with the properties we have already acquired these properties totaled over $104 million of purchase price, and they have a weighted average cap rate of 8% with 18.5 years of lease term remaining. On the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with net debt of $2.3 billion at a weighted average interest rate of 3.5% and $111.2 million of cash and cash equivalents."
