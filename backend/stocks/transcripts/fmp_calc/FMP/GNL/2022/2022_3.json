    "content": " In the third quarter, core FFO grew by 9.6% year-over-year to $48.3 million or $0.47 per share and AFFO was $41.3 million or $0.40 per share. The year-to-date renewal and expansion leasing adds $117 million of net new straight line rent over the new weighted average remaining lease term of 9.3 years, up from 3.5 years. If consistent with our disciplined acquisition criteria, we decide to close on the properties in the pipeline when combined with the properties we have already acquired, our acquisitions for 2022 would be $66 million at a weighted average CAP rate of 7.6% with 11.7 years of lease term remaining. On a constant currency basis, applying the average monthly currency rates from the second quarter 2022, revenues would have been up by $1.2 million to $93.8 million. Core FFO grew by 9.6% year-over-year to $48.3 million or $0.47 per share, and AFFO was $41.3 million or $0.40 per share. On the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with net debt of $2.2 billion at a weighted average interest rate of 3.5% and $128 million of cash and cash equivalent."
