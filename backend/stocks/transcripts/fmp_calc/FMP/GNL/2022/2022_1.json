    "content": " We continue to drive growth as year-over-year cash NOI for the first quarter increased by more than 7% to $87.2 million, and AFFO increased by more than 9% to $44.3 million. In the first quarter, we executed 2 lease renewals and 3 renewal and expansion leases, totaling 1.2 million square feet and $54 million of net new straight-line rent over the new weighted average remaining lease term. Closer to home, we signed a lease renewal and expansion with Lippert in South Bend, Indiana, for a total of over 780,000 square feet on a 16-year term and for $16 million in net new annualized straight-line rent. Our net debt to enterprise value was 54.8%, with an enterprise value of $4.3 billion based on the March 31, 2022, closing share price of $15.73 for common shares, $25.54 for Series A preferred shares and $25.05 for Series B preferred shares. I'm very pleased with our progress and accomplishments during the first quarter, including the lease renewals and expansions that added $54 million of net new straight-line rent on 1.2 million square feet of our portfolio."
