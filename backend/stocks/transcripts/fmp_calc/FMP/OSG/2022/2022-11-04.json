    "content": " The niche businesses registered an $11.9 million increase in revenues, driven by the increases in the number of MSC voyages, higher international rates for the Overseas Sun Coast, increased lightering volumes for the OSG 351 and the return to service of both the Overseas Tampa and the OSG 350 for a full quarter. The combined vessel operating contribution of our niche market activities, ATBs and the Alaskan crude oil tankers provided a vessel operating contribution in the quarter - current quarter of $40 million compared to $29 million in the second quarter, continuing their consistent performance. And then the other two vessels are trade internationally, the Overseas Mykonos and Overseas Santorini, as Dick mentioned, benefited from a number of Military Sealift Command time charters and voyage charters during the quarter, driving older performance by those two vessels in order of magnitude of close to $2 million for the quarter."
