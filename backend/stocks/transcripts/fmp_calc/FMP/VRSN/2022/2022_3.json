Net income totaled $169 million compared to $157 million a year earlier, which produced diluted earnings per share of $1.58 for the third quarter of 2022 compared to $1.40 for the same quarter of 2021. As with Q3 last year, cash flow this quarter benefited from an increase in deferred revenue, which was primarily related to early domain name renewal activity before the .com price increase on September 1, 2022."
