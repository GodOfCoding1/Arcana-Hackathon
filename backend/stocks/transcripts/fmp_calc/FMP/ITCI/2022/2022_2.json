CAPLYTA net product revenues for the second quarter 2022 were $55.1 million, representing a 190% increase over the same period in 2021 and a 58% increase over the first quarter of 2022. Second quarter 2022 CAPLYTA new and total prescriptions increased 55% and 51%, respectively, versus first quarter 2022. Significant launch inflection that we saw in the first quarter continued throughout the second quarter in both new and total prescriptions, reflecting sustained and robust growth following CAPLYTA's approval in bipolar depression. In closing, CAPLYTA is a very appealing option for prescribers and patients with bipolar depression and schizophrenia and we are confident in our ability to drive continued robust prescription and revenue growth throughout the second half of the year. In the second quarter, we recorded net product revenue of CAPLYTA of $55.1 million compared to $19 million for the same period in 2021 and $34.8 million in the first quarter of 2022. Now that being said, we are pleased with the continued growth that we've seen the schizophrenia business in addition to the more explosive growth that we have seen with all the new patients coming in consistent with the new indication in bipolar depression."
