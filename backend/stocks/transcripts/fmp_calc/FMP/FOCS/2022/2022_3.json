    "content": " According to Cerulli, RIA's outperform in post-crisis periods, increasing industry managed asset growth rates by 60% to 70% versus the compound annual growth rate of approximately 10% per year in normalized markets and substantially outpacing the wire houses and broker dealers. Our Q3 year-over-year organic revenue growth rate was 3.4%, also above the top end of our 0% to 2% guidance, primarily due to better-than-expected revenue growth across our partnership of 87 firms. As a result of our strong Q3 revenues, our adjusted EBITDA was $128.7 million, reflecting year-over-year growth of 13.4% and our adjusted EBITDA margin was 24.8%, above our guidance are approximately 24%. Management fees were $123 million or 23.7% of revenues, which was a lower percentage compared to the second quarter of this year, reflecting the modest sequential decline in revenue and the variable nature of our management fees. As of September 30, our LTM cash flow available for capital allocation was $345.8 million, increasing 15.4% year-over-year, reflecting the strong financial performance of our partnership despite volatile markets. We expect that our Q4 organic revenue growth rate will be approximately negative 10% due in part to a comparably strong Q4 2021, which included approximately $20 million of performance fee revenues.
