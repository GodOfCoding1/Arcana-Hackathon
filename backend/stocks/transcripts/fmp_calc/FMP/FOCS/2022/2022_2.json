    "content": "  We generated Q2 revenues of $539.2 million, reflecting year-over-year growth of 26.8% and our organic revenue growth rate was 15%. First, approximately 23.3% of our Q2 revenues were not correlated to the financial markets, meaning that they are typically derived from family office type services, tax fees, and fixed fees for investment advice. And fourth, our partner firms use a variety of billing methodology, which mitigates the impact of quarterly market movements, approximately 67.2% of our Q2 market correlated revenues were built in advance, meaning they were built typically based on prior quarter movements. Our adjusted EBITDA for Q2 was $137 million, a 27.1% increase year-over-year, and our adjusted EBITDA margin was 25.4%, above our guidance of approximately 24.5% to 25%, reflecting lower compensation expense as a percentage of revenue due to variable compensation. So far in Q3, we have closed on 2 new partner firms, Octogone and Icon, which based on mid-quarter closings, we expect will add estimated revenues of approximately $7 million and adjusted EBITDA of approximately $1.7 million in the third quarter and over $30 million in annualized revenue and $7.8 million in annualized adjusted EBITDA. Our LTM cash flow available for capital allocation was $323.2 million as of June 30th, increasing 21.5% for the comparable prior year period, reflecting the earnings growth of our partner firms and the addition of new partner firms. We estimate that our Q3 revenues will be in the range of $505 million to $515 million, a sequential decline of approximately 4% to 6% from Q2."
