    "content": " So if you look at 32.6% in the second six months of the year, I believe that costs managed very well and helped by a slightly higher gold price than in the first six months, and obviously, the yield for Ergo and in Far West assisting to have a very stable operating margin overall for the year. Non-current investments and other assets, the majority of that balance more than $700 million sitting in rehabilitation and other funds, again, we have indicated to the market, if you look at the size of our -- the present value of our rehabilitation liability, that money set aside is at the present value level more than what is required, which is almost a unique position, I believe, in the mining industry and some a position that we are very proud of and that we have built up over many years and a consequence of the fact that we take money to rehabilitate on a concurrent basis and you will see that every year in our results."
