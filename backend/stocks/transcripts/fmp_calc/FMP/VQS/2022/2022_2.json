Your line is open. Yes, Scott, I would going to add that, when we -- when you look at the first half of the year, based on what's in the booking pipeline, as you remember, in Q1, our bookings was $1.6 million and in Q2 its $4.4 million. We also saw some constraints and capacity in Q2 related to more of a global distribution and acceleration to the new technologies for the law enforcement agencies, meaning if it's going on the new technologies, while we're training editors, there's a hard -- a higher percentage of work that goes over to quality assurance. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Yes, Marla -- Marla, the -- it's at the core of what we've been, if you look at the analysis of every earnings transcript for the last two years, what we've seen in Q2 with that kind of net booking is directly related to one single challenge faced by our customers, productivity, productivity amid a workforce that is getting older, really hard to recruit.

Your line is open."
