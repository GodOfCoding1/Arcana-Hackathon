    "content": " We are on track to achieve our goals this year -- realizing at least $50 million in revenue and continuing to improve our gross margin to reflect the integration of our technology platforms across all verticals, including courts. The decrease in Adjusted EBITDA was driven primarily by lower technology sales not fully offset by higher technology services revenue and related gross profit -- and higher Selling, General and Administrative expenses. We have seen significant gross margin improvement in our core technology services driven by the migration to our technology, which increased from 38.4% to 46.5% year over-year without subsidies. And while gross margin, particularly in the technology services space, showed a continued improvement of our operations and influence of our technology, the cost to produce a minute of transcription, particularly in the U.S., which is furthest along in integration, showed a 13% reduction in the time to produce a minute of transcription. We are seeing meaningful improvements of key performance measures as we integrate the technology throughout our services operations -- as well as an improved sales activity, which has resulted in increased organic bookings by 64%. Your line is now open. In the U.S., many of those court systems have independent, in-house transcription services because of the complexity of the approval process that is unique to the United States, which is absolutely why we believe that the end-to-end technology that we're now testing in the Midwest is going to be the right application to solve for this resource crisis that they're experiencing in the United States. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. Your line is now open."
