    "content": " In the first three quarters of 2022, we sold $7.1 million of new bookings, of which only approximately 10% has been recognized up to September 30th, which means that approximately 90% of the year-to-date new bookings will commence flowing through the P&L in Q4 2022 and into 2023 and 2024. This metric increased approximately 27% from 1.3 million in Q3 2021 to 1.6 million in Q3 2022, as a result of the migrations that have taken place during the quarter and the additional use of the platform by technology customers purchasing on subscription solutions. And, I think, behind the scene, that team has gone out of its way, particularly with the $7.1 million of new bookings coming in, plus the existing migrations that we're working with, that we are gaining some speed."
