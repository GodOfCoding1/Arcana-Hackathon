    "content": " And I'm pleased to say that we started off quarter 1 in a solid format, and we're on track towards our full year guidance, our full year mid-single-digit underlying revenue growth. Underlying revenue growth was positive at 3.8%, although there were some quarterly phasing headwinds for products such as TAKHZYRO and our immunoglobulin products, which we would not expect to see going forward, and both are on track to delivering our full year guidance. Yes, we can hear you. And in quarter 1, now that it's opened up -- the markets opened up, in particular in the U.S., we're seeing the switch come back to the impact there of the variation between prior year. And this quarter, again, it's a difficult comparison with the 30% growth from FY '20 Q1, but we are on track to achieve the 5% to 10% growth for the year. Firstly, let me highlight that the SG&A increase in quarter 1 fiscal year '21 versus 2020, 50% of the SG&A increase is related to foreign exchange, when you're looking at the core and the reported SG&A number. So we're seeing the China growth on the launching -- investment in the launching of new products, and that's reflected in the strong growth we're already seeing in topline revenue growth in China. Yes, we can hear you."
