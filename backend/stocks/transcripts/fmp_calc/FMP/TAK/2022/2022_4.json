    "content": " Whilst we have seen some increase in donation fees during the course of the pandemic, we do feel very confident that as the pressures of the pandemic now ease, we will see some moderation of those fees, and we feel confident that the operational improvements that we have made over the past couple of years and with the continued expansion of capacity and particularly with the uptake of the new donation centers and increased productivity of those donation centers that we've opened in fiscal '21, we will be well positioned to resume in improving our margins over time from fiscal '22."
