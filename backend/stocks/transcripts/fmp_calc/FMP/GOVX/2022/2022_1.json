    "content": " The -- I mean I think that it's fairly straightforward as David said, that vaccine was designed to induce antibody responses and T-cell responses with the primary antibody target being the S protein and then T-cell responses would be generated to both the S and the N. And we measure the antibody responses by enzyme linked immunoassay ELISA, which is just total titers and neutralizing function. Now, one of the challenges that we've faced with that trial is the evolving therapeutic landscape for immunocompromised patients, and so we've been -- it's been necessary for us to modify the protocol progressively to ensure that we're compliant with the standard of care for vaccination of these patients. But our focus is clearly -- as we've said, it's now in execution and reporting updates and progress for Gedeptin, CM04S1, CMO2, and our other development programs, as well as updates on the expansion of our capabilities and resources."
