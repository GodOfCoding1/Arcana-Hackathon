    "content": " The third quarter represented continued progress for GeoVax as we advanced the Phase 2 clinical programs in support of Gedeptin, our cancer therapy for patients with advanced head and neck cancers, and GEO-CM04S1, our next generation COVID-19 vaccine. As a result of our successful financings this year, we are well capitalized to complete our current Phase 2 clinical programs, including expansion of the Gedeptin multi-site trial and expanding the CM04S1 COVID-19 vaccine trial among immunocompromised patients to additional sites. CM04S1 is our leading next generation COVID-19 vaccine, currently in Phase 2 clinical development, targeting both the antibody and cellular arms of the immune system with the goal of providing more robust and durable protection than the currently authorized vaccines. Based on the discussions we're having with various advisors, consultants, we believe that there may very well be expedited pathways for focusing on certain immunocompromised populations relative to the continued development of our COVID-19 vaccine."
