    "content": " More information about these factors is contained in GeoVax's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including those set forth at risk factors in GeoVax's Form 10-K. Fourth quarter 2022 represented continued progress for GeoVax as we advanced the Phase 2 clinical programs in support of Gedeptin and our promising cancer therapy for patients with advanced head and neck cancers and GEO CMO4S1 and next generation COVID-19 vaccine focused on the unmet needs of immunocompromised patients. Additionally, multiple sites are in the process of joining our Phase 2 COVID-19 trial among immunocompromised patients, including some potential sites outside the U.S. During the fourth quarter, we also announced the acquisition of the rights from the NIH allowing GeoVax to develop and commercialize their MVA as a vaccine against monkeypox or MPox and Smallpox. Regarding 2023 milestones, our focus this year includes accelerating efforts in support of the Gedeptin and CMO4S1 Phase 2 clinical programs, moving the GeoVax MVA vaccine related to MPox and Smallpox development and advancing our MVA manufacturing process into operational validation. Please state your question. What I'm thinking here is that what you're saying is, in the event that there is another pandemic, the ability to be able to make a vaccine at scale, high capacity, high yield quickly becomes critical obviously, you're differentiated from an mRNA process, which is a pretty rapid process too, but you're making the point that you're getting away egg based vaccine technology is something in the past and you've now kind of got this critical piece in place. Please state your question. Please state your question. Please state your question. Please state your question. Please state your question."
