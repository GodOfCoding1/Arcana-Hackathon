    "content": " CMO4S1 is a leading next generation COVID-19 vaccine and Phase II clinical development, targeting both antibodies and cellular immunity with the goal of providing more robust and durable protection than the current authorized vaccines. Finally, the ongoing GeoVax effort to develop an advanced MVA manufacturing process based on the continuously growing AVM cell line to increase production consistency and capacity will well match with the clinical development activities and full development schedule associated with the CMO4S1 and the CMO2 vaccines. Currently there are two vaccines authorized in the US for prevention of monkeypox, the primary vaccine being Modified Vaccinia Ankara or MVA, which is also the vaccine to utilize in numerous GeoVax's vaccines including our CMO4S1 and CMO2, which target COVID-19. So we know that from discussions, etcetera, and we also believe --similar to what you've just raise and that the -- having that, which is of increased interest as we see that at least continue limitations of the current authorized vaccine related to COVID-19, but also then having the added benefit of being able to address monkeypox could be very important to the stockpile program, as well as to NGOs who are looking at other endemic areas."
