Actual events or results could differ materially from those mentioned in today's news release and in this discussion due to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those mentioned in our most recent filing with the SEC and Hong Kong Stock Exchange. Joining us today from Bilibili senior management are Mr. Rui Chen, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer; Ms. Carly Li, Vice Chairwoman of the Board and Chief Operating Officer; and Mr. Sam Fan, Chief Financial Officer. And thank you, everyone, for participating in our 2022 fourth quarter and fiscal year financial and operating results conference call. In 2022, we proactively adjusted our strategies and reprioritize our goal to better align ourselves with the new industry paradigm. First, our users and their engagement with our community remain the foundation of our business. By focusing on DAU growth, we are bringing higher-quality users to our platform, which ties in more closely to a monetization potential. In Q4, our DAUs increased to 93 million, up 29% year-on-year. This brought our DAU to MAU ratio to 28%, a meaningful improvement from 26% in the same period last year. The average daily time spent per user on our platform reached 96 minutes, driving the total time spend on our platform, up by 51% year-on-year. Second, we improved our commercialization efficiency and elevated cost reduction measures to bring us closer to our goal of profitability. Our total net revenues for 2022 were RMB21.9 billion, and the total net revenues for Q4 were RMB6.1 billion, up 6% year-on-year. Specifically, in the first quarter, we cut sales and marketing expenses by 28% year-on-year. As a result, our non-GAAP net loss in the first quarter narrowed by 21% year-on-year and 26% quarter-on-quarter. Specifically, we plan to continue to grow our DAUs, improving our gross margin and tightening our expenses. With that overview of our strategic approach and the progress, I'd now like to provide a brief update on our three core pillars of content, community and commercialization. In the fourth quarter, our platform hosts 3.8 million content creators, 25% more than the same period a year ago. Creator  submitted 17.6 million videos, up 62% year-on-year, both on a monthly basis. Our goal is to turn more users into creators, driving both our content offerings and the user engagement. For the fourth quarter, total daily videos views were up 77% year-on-year to 3.9 billion. In particular, storing more daily video views increased by 175% year-on-year, while PUGV daily video views increased by 56% in the first quarter. Story mode has allowed us to expand into the vertical video market, broadening our DAUs, increasing user time spent on our platform and opening more commercial opportunities for us to pursue. To unlock our commercial potential, in 2022, we further integrated our commercial channels within our content ecosystem. Over 1.3 million content creators earn income through multiple channels on Bilibili in Q4, up 64% year-over-year. Looking at our community, our inclusive committee environment and the risk interaction tools are creating tighter bond between our users and our platform. In the fourth quarter, user's average daily time spend on Bilibili reached 96 minutes. And for the core members of our community, the number of official members reached $195 million in the fourth quarter, up 34% year-on-year and their 12-month retention rate continued to exceed 80%. For the fourth quarter, our total net revenues reached RMB6.1 billion, up 6% year-over-year and our full year revenue grew by 13% to RMB21.9 billion. Revenues from VAS was RMB2.3 billion for the fourth quarter and RMB8.7 billion for the year, up 24% and 26% year-on-year, respectively. For 2022, revenues from live broadcasting increased by over 30%. This has helped to penetrate more video users, converting paying users, and optimize our revenue sharing structure organically. In the fourth quarter, the number of monthly active live broadcasting holds increased by over 17% and MPUs for live broadcasting grew by over 40%, both on a year-on-year basis. Looking ahead, live broadcasting will continue to be one of our primary revenue growth drivers. By the end of the fourth quarter, we had added nearly 1 million premium members from the prior period, reaching a total of 21.4 million premium memberships. In January 2023, our co-produced traditional Chinese style graphic anime, Yao Chinese folktale  become a smart hit, generating over 200 million video views on our platform. Advertising revenues were up by 12%, reached RMB5.1 billion in 2022 and RMB1.5 billion in Q4. Our top-performing verticals in the first quarter were mobile games, e-commerce, digital products, and home appliances, automotive, and skin care and cosmetics. In 2022, we further opened up our ecosystem to embrace more advertising opportunities across various video viewing scenarios. In the fourth quarter, our performance-based ad revenue grew by over 50% year-on-year. In addition, as our users getting mature and into new life stages, the new consumption needs such as automotive and home appliance also attract more advertisers and their ad budgets have been allocated to our platform. Turning into GaN, revenues for the year were RMB5 billion and RMB1.1 billion for the fourth quarter. In 2022, our self-development games contributed 5% of our total game revenues. Looking at our pipeline, we are planning to launch two self-development games  as well as six exclusively licensed titles in the second quarter of this year. In 2023, we will continue to centralize our resources to grow our DAUs, increase our gross margin and narrow our losses. Total net revenues for the fourth quarter were RMB 6.1 billion, up 6% from the same period 2021. Our total net revenues breakdown by revenue streams were approximately 38% VAS, 25% advertising, 19% mobile games and 18% for our e-commerce and other business. Our gross profit in the first quarter was RMB 1.2 billion, and our gross margin was 20.3%, up 2. With our tightly controlled cost structure, we expect to show continued margin improvement throughout 2023. Total operating expenses were RMB 3.6 billion, up 15% from the same period in 2021. As we work on increasing our commercial prospects, we are also keeping a lean cost structure, because sales and marketing expenses in Q4 by 28% year-on-year to RMB 1.3 billion, while DAU grew by 29% year-over-year. Sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of total revenues, was also down to 21% compared to 30% in the same period last year. G&A expenses were RMB 870 million, up 52% year-over-year. R&D expenses was RMB 1.5 billion, representing an 87% increase year-over-year, which was primarily due to increased R&D personnel and a one-off consolidation cost of RMB 470 million related to our certain game projects. We think, our overall operating expenses peaked in 2022 and will start to decline in 2023. Net loss and adjusted net loss was RMB 1.5 billion and RMB 1.3 billion, narrowing by 29% and 21% year-on-year, respectively. Our net loss ratio in the fourth quarter was 24%, a very notable improvement from 36% for the same period a year ago. In the fourth quarter, we repurchased and retailed a total principal amount of US$547 million notes for a total cash consideration of US$420 million. As a part of our liability management plan in January 2023, we completed US$409 million equity offerings and note exchange program. As of December 31, 2022, we had a cash and cash equivalents, time deposits and short-term investments of RMB 19.6 billion or US$2.8 billion. With that in mind, we are currently projecting net revenues for the full year of 2023, to be between RMB 24 billion and RMB 26 billion. Starting from last year, we've noticed that the Internet industry has entered into a new era. Every company is more focused on the quality of the growth, the quality of revenue as well as improving gross margin and focus on cash flow, not just Chinese Internet company, we noticed many US companies are doing the same thing. As for us, our key objective for 2023 would be to grow our top-line and narrow our losses and focus to achieve higher quality of user growth. In the fourth quarter, we've achieved gross margin improvement from a year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter basis. We expect that in 2023, our overall net loss will narrow more meaningfully, and to achieve our breakeven target by 2024. On the user aspect, we will no longer just pursue the absolute number of MAU, but rather to focus on the growth of our DAU, as well as the sales conversion of each DAU that can bring to the company. In 2023, we are expecting our DAU to MAU ratio will continue to improve. I still want to emphasize that our community and content ecosystem is the cornerstone of our business, no matter what kind of strategy the community and the content ecosystem as the foundation of the business. And in the past 14 years, we have experienced the industry cycle, which is the mobile PC era, mobile era and as we're going through the AI-powered era, no matter how the technology industry is involving. For Bilibili, the community and the PUGV content ecosystem aspect is what has kept us going while others come and go. As Rui mentioned before, we see the company's gross margin has continued to increase in the past few quarters. As Mr. Chen mentioned, the key objective of the company for this year to improve our gross margin and narrow our loss. So that's why for 2023 revenue guidance, we are cutting down low-margin business, such as e-sports content supplying revenue business and certain low-margin e-commerce business. As a result, we expect our e-commerce and other revenue line for 2023 to decline by mid 20% to 30%. However, we expect the gross margin and the gross positive for e-commerce and other business to improve year-over-year. And for the non-e-commerce business revenue, including our Game, VAS and Advertising. If we combat these together, we still expect to grow by 20% plus year-over-year in 2023. And in regarding to the gross profit, overall, the increase of the revenue will drive the increase of the gross margin, especially for certain fixed costs, such as server and bandwidth, staff costs and content costs. In 2023, as I mentioned, we will be more selective and ROI focused in terms of the content investment. In terms of the revenue sharing costs, we expect each business line gross margin will improve year-over-year. Meanwhile, G&A and R&D expenses in terms of the absolute dollar amount will also decline slightly in 2023. We expect our gross margin to gradually improve to mid 20 throughout 2023, and we also expect meaningfully narrowed our non-GAAP operating loss in 2023. Operator, next question please. Firstly, on the story mode, our multi-screen and multi-scenario is one of our key strategies that's driving Bilibili's user growth. We noticed that since the launch of story mode, it has played a vital role in terms of increasing user engagement, especially for users who are not as active. At the same time, it has driven better than expected increase in terms of video views, as well as user time spend. Story mode has essentially allowed users to access their favorite Bilibili content anytime, anywhere. Don't forget that, PUGV also grew by 50% year-on-year and maintained a very healthy growth rate. In addition, the combination of Story Mode and our existing ecosystem has helped us to increase our ad efficiency, and this has also brought new commercial opportunity for live broadcasting and advertising. For Bilibili, its full year advertising revenue, we have reached RMB 5 billion. However, we also noticed that for all advertisers, they will be more conscious and we'll be focusing more on the core value of their ad investment and their ad investment efficiency. In 2023, we will be looking to upgrade our sales model for different industry verticals. For our leading industry verticals, we'll continue to build high barriers and upgrade four ad product matrix such as for games, 3C, and digital product. In Q1, we have unified the for three key game teams, including game distribution, game ads and gain content in order to provide a more comprehensive service to game companies and improve the efficiency for game distribution. Secondly, we expect to further gain market share and attract larger budget from areas like e-commerce, automotive and general FMCGs take e-commerce, for example. In 2022, over 1,000 new brands and over 10,000 SKUs have debuted on Bilibili through  function, which also recorded better-than-expected performance based as revenue. On top of all that, we are also working to improve our algorithm infrastructure and invest in AI GC application and also improve our data capacity to provide our customers with more scientific marketing data point. All of which are the right thing to do, and we have -- that's what we have done in 2022 and will continue to carry into 2023. Operator, next question please. And also gamers involving taste and their increasing demand for higher-quality games are also shaping the overall games industry as production cost rises, the success rate for games is declining. In the era of lower gamer penetration rate, it's easy to make money for game company as well as they have good quality of titles. And only the two kinds of games, we'll be able to gain market share and survive in this new era. This will be the month to use for the next industry cycles because only global distribution could cover the increase in production cost and only the highest quality of games have \u00e2\u0080\u0093 will have more operation cycle, hence, to achieve higher ROI. In terms of genre, we will be more focused, whether it's a done operated game or our self-development game, we will be focused on the area that we hold the most advantage. In 2022, our self-development games revenue is already contributing about 5% of total game revenue. So we believe that this has been an industry tailwind favorable to Bilibili, not only our self-developed games, it's also being -- it will also be favorable for our gained jointly operation as well as for our game advertising business. Also, we are looking to launch two self-development titles in the second quarter this year. I believe that the opportunity that AIGC can bring is a mega event, not only for the industry players, but for the whole society to pay attention, we believe will bring a huge productivity increase in terms of content generation. We believe it has brought a very big opportunity for Bilibili, as well as for many other players in this industry, but especially so for Bilibili is because, for one, we are a massive content platform. First, as that would be on the search front, the ChatGPT similar experience will help users to find the video that they want more efficiently, such as product reviews, let's say, people want to look for a new Airpod review. For Bilibili who has our own data, we can easily accumulate up, find and organize and structure the useful information and present to the user and whether it's in the format of video clips or in a format of text. As for Bilibili, because we have a massive amount of knowledge related content and knowledge content in a constructive way, it has more time value. Even after a few years back, we can still find that historical videos that continues to generate views and bring value to users, which ChatGPT like search experience will help us to enlarge the value of our historical video content at the same time to improve the consumption efficiency for our users. In terms of content creation tools, we believe the AGC can bring revolutionary experience that allow more users to start creating content. For example, the same material can be presented in different formats in different videos and also allow many users who used to just be content consumers. Lastly, on virtual content creators, as you may know, Bilibili is already currently the largest virtual content creator platform in China, we have tens of thousands virtual content creator, virtual live broadcasters on Bilibili. So we believe AIGC will serve very positive effects in terms of the virtual content creator, virtual live broadcasting host and the virtual idols that Bilibili can offer. As a platform who's connecting content creator with users, the evolution of production tool will serve very positive, bring very positive change to our platform. That's allowing more people to access the Internet, allow more users to be able to create content easily. And I'm personally very looking forward to the -- the involvement of AIGC tool in terms of improving the video production efficiency, allowing more people to create content more easily that will definitely serve Bilibili as a content platform, the most."
