I think like you -- very much consistent with what you said, Dan, as we evaluate innovation, obviously we need to continue to look at the size of the market and the overall appeal with consumers and we always keep a pulse  on innovation that we see but at the same time need to make sure that it is strategic for Oil-Dri and aligns with our long-term strategy of pursuing lightweight. So litter in Canada is doing great, actually top lines, slightly ahead of the really strong growth in the U.S. And it's a lightweight market, where we're the leading share brand up there."
