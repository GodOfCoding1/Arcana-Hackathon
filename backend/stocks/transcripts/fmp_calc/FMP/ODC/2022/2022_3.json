    "content": " With me here either physically or on the line is Susan Kreh, our Chief Financial Officer; Aaron Christiansen, Vice President of Operations; Chris Lamson, Group VP of Retail and Wholesale; Jessica Moskowitz, Vice President and General Manager of our Consumer Products division; Wade Robey, our Vice President of Agriculture and Amlan Marketing; Laura Scheland, Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary; David Atkinson, Vice President and Controller; and Leslie Garber, our Manager of Investor Relations. Year-to-date, we've issued $25 million in notes at a very favorable rate of 3.25% and we've used those proceeds to fund our growth through building inventory, and we're doing that not only because of the increased cost of the supply chain, because of the fact that getting freight out is taking longer, so we have more finished goods on hand, and just to provide overall higher service levels to our customers."
