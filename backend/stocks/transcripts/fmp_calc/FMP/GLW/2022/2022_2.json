    "content": " Second quarter sales grew 10% sequentially, faster than we expected and 22% year-over-year to reach $1.3 billion and we expect to grow year-over-year again in the third quarter and even faster than the market for the full year due to growing demand for our innovations. We expect continued strong sales in Optical Communications, Hemlock\u00e2\u0080\u0099s solar products, and Specialty Materials to offset lower display volume, which is expected to be down mid-teens from the second quarter as I noted earlier. And your line is now open. And your line is now open. And your line is now open. So I think maybe stepping back a little bit on the guide, if I think about both the third quarter and the full year, what we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve tried to do is reflect the highest probability range that we can for sort of all the dynamics we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re seeing across all of our markets. And your line is now open. But I just \u00e2\u0080\u0093 with energy prices where they are, wouldn't it make sense to, it would seem solar demand is only going to go one way.
