    "content": " The proposed sustainable aviation fuel tax credit could result in up to $80 million per year to support the construction and operation of the 90 million-gallon per year Aemetis Carbon Zero one sustainable aviation fuel and renewable diesel plant in Riverbank, California, assuming a 50% SAF production allocation and a 50% renewable diesel production allocation. As we mentioned earlier, the 2 million metric ton per year Aemetis carbon capture project would generate $170 million per year from the Federal Direct Pay tax credit as well as an estimated $400 million per year at a projected $200 per ton of sequestered CO2 from the Low Carbon Fuel Standard in California."
