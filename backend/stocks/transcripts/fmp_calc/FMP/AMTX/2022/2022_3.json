Additionally, our Aemetis Biogas subsidiary recognized $1.3 million of accretion and other expense in connection with preference payments on its Series A preferred units during the third quarter of 2022 compared to $2.2 million during the third quarter of 2021, along with a loss on extinguishment on Series A preferred units of $53.9 million during the third quarter of 2022 as a result of a charge related to the redemption of Series A preferred units as part of the amendment to the preferred unit purchase agreement. After considering the future value of over 60 digesters planned by Aemetis Biogas to generate an expected 1.65 million MMBtus per year, compared to the approximately two million MMBtus of landfill RNG currently produced by Archaea at 1/10 the number of LCFS credits. In the past two quarters, we have received funding of about $50 million from the two credit facilities provided by Third Eye Capital at interest rates at only 8% and 10% per year. This new $50 million of growth lending has supported the construction of a solar energy system and many other carbon reduction projects at the Keyes ethanol plant, the financing land purchases, the engineering, permitting and related equipment for the renewable aviation and diesel fuel plant and the pre-project engineering and drilling pad construction for CO2 characterization and sequestration wells. As an example of our long-term financing strategy, Aemetis recently closed a $25 million project financing, supported by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Renewable Energy for America, known as REAP program, to fund dairy biogas digesters and biogas pipelines to produce renewable natural gas. The IRA sustainable aviation and renewable diesel fuel tax credit is expected to result in up to $112 million per year to support the construction and operation of the 90 million-gallon per year Aemetis Carbon Zero Plant in Riverbank, California. If extended over the 10-year period of our contracts with certain airlines and monetized efficiently, the SAF and RD tax credits in the Clean Fuel program of the Inflation Reduction Act could provide more than $1 billion of cash to repay an estimated $400 million of project funding. This potential $1 billion from IRA tax credits over 10 years is in addition to the revenues from California Low Carbon Fuel Standard credits, federal renewable fuel standard D5 RINs and the sale of the aviation and diesel fuel. Next, an increase in the carbon sequestration tax credit from $50 to $85 per metric ton of CO2, but paying the credit in cash as an IRS tax refund to companies in a process called Direct Pay for the first five years, followed by seven years of additional tax credits. A planned two million tons times $85 per ton equals $170 million per year of cash that could potentially be paid to Aemetis by the IRS each year for the first five years of the project, providing approximately $850 million of IRS funding in the aggregate to repay the capital costs and operating costs of the two projects. With another seven years thereafter, the same yearly rate, generating an expected aggregate amount of tax credits valued by management at an additional $1.2 billion, the total value of the $85 per metric ton tax credit would be $2 billion in the first 12 years of operation of the two Aemetis carbon sequestration wells. And lastly, several provisions in the IRA legislation are valuable to the Aemetis Ethanol business, including a tax credit for low carbon intensity ethanol, $500 million for biofuels fueling infrastructure to support 15% to 85% ethanol blends, and adopting the Argonne Lab's GREET model to correctly calculate the carbon intensity of ethanol and other renewable fuels. With the recent closing of our first $25 million financing that utilized the USDA Renewable Energy for America program, the Aemetis Biogas renewable natural gas project in California is on track to deliver -- to deliver on in-service dates in Q1 2023 for several key projects. To date, Aemetis has been awarded $23 million of grants related to the biogas project from the California Department of Food and Agriculture, the California Energy Commission, Pacific Gas and Electric, and other government agencies for the dairy biogas project and the production of renewable natural gas. Currently, natural gas costs for the Keyes plant is more than $10 million per year so an approximate 65% savings in natural gas costs and a significant reduction in ethanol carbon intensity is expected once the MVR system is fully operational. In addition, we signed a $3.2 billion renewable diesel sales agreement to deliver 45 million gallons per year under a 10-year sales contract with a major travel stop chain for its Northern California locations. In Phase 1 of the Aemetis Carbon Capture project, we plan to inject up to 400,000 metric tons per year of CO2 emissions from our biogas, ethanol and jet diesel plants into two sequestration wells, which we plan to drill near our two biofuels plant sites in California. And so doing that 10% increase, let's call it, $0.30, $0.35 per gallon, for every 10 million gallons, it's about $3 million or more being paid to Aemetis, can be offset by the sale of credits by our customer to other companies."
