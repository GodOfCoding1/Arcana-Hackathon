    "content": " This year, the Aemetis Biogas renewable natural gas project in California progressed with the completion of the construction and testing for 20 of the 36 miles of biogas pipeline; completion of construction and testing of the $12 million centralized biogas to RNG upgrading facility; completing the PG&E utility gas pipeline interconnection unit and testing; full operation of our third dairy digester, which is now flowing gas through our biogas pipeline; and continued construction of four additional dairy digesters that are scheduled for completion in the next few months. In Phase 1 of the Aemetis carbon capture project, we plan to inject up to 400,000 metric tons per year of CO2 emissions from our biogas, ethanol, and jet diesel plants into two sequestration wells, which we plan to drill near our biofuels plant sites in California."
