    "content": " Top line performance for our portfolio was our strongest since the onset of the pandemic, with third quarter RevPAR of approximately $120, up 19% as compared to the third quarter of 2021 and up 8% as compared to the third quarter of 2019. Positive business and leisure demand trends continued post Labor Day, with September RevPAR, up 12% to 2019 and our October occupancy of approximately 78% at rates that continue to surpass pre-pandemic levels. With comparable hotels total revenue up 20% relative to the third quarter of 2021 and more than 6% compared to the third quarter of 2019, we achieved comparable hotels\u00e2\u0080\u0099 adjusted hotel EBITDA of $129 million, up 19% to the same period of 2021 and up 4% to the same period of 2019, despite modest margin declines of 40 basis points and 80 basis points compared to the same period in 2021 and 2019 respectively. Preliminary results for October show continued strength in demand with occupancy increasing to 78% and RevPAR growth relative to 2019 trending in line with results for the third quarter, bolstered by another month of double-digit ADR growth as compared to October of 2019. OTA bookings remained stable at 13%, property direct bookings declined to 25%, but remained elevated to third quarter 2019, a testament to the continued efforts of our property and management company sales support teams and GDS bookings continued to increase showing growth in corporate demand and represented 16% for the quarter, a 100 basis point increase from the second quarter. Turning to expenses, total payroll per occupied room for our same-store hotels was around $36 for the quarter, slightly higher than the second quarter and up 11% to the third quarter of 2019. Strong rate growth and effective cost control despite the challenging labor and inflationary environment enabled us to achieve third quarter comparable adjusted hotel EBITDA of approximately $129 million and comparable adjusted hotel EBITDA margin of approximately 38%, down 80 basis points to the third quarter of 2019. I think it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an opportunity we may come back to at some point in the future, but based on the current operating environment, and I think specifically what we are looking at in terms of near-term supply and the potential impact of supply on the hotels that we own, we see greater opportunity to drive returns for our investors by focusing on our core business and ensuring that we are yielding the best possible results from our existing portfolio."
