    "content": " Strong rate growth and effective cost controls enabled us to achieve actual adjusted hotel EBITDA margin for the year of 37%, up 250 basis points to 2021 and 10 basis points to 2019. The 12 hotels owned for all of 2022 produced a total unlevered return for our investment after CapEx of over 8%, despite the impact of the Omicron variant on first quarter numbers and with meaningful upside remaining as assets continue to ramp and markets improve. Continued strength in leisure demand and recovery in business travel during the quarter enabled us to achieve RevPAR of $103, an improvement of 16% over a strong fourth quarter in 2021 and 7% as compared to fourth quarter 2019. Turning to expenses, total payroll per occupied room for our same-store hotels was just under $39 for the quarter, slightly higher than the third quarter and up 12% to the fourth quarter of 2019. Strong rate growth and effective cost controls despite the challenging labor and inflationary environment enabled us to achieve fourth quarter comparable adjusted hotel EBITDA of approximately $102 million and comparable adjusted hotel EBITDA margin of approximately 34%, down only 10 basis points to the fourth quarter of 2019. Actual adjusted hotel EBITDA margin for the fourth quarter was also 34%, but up 70 basis points to 2019, highlighting the positive impact of our transactional activity since the onset of the pandemic. For the full year, we expect net income to be between $165 million and $209 million, comparable hotels RevPAR change to be between 3% and 7%, comparable hotels adjusted hotel EBITDA margin to be between 35.3% and 36.9% and adjusted EBITDAre to be between $420 million and $457 million."
