    "content": " We achieved record first quarter revenue, increasing 18.5% year-over-year on a constant currency basis to $170 million, led by strong performance by our teams in the U.S. and Canada. First, organic growth from the successful integration of our Omicron Granite & Tile business, acquired in the fourth quarter of 2020; second, continued strength in the big box channel; third, expansion of our innovative digital platform, CS Connect, in North America; and fourth, successful execution of our strategic initiatives to capture a growing share of demand in our end markets. On a constant currency basis, first quarter revenue was higher by 18.5%, compared to the same period last year, primarily due to strong performance in North America."
