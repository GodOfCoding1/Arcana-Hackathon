    "content": " Additionally, successful implementation of pricing initiatives is helping to more than offset softening volume due to the challenging macroeconomic environment as higher interest rates and inflation have continued to pressure renovation and new construction activity mainly in the U.S. As a result of these macroeconomic conditions, we have already taken measures to align our production and inventory levels to new conditions in the market and plan to continue to take actions to reduce costs. On a constant currency basis, third quarter revenues was higher by 14.9% compared to the same period last year, primarily due to higher pricing across our global footprint, particularly in North America. The year-over-year difference in gross margin predominantly reflected unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, with the remainder of the difference attributable to higher logistics, shipping delays and raw material costs which were partially offset by our pricing actions."
