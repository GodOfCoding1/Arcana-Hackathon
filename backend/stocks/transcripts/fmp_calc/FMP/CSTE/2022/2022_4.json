    "content": " The year-over-year difference in gross margin predominantly reflected increased manufacturing unit costs driven by lower fixed cost absorption resulting from lower capacity utilization, higher raw material and shipping costs, and unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates, as a result of appreciation of the U.S. dollar against all other currencies. Looking ahead to 2023, we expect the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates, higher raw material and shipping costs in our P&L to persist, primarily in the first half of the year, given that we started the year with higher unit cost in inventory, reflecting those previous periods of elevated material and shipping costs. The difference in the adjusted gross margin mainly reflects lower fixed cost absorption, higher raw material prices, unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates and shipping price increases, which were partially offset by favorable product mix and selling price increases. Our full year 2022 adjusted EBITDA was $51.9 million, a 7.5% margin compared to $68.2 million last year or a 10.6% margin, with the year-over-year change in margin primarily reflecting the lower gross margin. Additionally, we expect a gradual and moderate improvement in adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of sales for the full year of 2023, primarily due to pricing initiatives and cost optimization efforts, which are expected to more than offset higher raw material and shipping costs in our inventory, while spot market cost for many of our major inputs, such as raw materials and shipping have stabilized in recent months."
