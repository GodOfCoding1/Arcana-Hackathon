    "content": " As we reflect on the fourth quarter and full year 2022 results, I want to start by expressing my heartfelt appreciation to our 4,200-plus strong Ryerson team for their hard work and continued dedication, which now includes new businesses added to Ryerson's family of companies in Ford Tool Steels, Apogee Fabrication, Howard Precision Metals and Excelsior Metals as well as our first additive manufacturing investment in FreeFORM Technologies. Based on these expectations, we forecast adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter of 2023, excluding LIFO, in the range of $78 million to $82 million and earnings in the range of $0.98 to $1.06 per diluted share. Ryerson's leverage ratio increased slightly quarter-over-quarter to 0.6x, but remains low historically and at the low end of our leverage target range, while the company's available global liquidity is at historic highs and increased slightly quarter-over-quarter to $909 million. In the fourth quarter, Ryerson achieved adjusted EBITDA, excluding LIFO, of $28.7 million and generated $148 million in free cash flow."
