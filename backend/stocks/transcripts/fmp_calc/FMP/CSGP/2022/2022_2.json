Our three main products, CoStar, Apartments.com and LoopNet, all have exceptional sales quarters, growing a combined 81% on a year-over-year basis. Total revenue for the second quarter of 2022 was $536 million, growing 12% year-over-year, and coming in above the high end of our guidance range of consensus estimates. As we ramp up our investment in our residential product strategies, we continue to deliver strong profit results with adjusted EBITDA of $159 million in the second quarter, well above the high end of our guidance range and consensus. Revenue for our CoStar product was $207 million in the second quarter, representing a 17% increase over the same quarter a year ago. CoStar net new sales bookings increased by 60% in the second quarter, making the last four quarters the highest sales quarters on record. Sequential growth in sales was 35% in the second quarter of this year, which makes this the third quarter in a row of improving sales results. Second quarter revenue in residential was $20 million, an increase of 40% on an organic basis, compared to the second quarter of 2021. Revenue from our Pro+ products grew an impressive 46% year-over-year, while our concierge Pro+ product grew 175% versus the second quarter of last year. Transaction volumes for commercial real estate properties continue to reach new highs over $216 billion traded during the second quarter, leading to a second quarter record and a record breaking first half for the year. Let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s talk about our revenue by our services and Andy reported CoStar is growing 17% in the second quarter, price and new sales volumes each are contributing roughly half of that revenue growth. Residential revenue increased 11% over the second quarter last year and organically excluding the effect of the wind down of the  revenue from Homes.com, revenue grew around 40% in the second quarter on a like for like basis as Andy mentioned. Holding that aside, the year-over-year growth in our Pro Plus subscription product is expected to be around 35% in the second half of the year, which is where we remain our focus in growing our sales force. Subscription revenue on annual contracts was 80% for the second quarter of 2022, compared to 77% this time last year and consistent with the first quarter of this year. Turning to the outlook, we expect full year 2022 revenues to range from $2.165 billion to $2.18 billion, an increase of approximately $12.5  at the midpoint of the range, implying an annual growth rate of 12% at the midpoint. Third quarter 2022 revenue expected in a range from $552 million to $557 million, representing growth of 11% year-over-year at the midpoint."
