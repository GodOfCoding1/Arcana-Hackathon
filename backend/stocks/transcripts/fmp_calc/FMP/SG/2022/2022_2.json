    "content": " In the second quarter, we reported sales of $124.9 million, representing 45% year-over-year, fueled by same-store sales growth of 16%. Our adjusted EBITDA loss was $7.4 million in the second quarter, narrowing from the loss of $13.8 million this time last year and more than having our first quarter 2022 loss of $16.5 million. Total revenue for the quarter reached $124.9 million, up from $86.2 million in the second quarter of 2021, growing 45% year-over-year. For full year 2022, we now anticipate at least 35 new restaurants in 2022, revenue in the range of $480 million to $500 million, same-store sales growth of 13% to 19%, restaurant-level margins of 15% to 17%, adjusted EBITDA of a loss of $45 million to a loss of $35 million. Looking at the 35 units that are expected to open this year, obviously, hearing what you've talked about in terms of the suburban-urban mix around 50-50, 85% of future stores being suburban, but it is, I think, a point worth mentioning."
