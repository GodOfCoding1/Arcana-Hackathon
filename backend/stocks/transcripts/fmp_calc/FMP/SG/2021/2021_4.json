For fiscal year 2022, we anticipate the following assuming no additional COVID-19 headwinds; at least 35 new restaurant openings, revenue ranging from $515 million to $535 million, same-store sales growth between 20% and 26%, restaurant-level margins between 16% and 17%, and adjusted EBITDA between a loss of $14 million and a loss of $33 million. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. In addition to that, at the restaurant level, we've got a lot of work about what we call our operation simplification initiative to really streamline the way we operate our actual restaurants but that comes from a simplification and labor classifications that's given us more flexibility and labor scheduling and in addition to which some sourcing changes that we think can be margin accretive over time. Your line is open. Your line is open."
