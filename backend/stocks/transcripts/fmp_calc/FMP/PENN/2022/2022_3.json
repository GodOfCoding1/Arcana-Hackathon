And we are seeing a slightly \u00e2\u0080\u0093 again, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s early, a slightly higher hold percentage in Ontario as it relates to online sports betting than we are here in the U.S. given that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re on our own tech stack, and we can really think about how we target parlay betters versus money line betters differently in Ontario, and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be doing obviously more of that in the U.S. once we migrate over next summer."
