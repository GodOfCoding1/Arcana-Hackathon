    "content": " In our portfolio of 92 hotels with comparable 2019 results, RevPAR recapture reached 93% of 2019 levels, a significant improvement from the 79% recapture we achieved in the first quarter and highlighted by June's 96% recapture rate, the highest of any month since the onset of the pandemic. From a segment perspective, Summit's 42-hotel urban portfolio produced a second quarter RevPAR of $125, by far, the highest quarterly RevPAR for our urban portfolio since the onset of the pandemic. This culminated with June posting a weekday RevPAR of approximately $125, nearly double that of June 2021 and resulting in an 86% recapture to 2019's urban portfolio weekday results. Second quarter RevPAR for our non-urban hotels was $119, an increase of over 13% relative to first quarter 2022 and a 33% increase to the second quarter of 2021. On a same-store basis, operating costs per occupied room in the second quarter declined compared to the first quarter of 2022, resulting in second quarter gross operating profit margin of over 49%, which is approximately 100 basis points below the second quarter of 2019 despite current labor market dynamics. Pro forma hotel EBITDA for the second quarter was $70.7 million, a 94% increase from the second quarter of 2021, which resulted in a 38% margin, the highest quarterly hotel EBITDA margin during the pandemic era and more than 600 basis points higher than the second quarter of 2021."
