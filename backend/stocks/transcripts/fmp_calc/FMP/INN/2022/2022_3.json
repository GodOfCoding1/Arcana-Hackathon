    "content": " We were encouraged by our third quarter results, which reflect the ongoing improvement in our operating fundamentals, as same store RevPAR recapture was 95% of 2019 levels for the quarter, a 120 basis point increase from the second quarter and a new quarterly high for our portfolio. RevPAR recapture in our urban portfolio was nearly 90% for the quarter and heavily business transient-driven markets such as Boston, Charlotte, Chicago and Pittsburgh, all achieved RevPARs that exceeded 2019 levels during the quarter. From a segmentation perspective, Summit's 42 hotel urban portfolio continued to see robust growth in both weekday and weekend demand, resulting in urban RevPAR growth of 27% versus third quarter of 2021. For the four week period following the Labor Day weekend, the 92-hotel comparable portfolio experienced notable strength in weekday demand, in particular, Monday through Wednesday, which realized occupancy expansion of 510 basis points versus the first 2 months of the quarter. From a capital expenditure perspective, during the third quarter, on a consolidated basis, we invested approximately $24 million in our portfolio, bringing our year-to-date total to $49 million. The NewcrestImage portfolio is beginning to benefit from Summit's sophisticated asset and revenue management strategies, as third quarter ADR recapture improved meaningfully for hotels with comparable 2019 data, achieving a 104% recapture to 2019 compared to 100% in the second quarter."
