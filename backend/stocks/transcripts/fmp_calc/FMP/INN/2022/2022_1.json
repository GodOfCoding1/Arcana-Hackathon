    "content": " Preliminary April occupancy was approximately 70% in our urban portfolio with rates over $170, which drove RevPAR to its highest level since the onset of the pandemic, surpassing our first-quarter metrics by nearly 40%. 05:45 We also announced in conjunction with our mezzanine lending program, the exercise of our equity purchase option to acquire a 90% interest in the newly constructed 264 guestroom AC element, dual branded hotel in downtown Miami's Brooklyn neighborhood at a valuation of $89 million or $337,000 per key. Strength in our non-urban portfolio was driven heavily by our 11 resort hotels, which generated a $183 RevPAR in the first quarter, due to robust spring break demand and peak leisure seasonality in markets such as Phoenix, Tucson, Fort Lauderdale, Orlando, Steamboat Springs, and Silverthorne in Colorado. 13:26 Pro forma hotel EBITDA for the first quarter was $47.3 million, a 200% increase from the first quarter of 2021, which resulted in a 33% margin, nearly 13 percentage points higher than the first quarter of last year."
