    "content": " Had we done this for 2022, our adjusted EBITDA guidance would have been $10 million to $20 million, reflecting expected de novo post opening losses of approximately $10 million, and another $10 million of internally budgeted preopening costs, which include onetime expenses to enter new markets and build out related professional fees. Your line is open. Well, we're going to be doing with our clinics and I've said this on previous calls is we're going to be very opportunistic now on how we open clinics, we're still in growth mode, but because of the fact that we now have this very large MSO, we're looking at areas where we have that density in those specific markets, and identifying those physicians that have sizable panels between 100 and 300 Medicare Advantage members so that we can open what we call seated de novo, and this is really going to allow us to open in a capital efficient way. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. And that's why we're reinvesting really all those fees that we're getting on the MA side, from the MSO really just reinvesting those and making sure that we're prepared to take risk next year, but we also didn't want to over invest, because we know that, the cash flow is going to be a little bit of a burden. Your line is open."
