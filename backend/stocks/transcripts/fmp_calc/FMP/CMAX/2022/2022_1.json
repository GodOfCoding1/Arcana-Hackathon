    "content": " For the first quarter of 2022, revenue grew 55% over the prior year to $137 million pro forma for the business combination of CareMax and IMC. Despite impacts from COVID in the quarter, we believe we remain on track to deliver 2022 adjusted EBITDA in the range of $30 million to $40 million excluding de novo losses. Despite COVID waves last year, our providers were able to see over 95% of our members in 2021 and document their conditions, allowing us to fully recover those risk adjusted headwinds for 2022. Following these results, we have reiterated our prior 2022 guidance for 38,000 to 40,000 Medicare advantage members by year-end; $540 million to $560 million in revenue; $30 million to 40 million in adjusted EBITDA, excluding de novo losses; and 15 de novo center openings. So far of the $1 million of de novo losses reported in Q1, about half are related to losses in core Florida centers opened in the last 18 months, and half are related to the initial operating losses and new markets. That $1 million you, kind of, have to exclude as COVID related and to your point, barring any other COVID waves, we would expect a 70% MER for the full year."
