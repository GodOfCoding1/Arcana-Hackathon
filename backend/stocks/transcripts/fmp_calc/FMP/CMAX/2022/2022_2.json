    "content": " Following the close of the transaction, CareMax will serve as the exclusive value-based management services organization across Steward's Medicare network, initially managing approximately 161,000 senior value-based care patients and 1,800 providers across its 3 membership programs, MSSP, Medicare Advantage and ACO reach. One of the things I can tell you is we are going to focus the majority of our de Novo centers in all of the areas that have high density around the Stuart network so that we can use that to create our seated de Novos, makes a lot more sense for us to start medical centers when we have a physician and evasive patients similar to what we're doing in the Houston de Novo that we just opened. So when you talk about sort of what that begins the revenue, is it correct to assume that if you've got these physicians and these members in other types of arrangements, whether they're seeing I'm just on a fee-for-service basis or even on a partial risk, is it fair to assume that the EBITDA ramp on those patients is faster, meaning that you already know the patients, you've got the care protocols, you have the doctor in place. In terms of professionalizing that, it's similar to how we ran our MSO, it's deploying our tech-enabled services using our CareMax University to educate those providers on a continuous basis on how to manage or on how to provide care under a value-based care arrangements and then providing them with the resources to execute on that strategy and then deploying the team on the ground to assist Stuart in that network to achieve those results and then create a compensation structure that enables them to execute on that strategy."
