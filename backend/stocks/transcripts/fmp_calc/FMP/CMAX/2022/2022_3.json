    "content": " As we've noted on prior calls, we believe our platform is uniquely equipped to achieve attractive medical margins across the spectrum of value-based care from patients staying at our clinics to those seen by providers in our MSO network. Your line is open. We do expect to see a significant reduction in that capital outlay both on the OpEx and CapEx, specifically due to the Steward transaction as we start opening up centers in collaboration and open up either tuck-in or seated de novo's that already have membership and some of them are already retrofitted in very large locations, as we discussed at the beginning of the call. Your line is open. Your line is open. The conversations we've already had with the payers as we think about the Steward integration almost all of those contracts have been completed, and we've seen just tremendous positive receptivity from the payers in wanting to have a value-based care partner, value-based care relationships in a lot of these areas that we're going into in Texas and Massachusetts and in some of these areas where Steward has a significant presence. With respect to kind of guidance and how we're thinking about de novos in the future years, it's really going to be dependent on those specific areas where we continue to gain that density and then take advantage of being able to build out new medical centers in a capital efficient way by bringing in, as I mentioned in the earlier question, those physician groups that we can pull together to open up de novo. Your line is open. Your line is open."
