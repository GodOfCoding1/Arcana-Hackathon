    "content": " Adjusted EBITDA margin expanded more than 400 basis points to 22.1%, driven by favorable volume, price and efficiencies gained from COS. We generated cash flow from continuing operations of $418 million, bringing our full year 2022 total to $1 billion. And then spray foam to the Accella acquisition that had a few years ago, it was a little bit lower mix, but we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve done some nice things there with that group to continue to drive, I would say, market or above rates, and there were some \u00e2\u0080\u0093 I think when we did that deal, we were talking about 8% as a market growth rate there, and so they continue to grow. When you look at the year as a whole, obviously, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to maybe vary by quarter, but I think what we did in 2022 is probably a good starting point for what we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll do in 2023. And if we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re right, which we \u00e2\u0080\u0093 from every indication we have, this is going to be another good year in the commercial roofing space, then you think we start to think about how there might be some pressure for product and around availability, which obviously at Carlisle with Sikeston, with the new 16-foot TPO line and this kind of stuff, we think we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re prepared to flex with that."
