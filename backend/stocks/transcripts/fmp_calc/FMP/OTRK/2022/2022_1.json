    "content": " In addition, we\u2019re collaborating with existing customers on various growth initiatives, including assistance with their RFP submissions for new state contracts, expanding our relationships to cover new geographies and lines of business and launching the Ontrak mobile app, which will help promote higher enrollment rates and more engagement with our care coaches and providers. We expect near-term quarterly revenues from our existing customer contracts to remain at approximately $4 million to $5 million over the next few quarters, as we look to execute on our pipeline opportunities, including potential customer expansion that we believe may increase revenues late in the year and especially in 2023. As we move forward this year and next, we\u2019re committed to an integrated, evidence-based whole-person coaching and behavioral health provider and care model as our core Ontrak product offering, which maximizes the effectiveness of behavior change programs and treatment plans, and delivers durable value-based outcomes for medically complex populations, who face a myriad of barriers to their care."
