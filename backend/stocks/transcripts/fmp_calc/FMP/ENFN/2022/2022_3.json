    "content": " And what typically happened in the past with us, and I have no reason to expect anything different going forward is, despite slower launches, the larger, more complex clients, both hedge funds sort of enterprise clients that run $1 billion plus type AUM. And this is where we find most of our opportunities where the system feeds really well, because it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sort of like LEGO business, if you will, we can service each unit on a stand-alone basis, but we can then service the entire enterprise and scale as both up and down if some teams leave and then other teams expands and an entire business expand, we typically have capability to grow with the clients that way. And in fact the paradigm that I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m trying to establish at the company really has to do with upfront understanding, right of how each potential clients given their needs, how we can respond to their needs both in terms of product capabilities and in terms of services they provide which by the way this is what we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re increasingly seeing."
