    "content": " We expanded our base of global enterprise fund managers, notably with the addition of two seven-figure deals for the first time in the same quarter, both utilizing our end-to-end portfolio management and OEMS solution as well as winning four new institutional asset managers. First quarter revenue grew 40% to $34.1 million, reflecting robust growth with existing customers, as well as new larger customers. The uniqueness of this outcome is that in all, these wins in the quarter represent a record aggregate contract value of total new logo win that we've never seen in previous quarters, demonstrating strong sales execution, our ability to increasingly win more resilient enterprise clients across our products and services, and the ongoing strength across all regions. Overall, I'm proud of the team's accomplishments and I'm excited to continue seeing the investment management industry embrace our cloud native solutions, which translated to a strong first quarter business results. Enfusion as well-positioned to continue delivering high growth in 2022, as well as our profitability, driven by new clients demand for our products, especially with institutional asset managers, upselling momentum with our existing clients, and the TAM we continue to unlock.
