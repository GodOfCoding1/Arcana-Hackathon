    "content": " With this new product, Enfusion addresses the downstream market opportunities and delivers to smaller funds, both new fund launches and existing managers, core capabilities of our flagship OEMS solution, including order management and execution, pre and post-trade activities and real-time portfolio level visibility. And so across the segments, whether it's family offices, institutions, alts, we are seeing a reoccurring theme, which we talked about in previous quarters, our ability to quickly land opportunities, implement those opportunities  and then as clients go into steady state, begin to offer additional products and services that we continue to build on, as we continue to innovate around our clients' needs. And so I think the progress sort of  in terms of the results that are showing in the second quarter from the perspective of we're seeing positive momentum in diversifying the mix of  that we have, leaning in hard on larger fund managers across the different segments, and that's working."
