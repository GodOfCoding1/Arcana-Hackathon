    "content": " Second, our top priority for 2023 is to advance the Exelixis development pipeline with new potential cabo indications, expedite zanzalintinib, development with new pivotal trials and pursuing XB002 monotherapy and combination expansion cohorts with the goal of moving this agent into full development by year-end. So, in terms of XL092 where zanzalintinib, as it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s now called, of course, we presented the first clinical data at ESMO last year, which, again, confirmed the overall profile in terms of the shorter half-life compared to cabo, and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re pleased to see early evidence of activity and a tolerable safety profile. Vicki, do you want to take that one? I would say that, again, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re still in dose escalation at this point and looking forward really to working with them to achieving a recommended Phase 2 dose and moving into the next stage of development, which would be expansion in a range of tumor types, obviously, which will be informed by some of the early data that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re seeing in dose escalation. I think we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve -- I think it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fair to say, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve proven that when we can generate differentiating clinical data, we can use that to drive the top line growth with cabo, and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re certainly proud of that and understand that we have to do it again and again and again and doing it through both internal and external sources is the plan. Vicki, do you want to take that one?"
