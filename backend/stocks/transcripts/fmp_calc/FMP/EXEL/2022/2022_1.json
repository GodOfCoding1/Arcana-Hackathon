I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker, Ms. Susan Hubbard, Executive Vice President of Public Affairs and Investor Relations. Thank you, Shari, and thank you all for joining us for the Exelixis first quarter 2022 financial results conference call. Joining me on today's call are Mike Morrissey, our President and CEO; Chris Senner, our Chief Financial Officer; P.J. Haley, our Executive Vice President of Commercial; Vicki Goodman, our Chief Medical Officer; and Peter Lamb, our Chief Scientific Officer, who will together review our progress for the first quarter 2022 ended March 31, 2022. Please refer to today's press release, which is posted on our website for an explanation of our reasons for using such non-GAAP measures as well as tables deriving these measures from our GAAP results. During the course of this presentation, we will be making forward-looking statements regarding future events and the future performance of the company. This includes statements about possible developments regarding discovery, product development, regulatory, commercial, financial and strategic matters. We refer you to the documents we file from time to time with the SEC, which under the heading Risk Factors, identify important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed by the company verbally and in writing today, including, without limitation, risks and uncertainties related to product commercial success, market competition, regulatory review and approval processes, conducting clinical trials, compliance with applicable regulatory requirements, our dependence on collaboration partners and the level of cost associated with discovery, product development, business development and commercialization activities. Thank you, Susan, and thanks to everyone for joining us on the call today. We continue to grow the Cabozantinib franchise and advance a diversified pipeline of clinical and discovery programs while focusing on important upcoming milestones, including top line results for ongoing pivotal trials, ASCO preparation and the Cabo, ANDA trial starting on May 16. Key highlights from Q1 include first, the Cabozantinib business continues to grow and generate the funds to advance our portfolio of next-generation therapies for oncology. The Cabo franchise grew 37% year-over-year compared to first quarter 2021, marking its sixth consecutive quarter of growth. Second, our emerging bicoastal development team is focused on expanding potential cabo indications, numerous expected top line results for important COSMIC and CONTACT pivotal trials and advancing our growing pipeline of clinical compounds, including XL092, XB002, XL102, and XL114 including the upcoming initiation of the pivotal trial program for XL092. Third and finally, our drug discovery network of internal and collaborative efforts along with extensive business development activities across both small molecule and biologic platforms continues to advance at a rapid pace with the selection of up to five new development candidates expected in 2022. So with that, please see our press release issued an hour ago for our first quarter financial results and an extensive list of key corporate milestones achieved in the quarter. For the first quarter of 2022, the company reported total revenues of approximately $356 million, which included Cabozantinib franchise net product revenues of $310.3 million. Cabometyx net product revenues were $302.8 million, which included approximately $9 million in clinical trial sales. This increase in gross net was primarily driven by higher 340B utilization, higher Medicare Part D and higher co-pay assistance, primarily associated with patients in high-deductible medical insurance plans. Historically, we have experienced higher Medicare Part D and co-pay assistance expenses in the first quarter of the year due to many Part D patients moving through the donor hole and commercial patients satisfying their deductibles during the start of the year. The Total revenues also included approximately $46 million in collaboration revenues earned primarily from Ipsen, Takeda and Genentech. Cash and investments for the quarter ended March 31, 2022, was approximately $2 billion. And finally, we are reiterating our full year 2022 financial guidance, which is detailed on Slide 13 of our earnings presentation. The team continues to execute at a high level, which has resulted in CABOMETYX continuing to be the number one prescribed TKI in RCC. Furthermore, CABOMETYX total prescriptions or TRx have now grown for six consecutive quarters. Year-over-year, TRx growth in Q1 2022 was 37% relative to Q1 2021. Given the clinical data from the CheckMate 9ER study, we anticipate these first-line combination patients to receive therapy for approximately 1.5 years on average, thus driving a significantly longer treatment duration for CABOMETYX. We are encouraged by the fact that in our data, we see a near doubling of the amount of new patient starts at the 40-milligram dose in Q1 2022 since the CheckMate 9ER launch in January 2021. Turning to the TKI market basket of CABOMETYX, INLYTA, SUTENT, VOTRIENT and Lenvima Homes TRx market share has increased every quarter since Q1 2021 and the share in Q1 2022 was 36%. As we have discussed previously, the first-line RCC market is very competitive, and we are pleased with the performance of CABOMETYX in combination with nivolumab in this setting. Furthermore, we're still not seeing any significant competitive impact on our market share. We are pleased that the CABOMETYX second-line RCC business remained strong and was stable in Q1, while growth continued in the first line setting. In HCC, our business was stable in Q1, and CABOMETYX continues to be the most prescribed TKI in second-line setting for patients treated with immunotherapy containing regimens in the first line. And in Q1, we continue to see strength in new patient starts and demand in this indication. Looking beyond the six current U.S. indications for cabozantinib, we are planning for numerous life cycle expansion opportunities as they begin to have top line data readouts in 2022. We look forward to having the opportunity, pending data and approval to bring CABOMETYX to many more patients in need of additional treatment options. Today, I will cover our progress towards our organizational expansion to the East Coast, Exelixis East, as well as progress on our pipeline and highlights of cabozantinib data to be presented at the upcoming ASCO meeting in June. As we announced early this year, we are developing a presence in Greater Philadelphia as we seek to access talent on both coasts to support our expanding development organization. We have made progress since the last quarterly update, including signing a lease for intermediate term space in King of Prussia, Pennsylvania which we expect to occupy by July of this year and which can hold approximately 140 office-based employees. We have also identified a potential long-term build-to-suit site of approximately 200,000 square feet in close proximity to our intermediate term space in King of Prussia and we have begun hiring to open roles within the development organization in King of Prussia, supported by an ongoing recruitment campaign to raise awareness of our presence in the Philadelphia area. I'm excited by the opportunity to create a bicoastal presence across two biotechnology hubs, operating as one team focused on the singular mission of developing medicines to improve the lives of patients with cancer. Turning now to an update on our pipeline, beginning with our cabozantinib registrational trials. For COSMIC-313, evaluating cabozantinib in combination with nivolumab and ipilimumab in intermediate and poor risk renal cell carcinoma, we expect to release top line results in July. An interim readout for the primary endpoint of overall survival for CONTACT-01 and readout of the progression-free survival endpoint for CONTACT-03 in combination with atezolizumab in PD-1 experienced non-small cell lung cancer and renal cell carcinoma, respectively, are expected in the second half of 2022. We CONTACT-02, our Phase III study in combination with atezolizumab in metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer is expected to complete enrollment this year. XL092, our next-generation MET, AXL, MER and VEGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor is being explored in combination with several checkpoint inhibitors and IO combinations and is progressing towards registrational studies. Our first planned Phase III for XL092, STELLAR-303 and third-line non-MSI high colorectal cancer will be initiated in the second quarter of this year. As a reminder, data supporting this study comes from two studies of cabozantinib in colorectal cancer which were presented at ASCO-GI in January and demonstrated promising activity in comparison to historical controls of regorafenib, the current standard of care. XB002, our first antibody drug conjugate, which targets tissue factor without interfering with the coagulation pathway in preclinical models continues in dose escalation. We are now also initiating dose finding for combinations beginning with an XB002 dose level, which has cleared safety evaluation in the monotherapy cohort. A Phase I study of XL102, our oral CDK7 inhibitor, is expected to move into both single agent and combination expansion cohorts after completion of ongoing dose escalation and determination of a Phase II dose. We expect to provide Phase I clinical updates for XL092, XB002 and XL102 in the second half of this year. Finally, we are pleased that five cabozantinib abstracts have been accepted for oral presentations at the upcoming ASCO meeting, and I'd like to highlight three of these. These include two presentations based on COSMIC-021, our multitumor signal finding study, the first in three distinct populations of bladder cancer patients and the other from two cohorts of non-small cell lung cancer patients previously treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors and platinum-based chemotherapy, who received either cabozantinib plus atezolizumab or cabozantinib alone. Additionally, an investigator-sponsored Phase II study evaluating the addition of cabozantinib to pembrolizumab in PD-L1 positive squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck will be presented. We have a broadening pipeline derived from both internal and collaboration efforts with over 10 programs in progress, giving us the possibility of advancing up to five compounds into preclinical development in 2022. As you can see in the pipeline slide, the preclinical pipeline is a balanced mix of small molecules and biotherapeutics, which is reflective of how we see the clinical pipeline evolving in the future. We're continuing to accelerate the expansion of our pipeline, both through internal growth and through business development activities. Last year, our internal small molecule discovery group occupied new laboratories on our Alameda campus, and we have further embarked on expansion of our lab space in Alameda to accommodate future growth. In addition, we've located the site in Pennsylvania for an East Coast laboratory expansion, which will allow us to tap into the locally available talent pool and will complement our newly opened development offices in the same area. We also have significant ongoing efforts on the business development front aimed at providing us access to novel targets, capabilities and technologies that will complement and accelerate our ongoing biotherapeutics and small molecule strategies. In addition, we're assessing late preclinical and early clinical assets with the aim of identifying multiple opportunities to invest in. As you heard on the call today, the EXEL team has executed across all components of our business in Q1 with significant progress across our pipeline clinical development and commercial activities. We're excited about the potential of multiple growth drivers ahead of us, to move the business forward and most importantly, put Exelixis in a position to help many more cancer patients. We have the vision, determination and resources to become a multiproduct enterprise and expand our reach to serve cancer patients across the globe. Check on the gross to net a little bit here for Q1, it's a little higher than what I was used to at cabo. talked about, we had strong growth, and we've had growth over the last six quarters. And then on top of that, the 340B was at a higher level or as I said, the highest level we've seen. And we've seen that segment of our gross to net growth over the last several years, and I think it's growing from an industry perspective also. But those seasonality items are -- those items that we've mentioned that are shave a seasonality effect, we'll be there next year too just based on what we've seen over the last several years\n Got it. And then, Vicki, I think I heard you say that there will be data for 092 in the second half -- can you give us any sort of details on which studies will be presented and what we are -- what were we looking from the data\n Yes. Obviously, there's a lot of focus on the ANDA trial next week with MSN, as you mentioned. Yes, look, I think we've been pretty careful to not get ahead of ourselves in the context of this whole topic. We've been very, I think, an appropriately aggressive in protecting our IP. But in terms of the actual details and the nuances there, I just don't want to get into that right now for all the obvious reasons. So the data that are going to be presented are from two cohorts, as I mentioned, of COSMIC-021 Cohort 7 and Cohort 20. And so the population is similar to contact 01 and we'll be presenting roughly two years of follow-up for these patients presenting response, other efficacy outcomes as well as safety data for those patients. In terms of Slide 18, one of the interesting dynamic that we observe from the five quarters that you illustrated is that if you add up the market share of LENVIMA and INLYTA, they actually stayed pretty constant. question first, and then I'll loop back and just give a quick kind of high-level summary on ASCO. With regards to the market share, as I mentioned, we're certainly pleased with the progress. As you pointed out, we've been growing and as one does look at the prescription data for INLYTA and pembro, that does seem to be relatively speaking, a zero-sum game. And if you look at a different data source from brand impact, it would point out, for example, that approximately 40% of the lenvatinib data or prescriptions or usage, I should say, is from endometrial. So I think the -- to sum it up, I think you're right. What we see generally across data sources is -- as I mentioned, we're not seeing impact on our share. Andy, in terms of ASCO, again, I don't want to get into the weeds on the abstract before it's published. So if you look at the oncofetal protein 54, it's been no case target for a while, pretty popular as a vaccine as vaccine target back in the day. So recently, there's been one business development activity going on. Obviously, you guys are FP&A XB010 going forward. I mean 5T4 is a target of interest for various biotherapeutic and vaccine approaches, as you indicate for some time, so it's an own public domain target. I think -- and that's for good reason, I think its expression pattern is compelling, where it's overexpressed in a variety of solid tumors at pretty decent levels and has minimal expression in most normal titers. I think for us, it really falls into the category of targets that I sort of spoke to before, which are good targets, which I think would really benefit from the kind of next generation of coaches to -- as that we're taking. As we discussed, we have antibodies from Invenra, which we've characterized extensively, transferred to our partners at Catalent and using their very contemporary site-specific conjugation technology to make a well-constructed ADC with a highly defined DAR that has, at this point, compelling preclinical efficacy and safety data. So yes, we're excited to be using XB010 forward. As you say, we're not alone in finding this to be a good target and a variety of approaches. Maybe the first one, Mike, the CONTACT-03 data that the Cabotecentriq rewired versus cabo and second-line RCC interim data, second half, do you expect we'll have more it's a PFS OS endpoint. Second part of your question, commercially, obviously, any good data we can generate in any line that raises the bar for standard of care, we want to pursue, and we have pursued with first-line with the Triplet 313 and second line with CONTACT-03. So I think, again, if that looks good, we can potentially move the needle even further for those patients. So for CONTACT-03, right, it is a primary readout for the progression-free survival endpoint. And obviously, PFS matures at an earlier time than overall survival. CONTACT-01, which also has data on the second half is not discussed quite as much. Yes, Yaron, it's Mike. Yes, I think you're probably over interpreting that. We're pushing those all really hard if successful, they could all move the needle. Certainly, HCC was for a long time an area of significant unmet for patients really across all lines. As I mentioned with regards to CABOMETYX in our current second-line indication, we're very pleased with the business there. And I think beyond that, while there has been a lot of great developments for patients in HCC, there are certainly much more that can be done for them. Yes, Jay, Mike, I would say we are very, very focused on generating data, using that data to help us understand where we can differentiate and how that can then again raise the bar for patients from the standpoint of standard of care. Once we have conviction as we generate conviction, where we can take that in terms of novel combinations across multiple different indications. So -- but you're right, we're in a very good position, especially in today's somewhat tenuous market on a macro level to be able to have the cash flows that we've got and the -- certainly the balance sheet that we've got to be able to make those investments both internally as well as considering external options. So we're all about building the team, building the portfolio, driving top line growth, helping more patients. Could we see long-term gross to net levels approach something at a kind of 35% to 40% run rate, that would be very helpful. The numbers that we saw Q1 versus Q4, that's the data. I think this is a trend if you've been tracking other biotech and/or pharma earnings calls over the last few weeks, you'll see this is not that -- actually, this is a very general trend across oral oncolytics. But what happens in the future, I'm not going to speculate or predict it's just not proper here or anywhere. In terms of IP, like I said with Michael's question, I don't want to get into the details there. So as time goes on, we'll be able to get a better picture of that by using a variety of different methods, and we'll be happy to report that when that's more mature. Given that there's going to be some competitor data with J&J's small number in the second half, I'm curious to understand how you -- your guys' thoughts around molecule differentiation, given that if I'm not mistaken, you have a covalent inhibitor versus their allosteric inhibitor. In addition to that, what type of plans do you have in terms of potentially combining your MALT1 inhibitor with like venetoclax or BTK. Yes, kind of obviously looking forward to seeing what the J&J data show. So mechanistically, it's somewhat differentiated from the J&J approach. Certainly, it has potential in a variety of B and T cell lymphoma, particularly obviously, one area of interest is in patients who've failed on BTK inhibitors. There's always -- there's also some data that MALT1 activation an inhibition of it, they also have a role in combination with immune CheckMate inhibitors. So ultimately, how the clinical data compare will obviously be a great interest. And lastly, with the COSMIC-313 data expected in July, if you can briefly just discuss how you guys are envisioning physicians utilizing it in practice and how it might have a higher standard given the potential saving profile that might be borne out. With regards to the COVID impact, I would say, broadly, we're kind of largely beyond a significant impact of business. As you pointed out, with demand growth, not only for CABOMETYX, but also the TKI market itself grew 7% quarter-over-quarter. So I think largely, that's in the rearview mirror. But I will say there's certainly still limited access in many accounts, and that's varied across the country versus community or academia, et cetera. And we view that as -- we're excited about the opportunities these accounts are starting to open up, so we can have just a greater chance to share our data with them and hopefully continue to drive CABOMETYX and nivolumab for appropriate patients. With regards to 313 and the triplet at a very high level, I think we're certainly excited to see the data. And I just point out that nivo/ipi has a, if you look across data sources has a 20% to 25% market share. In the first-line setting, so I think that could potentially be some low-hanging fruit given positive data and approval, et cetera, that, that might be a good opportunity for the addition of cabo in that setting. Also, I think one possibility there is they do have, I think, about 20%, if I'm recalling correctly, primary progression rate in the 214 trial. So given the totality of the data with Cabo, we think that's certainly an opportunity to improve upon that as well. So I think it's going to be Important to really look at the totality of the data in this data readout, whether it's all the radiographic data, obviously, the primary endpoint of PFS as well as what we see in survival at that point as well the safety. Question for Michael or P.J., just on the gross to net, kind of if there's anything you can point to what drove the gross to net, if there's one element or multiple drivers and then any kind of guidance you can provide around the gross to net going forward? So again, we won't comment on gross to net going forward in terms of future years. So Peter, I mean, what we talked about earlier was there's a seasonality effect of Medicare Part D patients going through the donor hole. Those on co-pay assistance, the commercial patients using our co-pay systems programs and they go through their deductibles at the beginning of the calendar year is another driver. This year, we saw a higher 340B utilization in Q1 when we compare it to the second half of last year was relatively flat. And then for this year, I think we're looking right now at a 29% gross to net percentage. And obviously, that's an estimate right now and that can change based on different utilization patterns of 340B or co-pay assistance or Medicare or Medicaid and so on. And then, I guess, kind of a follow-up question really about demand trend. I would just say we continue to see -- as I mentioned, six quarters of growth and strength in the demand trends. It's just -- we're pleased it's being driven by, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, primarily longer duration of therapy on the first-line patients benefiting from the combination of CABOMETYX and nivolumab. The TRx growth Q-over-Q was 11%, which is, as I mentioned, also for the market. as I mentioned, with really being driven by the combination patients. The second would be on STELLAR-002, the study involving XL092. I believe there were some treatment arms, including BEMPEG can you just maybe provide any additional insight into any recent updates given the Nektar's BEMPEG program. Just to be clear on that, we've reached the number of events that we need for our primary analysis of PFS. So you're correct, that time line has moved a little bit. STELLAR-002 had three arms, a combination with nivolumab, a combination with nivo and ipi and then a combination of nivo and BEMPEG, all with 092 in genitourinary tumors. And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we are removing the BEMPEG arm following the recent Phase III readouts for that molecule and the discontinuation of the program. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call."
