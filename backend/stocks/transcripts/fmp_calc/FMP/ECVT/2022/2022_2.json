    "content": " Volume growth from product and service demand continued, primarily driven by higher virgin sulfuric acid and Regeneration Services and our Ecoservices business and higher polyethylene, hydrocracking and niche custom catalyst in our Catalyst Technologies business. Thus, excluding the $37 million sales impact associated with pass-through of higher sulfur costs, the adjusted EBITDA margin would have been 32.4% or a 310 basis point improvement compared to the second quarter of 2021. Adjusted EBITDA for Ecoservices increased 48% year-over-year to $60 million, driven by the benefit of higher sales volume and favorable pricing that more than offset the higher operating costs. During the second quarter, we saw positive demand trends with continued growth in silica catalyst sales, driven by polyethylene catalyst demand, and higher sales in our Zeolyst joint venture associated with the increased hydrocracking and niche custom catalyst sales. Second quarter adjusted EBITDA for Catalyst Technologies was $21 million, up 3.5% compared to the prior year, with the contribution of the higher sales volume, partially offset by unfavorable product mix and higher production costs. Given strong first half results and with the view of demand trends remaining stable into the third quarter, we are raising our previous guidance for the full year 2022 adjusted EBITDA to fall in a range of $265 million to $275 million, with no change to our adjusted free cash flow generation of $115 million to $125 million for the year.
