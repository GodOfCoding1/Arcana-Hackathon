    "content": " Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA was $69 million, up 9% compared to the fourth quarter of 2021, with the pricing benefit, partially offset by higher variable costs, largely associated with inflation, lower sales volume in silicon catalyst and higher turnaround costs in Ecoservices. Demand for regeneration services continued with higher sales volume compared to the fourth quarter of 2021, while market demand for virgin sulfuric acid remained strong in the fourth quarter, sales volume was down compared to the exceptionally strong sales volume in the fourth quarter of 2021, due in part to the adverse impact of planned customer turnarounds, disruption associated with Winter Storm Elliott and lower spot sales. Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA for Ecoservices was $54 million, up 4% compared to the fourth quarter of 2021, with the sales benefit being partially offset by higher turnaround costs, of approximately $3 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2021 and the impact of Winter Storm Elliott."
