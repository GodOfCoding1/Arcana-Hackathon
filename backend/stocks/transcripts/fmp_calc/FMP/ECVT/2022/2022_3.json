    "content": " With continued favorability in demand trends, Ecovyst's third quarter sales, including our 50% share in the ZI joint venture, were up 30%, and adjusted EBITDA was up 9%, compared to the third quarter of 2021. The increase was primarily driven by higher average selling prices, including the pass-through of higher sulfur costs, as well as the higher demand for Regeneration Services in our Ecoservices business and higher catalyst sales into polyethylene and niche custom applications within Catalyst Technologies. Higher pricing in the third quarter includes the pass-through of $28 million of higher sulfur costs, as well as the contractual index pass-through of other variable costs, including natural gas and freight, principally in our Ecoservices business. Third quarter adjusted EBITDA for Ecoservices was $64 million, up $12 million or nearly 24%, compared to the third quarter of 2021 on the higher sales volume and pricing covering increased operating costs, including sulfur, natural gas and freight. Third quarter adjusted EBITDA was $19 million, down $6 million, compared to the third quarter of 2021, with higher overall sales volume, offset by less favorable product sales mix and higher production costs within the quarter. Based upon our favorable results for the first nine months and our expectations for the fourth quarter, we anticipate our full-year 2022 adjusted EBITDA may fall toward the high-end of our $265 million to $275 million range, and we continue to expect adjusted free cash flow generation of $115 million to $125 million for the year.
