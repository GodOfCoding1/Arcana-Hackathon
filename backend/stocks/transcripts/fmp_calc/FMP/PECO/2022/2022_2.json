    "content": " Our second quarter core FFO increased 11.8% to $71.8 million, driven by increased revenue at our properties from higher occupancy levels and strong leasing spreads as well as lower interest expense from a reduced leverage. Your line is open. Your line is open. It was a good quarter, but that really -- that spread that you're talking about and the consistency of it over time is one of the just the financial things that explains the difference in our strategy between a big box, sort of, concept where the where the leasing takes so much longer to get from lease to operate to open versus our smaller format better. Your line is open. Your line is open. And that's where -- that's really what the 60 basis points I think that you're talking about is showing is that, not only are we talking about it, we're actually getting leases signed and getting rents paid in a much shorter period of time than most of our peers. Your line is open."
