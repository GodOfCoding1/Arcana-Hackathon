    "content": " I'm excited about the way in which our leadership team is coming together, the launch of our new value platform that is resonating with Denny's guests, the completion of our acquisition of Kiki's and our path toward extended operating hours, all culminating in accelerated adjusted EBITDA expectations for our fourth quarter. So maybe 90% of the franchise based or about let's say 1400 units, I think you said right now we sit at 870 units, so we're a little north of 60% reopened in in 24 7 and I think you mentioned that the monthly opening rate has doubled since the convention."
