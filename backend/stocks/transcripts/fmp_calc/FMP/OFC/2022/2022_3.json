    "date": "2022-10-28 17:49:04",
    "content": " During the fourth quarter, we expect to place over 900,000 square feet of development projects into service, which are over 98% leased, and the NOI from these projects supports the $0.60 FFO per share as adjusted for comparability midpoint for the fourth quarter. Our leasing accomplishments through three quarters exceeds our annual target of more than 620,000 square feet and with another quarter remaining is already 117% of our five year annual leasing total. Importantly, in the fourth quarter, 40% of our leased square footage was expansion space for existing tenants, indicating continued growth and mission work from healthy Defense budgets. During the quarter, we signed two new leases with the U.S. government for a total of 127,000 square feet, including a 68,000 square foot lease for the final two floors at 310 NBP, which is now 100% leased to the U.S. government. We completed 506,000 square feet of renewal leasing during the quarter with a retention rate of 92.2%, our highest in over two decades. Our 1.9 million square feet of active developments are 91% leased, assuring incremental NOI from these properties that will drive FFO growth in coming years."
