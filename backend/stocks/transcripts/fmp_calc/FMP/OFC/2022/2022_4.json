    "content": " These contributions are partially offset by $0.10 from higher interest expense based on the increased SOFR curve; a decline in capitalized interest resulting from the large volume of projects being placed into service, and the incremental interest from the venture financing, and a total of $0.06 from an increase in total G&A expenses from backfilling several open positions, market increases in wages and a reduction in capitalized labor; lower development fees, which accounts for $0.02 of this reduction as significant construction work on behalf of a tenant was completed in 2022; and accelerating the timing of the $190 million joint venture transaction."
