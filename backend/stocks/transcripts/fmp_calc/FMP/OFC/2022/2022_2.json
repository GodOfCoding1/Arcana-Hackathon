    "content": " Following this quarter's development leasing success, our active development pipeline now contains 1.9 million square feet of projects, all of which are Defense/IT locations. These 21 leases represent 50% of all the expiring footage in 2023 and 2024, and include 12 full building leases for highly improved buildings, including six secured buildings leased to the United States government, three buildings leased to defense contractors and three data Shell properties with significant tenant investment. Additional demand from contractors for space at Redstone led us to commence construction on our next 125,000 square foot inventory building, 8,100 Redstone Gateway, and we look forward to announcing leasing progress on this project in the coming quarters. Our 1.9 million square feet of active developments are 91% leased, assuring incremental NOI from these projects that will drive FFO growth in coming years. Congress appropriated to 2022 defense base budget with a 5.8% increase, the largest annual increase since fiscal year 2018, suggesting leasing demand will continue through calendar year 2023 and beyond. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open."
