    "content": " More generally, the company and its customers expect to experience supply chain and other challenges due to COVID-19, including rising raw material costs, higher delivery and shipment costs, supply chain disruptions, and extended handling times, similar to those reported by many companies. We just finished our first full quarter in this new model, continue to face significant cost pressure headwinds due to COVID-19 supply chain disruption, and we need additional experience to feel comfortable discussing where margins might trend in fiscal year '22. Before I turn the call back over to John, I will note, we continue to navigate a volatile landscape due to the continuing challenges from COVID-19, including higher raw material prices, delivery and shipment costs, supply chain disruption, extended handling times and delays or disruptions in procedure volume."
