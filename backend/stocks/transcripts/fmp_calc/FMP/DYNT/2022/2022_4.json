    "content": " Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased by 7.2% to $15.4 million in fiscal year '22 compared to $16.6 million in the prior fiscal year. Cash used in operating activities was $4.9 million for the fiscal year due to the company's working capital investment on the expected double-digit growth, specifically $5.6 million or 85% increase build in inventory to serve customer demand, add additional safety stock to offset continued expected supply chain disruption and new product introduction. The company expects the distribution of net sales in fiscal year '23 across the quarters to align with historical trends, highest in the first quarter, lower in the second and third quarters with a bounce back in the fourth quarter. On the higher sales I discussed, inventory as of the end of fiscal year '22 was $12.1 million compared to $11.6 million at the end of Q3 fiscal year '22. Gross margin in each quarter of fiscal year '22 was impacted by the effects of COVID-19 and supply chain challenges, including extraordinarily high freight, raw materials and labor costs. Without the addition of freight, raw materials and labor costs we experienced in Q4 of fiscal year '22 of approximately $0.45 million as a result of COVID-19 and inflationary pressures, our gross margin would have been 27.4%. The midpoint of this range, $46.5 million represents 5% organic revenue growth, which would exceed the market expectations for the full year. We expect that the changes we have made to deliver higher annual net sales, we will begin to deliver higher annual gross margin, operating income and cash flow from operations as we move through fiscal year '23. We have delivered sales growth for 5 consecutive quarters, well above market growth and above our $9.25 million continued net product sales baseline set in April 2021."
