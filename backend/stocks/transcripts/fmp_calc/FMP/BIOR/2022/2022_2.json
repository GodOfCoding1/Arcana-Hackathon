    "content": " Before I turn the call over to Mr. Mohanty, I would like to remind you that today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s call will include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including, but not limited to the types of statements identified as forward-looking in our quarterly report on Form 10-Q that we will file later today and our subsequent reports filed with the SEC, which will all be available on our website in the Investors section. For a further description of the risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements as well as risks related to our business, please see the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s periodic reports filed with the SEC. During the second quarter, we completed our transition from a diagnostics company into Biora Therapeutics, a biotherapeutics company that's working on changing the way large molecules can be delivered to patients with potentially game changing outcomes. We've continued to generate human safety and performance data with our targeted therapeutics program, where we recently shared top-line data from a human study demonstrating that the performance of our ingestible device is not impacted by food. Additionally, we recently concluded another study in active UC patients with outstanding results demonstrating the device functions as intended in these patients despite disease in the colon. We received constructive feedback from the FDA on our UC clinical development plan, where they generally agreed with our proposed trial design and provided comments that we expect will allow us to have a more robust IND filing. We very much appreciate the FDA feedback and intend to implement their recommendations, including their suggestions on the tox studies, which will already plan for Q4 of this year. We expect these activities to allow us to file an IND in Q1 of 2023, so we can begin our Phase 1 study. We gave very well received presentations at the DDW and CRS conferences, and recently announced that several abstracts covering our targeted and systemic programs were accepted at the upcoming ACG conference in October. As a reminder, our first program with this platform is an ulcerative colitis or UC. Our lead program, PGN-600 is a proprietary liquid formulation of tofacitinib delivered in the colon using our targeted delivery technology, which is a device approximately the size of a fish oil pill, a commercially available version of tofacitinib is approved for the treatment of UC. Tofacitinib is administered orally and like other drugs that are orally delivered is mostly absorbed in the stomach or the upper GI tract, whereas UC is a disease of the lower GI tract. By delivering drug topically at the site of disease where it is needed, PGN-600 has the potential to improve efficacy and also limit systemic exposure to improve safety. Fasting is the norm for ingestible devices, but fasting is not ideal for patients, especially for patients requiring frequent administration or dosing, which is what is required in chronic diseases like ulcerative colitis. All 39 devices indicated entry to the colon, activation and deployment regardless of fasted or fed schedule with no failure modes observed in the analyzed devices. To our knowledge, this could be the first ingestible therapeutic delivery device that may not require fasting or other food restriction for use, greatly enhancing patient convenience and particularly helpful for chronic diseases. Given the different gastrointestinal physiology and disease activity in these patients, it is critical that the device performs as intended and can identify entry into the colon, activate and release a payload in UC patients. In the study, the device was ingested orally by seven patients with active ulcerative colitis. The device was well tolerated and the study demonstrated that in all patients the device accurately identified entry into the colon, triggered release of a liquid payload and achieved distribution across the entire lower colon as confirmed by an independent scintigraphic imaging method. We're not aware of any other oral drug delivery technology that can accurately detect colon entry, especially in the environment of inflammation, blood, and highly variable motility seen with these patients. As you know, PGN-600 is our lead program in our targeted therapeutics platform and is a combination of our device and our proprietary formulation of tofacitinib. In Q2, we had submitted a Type C filing to the FDA asking for feedback on our proposed clinical development plan. As we had previously mentioned, we had already planned for an animal tox study later this year. We believe that with the final reports of the recently completed human functional studies and the planned animal tox study this year, we will be in a position to file an IND in Q1 2023 to support the initiation of our Phase 1 study. Following FDA feedback, we move ahead with more certainty and clarity and are able to share our proposed design for the study. The Phase 1 single and multiple ascending dose studies will evaluate safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of PGN-600. And in addition to drug concentrations in serum and feces, we will also measure drug concentrations in colon tissue. Given the data already generated and presented on the correlation between tissue concentration of tofacitinib and improved patient outcomes, if the clinical data generated in our Phase 1 trial confirms that we can safely achieve high tissue concentrations just as we have seen with PGN-600 in preclinical studies, we believe there is high likelihood of improving remission rates in UC patients compared to current therapies. Because of the well-known therapeutic profile of tofacitinib and standard oral formulations and the ability to utilize or reference these existing data, we believe our development risks from PGN-600 are reduced. Soon after the Phase 1 trial is completed, we plan to move into a disease interventional study, where we plan to evaluate clinical remission after eight weeks treatment with PGN-600 in active UC patients. Key opinion leader, Dr. S\u00c3\u00a9verine Vermeire gave a presentation titled \u00e2\u0080\u009cTofacitinib tissue exposure correlates with endoscopic outcome,\u00e2\u0080\u009d which Dr. Vermeire co-authored with lead author Dr. Bram Verstockt and others. In the presentation, Dr. Vermeire presented patient data confirming a significant relationship between drug levels in tissue and endoscopic improvement in patients with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis who were treated with tofacitinib. Specifically, the study supports the hypothesis that a tissue concentration of tofacitinib at or exceeding IC90 is directly correlated to significant improvement in patient outcomes. Preclinical data indicates that these tissue concentrations can be achieved with PGN-600, even with lower doses than commercially available oral doses of tofacitinib. In addition, current data suggests a need for combination therapy to target multiple inflammatory pathways in some patients with UC. However, combination therapies must overcome the systemic toxicity limits of current approaches. With respect to our IP in this area, we recently announced the issuance of a U.S. patent, the granting of two European patents and the allowance of an additional U.S. patent with claims directed at our device, including the localization technology that enables detection of colon entry. In addition to use in our drug delivery device, the localization technology is a standalone unique technology that has the potential to be used broadly for ingestible devices. Next, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll cover our systemic therapeutics platform. Our systemic therapeutics delivery solution is an oral device, which provides liquid jet delivery of large molecules to the small intestine in order to maximize systemic uptake. We believe this platform can help improve disease management and associated patient outcomes, reduce intravenous infusion costs, help expand the market for drugs across a range of chronic use indications and help biotherapeutics, such as monoclonals become more competitive with small molecule substitutes. Our platform has the potential to deliver a broad range of approved or other large molecules, such as proteins, peptides, and nucleic acid without complex reformulation. During the second quarter, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve continued to make progress with device, design and manufacturing. Although we have data with several molecules on this platform, such as anti-TNF-alpha and monoclonal antibodies, our initial focus is on a high concentration formulation of the peptide liraglutide, a GLP-1 receptor agonist. At the Controlled Release Society Annual Meeting in July, we presented results of early preclinical research on the systemic therapeutics platform, including the development of preclinical models that enable further evaluation of device performance and pharmacokinetics. We also presented the results of a preclinical study, where we demonstrated monoclonal antibody bioavailability of up to 55% with an average of 25% in animals with drug detected in blood. We expect the share existing and future results at other upcoming conferences, including the Parenteral Drug Association Universe of Pre-Filled Syringes and Injection Devices Conference, and the ACG Annual Meeting in October. This allowed patent application combined with the rest of our IP portfolio provide a strong footprint for Biora in the GLP-1 market, which is forecasted to be well over $20 billion by 2025. We plan to initiate a tox study with PGN-600 later this year, and based on the results, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll file IND in Q1 2023 to support the initiation of our Phase 1 study. Operating expenses, excluding stock-based compensation expenses, were $12.9 million in a second quarter of 2022, a reduction of $5.1 million compared to Q1, as we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve now completed a transfer of our molecular testing assets. More specifically, G&A expenses in a second quarter were $8.4 million, including $0.7 million in stock-based compensation expense, a 38% reduction compared to Q1. While R&D expenses in the second quarter were $5.9 million, including $0.7 million in stock-based compensation expense. As we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve mentioned in our previous call, we expect R&D expenses will mainly track our clinical studies workflow and combined with further G&A cost savings. We had a cash balance of $48.5 million as of June 30, 2022, giving us runway well in 2023, thanks to our reduced cash burn. Yes, if you remember in the past we said we were approaching them with a slightly aggressive approach on the supporting data package even though we had internally already planned the animal tox study, and by the way, you know some of these animal tox studies they book out like a year ahead of time. So not referencing any existing animal tox study, but using our own, it was one of the main things. And so, we're planning to do that and we didn't have any of the current studies like 601 and 602 completed at the time. Now that we have that information and we have this planned tox study coming up anyway, we think it's best. We proposed both Phase 1 and Phase 2, and that's why we're sharing so much more. If you look at the actual design itself, those were things that we had not shared before, and we feel more comfortable sharing because of all the input that they gave us, some of that will just help us make our protocol a little tighter, but most of that gave us comfort that they generally think this is a good plan and a good idea. So we feel pretty good about getting that input because it's \u00e2\u0080\u0093 as you know it's not just the drug, it's not just a device, it's the combo. We expect to execute this study, get all of the packages buttoned up and filed. And hopefully people look at the fact that we're looking at a dose somewhere in the range of 5 to 10, which is what maybe about a quarter of the current commercial dose. And so we referenced I think just early on the call, the IC90 tissue levels and so for us to be able to get a tissue leveled somewhere in that range and a very low plasma level. If we can show what we showed in our animal models, right, so far we have shown in our animal models multiple factor, lower systemic uptake and a much higher tissue uptake. And if we can get anything in that range in the tissue and anything in the range of much less than card systemic uptake, those are the places we can reference existing commercial data from Dalvance that \u00e2\u0080\u0093 that would be very interesting. So if I understand your question correctly, you want to know if the FDA was worried about the JAK inhibitors or our device. There was no concern about safety, especially given that we explained to them the levels that we were trying to go to which is a much lower than the commercially approved dose. And the fact that we have some data that shows the kind of systemic uptake, which is much lower. It was the combination of a drug and a device meant that we couldn't quite reference the previous animal tox studies we had to generate our own, and that's what we're doing. So the combination, which is not a worry just something that we need to do, so the combination going through animal tox study is the main requirement that we have to complete. But I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m quite sure we could leverage our own studies, even though there were different molecules because the combination would\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve gone through \u00e2\u0080\u0093 the drug device combination would\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve gone through more data generation by the time we get to the next molecule. So we had the 602 study that we just published, where we actually gave this to very active UC patients with pretty severe disease. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re completing it, completing the reports so that we can publish them, but they were very active high scores in that study. And so there was bleeding, there was inflammation, there was varying rates of motility in terms of like you said, right, many motions, several times a day, our capsule or device was still able to accurately locate in variable patients with variable disease, the right location, deliver the drug. And independently with imaging, we could show that the drug coated the entire colon. So even with all of those variations that you talk about, motility, multiple motions, inflammation, bleeding, all of it gives us confidence that we believe that this would work quite well. And our last question is about your device performance study, just want to hear it in plain language. We have now done many devices through many different people, healthy volunteers, UC patients and all of them worked. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re quite excited by the fact that it also worked with different feeding regimes, to not have the restriction potentially on the label of fasting requirements before or after the pill. If the uptake is like we saw in the animals, this gives us a lot more confidence going to our next molecule. At the same time, our other device on the systemic also continues to progress well."
