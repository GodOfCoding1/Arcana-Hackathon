    "content": " Based on preclinical data showing bioavailability more than double our target levels, we're working to complete the optimization of our next-gen BioJet systemic delivery device to support additional preclinical data generation during the second quarter of 2023. What might be important to remember is that we have previously talked about having run an actual study in canines, where the number of not appropriately deployed devices was well over 20%, and given the differences in the physiology of animals and humans, it is expected that a large number of them in an animal study wouldn't perform the same way as they would in humans."
