Given our position in our outlook, is there any sense in approaching some of those larger developers and saying, look, we can allocate a certain percentage of our monthly, weekly, quarterly production to you as a single customer, and then they can have a more consistent supply of units because a lot of things I've read makes it sound like there's lots of demand on the park side, and they're coming to market with a rental rate in many areas, it's very attractively priced versus the competition. Your line is open. Your line is open. And as the market slows and people idle plants and don't have orders and companies, smaller businesses shut down, though you really - you can't get small fast enough and I think that some of the larger competitors could really struggle there where you've got 40 plants, and there's more fixed cost than people realize."
