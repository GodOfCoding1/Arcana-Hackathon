    "content": " And I think to the extent that we see what we\u2019re seeing now in April, and that continue through April, May, June and the second quarter, and then through the third quarter, I think there is the potential for a significant number of our assets to come out of cash traps, because they typically are six months or two consecutive quarter tests. I think we\u2019ve got a handful of assets that have franchise agreements that might be expiring over the next several years that have maybe what we think are some of the weaker brands in our system, where we don\u2019t think the pips required will make it worth it or some of our lower RevPAR, full service assets that when you look at, when we look at the life of the assets and the amount of CapEx that we have to put in over time, given their lower RevPAR profile, it just makes it hard for them to cash flow in a significant basis. Yes, that\u2019s a good question. And honestly, as you see, continued geopolitical concerns, these inflationary concerns and the cost concerns, I mean, we\u2019re seeing on the construction side and even our own CapEx budgeting, projects being skinny down a little bit, in certain situations to keep down costs that with what it\u2019s now taking to build in, particularly in larger, more urban markets I think what you see coming into the pipeline, a lot of that is not going to be made in that even with this inflationary environment and cost situations. Yes, that\u2019s a good question."
