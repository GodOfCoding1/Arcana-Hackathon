    "content": " The hotel was able to bring back a large long-term piece of group business, which helped propel the hotel to an 11% growth in group room revenue during the second quarter, relative to 2019. With this core piece of business back in place, the hotel was able to be more selective with remaining groups which drove the overall group room rate during the second quarter by 15% over the same time period in 2019. Lastly, I would like to highlight the success of Lakeway Resort & Spa in Austin, which also broke a record with hotel EBITDA nearing $2.5 million during the second quarter."
