    "content": " During the quarter, we sold the Sheraton Ann Arbor in Michigan for $36 million which $34.5 million was in cash and $1.5 million is due in the future equating to an estimated trailing 12-month cap rate of 3.9% and a 2019 cap rate of 7.7%. Adjusted EBITDAre was $82.1 million for the quarter, which reflected a growth rate of 75% over the prior year quarter. During the third quarter, our portfolio recovered 98% of our group room revenue relative to the same time period in 2019, and we continue to see acceleration from this segment. Well, I think that as of right now, given that, we're being I'd say a little bit cautious in the sense that, we want to make sure, we understand what's going on with the debt financing markets, we do have extension tests, and \u00e2\u0080\u0093 on some of our loans next year that are \u00e2\u0080\u0093 kind of happened throughout the year."
