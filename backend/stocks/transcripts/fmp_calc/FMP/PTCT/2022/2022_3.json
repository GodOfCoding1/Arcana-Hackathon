    "content": " We haven't provided any specific information on what we are seeing in terms of responder rates other than to emphasize what we have seen in the Phase 2 study and what we expect in this study, which again what we saw in Phase 2 was responses across the full spectrum of patients, not only with those with the baseline phenylalanine level of greater than 600 micromoles per liter but importantly also in that subgroup of patients, the classical PKU patients with baseline phenylalanine levels greater than 1,200 micromole per liter, where historically there has been no response in these patients to Kuvan, and we have been able to demonstrate market reductions in blood phenylalanine levels. And so we're in a position now where we've gotten that first written feedback that seems to have focused on a potential interest of using Study 041 alone to meet that stated substantial evidence of effectiveness criterion that the agency has held out for rare disorders where a single study can suffice, rather than seemingly focused on the clear evidence of benefit in the overall ITT population, along with the confirmatory evidence we can clearly offer, whether it\u00e2\u0080\u0099d be from a pooled analysis of  and Study 041 with a P value of 0.002, showing that the findings of significant treatment benefit clearly  by chance or outside of course just trying to understand where we can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t confirm that what we're observing in the clinical trials in terms of slowing of progression are manifesting themselves in important delays in the key morbid transitions of the disease, whether that\u00e2\u0080\u0099d be the four year delay and loss of ambulation compared to a match natural history cohort, the 1.8 years in terms of loss of pulmonary function."
