    "content": " For PTC518, an oral splicing modifier, we initiated the Phase 2 PIVOT-HD study in patients with Huntington's disease in the first quarter of this year, and we look forward to data from the first 12 weeks by the end of the year. Yes, thanks for the question. Yes, thanks for the question. I think we've been saying this for quite some time that we believe that the EMA really looks at the totality of the data and includes not only the trials and the totality of the data and the results that we have in the trials, but also the results of the registry where we're seeing comparison at five and a half years, greater walking years better in terms of getting off the ground, much better pulmonary function. Yes, until we turn over the cards and see the data, it's hard to say exactly but we anticipate that even if it's not -- we're hoping for perfection, but if there's imperfection, we still think that this data -- if you think about this data when look into totality, the data Study 041 that everything when you look at the six-minute walk test, you look at the time function test, the NSAA falls, all the measurements that we did, it always favors Translarna over placebo. I think it's just intended to allow for as many patients as possible to enter into that follow-up period, even if they maybe didn't meet the criteria to be randomized that we could actually put them in if we want to bolster the number of patients we're collecting long-term safety data on."
