Net cash used in operating activities of $71 million compared to $70 million in Q1 2021, reflecting higher costs associated with expanded product offering and increased factory capacity as well as expenses incurred as a result of the financial restatement and related work, offset by favorable working capital net cash outflows as compared to Q1 2021."
