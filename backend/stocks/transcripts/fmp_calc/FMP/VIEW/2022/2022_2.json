    "content": " For the quarter, we reported revenue of $16 million which represents a 4% year-over-year decrease from Q2 2021 due to timing of smart glass projects that are expected to be produced and shift in the second half of 2022, mostly offset by higher smart building platform and smart building technologies revenues. The decrease in our cost of revenue reflects lower levels of contract loss accruals, higher factory yields, product mix and lower levels of stock-based compensation expense, partially offset by higher costs associated with increased new smart building platform revenues, higher factory costs following the scaling of the factory in the second half of 2021 and higher levels of inventory reserves. With the launch and ramp of our fourth generation panel as well as the new product offerings smart building platform and smart building technologies behind us, we anticipate a moderation of R&D spend in the second half of 2022. Net cash used in operating activities for the first half of 2022 was $153 million compared to $125 million in the first half of 2021, reflecting higher costs associated with expanded product offering and increased factory capacity as well as expenses incurred as a result of the financial restatement and related work. As we have said before, we anticipate cash burn will moderate in the second half of 2022 through working capital management, reduce general and administrative spend following the completion of the restatement and higher revenues driving improved factory unit economics."
