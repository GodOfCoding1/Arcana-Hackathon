    "content": " For the quarter, we reported revenue of $24 million, which represents a 26% year-over-year increase from Q3 2021 due to growth across all product lines, including Smart Glass, Smart Building Platform, and Smart Building Technologies. Our Q3 2022 non-GAAP cost of revenues decreased 4% year-over-year from Q3 2021, primarily driven by a decreased in new contract loss accruals recently implemented cost savings initiatives in the factory and improved inventory management, partially offset by increased costs associated with the delivery of higher Smart Building Platform revenues and higher production requirements in the factory. So, as we mentioned in our prepared remarks, as Amy pointed out, we significantly reduce cash burn in the quarter Q2 to Q3 from about $80 million to about $50 million, and we expect to continue to march on the revenue path, reducing unit economics or improving unit economics as we ramp revenue, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to manage our OpEx to right size the company based on the R&D needs, based on the sales and marketing needs and of course, G&A to properly run a public company."
