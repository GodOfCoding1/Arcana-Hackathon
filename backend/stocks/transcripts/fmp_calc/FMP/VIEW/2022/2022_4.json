    "content": " First, while hitting $100 million in revenues is a historical milestone for the company, what is underlying that is a tremendous effort to create the products and manage the supply chain and manufacturing capabilities, field service, and most importantly, customers that are steadfast partners in this journey to fundamentally make buildings more sustainable, healthier and smarter. We continue to innovate in Smart Building technologies, our cloud-based SaaS business to accelerate the digital transformation of real estate, I am pleased to report that this high margin business grew to $11 million in revenue in 2022. For the quarter, we reported revenue of $44 million, which represents a 56% year-over-year increase from Q4 2021 due to growth across all product lines, including Smart Glass, Smart Building Platform and Smart Building Technologies. For the full year 2022, we reported revenue of $101 million, representing 37% year-over-year growth, compared to $74 million in 2021 and within our guidance of $100 million to $110 million. For the fourth quarter of 2022, we reported an adjusted EBITDA loss of $57 million, compared to $60 million in Q4 2021, reflecting higher revenues and the leverage of our expenses over our top line growth. Last year, we said we anticipated cash burn would improve in the second half, driven by leverage from our higher revenues, improved working capital management, reduced G&A expense following the completion of the restatement and realization of our focus on cost savings initiatives."
