    "content": " We reported 2022, fourth quarter earnings per share of $0.45, which was driven by a continuation of our strong growth, efficiency and asset quality trends, as well as emerging funding pressures which impacted the net interest margin as interest rates continued to rise. Given the level of loan growth we've seen -- that we've been able to generate during the year and where we are in the interest rate cycle, it's not surprising to us that we've started to run up against funding pressures. Looking ahead to the first quarter of '23, we expect to see a similar pace of margin compression as we just saw in the fourth quarter with stabilization thereafter and the potential for margin expansion in the back half of the year as funding costs flatten and loan yields continue to expand. On Slide 11, you can see we had strong fourth quarter loan growth across the various loan types led by multifamily, which continues to be a key growth driver given our expertise in the Twin Cities market and the low risk characteristics of the portfolio. I think, for us, I mean, if you look at the growth that -- in the third and fourth quarter, with the pace of loan growth and having to kind of fill the gap with higher cost wholesale funding or broker deposits, I mean, when we, we highlighted the core deposit betas that we've experienced and we feel confident our ability to grow core deposits throughout 2023. I just think when you consider those inputs on the loans and the deposit -- core deposit growth and given our rate outlook, I mean we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re assuming a 5% fed funds rate."
