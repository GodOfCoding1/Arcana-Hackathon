    "content": " Even more notable is that approximately 70% of these wins are in our electrification growth factor, which will drive Sensata's future revenue outgrowth and are directly due to the incremental investments we have made over the past several years. Our Performance Sensing business reported revenues of $757.7 million, an increase of 10.6% compared to the same quarter last year. As shown on Slide 10, Sensing Solutions reported revenues of $257 million in the fourth quarter, an increase of 3% as compared to the same quarter last year. Adjusted for charges excluded from our non-GAAP results corporate and other costs were $65.5 million, an increase from the prior year quarter primarily reflecting higher research and development and business development spend to support our megatrend growth initiatives, partially offset by lower compensation, incentive compensation and favorable foreign exchange. The record new business wins of more than $640 million in 2021, and more than $1 billion in 2022, along with our rapid revenue growth in these areas, clearly demonstrates how Sensata's expanding capabilities are appealing to our customers in driving market outgrowth."
