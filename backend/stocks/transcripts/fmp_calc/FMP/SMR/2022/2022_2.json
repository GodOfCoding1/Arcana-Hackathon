A telephone replay will also be available for seven days through a registration link, also accessible on NuScale\u00e2\u0080\u0099s website. At this time for opening remarks, I would like to turn the call over to Diane Hughes, Vice President of Marketing and Communications. With us today are President and Chief Executive Officer, John Hopkins; and Chief Financial Officer, Chris Colbert. Please note that although, the merger was Spring Valley closed on May 2, this report and our 10-Q will cover the entire three and six months ended June 30. We issued the earnings release earlier today, which can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website at ir.nuscalepower.com. Before getting started, I'd like to refer you to our Safe Harbor disclaimer regarding forward-looking statements, which is included in the press release. During today's call, we will be making forward-looking statements, which reflect our current views of existing trends and information. You can find a discussion of our risk factors, which could potentially contribute to such differences in our S-1 and other filings with the SEC. Also, during this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. I'll now turn the call over to John Hopkins, NuScale\u00e2\u0080\u0099s President and Chief Executive Officer. Then my colleague, NuScale\u00e2\u0080\u0099s CFO, Chris Colbert, will provide a detailed update on our financial results and reaffirm our outlook. As a first publicly-traded SMR technology provider, we have even more opportunities in venues to make our case for nuclear, especially modern small scale nuclear as a safe, clean, and economic source of cost effective, 100% carbon-free base load power. We believe NuScale is a pure-play on a critical emerging trends in clean energy, specifically zero-carbon base load in next-generation nuclear technology. We intend to keep working aggressively to meet our operational and financial milestones, build our business and change the landscape of clean energy. Now more than ever, the world needs more clean energy sources and we believe NuScale is primed to fulfill this need in a disproportionate way. With the tripling of natural price, gas prices in some areas and the rising threat, the energy security around the world, the need is even more urgent for reliable, clean electricity produced from nuclear. Based with a fragile electrical grid in the prospect of summertime blackouts, California agreed to earmark hundreds of millions of dollars to buy power from fossil fuel plants that are scheduled to shut down as soon as next year. Tesla is telling its customers an ERCOT, the Texas\u00e2\u0080\u0099 grid operator to charge their cars only at night. Renewable such as solar and wind are important to our energy future, but they're not the whole story. To combat climate change, we must replace greenhouse gas intensive fossil fuels with emissions free energy. NuScale\u00e2\u0080\u0099s SMR can deliver base load power and load follow, better supporting grids that are reliant on intermittent solar and wind generation. Best way to do this is to use the context of our five key strategic objectives for 2022, which we shared on our June business update call. As a reminder, our five year near-term objectives are one, we intend to secure our next committed customer by year-end. Two, we intend to issue long lead material specifications for the nuclear reactor pressure vessel. Three, we intend to complete the reactor building design. Four, we intend to submit a standard design approval application to the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission for the VOYGR-6 module power plant that UAMPS plans deploy. Five, we intend to complete our standard plan design, which will also refer to as SPD throughout my remarks. First, we continue to build a potential customer pipeline. The progress is solid at our anchor customer, UAMPS, in the U.S. and we continue to strengthen our six relationships around the world. Moreover, we have 18 signed and active MOUs in 11 countries and nine strategic relationships. Some of which I'll discuss in a moment, customer opportunities in a pipeline are now at over 100 and we are happy the level, the discussions we are having across the board. Looking overseas, we have highly concerted efforts in Romania. On June 26, the U.S. government committed $14 million towards a front end engineering design study, in Romania that could lead to the deployment of our VOYGR-6 nuclear power plant. This eight month effort, which is expected to cost $28 million in total will include contributions for Romania SA Nuclearelectrica and other industry participants. The project will provide to Romanians with key site specific data needed for the deployment of our power plant, such as cost, construction schedule and licensing details. Furthermore on May 23, the United States announced, it will provide Romania with a NuScale small module reactor, SMR simulator for Romania to establish an E2 Center at University Polytechnica in Bucharest. During the quarter, we also made great progress in Poland. On July 8, our Polish partner, KGHM a leading copper and silver mining conglomerate and large industrial energy user submitted to their regulators at application to assess NuScale\u00e2\u0080\u0099s technology. In early August, we expect to receive the tender offer and statement of commencement for the licensing work and start negotiations on the full scope. To support the licensing process, KGHM, intensely provide Polish regulators with updated licensing and safety reports by the end of October. All-in-all, we are pleased with our progress towards securing that second committed customer by year-end. One of the major components to the NuScale power module, which was completed in May. In addition to supporting our ability to place long lead material, our orders. In addition to material specs, we have initiated certain pre-manufacturing activities ensure that we can support client manufacturing schedules. We executed the upper RPV forging, die purchase with Doosan in April of 2022, to prepare for the start of manufacturing. We also completed physical testing of the steam generator tube installation, demonstrating progress on our manufacturing readiness. In late July, we announced an agreement with National Technical Systems to establish an equipment qualification test chamber, which will allow us to qualify components that meet U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission and plant-specific requirements. The key takeaway from all of this activity is that NuScale is extensively focused on readiness, by actively engaging with our manufacturing partners in completing fabrication tests for first of a kind components. Moving along to our third objective, we completed some key elements of reactor building design. Fourth, we made progress on critical activities that support the standard design approval application for SDAA. This included delivery of reactor building crane design inputs, completion of reactor building sites inputs for fuels analysis, an emergency core cooling system, valve design deliverables. Finally, the SPD is well underrway with completion still projected for year end. By completing the SPD in advance of any construction activities, our customers can be confident that we have thought through the challenges of deploying all aspects through a NuScale plant. Leading this SPD at our expense saves our customers money, that they can then allocate precise specific design changes, as opposed to helping put the build for the design of a plant. Most importantly, we form the new Voyager Service and Delivery business unit, or VSD. The VSD will help us to more effectively deliver our Voyager plants and services, which in turn will help our customers more easily operate and maintain a Voyager plant. The VSD will be led by Tom Mundy, who previously served as Chief Commercial Officer, Managing Director for the United Kingdom and Europe and the Vice President of Program Management. Prior to joining NuScale, Tom served as founding CEO and President of Exelon Nuclear Partners, LLC. During Q2, we also made some significant progress in partnerships. Most importantly is the license agreement with our partner Paragon, which will enable widespread use of our NRC-approved Highly Integrated Protection System or HIPS platform. For over 30 years, they have provided the nuclear sector with established technology solutions, such as instrumentation and control systems, sophisticated and repair programs. We develop the HIPS platform with Paragon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Rock Creek Innovation subsidiary, which develops safety critical applications. Our objective is to make the HIPS technology available to the entire nuclear power industry, enhancing the safety of all nuclear plants improves public perception of nuclear power, thus supporting our own marketing efforts. The DOE awarded MIT $800,000 to study the use of Accident Tolerant fuels in our SMR. By studying and simulating the usage and safety performance of their fuel, we have the potential to improve the safety profile of nuclear energy, even further beyond a substantial improvements offered by our SMR design. Two weeks ago, the NRC voted unanimously to approve the design certification of our SMR. To avoid confusion, keep in mind that our fourth near-term objective, the SDAA refers to our newer 77 megawatt 6 module design. The honest development, which applies directly to us, the general support for nuclear continues to grow. For example, at this year\u00e2\u0080\u0099s G7 Global Infrastructure Partnership Summit, President Biden reaffirmed our country\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pledge to combat climate change in part by supporting our SMR deployment in Romania. Furthermore in Europe, member countries are advancing to reduce greenhouse gas emissions based on their nation\u00e2\u0080\u0099s energy portfolios and infrastructure. In fact, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s somewhat surprisingly given their stated stance on nuclear, Germany recently decided not to retire the remaining three nuclear power plants due to the dire need for this clean source of power. Thank you, John and good afternoon, everyone. I will discuss our second quarter financial performance, update you on a strong capital structure and financial position. All the figures I referred to will be for the second quarter of 2022, unless I note otherwise. As Diane noted at the start of the call, this earnings release in our 10-Q will report NuScale results for the entire three and six months ended June 30. We are not including Spring Valley expenses prior to the merger, and they had no expenses subsequently. Since revenue is still small, our focus is on effectively applying our operating expense budget. As you would expect with funding in place in May, OpEx grew versus Q1 as we ramped our commercialization plan. The increase in G&A resulted from new hires across the organization, partially offset by lower accounting and finance fees. Having covered that we did generate revenue in the quarter, and it was somewhat higher than the first quarter. The better top line was due to higher procurement and construction activities, supporting new ramps, which is cost shared with DOE, more customer early works agreements launching and more consulting services. Looking ahead, we are well funded to meet our financial projections over the next several years. Our $351 million in cash, and no debt gives us substantial financial flexibility and years of run way. Not surprisingly there is some confusion, which is a natural result that the complexity associated with our transition to being publicly traded. At quarter end there are over 42 million shares of Class A common stock outstanding, and over 178 million shares of Class A common stock issuable upon the exchange of NuScale LLC Class B units. It is comprised of 14.4 million shares from Spring Valley Class A shareholders, 3.9 million shares from Spring Valley founders and 23.7 million shares from pipe shareholders. In the coming quarters, we expect that shareholders not subject to lockups will elect to exchange their Class B units to Class A shares. Outstanding stock options totaled $14.7 million, public warrants comprise $11.5 million and private placement warrants amounted to $8.9 million. Given that the market value of NuScale common shares has turned in nicely above this strike price level, we have assumed the full exercise of all warrants and related earnouts in our calculation of fully diluted shares. So adding it up on a fully diluted basis, we have 257.2 million shares. Finally, a quick reminder, we are reaffirming our projections for 2022. First, demand for clean, safe nuclear power is building all over the world. Second, the industry is increasingly recognized that NuScale\u00e2\u0080\u0099s next generation nuclear technology is safer, more versatile and more cost efficient than ever. Our level of safety far exceeds the already high standards of currently operating plans, which uses decades old technology. And finally, we are making great progress on our five near-term goals, which are securing additional committed customers, issuing long lead material specifications, completing the reactor building design, completing our standard plan designs and advancing our standard design approval application with the NRC. We are highly confident, we can achieve these goals by year end. Operator, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re ready to begin the question-and-answer portion of the call, please. I guess, starting with maybe for Chris, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got the revenue outlook that you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re reaffirming here for the year. So in our projections, we did in December of last year, we short of used, I think of $155 million of free cash flow of this year. We didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t break that out separately projected, but I believe you can derive it from the information I just cited, Marc. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m curious, with the most recent announcement here in the industry with Dow and X-energy, which I thought was kind of interesting. Yes, Marc, this is John. I mean, as you know, NuScale doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have to be tied to a grid for safety purposes as proven to the NRC. So at the end of day, having companies like Dow and others who are looking at process heat, perhaps hydrogen or ammonia production we can be right next to the end user. So companies like Dow, I think are pretty forward thinking and looking \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been doing this for quite some time, it wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t just out of blue. And how investors should think about, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve gotten the question a few times, like what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the possibility of cost coming in higher than expected and kind of risking the project viability. I was actually at a project review a couple weeks ago, which was with the UAMPS management team from CFPP, Fluor attended. Also, we had a Japanese manufacturer, we went through the numbers. However, having suppliers such as the Dyson and the Samsungs of the world and also minority shareholders, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re willing to really sharpen the pencil. So they all \u00e2\u0080\u0093 our supply chain anticipates there will be some increases, but at the end of the day, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve all got to be ensure that this project successful. So I feel again, as I said, if with gas prices where they are around $8 million per BTU I feel pretty comfortable. They\u00e2\u0080\u0099re in the process of finalizing their Class III, as you know, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s five classifications of estimating. So I suspect here within the next month, or so there should be an announcement coming out from the customer. As you can, well imagine we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re all around this as well as others and Chris probably better serve for you to answer. So point right here, this includes Chief Financial Officer role as I manage our government relations and there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been a lot of discussion about the Inflation Reduction Act. Three, our general assessment is that it does provide benefits for customers who would invest in clean energy technology above and beyond what they currently enjoy. But we have asked our customers, what it specifically means to them because there are a number of requirements, other callouts and factors that come into play. So we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re kind of waiting to hear, one, see it pass on Friday we hope. And second to hear from our customers, how that factors into them and how we can make sure that we get the greatest benefit of that act for them in terms of how we structure our contracts and deliver the project. But, generally speaking it certainly, we think should be a positive if that would defer to our customers to help us interpret the benefit there. But if it does have that benefit, we would expect to see that flow into our really customer action as we go forward in the year as they evaluate and rethink about what they may do investment wise in clean energy. So no concerns, I guess, internally around sort of the fact that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, I guess trying to incent other technologies as well under the legislation soon as it get passed. And in particular, Marc, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s one section that that goes in specifically, it was a concern of Senator managing where to make sure that it was a technology neutral. And so for technology going into construction after 2024, I think it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s really measured based upon what they output in terms of carbon dioxide and we don't even met in the production of megawatt hours, carbon dioxide. So, in reaffirming our outlook for 2022, that includes what we saw for use of cash. And we monitored very tightly what our spend is, but we haven't yet seen any negative impact in terms of an increased drag on cash for 2022. That said, we'll be continuing to monitor it, but most of our spending is in costs for labor, for employees and staff, and then for labor, that's provided by our contractors such as Fluor and Sargent & Lundy. And as we see perhaps some labor pressures flowing through there, you may see some of that come through, but as of now we're still tracking to what we projected at the end of last year in terms of cash usage for what we need to get done. Marc, and as you know, cash is king for us. Cash is critically important and all our vendors who submit their invoices to us, go through a rigorous process to prove competitiveness. And then just lastly, the process, obviously with the Romania appears to be, I guess, one of the more advanced next to UAMPS, and you've got the MOU, your building simulator, I guess just what's next in the process. I met with their prime minister and their energy minister, and they again indicated the importance of this project to the country of Romania for predominantly energy security as well as climate disruption. The CEO of Nuclearelectrica is coming with his team to Corvallis, we're going to sit down. And then from there, they'll go out to the project to and they'll sit down with us to go through the project sequencing and scheduling. Another good plus on this is we know their regulators are in communications with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, having gone through the rigor of that NRC. They will in fact, put their solvent stamp as Romania that they're more than willing to utilize data from the NRC, which is very important. By the way, it's Shar on for Marc. Yes, I've asked Dr. Jos\u00c3\u00a9 Reyes that same question, and we don't need Accident Tolerant fuels because of our safety design basis of this design. However, we are working with him and maybe future state and years to come, there could be an opportunity use Accident Tolerant fuels. And as well as providing added benefit in terms of the Accident Tolerant aspect, which does figure into some way in the EU taxonomy. So it could be helpful in both those areas, but it's not required for what we're currently doing. Yes, Marc, this is John. We worked with Rock Creek for many years, that was acquired by Paragon and development of the HEPS program. However, I don't know necessarily that in terms of near term that revenue's being derived is going to be really material, but it's just one that it is a pretty innovative process and having gone through it, we talked with Paragon, we felt that it should be opened up to the marketplace and not just limited to NuScale alone. In terms of the addressable market, Marc, it really could be used for retrofitted existing reactors if they wanted to replace their analog systems and any new reactive design coming through, if they wanted to take advantage of it, could use it. Yes, it's tied to revenues that they gain off the sale of the what they embed in the overall product. Well, thank you operator, and thanks to all of you participating in our call today. Before we conclude again, I'll turn it back over to Diane, who'll discuss upcoming investor events at which we will be present. So interested investors, please contact your respective sales representative to register and schedule one on one meetings with us. Tomorrow, August 11, we'll participate in the Raymond James Aspen Energy Summit and Aspen Colorado. In mid-September, we plan to present at the UBS Global Energy Transition Conference in London. On September 14, we will present at the Virtual Energy and Utilities Access Day hosted by the New York Stock Exchange. With that, we will conclude today's call. With that, we will conclude today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."
