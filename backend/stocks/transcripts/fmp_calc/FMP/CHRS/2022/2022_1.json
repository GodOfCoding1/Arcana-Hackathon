    "content": " These statements include, but are not limited to, our ability to advance our product candidates through development and registration, the status of product candidate clinical profile, our timing and ability to commercialization our products and product candidates in the future, our R&D and SG&A expense guidance for 2022, our revenue targets for 2026, and our ability to meet the same; our projections about margin as well as our ability to drive down amounts under our new credit facility, and the timing of the resubmission and review of the toripalimab BLA. As far as expectations for full year operating expenses, with the discontinuation of the CHS-305 Avastin biosimilar program and the delay in the toripalimab launch, we're lowering our projected range for full year R&D and SG&A expenses by $20 million to $395 million to $430 million. Another $40 to $50 million of operating expense this year will fund completion of development of additional presentations of products we expect to introduce over the next two years, as well as manufacturing scale up projects that will deliver ongoing benefits in the form of significantly lower COGS."
