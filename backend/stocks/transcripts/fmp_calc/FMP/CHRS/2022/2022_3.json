    "content": " These statements include, but are not limited to, our ability to gain approval for multiple new products and launch them, timing of the end of our decline in revenue and timing of our ability to gain market share for any of our approved products, expectations about revenue growth, projections of expenses and revenue, our future manufacturing capacity and our ability to return to profitability in 2024. This quarter, the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s revenue growth driver, but on path from UDENYCA to CIMERLI, our initial launch trajectory for CIMERLI suggests that we are on pace to deliver at least $100 million in revenue in 2023 from this product. With the anticipated launches of toripalimab, YUSIMRY, and UDENYCA will be high next year, we look forward to growing our top line revenue to at least $275 million across the portfolio, which represents the lower bound of our internal forecast for 2023. With anticipated rapid top line revenue growth expected for multiple new product launches through next year as well as the reduction in 2023 operating expenses, we believe we have the ability to execute our new product launches and continue our R&D investments."
