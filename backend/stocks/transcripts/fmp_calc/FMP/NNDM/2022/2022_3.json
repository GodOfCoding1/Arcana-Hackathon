    "content": " It is something we looked for a long time, size of the company is relatively small, less than $10 million in revenue, but it was a subsidiary for many, many years of a much larger company that was in different business. That basically means that if you guys told me that if we didn't have the belief in the huge multi-$100 million potential of the Additive Manufacturing Electronics, which demand still an investment of about $13 million a quarter in R&D, we could close cut that or sell that and within two, three quarters, we'll be making money. And it's all aimed for profitability with spare cash as we need, as much as revenue for the three months and nine months I mentioned before, on the right side, you see the -- on the right side is the quarter and on the left side. So the company grew the growth from $10 million to say a rate of -- run rate to 42 is combined, frankly, mostly for organic growth because this year we acquired only kind of 1.5 companies, if you wish, because the first -- the last company we acquired in July, it's not even appearing on the numbers. 1x investment -- sorry, 1x revenue, 2x revenue, 5x revenue, if it was 10 -- if it was a year and a half ago, it will be valued at 10x revenue, 10x revenue is $0.5 billion, $0.5 billion plus 1.2 is 1.7, divided by 280 million shares, you can find out why the share should be 7 or 8."
