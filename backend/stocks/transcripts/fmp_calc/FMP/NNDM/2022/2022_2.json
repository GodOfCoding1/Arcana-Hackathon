    "content": " And the reason why this fits well with the development -- the core development of the electronics is because, it is sold to very similar customers, so we can leverage and scale up our go-to-market, our sales organization and marketing, selling different kinds of machines with the same customer and the growth of our revenue in the last three years from $4 million to $40 million run rate in less than 24 months as a result of both the growth of the DragonFly IV revenue and the growth into other electronic and as manufacturing fields. So the summary of my answer to you, and it's released again what I said in the beginning is the reason why you may be confused, and I hope that this explains it is growth of the company will be -- is much faster and scalable by having more products and added manufacturing that can be leveraged by both our distribution channels and go-to-market and by applying our artificial intelligence and deep learning into other machines, as long as we keep the synergy that we sell to similar customers, which is mostly defense, aviation, aerospace, advanced medical, advanced industrial applications, academics, of course, and research institutions. For instance, if I'm approaching a certain other use of funds, and I decided -- the Board decides rather than Mayors, really the Board that the other user funds at this point, if it's substantial, is before we buy back shares, or if the Board decides the price to buy shares is this or different, or many other considerations as much as market considerations that I'm not an expert with."
