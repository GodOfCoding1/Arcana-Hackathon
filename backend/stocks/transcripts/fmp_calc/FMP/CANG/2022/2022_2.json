    "content": " As a one-stop platform serving car dealers nationwide, Cango is committed to providing safe, secure, sustained and consistent end-to-end professional car trading transaction services for participants in both the upstream and downstream of the industry value chain. As NEVs and used cars enter a new development stage of fast and large-scale growth and benefit from policy initiatives designed to stimulate market activities, we will make ongoing investments in these 2 areas to elevate our platform capabilities and realize our goal of building a tech-enabled car trading platform, where we place equal emphasis on new and used car trading and monetizing our finance and insurance services through multiple channels. The app is a one-stop B2B transaction service platform for dealers across the country, providing a swift, secure, sustained and consistent supply chain services with car sourcing, financial, insurance services and other non-car sourcing, supply chain, sales management and sales optimization tools. As for your second question on take rate, well, so far, our car trading transaction business has maintained a gross margin of about 1% as our business model features centralized procurements of vehicles from OEMs before selling to small and medium-sized dealers without any control over the production process, our gross margin is relatively low. So the car trading transaction business is our growth driver, but we will also increase our profit in the margin business as well as revenues from ancillary financial services such as insurance services for self-owned cars."
