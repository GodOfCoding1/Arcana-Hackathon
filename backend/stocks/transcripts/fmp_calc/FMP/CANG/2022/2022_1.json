    "content": " In addition to the progress of the platform operations I've just mentioned, in the first quarter, we also continued to invest in building the platform proprietary products and services, including proprietary vehicle sources supporting financial insurance supply chain services as well as third-party products and services such as third-party vehicle sourced listing, car search, logistics and other management services. In the first quarter, revenues from our automotive financing facilitation business declined quarter-by-quarter to RMB 106 million. Similarly, in the aftermarket services sector, we have also restructured the business process centering on car transactions, we are looking to promote the closer integration of car transaction financing insurance so as to provide more integrated supply chain solutions for dealers. Together with the deliberate strategic steps taken to adjust our traditional automotive financing facilitation business, these factors have significant impacted on our top line revenues in the first quarter. Looking at the quarterly performance of our three business our car trading transactions division, which delivered revenues of RMB 599.3 million plays an essential role in our transformation to a platform model."
