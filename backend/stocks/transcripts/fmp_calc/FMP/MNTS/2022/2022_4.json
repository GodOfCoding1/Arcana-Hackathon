    "content": " I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m pleased with what we were able to accomplish in 2022, and so far in 2023, including the launch of 2 orbital service vehicles, the deployment of 8 customer satellites, our progress towards conducting the Vigoride 6 launch next month, recent customer contracts, further progress on our cost reduction plan, and the retirement of legacy matters through the settlements of the class action lawsuit, and raising capital to cover expenses and the share repurchase agreement with our former founders. We do think it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s very important to eventually develop a reusable Vigoride vehicle, as this has the potential to reduce our 2 largest cost items, which are manufacturing costs and launch costs, while also allowing us to add new revenue streams such as in-orbit refueling, maintenance and de-orbiting."
