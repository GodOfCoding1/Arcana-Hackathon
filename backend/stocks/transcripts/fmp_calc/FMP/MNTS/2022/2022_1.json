    "content": " During the first quarter, we completed system level thermal vacuum testing on the Vigoride 3 vehicle that we plan to fly in space on its inaugural mission this month. Vigoride 3 is now at Cape Canaveral, mated to the Falcon 9 launch vehicle that will carry it to orbit on the SpaceX Transporter-5 mission targeted for this month. While Momentus plans to take some customer payloads to orbit and generate a small amount of revenue, the primary goals of our inaugural mission are to test Vigoride on orbit, learn from any issues encountered and incorporate the lessons learned into future Vigoride vehicles. As mentioned earlier, Vigoride 3 is currently made to the Falcon 9 rocket that SpaceX is targeting for launch this month on the Transporter-5 mission. During the first quarter, we signed launch services agreements with SpaceX that reserve space for us on 4 additional rideshare missions, including Transporter-6, which is targeted for October 2022; Transporter-7 targeted for January 2023; Transporter-8 targeted for April 2023; and Transporter-9 targeted for October 2023. We don't anticipate any issues given that we've recently and just recently been through these processes for the Vigoride 3 launch, and we received all the licenses and approvals that we needed for our upcoming mission from the FAA, FCC and NOAA. Edison, as you recall, the use of that third-party deployer system is as part of the exploration that we have to look at other ways of doing business using rideshare aggregation and putting them on a lower cost, less capable system that still meets the needs that are less complex for some of these customers and some of the customers in our backlog and would give us a lower cost method of meeting their needs than Vigoride, which is more capable and able to take customers to precise customer orbits."
