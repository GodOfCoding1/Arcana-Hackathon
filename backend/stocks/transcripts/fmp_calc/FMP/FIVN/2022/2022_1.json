    "content": " With approximately 0.25 million concurrent seats on our platform with our largest clients individually deploying over 10,000 seats, with 99.995% LTM uptime, with the highest levels of security certifications, Five9's platform is built for the scale, reliability and security that enterprise customers demand. In just 10 months through March of this year, they are deflecting more than 40,000 calls per month, which would require 36 human agents to perform this work manually, resulting in $2.2 million of annualized savings or approximately 10% total labor costs. For example, our increased investments in professional services have enabled us over the last six months to reduce by approximately 50%, the number of days between IVA sale and starting the IVA implementation allowing clients a faster time to value and a faster time to revenue for Five9. In fact, first quarter channel bookings grew 68% year-over-year, driven in large part by the Sis, who are increasingly helping Five9 in large strategic engagements, as our customers execute their digital transformation programs. We estimate the onetime costs of closing our Russian office and the associated onetime costs to attract and move Russian employees who would like to immigrate and join the new development center in Portugal to be between $8 million and $12 million, of which $2.7 million was included in the first quarter results. One of our largest customers in the health care space drove a 10% labor savings by implementing our solution completely replaced their IVR, and had \u2013 I think they had $2.2 million savings per year, which represented 10% of their total labor costs, or 36 agents just by implementing this technology."
