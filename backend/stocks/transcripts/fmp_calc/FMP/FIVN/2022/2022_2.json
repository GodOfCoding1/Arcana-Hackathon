    "content": " Now, stepping back and looking at both net new and installed base combined and considering our belief in the mission-criticality of contact centers, the huge barely penetrated $58 billion TAM and our proven ability to execute, we remain cautiously optimistic that despite the macro crosscurrents, there will be no interruption to our continued delivery of LTM enterprise subscription revenue in the 30s for the foreseeable future. In terms of top line, we are guiding Q3 revenue to a midpoint of $193 million, which represents a 2% sequential growth, a slightly higher increase and a typical pattern heading into prior third quarters where we guided to a 1% increase. Thanks for taking the question. Thanks for taking the question. Thanks for taking the question. Thanks for taking the question."
