    "content": "  We've observed several positive trends continued from last year, some of which include attractive payback periods of newly acquired customer cohorts, which remain at less than a year; 85% year-over-year online revenue retention from customers who have maintained a subscription for at least two years; strong interest from retailers, providers and other prospective partners; continued operational efficiency gains with line of sight to additional future gains and ability to maintain overall market and efficiency in a volatile environment; and a healthy cash position that provides us the flexibility to invest in longer range initiatives."
