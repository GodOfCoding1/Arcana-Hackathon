    "content": " These include an ability to maintain strong payback periods of less than a year on our marketing investments, successful introduction of additional marketing campaigns, which has driven growth across several categories in the form of greater audience reach and consumer trust. We're really looking for opportunities to lean in here because during these recessionary times and to Dan's earlier point, we are seeing the competitive landscape tying their belts and start to attract from a lot of these channels, which creates an opportunity for us to really capture a disproportionate size of the market in the next coming quarters. So the mobile app has really been one of the most impactful initiatives that we've released this past quarter and have very, very strong belief that this platform and this kind of health care hub that we're creating, ultimately will draw users back to the platform, drive stickier engagement, higher customer value. We launched this quarter, 2 separate apps, one for Hims and one for Hers that has allowed us a degree of personalization and kind of authenticity in that experience that's paid a lot of dividends the metric that we've disclosed, which I think is a really important metric and one that we're starting to really track is the increase in engagement with the platform."
