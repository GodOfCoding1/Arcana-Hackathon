    "content": " In short, investments across brands, technology and experience, a model which we think of as our company's consumer adoption flywheel, are not only driving the incredible results you see today, but we believe are also setting us up for tremendous growth over the long term. Given the momentum we are seeing in the business and the scale benefits we continue to realize, we are raising our 2022 guidance and now expect to eclipse $515 million in revenue this year and become adjusted EBITDA profitable beginning in Q4. And I think, to some degree, the elements are correlated, meaning that, as we've also started to expand the offerings within certain product mixes, whether that's rolling out a multi-month offering in mental health or additional options in the Her business, we've seen with the investments alongside our brand more and more consumers opting to take that. And so the channels that have gotten us to this point will continue to be a large portion of the mix, but I think you'll see us flex some new muscles in the coming quarters as we prioritize the long-term equity of the brand and high-intent consideration and brand awareness across different geos in the country. But I would say that the shift this year has already really started to happen towards a variety of different investments, and we'll continue to look to leverage that so that we'll continue to just, again, realize greater benefits from economies of scale as well as just the benefits that come from increasing and expanding footprint that we have relative to others in the marketplace."
