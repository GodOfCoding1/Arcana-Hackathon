    "content": " Due to the combination of typical seasonality in our business as well as the timing of cost reductions, we expect our first half adjusted EBITDA to be approximately 40% of our full year earnings, with the first quarter being the weakest quarter of the year. And your guide \u00e2\u0080\u0093 again, I'm not sure exactly what I heard on the $40 million, but if $40 million was non-recurring, then you're effectively guiding to flat EBITDA year-on-year at the midpoint, which \u00e2\u0080\u0093 that seems like more than what you've articulated in terms of the cost saves and productivity. So then, what you have there is, call it, in that 100-plus-million-dollar range of productivity and cost reductions, so that is the amount between, again, carry-forward benefit from things we did last year that will help us, call it, year-over-year in the first half of this year and additional actions we've either taken or will be taking this year. If we're assuming $150 million or a little bit more of an EBITDA headwind from lower volumes, another $40 million in other costs that will be returning, I heard on the call $100 million in productivity and cost reduction."
