    "content": " The core gain in Corporate and Other of $86 million was $165 million favorable compared with the prior year quarter, mainly due to higher yields on fixed income investments, gains on seeds money investments and lower withholding taxes, partially offset by higher interest on allocated capital to operating segments. In Retirement, net outflows were $4.6 billion compared with net outflows of $1 billion in the prior year quarter, primarily driven by higher planned redemptions in the U.S. Our Institutional Asset Management business recorded net inflows of $0.9 billion compared with net inflows of $1.6 billion in the prior year quarter, driven by lower net flows in real estate, timberland and infrastructure products, partially offset by higher sales of fixed income mandates."
