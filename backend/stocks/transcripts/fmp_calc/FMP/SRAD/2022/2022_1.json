    "content": " Our revenue in the first quarter in 2022 increased 31%, compared with the first quarter of 2021 driven by the US and our growth in core betting products across all businesses. For Sportradar, this adaptive approach has led us to develop commercial-reliable synthetic data to serve our simulated reality program's proprietary, computer visionalization technology for our sports tracking and audiovisual product processes; and data-driven deep knowledge analytics of consumer behavior for targeting marketing purposes. More specifically, Managed Betting Services revenue grew 51% year-over-year to \u20ac26 million due to increased turnover while Live Data and Odds grew 16% to \u20ac47 million due to higher sales to our existing clients. And as I have mentioned previously, in the first quarter of 2021 we experienced some temporary savings on sports rights and scouting costs, which drove adjusted \u2013 the adjusted EBITDA margin higher to 57%.
