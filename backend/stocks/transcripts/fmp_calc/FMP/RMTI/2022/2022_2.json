Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for Rockwell Medical's Second Quarter 2022 Results Conference Call and Webcast. The first step of which was to expand our relationship with our largest customer, DaVita, which is one of the leading providers of kidney care services in the U.S.  During the second quarter of 2022, we successfully renegotiated our supply agreement and expanded our partnership with DaVita, which included a $15 million investment in Rockwell. During the second quarter of 2022, Rockwell provided the FDA with supplemental data, including information on a new presentation of Triferic AVNU to be used in our clinical studies and to commercially support our investigational new drug or IND application."
