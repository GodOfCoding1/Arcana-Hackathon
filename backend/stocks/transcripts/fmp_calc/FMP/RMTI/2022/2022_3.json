    "content": " Rockwell Medical's quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended September 30, 2022 will provide a full analysis of the company's business strategy as well as the company's third quarter 2022 results. With all the improvements we have made to our concentrates business and with the additional growth initiatives we outlined, we believe that our hemodialysis concentrates business could achieve annual revenue of $100 million in the coming years and Rockwell achieve profitability in 2024. We believe that if we focus our efforts going forward on growing our hemodialysis concentrates business within its large addressable market and focus on our international pharmaceutical partnerships, we can drive Rockwell to profitability in 2024, reduce our downside risk while maintaining our upside potential, reduce our overall business risk allow -- all of which will allow us to grow our cash base and reduce our reliance on the capital markets. With this $5 million debt prepayment, Rockwell's cash position would have been approximately $22.6 million as of September 30, 2022."
