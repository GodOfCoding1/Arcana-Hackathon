    "content": " In general terms, I will say that exactly with all the pressure that we will have on cost for one hand, the inflation that is happening around the world and in the second part, additional square meters that we are putting into our portfolio with expansion of Tijuana airport, for instance, or airport on this year, we for sure want to have some additional pressure on the cost. So I would say that for sure, we are going to see some kind of a jump in the cost of operation and for terminal Tijuana in May for sure, for  and we'll end up the expansion of the T2 in Los Cabos also when they have some additional jump, but I will say for this year, this will be the two only facilities that we will begin to operate and that could have some kind of impact in the cost of operation. Your line is not open. Your line is not open. So at the day I see some kind of risk coming for additional fleet, but in general terms, I could say that if the Mexican airlines fulfil their original plans or the plan that have announced for sure, we could be more in the positive side of the guidance or even higher, but for sure, I will say Bruno that our were numbers as always cash and taking account different risks that we are seeing on the horizon. Your line is not open. I'll say that assuming we are seeing that in all our recognition of Cabos, Puerto Vallarta, Manzanillo, there's important growth of key rooms and hotel, the development of real estate that give us in some way the ability of that really optimistic future for coming years, and also when this is mixed or blended with the change in some of the trends of traffic in the world, that the long haul is not working as good as in the past, that we are seeing some kind of trend of people going for vacation in a more closer area than in the past. Your line is not open. Your line is not open. Your line is not open."
