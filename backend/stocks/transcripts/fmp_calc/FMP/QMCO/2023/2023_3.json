    "content": " As with the last few quarters, the biggest mover continues to be our secondary storage systems, with revenue increasing 66% year-over-year and 15% sequentially to $50.7 million or 44% of total revenue as we saw strong orders from both our enterprise and hyperscale customers. And, Jamie, I think when we spoke three months ago, one of the things you were looking for is that for some of the sales changes you're making to really help accelerate primaries storage, and is that what you're seeing and with the strength in Europe and Asia, because headline primary was pretty flattish, but just walk us through the impact you're getting, as you make some of the adjustments to the sales team. And what we're seeing through the new sales teams, the new sales training, and the new sales incentives, is going into our accounts and selling them a primary product, store next door surveillance, selling them secondary products, selling the management software, selling multiple products, and often those products as a solution where we combine multiple products to solve a business problem or solve a management initiative. And then -- just again, the sequential guide on the adjusted EBITDA also seems -- I know we're talking about the product mix, taking roughly 2.5% out of that $102 million midpoint guide another $1 million for the OpEx higher, but that still seems -- the $0.5 million of adjusted EBITDA seems like a pretty dramatic step down."
