    "content": " Retailer demand for Tanger outlet centers is robust and occupancy continues to grow, currently at 94.9%, up 170 basis points year-over-year and up 60 basis points sequentially. Craig, I think that there's probably a dozen great shopping centers out there that are either independently owned or owned by smaller outlet developers who have looked at what we've done, looked at the platform we've created with our best-in-class leasing, marketing and operation footprint and want to be part of the Tanger branding. And in that regard, using our performance marketing and other great initiatives that we've been using over the past months and years, we've been recognized as being a great partner to these retailers and we're looking to grow the footprint, not only with adding new retailers to our shopping centers, but a number of other developers have taken hold and we're in contact with, speaking to about the potential of adding more centers to our portfolio. But if you would visit one of our shopping centers, especially starting in the summer, the promotional activity is much different, which would imply that a shopper who spent $500 in our shopping center last year and bought a number of units could buy more units for slightly less than that amount this year because of the major promotional activity that you're seeing."
