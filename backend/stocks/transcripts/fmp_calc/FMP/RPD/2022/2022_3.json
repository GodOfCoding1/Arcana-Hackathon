    "content": " We believe the platform investments we've made in recent years position us exceedingly well to help customers achieve more consolidated risk and threat visibility, response and automation across their expanding digital footprint and growing cloud environment. So those are the two areas that we want to make sure we actually just de risks from a forward guidance perspective,  I would say our macro assumptions going into next year is that there's some likelihood that we'll see ourselves in recessionary environment. So our platform of risk complete, any cloud first unlimited visibility platform is one that we're already seeing evidence is resonating more with customers, and we just have to operationalize with our packaging in our sales enablement around that strategy. And if you think about what we're talking about, with the risk complete, cloud first risk complete offering, that is really one that actually says listen, instead of actually bifurcating and locking up your spin across two or three areas and customer intelligence for the external attack surface, the on-prem world and the cloud world, we will actually give you world class capabilities at the best possible economics."
