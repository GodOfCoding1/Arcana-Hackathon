    "content": " Now, as I'd like to do with my opening remarks each quarter, today, I will focus on the following three main themes; first, we delivered resilient top line results in the second quarter against the mortgage market that continues to be challenged by extremely difficult conditions for homebuyers, namely rising inflation and interest rates, high home prices and unprecedented low housing inventory. While our purchase volume increased quarter-over-quarter, the rate of increase was impacted by the performance of the overall purchase market, which had a slow start in the first quarter and continued to struggle in second quarter with weekly purchase mortgage applications as measured by the MBA's weekly application survey, declining 14% on a seasonally adjusted basis from Q1 to Q2. In terms of purchase, our market share was essentially flat versus last quarter, but should grow in the back half of the year as our investments in customer acquisition reach higher productivity and more of the purchase transactions start benefiting from our Doma Intelligence Technology. The majority of the investments we set out to make 12 to 18 months ago as we were preparing to take the company public, were indeed made and are now starting to bear fruit for us as the broader housing market started to experience headwinds earlier this year and which intensified in the second quarter, we were swift in reducing our cost structure to align with a lower mortgage volume environment."
