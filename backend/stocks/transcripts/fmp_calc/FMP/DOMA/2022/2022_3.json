    "content": " Third, despite the adjustment we are making today in relation to the current year, getting to adjusted EBITDA profitability continues to be our top priority across the entire company, and we are now working towards a faster timeline that would enable us to turn profitable sooner than what we had previously communicated as late 2023. To sum it up, despite another challenging quarter for the entire housing industry, we believe the strong demand in the current market for better, faster and cheaper paths to homeownership presents Doma with the unique opportunity to get our instant underwriting solutions deployed across more transactions in a more efficient way. I would also say that, broadly speaking, even with the contraction in the overall mortgage market, we've actually seen a pretty significant number of share gains across different parts of the business in the last quarter. So I would say, despite the fact that we're seeing market share gains across a lot of our business, our main focus is making sure that we prioritize primarily against how we get to that adjusted EBITDA target faster, and that's really what's kind of the driving factor behind these decisions."
