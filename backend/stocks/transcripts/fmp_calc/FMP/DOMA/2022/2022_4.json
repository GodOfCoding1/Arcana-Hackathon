    "content": " Our Q4 adjusted EBITDA improved $14 million versus Q3, as we delivered full year 2022 adjusted EBITDA of negative $135 million, within our revised range of negative $135 million to $140 million. While the actions we took in the first nine months of 2022 delivered important cost structure and margin improvements in the back half of the year, the additional actions we took in December of 2022 are expected to generate estimated additional annualized compensation expense savings of between $85 million to $90 million and additional long-term facility-related expense savings all beginning in the first quarter of 2023. Adjusted EBITDA, our main profitability measure improved $14 million in the fourth quarter to negative $16 million compared to negative $30 million in Q3."
