    "content": " First, we have continued to take share in the US title and Escrow market, led by our machine intelligence-driven Doma Intelligence platform, which offers a better, faster, more affordable mortgage closing experience for lenders and their customers completing refinance transactions. Additionally, purchase activity, as measured by the MBA's weekly application survey, has been much lower than expected for this time of year, with weekly mortgage applications to purchase a home recently declining as much as 17% year-over-year, suggesting a much greater slowdown in the purchase market than anticipated. Our closed orders and home purchase, which today are sourced solely through our local channel and where the majority of those volumes are not yet on the Doma Intelligence platform, were down 13% year-over-year driven by lower close rates from orders opened in Q4, in a few purchase markets in the Western US. Despite the challenges and headwinds that current mortgage market presents, we expect to grow our purchase market share steadily over the next few years, as we further shift our focus of investments towards purchase and aggressively deploy our Doma Intelligence technology to this part of the market."
