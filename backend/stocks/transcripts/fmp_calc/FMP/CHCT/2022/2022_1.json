    "content": " During the first quarter, we acquired two properties with a total of approximately 30,000 square feet for purchase price of approximately $5.8 million. Meanwhile, interest expense decrease from 2.8 million to 2.6 million or 5.8%, this decrease was due to capitalized interest expense on a few construction projects that Tim previously mentioned, as well as two fewer days of interest in the first quarter compared with the fourth quarter. I'm pleased to report that funds from operations or FFO for the first quarter of \u201822 grew to 13.5 million from 12.6 million in the first quarter of '21, representing 7.4% growth over the same period last year. On a per share basis, FFO increased from $0.54 per diluted share in the first quarter of '21 to $0.56 per diluted share in the first quarter of '22, an increase of 3.7%. Adjusted funds from operations or AFFO which adjusts for straight line rent and stock based compensation totaled 14.8 million, compared with the 13.3 million in the first quarter of '21 or 11.4% growth year-over-year. On a per share basis, AFFO increased from $0.57 per diluted share in the first quarter of '21 to $0.61 per diluted share in the first quarter of '22 or 7%. Finally, AFFO for the fourth quarter of '21 was 14.9 million representing a point 5% decrease on a sequential basis and flat on a per share basis of $0.61 per diluted share. And from a pro forma perspective, if all the first quarter acquisitions occurred on the first day of the first quarter AFFO would have increased by approximately 73,000 to a pro forma total of 14.9 million."
