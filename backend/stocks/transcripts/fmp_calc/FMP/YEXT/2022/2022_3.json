    "content": " Before we begin, I'd like to remind everyone that this call may contain forward-looking statements, including statements about revenue, non-GAAP loss, growth of our business, including with listings and answers as well as geographies such as Europe gross margins, operating margins, net dollar-based retention, capital expenditures and other non-historical statements as further described in our press release. And so for example, a large telco, we landed in Q1 fiscal 2016 for just a couple of hundred thousand dollars in ARR has increased over 11x to an ARR base of more than $3 million as of the third quarter this year by expanding across our AR search platform with more products and solutions. Q3 operating expenses were $81 million or 81% of revenue, and that's up slightly from 80% in the year ago quarter while investing in revenue-generating opportunities such as marketing, events and product launches. Cash and cash equivalents were $230 million at the end of the third quarter, and we continue to have a strong balance sheet, and we're well positioned to invest in growth as we expect going forward. And so, when we think about the overall contribution Answers has on the business, which is what I think you're asking and include the support and recurring services and other products, that ARR is growing around 150% year-over-year and is roughly $20 million of total ARR. We showed that at our last Investors Day, it's tough to characterize it because there's so much business between now and January 31 that we've contemplated that in our guidance, and we think, as I said, we think the net retention metrics will start to return just based on our math, and we had a good strong gross retention in Q3, but we have a lot of work to do in Q4 to put up those numbers, but we feel good about the guidance that we have right now."
