And I think there are -- when you talk about Q4 and we saw this to some extent in Q2 as well, I think we told you in Q3 that we were going to be doing -- there's going to be a lot of focus on customer-facing events and getting back to our customers. And so the organizational changes that we've already started to make are about centralizing those interfaces and making sure that client success support professional services, customer service that they're all touching the customer in a way that's very consistent and aligned with our -- and more closely aligned with our go-to-market. I was only going to add that I think when you get the customer relationship right and when your customers are happier, the entire upsell, I mean, this is simple basic stuff but the whole upsell motion gets a lot easier when -- if we're seeing challenges on the customer satisfaction or success side of things, then it makes that conversation harder."
