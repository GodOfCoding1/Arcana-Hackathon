    "content": " I was talking to the CEO of one of the biggest support clouds on the planet a couple of months ago or actually last month, and he told me that just the number of tickets is exploded and anything a company can do to deflect the number of tickets coming in is very important and there's various tactics you can do that - to do that, but search or being able to answer a question at that moment where the consumer is looking for something is a huge way to deflect calls or deflect tickets. This is a huge breakthrough, because most of the answers in support are living in the knowledge base which are long articles that company has published to their help sites and we think that with Yext you can one click and bam, you'd be able to add a Support Answers box to the top, deflect calls, increased customer satisfaction, give users the answer that they want."
