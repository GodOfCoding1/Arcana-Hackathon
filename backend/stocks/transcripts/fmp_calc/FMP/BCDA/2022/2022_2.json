    "content": " BioCardia's efforts are focused on advancing two cell therapy platforms to treat significant unmet cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases, specifically ischemic heart failure, chronic myocardial ischemia, and acute respiratory distress. We are also working to provide additional educational materials for patients, including a simple but elegant animation of the CardiAMP heart failure trial, which is now live on our website, and which we invite you to view on the site cell therapy clinical trials page. I also note that in our indication of acute respiratory distress, where there's some phenomenal work that's been done with mesenchymal stem cells, including a very large NIH trial, that is completing enrollment, or has just completed enrollment, and we're following those efforts and others, but we're not targeting the patients who are on the respirator. If you think about this program, it's a, see it's a significant value proposition most late stage heart failure programs are, you know, even in the markets are valued in the billions of dollars, even though they're preclinical and where we are is kind of embarrassing."
