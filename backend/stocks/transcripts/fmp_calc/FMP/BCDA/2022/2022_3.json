    "content": " Our efforts to complete the CardiAMP Autologous Cell Therapy pivotal clinical trials for the indications of heart failure, or BCA-01, and chronic myocardial ischemia or BCA-02, remain our primary focus with an estimated combined 1.6 million patients in a reachable U.S. market. The CardiAMP Cell Therapy heart failure trial, or BCDA-01, is a Phase III 260-patient randomized controlled clinical study intended to provide the primary data to support safety and efficacy in pursuit of market clearance. As the CardiAMP Cell Therapy trial in heart failure was over 90% powered for success based on the previous Phase II data, there is potential that the trial could meet its primary efficacy endpoint on the patients that have already been enrolled to date."
