    "content": " At this time, for opening remarks, I would like to pass the call over to Liz Morali, Head of Investor Relations. With me today are Rich Hume, CEO; and Marshall Witt, CFO. Before we continue, let me remind everyone that today's discussion contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including predictions, estimates, projections or other statements about future events, including statements about integration progress, synergies, strategy, capital distribution investments and our expectations for fiscal year 2022. Actual results may differ materially from those mentioned in these forward-looking statements, as a result of risks and uncertainties discussed in today's earnings release, in the Form 8-K we filed today, and in the Risk Factors section of our Form 10-K and our other reports and filings with the SEC. Also, during this call, we will reference certain non-GAAP financial information. Reconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP results are included in our earnings press release, and the related Form 8-K available on our Investor Relations Web site, ir.synnex.com. Nearly 10 months ago, we closed a merger to form TD SYNNEX. Through our first three fiscal quarters together, we have successfully generated over $46 billion in revenue and $8.61 in non-GAAP earnings per share, all while making great strides on our merger integration. I'm incredibly proud of our more than 22,000 coworkers and their tremendous efforts to accomplish these very impressive results. In March at our Investor Day, we were able to share with you our vision of the evolving IT distribution landscape and the opportunities to grow and deliver enhanced financial performance over the coming years. We presented our 4-pillar strategic framework along with key medium- and long-term financial objectives focused on investing in high-growth technologies like hybrid cloud, security, data analytics and hyperscale infrastructure while strengthening our portfolio, expanding our global footprint and digitally transforming our business. From this vantage point, and with the strong support of our best-in-class network of over 1,500 vendor partners, we are well positioned to continue delivering unrivaled technology solutions to our more than 150,000 customers. Our performance in fiscal Q2 further demonstrates the success we are having in the market, given our strong value proposition and industry-leading portfolio. In Q2, we grew revenue by 4% year-over-year, assuming the merger occurred in the prior year if adjusted for FX and revenue policy alignment. This strong result was driven by robust demand for technology products and solutions to enable hybrid work, faster collaboration, enhanced security and advanced multi-cloud adoption. This is an exciting time to serve the technology ecosystem as the pace of change intensifies and our vendors continue developing products and services that enable companies and individuals to improve their agility, productivity, security and profitability. In PCs, the double-digit growth rates seen during the pandemic continued to moderate, as expected. From a regional perspective, our America's distribution business experienced strong year-over-year top line growth. On a year-over-year basis, our hyperscale infrastructure business declined given tough prior year compares, but grew on an LTM basis consistent with our expectations. Our European business also grew year-over-year in constant currency, albeit at a more measured pace given the current economic and geopolitical conditions in the region. Before I pass it over to Marshall to further elaborate on our Q2 results, I wanted to provide an update on our merger integration activities. We continue to make excellent progress on harmonizing processes, benefits and systems across TD SYNNEX, as well as our optimization programs and synergy attainment. From an ERP systems perspective, I shared with you last quarter that the April-May timeframe would be important as we migrated a large portion of our Canadian business to the new system. I'm happy to report that the migration went extremely well, and we are on track with our project plans to transition our U.S. business. As we enter the back half of this fiscal year, we are extremely pleased with the progress we've made and the momentum we are experiencing in the market. Thanks, Rich, and thanks for joining us today for our call. In fiscal Q2, we delivered another strong performance with year-over-year revenue growth on a constant currency basis. Gross margin expansion, healthy earnings per share, and strong cash flow from operations, this consistency in performance is a testament to the dedicated efforts of our global team and our agile entrepreneurial and resilient business model. Total worldwide revenue for fiscal Q2 was 15.3 billion, up 4% when adjusted for constant currency and the revenue policy alignment related to the merger. Growth profit was 956 million and gross margin was 6.3% compared to 5.8% for the prior year, reflecting a favorable product mix, a strong pricing environment, and solid execution. FX had a 31 million negative impact on gross profit compared to the prior year, primarily due to the devaluation of the Euro relative to the U.S. dollar. Total adjusted SG&A expense was 585 million, representing 3.8% of revenue and in line with our expectations. Non-GAAP operating income was 398 million up 18% versus the prior year, and non-GAAP operating margin was 2.6%, up from 2.2% in the prior year period. FX had a 10 million negative impact on non-GAAP operating income compared to the prior year, primarily due to the Euro devaluation versus the US dollar. Our net working capital at the end of the second quarter was 3.6 billion, a decrease of 800 million from 4.4 billion in Q1. Our cash conversion cycle for the second quarter was 21 days, down three days from Q1 of '22. From a shareholder return perspective for the current quarter, our Board of Directors has approved a cash dividend of $0.30 per common share. The dividend is expected to be paid on July 29th, 2022 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on July 15, 2022. We also continue to repurchase shares and through the first two quarters of fiscal '22, we have repurchased approximately 53 million of our stock at a weighted average price of approximately $103. In line with our target of a hundred million of share repurchases for the year, we have 347 million remaining on our three year stock repurchase authorization, which expires in July of 2023. Before I discuss our outlook for the third quarter, I wanted to take a moment to provide an update on our merger synergies. As Rich mentioned, our integration efforts are going well and we continue to make good progress on realizing our merger cost synergies. As I've mentioned previously, these opportunities span a variety of areas, including optimization and efficiency improvements via the Legacy Tech Data GBO program, as well as traditional deal related synergies across the spectrum of IT systems, corporate costs, facilities rationalization, taxes and interest. Now moving to our outlook for fiscal Quarter 3, we expect total revenues to be in the range of $14.5 billion to #15.5 billion, which one adjusted for currency impact of approximately $500 million and revenue policy alignment relating to the merger of approximately $300 million equates to a growth of around 10% at the midpoint on a year over year basis assuming the merger had occurred in the prior year. And non-GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be in the range of $2.50 to $2.90 per diluted share, that's based on a weighted average shares outstanding of approximately $95.5 million. My first question, Rich, just regarding your commentary on the overall demand environment, you still sound fairly bullish. So first, when we look back 2Q on a constant currency basis, we talk about the Advanced Solutions and Endpoint segment, and we talked about growth in both of those segments. In addition to that, I think we had a separate schedule for everybody to have a look at PCs and how they fit within our portfolio and profile. And to kind of move on to your second point, what I would say is the story remains consistent in the PC realm as what we had articulated previously, at least from our crystal ball, and that is that the commercial PCs have some pretty good demand associated with them. The weakness, I think, in the overall scheme of the PC category would be in the Chromebook as well as the consumer piece, at least for the foreseeable future. And as you would have noticed from that schedule that we had incorporated in there, we're heavier weight to the commercial piece. And when you get down to the consumer segment and think about it in the grand scheme of our entire portfolio, it's a single-digit number, a mid-single-digit number estimated. So I think that that the sentiment of the market, the PC providers have sort of articulated that point of view, and we would reaffirm that that's the way we see it. As it relates to Advanced Solutions, certainly, the growth rates there have been higher than the endpoint segment, and we do continue to see good demand in that segment. And I do believe, as we had talked for a while since the beginning of the year, that through the pandemic, you had PCs launching with high demand, the Advanced Solutions sort of deferring. And now you're coming around to the moderation of PC and pretty good demand strength, if you will, within the Advanced Solutions segment. And then as my follow-up, just regarding the inventory build that you had again in the quarter, up about $700 million sequentially, but you're guiding essentially, well, down slightly sequentially for the August quarter. But yes, it's the same demand forecast that we build up, you saw and we experienced in Q2 some of the higher margins and solid returns of some of that buildup at the end of Q1 for Hyve. The 1 comment that I would make is as we look at quarter, quarter, quarter, the supply chains continue to be volatile. So we'll see ebbs and flows in working capital, I think, for the tactical frame. And then we're pretty comfortable with what we articulated in our Investor Day financial model for working capital once we move to sort of stabler grounds, if you will. Good question, Ruplu, this is Marshall. Clearly, the $0.14 is a headwind. As we think about our Investor Day profile and looking at what we thought overall adjusted net revenues would be, we gave a guidance of 6% to 8%. So the execution of the business, our belief that the second half of the year will still have, we'll call it decent to good IT spend growth that we're going to benefit from. So first, in the pricing environment, certainly, over the last year to 1.5 years, there has been consistent price changes basically across the board based on all of the factors that we're familiar with, right? But for the tactical frame, I would suggest that, that will continue. As it relates to labor and how it impacts our business, so first of all, labor inflation is part of the overall inflation that gets sort of translated into price across the entire supply chain. I would consider them sort of marginal, if you will, incremental impacts to our overall pricing to end users. And Ruplu, just to remind you, our merit cycle is -- falls into Q2. And back to what Rich said, over time, we do find ways of offsetting that. Maybe for the last one, Rich, if I can ask you at a higher level question. So here's what we see -- we take it from the global channel guide, which is the most up-to-date information, we see the IDCs and context information of the world. And if you go and you take a look at those publications, what you'll find out is that the Americas market is more robust, if you will, than the European market. Read the Americas market to have been over the recent past call it some higher single digit, mid- to high single digit. Then Asia Pacific, which we don't have up-to-date information on, but our speculation would be sort of a mid-single-digit best guess, market right now. When we think about, your next question, looking forward, we do feel as if there is good, robust demand. And as we move forward, my crystal ball would say that as we move through time, hopefully, we'll see it move marginally down each quarter moving forward. You mentioned hyperscaler was down due to difficult comps, and I think you said as expected. Jim, you might recall in previous broadcast, we always talk about Hyve being a lumpy business. The market data would state that, that category has double-digit growth rates, and we firmly believe that that's the case in sort of the sustaining time. I would tell you that when you think about Q2 and then going into Q3 and then potentially Q4, the business in total has the benefit of some easier compares. And then I would say that, that segment as well sort of falls into that category. Of course, you had to build this quarter than you mentioned that you're going to be working it down some for the August quarter. Because if the supply chain challenges still exist today, you'd think inventory would be flattish or maybe it's seasonal because otherwise, people will say there's some weakening of demand to accrue your backlog there. But by starting, I want to make sure everybody's focused on the working capital improvements that we had seen in the quarter. Jim, when we -- if I hearken back to an earlier comment that I had, I said as we sort of continue to march through the supply-constrained environment, we're comfortable with our working capital model that we had taken everybody through at Investor Day. But until sort of we get stability in the supply chain, we're going to have some shorts and longs, if you will. It's the proverbial golden screw discussion in the core of distribution that has you hanging on, especially within the Advanced Solutions segment to inventory longer than you normally would. And then I think when we think about the hyperscale business, the ebb and flow of getting a bit behind on scheduled deployments and then getting back on schedule based on many factors associated with the pandemic sort of caused a bit of a continuity issue. But as I said, in the long term, once we sort of get through all these supply things, they'll work themselves out, and we'll have -- we believe we'll have really good stability as it relates to sort of our working capital profile. Rich, you knew I would ask about working capital if you got to me, but maybe I'll save that for my second question. And if you could talk about the composition of the remaining synergy, that would be helpful. And as in our prepared remarks, we're at 130 forecasted for the first year. And I would just say, if you think about the way that, that synergy of 130 breaks down, it's roughly 60% SG&A and the rest is below the line in taxes and interest. And then as it relates to additional synergies, typically, you put a project plan to better -- together, you go and you get myopically focused on executing that project plan. And maybe just as a follow-up, Marshall, I'll take the working capital question all the way up to ROIC instead. I realize you've reported a trailing 4-quarter metric, but it's just under 13% and the year ago period was just over 21%. Adam, in our pro forma premerger expectation, we thought that ROIC on an adjusted basis would land somewhere around 11%. As we continue to march through and integrate the companies and get the full digestion of debt and equity, you'll see that 12.5% lands somewhere around that 11%. Adam, again, that's a forecast for the full year. And then from there, we believe, given all the things we do in terms of capital allocation and reinvesting back in the business and acquisitions and other opportunities, we should see that step back up. And Adam, you've heard us say this in the past, we always achieved to have a 300 to 400 basis point ROIC above our weighted average cost of capital. To be candid with you, I'm really surprised relative to how successful we've been in our recruiting efforts as well. So I would say that we're a little bit higher than normal, but very manageable. And we have managed team closely and stayed close to them, especially through the sort of the merger phase. And 3 quarters into the integration, client losses tied to diversification. As you know, we have a highly complementary vendor line card and same with the customer base. If we think about the integrations we've done so far and the commentary Rich has had about the Canadian CIS migration, it's gone very smoothly with very little disruption. So very pleased with the overall result and significant upside, as we've mentioned in previous conversations around cross-sell once we get onto 1 platform. Rich, when you were in the Investor Day, you talked quite a bit about TD Synnex migrating towards more solutions for your customers and netted down revenue. Perhaps talk about progress made over the quarter and the demand for that, that you saw this quarter. So if I could, during the Investor Day, we talk about high-growth technologies. And just to give everybody sort of an insight there, we're talking about hybrid cloud and security, analytics and IoT, hyperscale infrastructure. Even within the endpoint space, AR/VR is within there as well. We had a -- we have an expectation of sort of an elevated growth rate, if you will, for that category. The core distribution piece of that clearly has been on track to deliver, if you will, that elevated growth rate. We talked about Hyve being a little bit lumpy, so we think about Hyve having that elevated growth rate annualized. So we're feeling really good, Keith, about those high-growth technologies and kind of where we're at with more investment, if you will, to come to make sure that we're bringing -- continue to bring incremental value to that customer set. There is -- that category in particular, is one which gets netted. And as that becomes a bigger piece of the pie, there's a larger netting that maybe, Marshall, you want to comment. So we always try to reference gross billings when we think about the high-growth technology sections, and we'll do that going forward. But early on, 2 quarters in, relative to our Investor Day profiles and what we thought, we're very much in line with that. So I think I'll start, then maybe Marshall can discuss it and maybe statement of the obvious. But if, in fact, we see a sudden downturn of demand based on the recessionary pressures that would have us find ourselves probably at the low end of our guidance, to get to the high end of the guidance, what would it take it just 1 thing comes to mind, right, is that is a significant release of supply to be able to sell through a bigger portion of the backlog. And obviously, you think about demand, but if demand is constrained by adding to the -- incremental demand is constrained by adding to the backlog, then that would be a tougher put. I think Matt had commented earlier, I think, in his insight that our ask is the PC stuff becoming a bit more stable. And we really once we hear from the regions, they actually, if you will, cross track with regard to our vendors to make sure that we're supply supported. And in fact, that would be the -- our range currently would be our best call. But if there are pleasant surprises that would come, they would be just that pleasant surprises. Rich, I don't think I heard you in any of your answers give what your consumer exposure is. So if you think about the consumer piece, sort of stand-alone, you could think about it as being a sort of mid-single-digit percentage of our total overall portfolio. Well, yes, I mean it's mid-single digits. So I think that the whole PC category, if it calibrates the pie, it's pretty well calibrated to the reality. Yes, legacy Tech Data had some handset exposure primarily in Europe and legacy SYNNEX had some meaningful consumer exposure, retail exposure in North America. Yes, we still have legacy SYNNEX, New Age Electronics, great business performing well. And on the legacy Tech Data side, we've got, you call it, consumer-related mobility in Europe. I don't have the number right in front of me, but I wouldn't even comment. And then I guess sort of Rich, your comments about second half '22, good IT spending environment. I guess what I'd love is to get some context, kind of see things like what do you guys see and maybe your interpretation, kind of the overall theme of customer behavior is right now, given kind of macro indicators, everybody's sort of watching the same macro indicators. It seems like commercial spending has been very well intact, at the same time -- and Marshall, you're actually one of the people who's watching these macro indicators. And so what do you guys think -- what are you experiencing, I guess, is the overarching theme from your customers. I hate to be a little bit repetitive here, but we see a really strong infrastructure. The Advanced Solutions category, that area continues to, I think, be most challenged as it relates to supply and backlog and the PCs are moderating with a particular emphasis of the consumer segment being sort of weaker. We said the first half, we thought that there would be good demand around PCs and the AS segment would begin to, if you will, accelerate a bit. And then in the back half, we'd see more moderation in PCs and that we'd have solid demands around the AS category. And the only other thing that I would offer is the high-growth technologies of cloud, analytics and IoT, security and hyperscale as a basket. Those growth rates are strong, and they're becoming more and more meaningful part of our business as we move through time. So from an end user demand perspective, certainly the high-growth technologies, the Advanced Solutions project-based business and then PC moderation."
