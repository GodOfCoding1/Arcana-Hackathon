And that, by the way, is also one of the reasons why it's -- we've talked about this for the last two years in the calls, how difficult it is to move workloads to Snowflake, because these workloads are so heavily grafted into operational processes. We're also in the envious position that we're sitting on over $5 billion today, and we will be opportunistic, because we're doing this for the long term, not for the next two quarters or three quarters or however long this macro uncertainty is going to last, but we're going to set ourselves up for the next 10, 20 years. And whether you're a data engineer or whether you're a programmer, where you're going to see everything we do is this maximum investment to allow these workloads to execute extremely well, just from a usability standpoint, from an economic standpoint, obviously, from a performance standpoint, that's what this is all about.
