You put up 158% net retention this quarter, which is still an impressive number, but slowing sequentially, I would love to understand what you're seeing between the different customer cores in terms of expansion momentum but also maybe optimization and how that sort of changed over the last 90 days. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Well, I'm just telling you they're not growing as quickly as what they did, but we saw in 2021 and 2022, where I think it was a little bit more you or with companies who didn't have as much cost discipline around spending, and you're seeing people being more cost conscious and how they do things across the board, not just on Snowflake, that's why you're seeing these companies do rips out there. Your line is open. Just as companies can really control their spend on Snowflake, when they open up their budgets more, they can ramp very quickly existing customers on Snowflake that could drive that up, but we're not seeing a precipitous drop off longer term in the net revenue retention. Your line is open."
