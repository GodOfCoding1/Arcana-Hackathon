Third quarter performance demonstrated our continued agility as we quickly adapted our operations to a changing environment and exceeded expectations across our three primary financial KPIs, producing revenue of $103.2 million variable marketing margin or VMM of $31.8 million and adjusted EBITDA of $2 million, despite ongoing headwinds in the auto insurance industry. Total revenue for Q3 was $103.2 million, a decline of 4% year-over-year and above our guidance range provided last quarter as strong growth in consumer volume nearly offset reductions in monetization that resulted from the auto insurance industry downturn.
