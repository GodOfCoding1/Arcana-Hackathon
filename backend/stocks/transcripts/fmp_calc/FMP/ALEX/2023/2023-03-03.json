    "content": " Core FFO increased 18.3% to $82.2 million, and core FFO per share was up 17.7% to $1.13 per share, which exceeded the high end of our twice-increased guidance range. In land operations, we generated adjusted EBITDA of $67 million from the sale of approximately 20,200 acres of noncore land and 4.9 acres at Maui Business Park. During the fourth quarter, we sold approximately 1,100 acres of noncore land and 1.1 acres at Maui Business Park for total proceeds of approximately $20 million. During the fourth quarter, we entered into two forward starting interest rate swaps that provide A&B with a fixed blended interest rate of 4.86% on $130 million of future financing. Combined, these items totaling approximately $4.6 million impact our core FFO guidance by about $0.07 per share and our Same-Store NOI guidance by approximately 250 basis points. And from a per share basis, I think that translates to -- is it about -- so in any event, it's about $9 million and so the delta really largely reflecting the impact of the noncore business."
