    "content": " We had non-core land sales in the first quarter totaling approximately $8 million, including 3.9 acres at Maui Business Park II and 173 acres of other non-core land holdings. Our Materials & Construction segment had a solid start to the year with operating profit of $3.2 million and adjusted EBITDA of $4.1 million, this compares to a $4 million loss and negative $1.4 million respectively in the first quarter of 2021. As Chris noted, the Materials & Construction segment had its best quarter in 1.5 years, contributing to the strong segment results with Grace Pacific adjusted EBITDA of $1.9 million, while other M&C business added $2.2 million. With respect to our dividend, the Board recently declared a second quarter 2022 dividend of $0.20 per share, a $0.01 or a 5.3% increase from the first quarter 2022 dividend and second consecutive quarterly increase, reflecting our strong first quarter CRE results and expected performance for the remainder of 2022. I also want to remind everyone, as I\u2019ve mentioned on prior calls, while it\u2019s not part of our guidance as it\u2019s not part of core FFO, we expect to incur an $81 million to $95 million pre-tax settlement charge in the second quarter related to the defeasance of our pension plan."
