    "content": " For the third quarter of 2022, our wholesale fuel gross profit increased 24% to $42.2 million, compared to $34.1 million in the third quarter of 2021. Wholesale segment gross profit was $56.8 million, an increase of 18% or $8.6 million when compared to the third quarter of 2021. Our wholesale fuel volume was 338 million gallons for the third quarter 2022, a decline of 5% when compared to the same period in 2021 largely due to lower volume in our base business partially offset by the acquisition of assets from 711, which occurred primarily during the third quarter of 2021. On our wholesale rent, our base rent for the quarter was $13.8 million compared to the prior year $13.7 million, a slight increase due to the renewal of certain dealer contracts and the reopening of certain previously closed sites. Our retail segment also performed well during the quarter as gross profit increased 102% or $28.5 million when compared to the third quarter of 2021. Additionally, we benefited from the declining fuel price environment during the third quarter of 2022, which contributed to additional cash flow generated from working capital of $19 million. For total operating cash flow generated during the quarter at $72 million, an increase of more than $36 million compared to the third quarter of 2021. Also contributing to the increase year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter for higher real estate taxes, as well as higher maintenance and environmental expenses, portion of which we are able to recoup from our third party site operators  On a quarter-over-quarter basis the increase in operating expenses was driven by elevated store level labor costs, as well as maintenance and environmental costs."
