    "content": " This performance is also apparent on the capital market side with $3.6 billion of office loan repayments over the last 12 months, of which $2.2 billion were in New York City, San Francisco, Chicago, L.A. or D.C., core urban markets that, while challenged, continue to show tenant and investor demand for high-quality office assets. So I think that having the information and the organization of the information within our platform here, both on the BXMT portfolio specifically but also more broadly across the overall Blackstone real estate platform puts us in a tremendously advantaged position as things are changing because it allows us to be really up to the minute in terms of what's going on in the market and manage our investment decisions and our borrower discussions with that information in mind."
