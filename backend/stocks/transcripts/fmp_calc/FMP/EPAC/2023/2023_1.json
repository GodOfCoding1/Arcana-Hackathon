    "content": " Of the $12 million to $18 million of adjusted EBITDA benefit that we anticipate in fiscal 2023 related to ASCEND, we experienced a benefit of approximately $6 million in the first quarter, which will be partly offset by future additional costs, for example, to backfill some roles for an estimated net recurring benefit of approximately $4 million to $5 million and we saw roughly 300 basis points of improvement in our SG&A as a percent of revenue, excluding adjusted costs as a result of the ASCEND actions taken to date."
