    "content": " Of the updated $32 million to $38 million of adjusted EBITDA benefit that we anticipate in fiscal \u00e2\u0080\u009823 related to ASCEND, we experienced a benefit of approximately $15 million in the second quarter and approximately $21 million year-to-date. Moving on to the regions, the Americas delivered core sales growth in the low-double-digit percentages in the second quarter driven by year-over-year improvement in both product and service, both the infrastructure and rail verticals continue to perform well as a result of ongoing government investment and maintenance and in our Heavy Lifting Technology or HLT business, we saw several large projects convert to orders in the second quarter, delivering some immediate revenue and helping to build our backlog for the remainder of the fiscal year. Transitioning to second quarter adjusted EBITDA on slide 12, we delivered over $32 million of adjusted EBITDA in Q2, approximately $16 million year-over-year improvement. Service volume and mix contributed roughly $1.5 million of EBITDA growth versus last year, primarily driven by the Americas with growth in rental sales and improved margins and manpower, as well as MENAC margin expansion, driven by 80/20, more selective project quoting and favorable mix. As Paul previously mentioned, second quarter adjusted EBITDA was also positively impacted by the execution of our ASCEND transformation program, which we estimate positively impacted the quarter by approximately $15 million. So based on the results of the first-half of the fiscal year, current foreign exchange rates and our view on the remainder of the fiscal year, we now expect full-year net sales of $580 million to $600 million and an adjusted EBITDA range of $118 million to $128 million, including an ASCEND EBITDA benefit of $32 million to 38 million."
