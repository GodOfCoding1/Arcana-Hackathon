    "content": " The combination of strong orders and the continuation of global supply chain challenges continues to add pressure on our past due backlog, which increased slightly from the end of our third quarter to be roughly $10 million to $11 million at the end of Q4. Excluded the impact from foreign currency translation, working capital decreased by $16 million in the fourth quarter, primarily on $7 million of lower receivables due to strong collections performance and $8 million of incremental payables. Due to the uncertain macroeconomic environment and particularly the impact of the stronger US dollar, we are setting our full year fiscal 2023 net sales range of $565 million to $585 million, which based on current foreign exchange rates, is approximately a 3.5% headwind from fiscal 2022 and assumes that there is not a global recession."
