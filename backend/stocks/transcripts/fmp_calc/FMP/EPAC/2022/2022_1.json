    "content": " Lower margins on the mix of product and service sales this quarter, coupled with pricing actions that only offset cost increases, resulting in an incremental margin of 26%, below our targeted levels. As we walked through on our last earnings call, our guidance assumes that we will see some moderation in supply chain headwinds in the back half of the year and coupled with an incremental pricing action in line with our normal historical timing, we expected to see 1% to 2% pricing realization for the year, substantially all of which would be recognized in the back half of our fiscal 2022.
