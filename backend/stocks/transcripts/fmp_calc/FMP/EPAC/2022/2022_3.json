    "content": " Further, while Enerpac Tool Group does not have a material top line exposure in Russia or Ukraine, the war has had ancillary impacts to our business that we continue to manage in the third quarter, including supply chain challenges, increased commodity costs, foreign currency impacts, lower dealer confidence in parts of Europe, and delayed maintenance as refineries continue to run to reduce dependency on Russian oil, particularly in Europe. Moving on to Europe, this region experienced a core decline of approximately 10% year-over-year, primarily driven by a large service project that did not repeat and a decrease in service due to delayed maintenance work as pipelines continued to operate to reduce dependency on oil and gas coming from Russia. And while our product shipments increased sequentially by 13%, this strong order demand coupled with continued global supply chain challenges again put pressure on our past due backlog, which increased from $6 million to $8 million at the end of our second quarter to roughly $9 to $10 million at the end of Q3."
