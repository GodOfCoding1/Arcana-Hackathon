    "content": " Casey's had gross profit of $811 million in the second quarter, an increase of $93 million or 13% from the prior year. EBITDA for the quarter was $271.7 million compared to $217 million a year ago, that's an increase of 25%. The company is not updating its annual outlook for the following metrics; inside margin is expected to be approximately 40%, the company expects same-store fuel gallons to be flat to up 2%, the company continues to expect to add approximately 80 stores in fiscal 2023, and expects to exceed the stated three-year commitment we have of 345 new units. Your line is now open. I think the - probably the biggest incremental headwind really the only incremental headwind of note that we would be looking at right now would be incremental investment compensation - I'm sorry, incentive compensation for the organization, just given the strong results year-to-date, that's going to be partially offset, if retail prices of fuel continue to trend down, that would be a little less, credit card headwind and OpEx spends than we have been looking at this time last quarter. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. Yes, Ben, this is Darren. We will look at - be looking at a variety of calendar year price increases on our normal schedule with a lot of that centered of store merchandise come January 1 and we will be making price adjustments and at the same time, we have visibility on one of that's contracted and so I would expect that to be relatively constant, but more work on the prepared food side in the second half of the year. Your line is now open. Yes, Ben, this is Darren. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. Your line is now open."
