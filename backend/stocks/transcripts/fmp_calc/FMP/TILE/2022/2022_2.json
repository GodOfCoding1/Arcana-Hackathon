    "content": " Second quarter adjusted gross profit margin was 34.3%, a decrease of 315 basis points from the prior year period as we continue to see higher freight, labor and raw material costs partially offset by higher pricing to our customers. Adjusted SG&A expense for the second quarter was 80.4 million or 23.2% of net sales, compared to 79.4 million or 26.9% of net sales in the same period last year. This is a great result on strong net sales growth, excellent work by our sales team and our supply chain operators to mostly offset inflation that has been 40 year high and continued vigilance focus on SG&A management. At the same time, these challenges are being partially offset by strong execution by our sales and manufacturing teams, continued demand in the commercial market, including office, education and healthcare, where we have a leadership position and a strong backlog as we move into the back half of the year. While we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re continuing to see solid growth in the business, our second half net sales comp will not look as strong in the first half of 2022 as we left the very strong net sales results achieved in the second half of last year."
