    "content": " Third quarter revenue came in at $315.5 million, up 4% year-over-year, exceeding a guidance range of $301 million to $315 million. Viavi\u2019s operating profit margin at 21.5% came in at the high end of our guidance range of 20.5% to 21.5%, improving 130 basis points year-over-year. NSE revenue at $230.8 million, up 9.3% year-over-year, came in at the low end of our guided range of $229 million to $239 million, as a result of COVID-related shutdowns in Shenzhen  in China late in the quarter. Within NSE, NE revenue increased 7% from a year ago to $204.3 million, reflecting continued strength in our fiber, wireless and lab and production products. NSE\u2019s operating profit margin at 14.9%, increased 500 basis points year-over-year, a result of operating leverage on higher revenue and disciplined OpEx management. The ending balance of our total cash and short-term investments was $596 million, down $82.1 million compared to a year ago, primarily due to additional retirements of convertible notes as well as investments in organic initiatives, including increased inventory levels, allowing us to meet and exceed customer demand requirements in environment of supply chain challenges. So that's what I said in my comments, the prowess of our supply chain management has really been instrumental in not only benefiting from this increased spend in fiber, but also capturing share for the remaining business because a lot of major players that would give you, let's say, 70%, 80%, and they would have a second source for 20%, 30%. And some of the new segments like ORAN and with the 5G and our revamped SC business, we actually think we\u2019re going to be in a higher growth segment than we were \u2013 while we were restructuring the business kind of from the JDS Uniphase days to the modern Viavi."
