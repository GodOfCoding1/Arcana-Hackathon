    "content": " Viavi's operating profit margin of 16.2% decreased 560 basis points from last quarter and 710 basis points from prior year, although above our guidance range of 13.9% to 14.9%, EPS at $0.14 per share was down 41.7% from the prior year and 39.1% from the prior quarter results and exceeded the guidance range of $0.10 to $0.12 per share. NSE quarterly revenue was impacted by lower service provider spent at $207.1 million and declined 15.2% year-over-year, slightly ahead of our guidance range of $187 million to $203 million. We expect NSE revenue to be approximately $197 million, plus or minus $8 million, with operating profit margin at 7.7% plus or minus 50 basis points. OSP is expected to be approximately $69 million, plus or minus \u00e2\u0082\u00ac2 million, with operating profit margins of 13.5% versus minus 100 basis points. Looking ahead, we expect second half of fiscal 2023 to be weaker with quarterly core OSP revenue moderating to about $55 million per quarter, driven by weaker anti-counterfeiting product demand as some of our major end customers pulled back on fiscal stimulus. I guess Oleg, I'm trying to get the thread on carrier CapEx and OpEx a little bit more clearly because clearly, it was even better than you guided to in the quarter, but -- you talked about the macro, but yet it seems like calendar 2023 spend seems like it's going to be okay, and you're also saying that later in the year."
