    "content": " Fourth quarter revenue of $62.4 million declined 3% year-over-year, primarily due to a difficult comparison as the year ago quarter included significant revenue from the LTE transition project at our largest customer. For slide nine, fourth quarter revenue declined 3% year-over-year to $62.4 million compared to $64.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2021. By segment, IoT connectivity revenue of $43.7 million increased 1% year-over-year. IoT solution gross margin increased 510 basis points year-over-year to 28.7%, mainly driven by the absence of lower margin LTE transition revenues from our largest customer in the current quarter. Adjusted EBITDA in the fourth quarter was $15.7 million, an increase of $2.6 million or approximately 20% compared to the same period last year. Total revenue of $268.4 million increased 8% from 2021, IoT connectivity revenue increased 4% to $175.9 million And IoT solution's revenue increase 16.5% to $92.5 million. Full year 2022 net loss of $105.4 million, which includes the fourth quarter goodwill impairment charge increase $80.6 million compared to the full year 2021 net loss at $24.8 million. Look, we were relatively confidently stating without providing guidance on the last call that, even net of the $24 million hole, right, the $12 sort of headwind from our largest customers LTE transition project going away, and then the 2G/3G revenue of about $12 million in 2022, that was obviously not going to be replicated in 2023. Look, Romil, I think you mentioned that when you were putting together the guidance for 2023, did you say earlier on the call that that before you layer in the Twilio component, that you were sort of looking at mid to high single digit organic normalized growth rates, obviously normalized meaning despite the fact that you had the pair of $12 million revenue headwinds for 2023."
