    "content": " Please note, that even with the continued new revenue from BMP customers in Q3 and Q4 of this year, we do expect IoT solutions quarterly revenue to decline in both quarters on a year-over-year comparison basis. So it's largely an IoT solutions story in terms of reduction in H2 over H1 just because there's this massive sort of upfront -- I don't like the term pull forward myself, but the one-time sort of large engagement the LTE transition project which is such a unique thing for us. Just on the IoT solutions, when I look at that type of -- again, growth rate which to me again, yes, the first half of the year is tough comp, but if you're putting up -- if you're continuing this type of growth rate then it's still going to look -- I mean, I would think that it still have to grow just in IoT solutions. So on the opportunities front, Scott, I just -- I think we need a couple of more maybe even a couple more years certainly a few more quarters of maturity on selling these more pre-configured solutions, bundled solutions types of engagements to customers in this industry go-to-market model that really only five quarters six quarters old for us."
