    "content": " I mean, look first of all, I think it's important to step back and just look at the power of the technology and how we built it with very rich application suite, one that actually is highly relevant, many different budget centers inside of a company, but also there is the speed at which we are able to innovate on the system and how that translates into new value and use cases that customers can turn on quickly and that's the core of how we operate this business, you're landing, you're enabling new use cases and you're expanding and that importantly contributes to how we think about long-term durable growth at scale and that's partly what's reflected in the context behind the NRR number, but I'm going to let Rob or Chris adding to this. And I think frankly, the company is naturally advantaged, especially in times of uncertainty to be able to create highly relevant product and capability that helps people to navigate their markets, right, whether it's navigating inflation, whether it's navigating the war for talent and part of the idea of experience management is we help organizations get closer to the customers and the workforce that they're dependent on and we'll be able to run their businesses and that's an important part something that we've been out for 20 years and we've only got better and better at in the way that we ended delivering. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open."
