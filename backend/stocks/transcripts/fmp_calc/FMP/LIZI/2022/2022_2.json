    "content": "  In the second quarter of 2022, we remained focused on dual pillar approach of interactive entertainment plus audio-based social networking business development and effectively executing globalized diversified product matrix strategy. Moreover, we achieved our third consecutive quarter of net income on a GAAP basis, which increased to RMB18.85 million in the second quarter, up 15% sequentially and recorded a profit versus a net loss in the same period of last year. In the second quarter, our total net revenues were RMB515.7 million, compared to RMB559.3 million in the second quarter of 2021, primarily due to the decreases in the number of paying users and the average amount of user spending on our audio entertainment products. Cost of revenues was RMB340.1 million in the second quarter of 2022, compared to RMB400.5 million in the second quarter of 2021, primarily due to a decrease in the revenue sharing fees because of a decrease in net revenues and the revenue sharing percentage to content creators."
