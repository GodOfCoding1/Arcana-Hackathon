    "content": " We recorded a negative provision for loan loss of $782,000 in the third quarter of 2022, which was triggered by a loan loss recovery in our energy segment of $822,000, combined with paydowns of $19.6 million in our hotel portfolio, over half of which -- of those paydowns was adversely classified. Additionally, we continue to have liquidity to fund future loan growth as our loan to deposit ratio was 77.7% at September 30, 2022 as compared to 75.3% at the end of the second quarter of 2022. As Curtis touched on, loans held for investment increased during the third quarter of 2022 by $109.9 million or 17% annualized, compared to the second quarter of 2022 as outlined on slide five. As outlined on slide seven, we grew loans in our metropolitan markets by $30 million in the third quarter of 2022, representing 14.6% annualized growth as compared to the second quarter of 2022. Year to date, we've grown our loan portfolio by 15.2% to $849 million in our metro markets, which strongly contribute to the bank's 10% total loan growth through the first three quarters of the year. Skipping ahead to slide nine, our indirect auto loan portfolio increased by $7 million to $289 million in the third quarter of 2022 as compared to the second quarter of 2022. As Curtis has commented, we believe we reached an inflection point in the second quarter of 2022 where our growing loan portfolio would generate improving interest income and return the bank to growth despite the decline in our mortgage banking business. Turning to slide 11, we generated $20.9 million of non-interest income in the third quarter of 2022 compared to $18.8 million in the second quarter of 2022. Excluding the $4.4 million of large loan recoveries and prepayment penalties that we recognized in the second quarter, our net interest margin was 3.54% which is a better comparison to the 3.7% in the third quarter of 2022. Turning to slide 14, total deposits increased $34.7 million in the third quarter to $3.46 billion as compared to the second quarter of 2022. Additionally, we continue to experience a positive mix shift in our deposit base as non-interest bearing deposits increased to 36.5% of total deposits in the third quarter of 2022 as compared to 34.9% in the second quarter of 2022. As Curtis touched on, we recorded a negative provision for loan loss of $782,000 in the third quarter compared to no provision for loan losses in the second quarter of 2022. Overall, we continue to experience improving credit metrics in our loan portfolio, with particular improvements in our hotel portfolio as non-performing assets to total assets declined slightly to 19 basis points in the third quarter of 2022 from 20 basis points in the second quarter of 2022 and 33 basis points in the first quarter of 2022."
