    "content": " In the second quarter, we processed $4.9 billion in volume, up 226% year-over-year with over 22 million consumers using our Buy Now, Pay Later services over 100 million times since launch. Venmo remains a key growth driver for our business with nearly 90 million active accounts, driving revenue growth in Q2 of more than 50%, with the revenues exceeding $100 million last month alone. In the second quarter, we also completed an additional $750 million in share repurchases, bringing 2022 year-to-date repurchase activity to $2.25 billion, representing approximately 95% of free cash flow generated so far this year. And as we discussed, we're pleased to announce the following: approximately $900 million of cost savings in 2022 across our operating and transaction expenses, with savings potential of at least $1.3 billion through fiscal year '23, an invigorated capital return program including a new $15 billion share repurchase authorization, full evaluation of capital return alternatives and an upcoming Investor Day in early 2023 to share operational, capital allocation and strategic updates. Maybe I would just add, in terms of the $900 million of identified savings this year and the $1.3 billion next year, nearly 50% of that really comes from transaction-related expenses."
