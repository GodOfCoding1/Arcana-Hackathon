    "content": " Today we reported second-quarter net income attributable to HF Sinclair shareholders of $1,221 million or $5.43 per diluted share. Excluding these items, adjusted net income for the second quarter was $1,259 million or $5.59 per diluted share, as compared to adjusted net income of $144 million or $0.87 per diluted share for the same period in \u00e2\u0080\u009821. We're on pace to exceed our target of approximately $100 million in annual run rate synergies within two years of the acquisition close date through a combination of commercial improvements, operating expense reductions and SG&A optimization. Pre-tax earnings were negatively impacted by a lower cost to market inventory, valuation adjustment of $35 million, acquisition integration costs of $13 million and decommissioning charges of $0.5 million related to the Cheyenne Refinery conversion to renewable diesel production. HF Sinclair owns $59.6 million HEP Limited Partner units, which following the acquisition of Sinclair Transportation represents 47% of HEP\u00e2\u0080\u0099s outstanding LP units with market value of $1 billion as of last Friday's close. Second quarter net income attributable to HEP was $56.8 million compared to $55.7 million in the second quarter of 2021, which included a $5.3 million gain related to our refined products pipeline sale. HEP generated distributable cash flow of $78.5 million and we announced a second quarter distribution of $0.35 per LP unit, resulting in a distribution coverage ratio of 1.8 times. During the second quarter total capital expenditures were approximately $15 million, including $7 million in turnaround expenses related to our Woods Cross refinery processing units, $5 million of maintenance CapEx, $2 million of reimbursable CapEx and $1 million in expansion capital. Your line is open. Your line is open. On my end Rich, at the time when you set the capital return of a $1 billion comparing to today certainly second quarter and third quarter look like was much stronger than you were expected. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. But as you know, we've invested in a pre-treatment unit and while we initially bought a lot of RBD to feed our start-ups, we're progressing toward a diverse feedstock slate much of which is going through our own PTU, and that will significantly improve our economics as of today for example the  versus RBD spread per gallon is something like $0.75. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open."
