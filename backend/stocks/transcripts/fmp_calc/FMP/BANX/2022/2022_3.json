    "content": " As I mentioned last quarter, we believe that every 25 basis points increase in base rates may translate to as much as an additional $0.005 to $0.01 per share per quarter in net income, all things being equal. As of the end of last week, Fed funds futures were pricing in a peak policy rate of nearly 5.2% in Q2 2023, which is accurate, such as there could be as much as 150 basis points of additional rate increases that could drive anywhere between $0.03 to $0.06 of earnings per quarter just related to the increase in base rates for our floating rate assets. We are pleased to report that net investment income for the third quarter was approximately $3.3 million or $0.46 per share, up 7% from the prior quarter. I also want to emphasize that for the first nine months of 2022, net investment income was up approximately 17% as compared to the same period in 2021 and meaningfully higher than the published inflation rate for the U.S. Also of note, ArrowMark Financial, over earned the third quarter $0.39 per share declared dividend by $0.07 per share or approximately 20%. For the quarter, the change in net unrealized depreciation on investments and foreign currency transactions was approximately $6.6 million or $0.92 per share. During the quarter, we generated net income of $3.3 million, net realized capital gains of approximately $4.7 million and the unrealized value of the portfolio and foreign currency transactions decreased by $6.6 million."
