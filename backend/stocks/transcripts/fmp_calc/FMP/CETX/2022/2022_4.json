    "content": " We believe Vicon can move towards $5 million in $10 million in recurring revenue over the next couple of years as a global leader in advanced security and surveillance technology to safeguard businesses, schools, municipalities, hospitals, and cities across the world. Our revenue for the full year of fiscal year 2022 totaled $50.3 million, compared to revenue of $43.1 million for the full year of 2021, a 17% increase year-over-year. The Advanced Technology segment revenues for the years ended September 30 2020 and 2021 were $29.1 million and $24.2 million, respectively, an increase of 20%. Industrial Service segment revenues for the full year 2022 increased by 12% to $21.2 million, primarily due to the increase in demand for their services. Gross profit for the year ended September 30, 2022 was $19.1 million or 38% of revenues as compared to a gross profit of $17 million, or 39% of revenues for the year-ended September 30 2021. Operating activities for continuing operations used $16.1 million for the year ended September 30, 2022, compared to using $10.1 million of cash for the year ended September 30, 2021. Cash and cash equivalents totaled $10.6 million at September 30, 2022 as compared to $11.4 million at June 30, 2022 and $15.4 million at September 30, 2021. Inventories increased by $3.9 million, or 68% to $9.5 million at September 30, 2022 from $5.7 million at September 30, 2021. Looking ahead, we believe revenues for Vicon Industries based on our current demand should increase by approximately 16% to $28 million for fiscal year '23, given the launch of our AI-based analytics solution, more improvements to our core product Valerus, as well as additional sales opportunities. We also believe AIS will continue to expand revenues by approximately 3% to $21.8 million, driven by continued strength in the industrial services market."
