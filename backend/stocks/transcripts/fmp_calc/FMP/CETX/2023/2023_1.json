The security segment revenues for the first quarters of 2023 and 2022 were $7 million and $4.4 million respectively, an increase of 61%. Industrial services segment revenues for the first quarter of 2023 decreased by $2 million to 2% to $5 million, mainly due to timing of the recognition of revenue for segments products and services. Gross profit for the first quarter of 2023 was $5 million or 42% of revenues, as compared to gross profit of $3.2 million or 34% of revenues for the year ago period. Operating loss for the first quarter of 2023 was $2 million, a 41% decline as compared to an operating loss of $3.3 million for the first quarter of 2022. Looking ahead, we continue to believe revenues for Vicon Industries based on our current demand should increase by approximately 16% to $28 million for fiscal year 2023, given the launch of our AI based analytics solutions, improvements to Valerus and additional select sales. We believe AIS will continue to expand revenues by 3% to $21.8 million for fiscal year 2023 driven by continued strength in the industrial services market, gross profit margin percentage for AIS is expected to improve to approximately 34% for the fiscal year 2023 for AIS. With all the combined actions taken to drive business improvement, we believe the operating loss over the next four quarters to be under approximately $2.5 million."
