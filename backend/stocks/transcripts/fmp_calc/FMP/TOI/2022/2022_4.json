    "content": " Despite facing certain headwinds during the year, including Medi-Cal preventing us from dispensing oral prescriptions to a portion of our California patients, a tight labor market and delays in acquired revenue, we surpassed the top end of our revised 2022 guidance for revenue, gross profit, and adjusted EBITDA, and achieved our revised guidance for covered lives. Consolidated revenue for Q4 2022 was $71 million, an increase of 36.6% compared to Q4 2021, and an increase of 9.9% compared to Q3 2022 . Gross profit in Q4 2022 was $16 million, an increase of 87.6% compared to Q4 2021. Consolidated revenue for the year ended December 31, 2022 was $252 million, an increase in 24.4% compared to prior year. Gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2022 was $52 million, an increase in 27.5% year-over-year. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2022 was $1.7 million, an increase of $12.6 million compared to the prior year. SG&A expenses for the year ended December 31, 2022 were $119 million or 47.3% of revenue, compared with $83 million or 41.1% of revenue in prior year. To ensure that success, our focus is aligned on three primary areas; first, refining and optimizing our model and expansion markets, including optimizing referral capture and transitioning gain share contracts to population risk agreements; second, growing our legacy markets by expanding service offerings in existing clinics and expanding to new counties; and finally, reducing cash burn by improving efficiency with new technology solutions, optimizing drug margins and taking a more sustainable approach to new market entry."
