    "content": " As announced earlier in the year, we also achieved and surpassed our near-term operating margin targets and we're pleased to cap off the fiscal year with operating income margins of 4.5%, this recently ended quarter and 3.9% for the fiscal year. Farnell's fourth quarter operating margin of 14.2% benefited favorably from higher year-over-year pricing, which contributed 180 basis points of margin. We have spent the last couple of years making Avnet a stronger company, one that is not only able to operate effectively in today's complex environment, but also one that can provide even greater value for our customers by proactively managing their supply chain. With the synergies we're seeing between Electronic Components and Farnell, our investments to support future organic growth, and steady progress toward our operating margin goals, we are confident in our ability to continue delivering value to our customers, suppliers, and shareholders in fiscal year 2023 and beyond.
