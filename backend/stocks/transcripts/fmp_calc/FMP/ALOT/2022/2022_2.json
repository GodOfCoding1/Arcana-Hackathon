    "content": "  On today's call, management will be referring to non-GAAP financial measures including non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per diluted share, non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP segment operating income, earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization or EBITDA, EBITDA excluding the CARES Act benefits and adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA excluding the CARES Act benefits. That said, in summary, we've carefully and intentionally differentiated between the income statement impact of the benefits we've recorded in our GAAP financial results which have those two CARES Act programs in them, and the results that we would have reported had those items not been there and we've done this to help you focus attention on the underlying operating results of the business, and we called that pre-CARES Act or non-GAAP in our press release disclosure."
