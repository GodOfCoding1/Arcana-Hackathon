    "content": " For the first quarter of fiscal 2022 revenue came in at $29.1 million, down 6% from the prior year, as top-line growth in our product and edification segment, partly offset continued softness in the aerospace portion of our test and measurement segment, due to the effects of the pandemic and the slow recovery in 737 MAX shipments. The year-over-year variance in supplies revenue reflected in part weaker aerospace industry demand in the first quarter of this fiscal 2022, associated with COVID-19 as compared to last year, as well as what we now think was some early pandemic supply stocking orders from some Product Identification Customers in the fiscal 2021. So far, we've not really had shortages and I've managed this once with some additional costs for things like expedited shipping and express shipping fees and we don't think that these challenges that materially affected our financial results or relationships with our customers and our current view are that these issues will remain manageable, but it probably will take a couple of quarters before they're worked out of the system. Yeah, we don't what I could say is maybe I just highlight the things that I already have said, which is we're seeing a nice pickup in orders on our Product Identification side and while the orders are still behind where they were obviously you know pre-pandemic level in the aerospace in Test Measurement portions of our Test And Measurement Segment that we're seeing that ramp up to."
