Bookings for the fiscal \u201922 came in at $128.6 million, up 13.2% year-over-year. In the fourth quarter comparisons to the prior year, we\u2019ve been hit by higher labor costs, higher material costs and significantly higher freight costs which spiked significantly in the fourth quarter as we were forced to pay for expedited shipping to get parts on time, sometimes even by airfreighting them over the top of the same goods being shipped, and the rates we\u2019re paying are a lot higher as well. Service and other revenue was 10% in the quarter, approximately flat in percentage terms, but up about of $0.25 million compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal \u201921. Supplies revenue was 62% of revenue for both fiscal \u201922 and fiscal \u201921, and our service business accounted for 11% of revenue in fiscal \u201922 versus 9% of revenue in the prior year. For the full year, domestic revenue accounted for 58% for fiscal \u201922 versus 60.1% in fiscal 2021. International revenue came in at 42% for the year up from 38.9% in fiscal \u201921. This compares to $3.1 million or 13.2% of revenue in the prior year fourth quarter, again reflecting higher manufacturing and procurement costs. Test & Measurement segment operating profit improved in the quarter, coming in at almost $0.5 million or 6.8% of revenue compared with $282,000 or 4.6% of revenue a year earlier. On a full year basis, the T&M segment had an operating profit of $3.4 million or 12.8% of revenue in fiscal 2022, compared to an operating loss of $1 million in fiscal 2021. Turning to the balance sheet, cash and equivalents at yearend totaled $5.3 million compared to $11.4 million at the end of fiscal \u201921."
