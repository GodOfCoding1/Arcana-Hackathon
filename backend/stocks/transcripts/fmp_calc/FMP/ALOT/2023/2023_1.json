    "content": " Despite the ongoing supply chain constraints and cost increases we faced during the first quarter, we were able to post modest increases in both revenue and operating income compared to last year's first quarter. Product Identification revenue declined 6% in the quarter, to $21.7 million, and operating income was $1.4 million or 6.5% of product revenue, compared to $2.7 million or 11.8% of product revenue in the same period last year. Turning to out Test & Measurement segment, first quarter revenue increased to $9.3 million, up 55% from the same period in fiscal 2022. Segment operating income also increased substantially, climbing to $1.9 million or 20.6% of revenue, from $350,000 or 5.9% in the year-ago period. Overall revenue was up $1.7 million -- was $1.7 million, up 21.6% to $9.3 million largely due to aircraft printer sales increases but also the data acquisition products Greg talked about. General and administrative expenses were $2.5 million, up 2.9% compared with last year's first quarter primarily due to increased payments to outside service providers. While this might seem like a notable 11.3% decline in the quarter year-over-year comparisons, it's primarily due to modest decreases in supplies and repairs expenses, and shouldn't be interpreted as a change in philosophy or approach or indicative of full-year trend."
