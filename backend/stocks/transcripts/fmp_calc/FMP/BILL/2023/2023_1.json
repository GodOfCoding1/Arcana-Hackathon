    "content": " In the FI channel, we had 9,100 net adds, driven by an increase in the number of small businesses signing up to use our white-label platform as well as the impact of a onetime migration of customers at an existing bank partner onto our white-label platform. This includes Bill stand-alone total payment volume of $61.6 billion in Q1 and representing growth of 31% year-over-year and $3 billion in card payment volume from Divvy spending businesses, representing 103% growth year-over-year. Transaction revenue increased to $156.5 million, up 94% year-over-year as a result of strong year-over-year TPV growth, increased ad valorem product monetization and increasing spend on Divvy. For fiscal Q2, we expect our total revenue to be in the range of $241.5 million to $244.5 million, which reflects 54% to 56% year-over-year growth versus a very seasonally strong Q2 last year. I can tell you it's a very small transaction, talented team, great product, we think fits strategically very nicely with where we're taking our platform over time, not only providing automation around financial operations, but shifting towards helping provide insights for customers to run a better business."
