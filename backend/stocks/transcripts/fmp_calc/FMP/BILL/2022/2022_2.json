    "content": " Transaction revenue increased to $106.3 million, up 313% year-over-year due to strong TPV growth, increased adoption of our ad valorem products and increased usage of our spend management card solution, which totaled $48.7 million in revenue for Q2. For Q3, Bill.com organic core revenue annual growth is expected to be approximately 67% on a stand-alone basis, while Divvy's spend management revenue growth is expected to be approximately 132%, which reflects lower seasonal card spend in Q3 for the advertising and travel categories and an estimated take rate closer to the top end of the 230 to 250 basis points previously discussed."
