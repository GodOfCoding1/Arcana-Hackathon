    "content": " We're going to obviously earn revenue against that over the next couple of years and that likely leads to a slightly declining percentage of revenue, given the rapid growth in some of our payment revenues outside of the financial institution channel, but long-term, we're actually very bullish in working with our financial institution partners and think there's a big opportunity such that the channel can be a larger component of our overall business as we think out intermediate and longer-term and that has to do with the potential to drive adoption of some of our additional products inside the white label solution that our banks are using, the opportunity to partner with new banks who are not currently working with us and so forth."
