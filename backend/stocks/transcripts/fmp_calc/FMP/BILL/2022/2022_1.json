    "content": " Bill.com's organic core revenue growth increased 78% year-over-year, driven by strong adoption of our platform and payment solutions. We also had 13,500 spending businesses using our Divvy card solution, representing growth of 2,800 net new adds in the quarter and 226,000 subscribers using Invoice2go's AR solution for the month of September. We've experienced significant organic TPV growth in recent quarters, driven in part by new customers scaling faster on our platform and increased payment activity from our customer base, including from larger mid-market businesses. During the quarter, we also processed $1.5 billion in card spend from Divvy's spending businesses, which is an increase of 160% from last year and nearly $100 million of TPV from Invoice2go's customers. While Invoice2go's payment volume is small, customers leverage the solution to send more than $2.5 billion in invoice volume in the month of September, which represents a significant opportunity for us to drive greater adoption of payments. Subscription revenue increased to $35 million, up 43% year-over-year, driven by an increase in the number of businesses using our platform, expansion of organic ARPU and fees from Invoice2go subscribers. Bill.com organic subscription revenue growth was 39% year-over-year, which accelerated from the prior quarter, driven mainly by a slightly larger average customer size due to our success with attracting and growing mid-market customer relationships. Transaction revenue increased to $80.6 million, up 319% year-over-year, driven mainly by interchange revenue from our Divvy card solution, payment mix shifts towards ad valorem products and strong TPV growth. For fiscal Q2, we expect our total revenue to be in the range of $130 million to $131 million which assumes organic core revenue growth of approximately 60% for Bill.com on a stand-alone basis."
