    "content": " As a percentage of net revenue, adjusted EBITDA was $17.7 compared with $21.6 in the prior-year period due to the combination of acquisitions not being fully integrated and higher-costs not yet covered by pricing actions. Combined, the Vinesse, ACE, and Meier's acquisitions are expected to contribute on order of an additional $2 to $3 million in cost synergies beginning over the next 6 to 18 months. It's probably a little early to talk about guidance for next year as we in the middle of our budget and planning process and finalizing some of our acquisitions, but we continue to stand behind our growth history and continue to stand behind the plan to make additional acquisitions as well as organic growth. It's not only projects some of it is delays, things that spilled under this year versus last year, but there are some, for instance, we're putting a new Canian line and the Meier's facility will allow us to bring canning for ACE hard cider into the East Coast will -- which will then really provide some tremendous opportunities to have savings of freight savings which will translate into higher prices for us. So, the acquisitions are doing well and we also made -- we've also made some minor CapEx to increase tank capacity at Meier's so we can get it ready for the 0.5 million plus cases of hard cider that we're going to move to that facility plus some other projects."
