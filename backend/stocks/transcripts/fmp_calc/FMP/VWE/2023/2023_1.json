    "content": " As Pat mentioned, our recently acquired ACE Cider brand delivered record volume performance driven by ongoing category growth for this segment of the beverage alcohol market and production efficiencies achieved since acquisition. As Terry mentioned, we had very strong growth in our direct-to-consumer segment, with revenue up 37% in the quarter to $20.5 million. Next, on to our B2B business, where 39% revenue growth was driven by increased private label and custom production activities, while the Meier's acquisition contributed $4.9 million in the quarter. Within our wholesale business, revenue increased 44% to $23.4 million, including $6.9 million of acquired revenues from ACE Cider, which is a high-volume business that is performing extremely well in the marketplace. If you'll turn to Slide 7, you'll see that Q1 gross profit increase resulting from strong revenue growth across all business segments, while Q1 gross margin was 38.7% versus 42.1% in the prior year due to increased overhead absorption. Our SG&A results reflect $4 million in acquisition-related SG&A, plus $4.6 million from the issuance of stock-based compensation that was not included in last year's first quarter."
