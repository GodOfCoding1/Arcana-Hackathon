    "content": " Turning to page 16, criticized loans increased $29.2 million or 6% in the quarter to $513.2 million or 2.66% LHI, as early grade migration in these categories continues to be primarily driven by commercial clients reliant specifically on consumer discretionary income, while criticized loans are down 12% since yearend 2021, we do expect the breadth of industries and client types experiencing great migration to expand in the coming quarters as the economy slows and are pleased to be entering the year with reserve levels at 1.31% of total LHI and 5.2x nonaccrual loans, both at or near cyclical highs."
