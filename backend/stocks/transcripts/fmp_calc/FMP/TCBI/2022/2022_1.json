    "content": " Given the firm\u2019s current unacceptable market share, we believe our opportunity is outsized and as an early indicator of our ability to grow market share and expand our client base, C&I loans grew again this quarter and are up 23% year-over-year. Net income to common was $35.3 million for the quarter, down $25.5 million quarter-over-quarter, driven primarily by the 27% decline in average mortgage-financed loans as the sharp rise in mortgage rates accelerated the industry\u2019s anticipated full year market contraction into Q1. Moving to slide 10, ending period C&I loans excluding PPP increased again this quarter, up $414 million or 16% annualized signifying early benefits of expanded coverage, improving calling disciplines and focused execution on our defined strategy. So we\u2019ve used the tools -- the things that we have done to really help with mortgage finance is over the past year, for the first quarter of 2021 to March of \u201922 as we repositioned the mix of mortgages that we finance with our clients, based on our client base to a much higher percentage of purchase from refinance. But as we said, both in this commentary as well as on the last call, that\u2019s a really important business for us and one that we want to be increasingly relevant to our clients and hence the products that we\u2019re rolling out this quarter in investment bank. It\u2019s focused directly on strategic objectives and if you would have told me last year that the increased expense by 2% or $3 million and that would equate to doubling C&I bankers, adding 60% of frontline, onboarding the technology talent necessary to develop internally a new commercial onboarding platform $2 billion of C&I loans in the rearview, I would take that trade all day."
