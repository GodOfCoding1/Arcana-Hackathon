    "content": " The statements in today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s conference call that are not historical facts, including, among other things, the expected financial performance of Dynagas LNG Partners\u00e2\u0080\u0099 business, Dynagas Partners LNG ability to pursue growth opportunities, Dynagas Partners LNG expectations or objectives regarding future and market charter rate expectations, and in particular, the effects of COVID-19 on the financial condition and operations of Dynagas Partners LNG and the LNG industry in general, may be forward-looking statements as such as defined in Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. For the fourth quarter of 2022, we reported net income of $11.6 million earnings per common unit of $0.24, adjusted net income of $7 million, adjusted earnings per common unit of $0.11 and adjusted EBITDA of 23.6 million. For the full-year of 2022, we recorded net income of 54 million, earnings per common unit of $1.15, adjusted net income of 30.6 million. Net income for the fourth quarter decreased by 31% to 11.6 million compared to Q4 2021, primarily due to a decrease in the unrealized gain on our interest rate swap transaction of 8.1 million, which was partly offset due to changes in the realized gain on our interest rate swap, and due to an increase of 3.2 million in interest and finance costs, which impact us with offset with an interest rate swap cash received of 4.3 million as can be seen in the cash flow statement. If we add risk growth as a realized gain from our interest rate swap of 4.3 million, adjusted net income would have amounted to 11.3 million or $0.23 per common unit instead of $0.11."
