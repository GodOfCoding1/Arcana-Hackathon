Mr. Helft, would you like to begin, please? Let me remind you everyone that this conference call is being recorded, and the recording will be available on Camtek\u00e2\u0080\u0099s website within a few hours of the call. With me today on the call, we have Mr. Rafi Amit, Camtek\u00e2\u0080\u0099s CEO; Mr. Moshe Eisenberg, Camtek\u00e2\u0080\u0099s CFO; and Mr. Ramy Langer, Camtek\u00e2\u0080\u0099s COO. Following that Rafi, Moshe and Ramy will be available to take your questions. Before we begin, I would like to remind everyone that certain information provided on this call are internal company estimates, unless otherwise specified. Furthermore, during this call, certain non-GAAP financial measures will be discussed. These are used by management to make strategic decisions, forecast future results and evaluate the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s current performance. And now I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d like to hand over the call to Rafi Amit, Camtek\u00e2\u0080\u0099s CEO. Third quarter revenues were a record of $82 million, a 16% increase year-over-year. Specifically, we are cementing our position in the front-end and compound semi segments. This quarter, we continued to strengthen our position in the U.S. and Europe due to major industry investment made there. Last month, the U.S. Commerce Department announced new regulations restricting the sales and support of semiconductor equipment for advanced nodes in China in both Memory and logic. We continue to evaluate the impact of such restrictions on Camtek, but based on our initial assessment, we believe that the direct revenue impact will be marginal, if any. The global economy is projected to decline in 2023, and expected to affect both wafer fab equipment in general and even more so in the Memory segment. We believe that although Camtek\u00e2\u0080\u0099s business model is not immune, it is however more resilient. One, we support a technology change in the industry of transition to Advanced Packaging and Heterogeneous Integration. 60% of our business is related to these segments. This strength is expected to continue  \n Rafi, we can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t hear you. And as we said, we believe that Camtek\u00e2\u0080\u0099s business model is not immune. First, is we support a technology changing the industry of transition to Advanced Packaging and Heterogeneous Integration. 60% of our business is related to these segments. Furthermore, the sales to the Memory segment are limited to DRAM only, which historically accounted for less than 5% of our total business. This segment, we mainly support the transition of the high bandwidths Memory, which is growing based on orders we have on hand and in the pipeline we expect increased sales in this space next year. Also, the increasing complexity of wafers being manufactured today means that manufacturers require ever more advanced inspection systems in their facilities. Moreover, Camtek has a wide and diversified customer base. This quarter alone, we sold systems to more than 40 different customers and added eight new customers. Altogether, we have over 250 active customers. Despite the positive factors that I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve outlined, we are progressing cautiously into the New Year. However, we continue to invest in R&D and plan to introduce new products and capabilities next year, securing our long-term growth path. Camtek is also not immune, but we believe our leading position, wide customer base and longer term strategic relationship with customers will enable our business to be more resilient than the overall semiconductor industry. In my financial summary ahead, I will provide the results on a non-GAAP basis. Indeed, it is below the typical range of our gross margin model and this quarter it was mainly driven by a less favorable product mix resulting from a few large orders and it does not represent a meaningful trend. Operating expenses in the quarter were $17 million, an increase of $2.7 million compared to the third quarter of last year and $300,000 compared to the previous quarter. Operating profit in the quarter was $23.2 million compared to the $21.7 million reported in the third quarter of last year, and $23.2 million in the previous quarter. Cash and cash equivalents, including short and long-term deposit as of September 30, 2022 were $460.3 million. In the last few quarters, we increase the inventory to overcome potential supply chain issues. With the stabilization trend of the supply chain, we plan to reduce the inventory level. Regarding guidance, as Rafi mentioned before, we expect fourth quarter revenues to be around the same level as of the third quarter. And with that Rafi, Ramy and I will be open to take your questions. Maybe, kind of Rafi, first following the recent U.S. export restrictions into China. The situation in China, I think, remember just four weeks ago, the Commerce Department, made all these restriction and the announcement, and I think it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s too early to evaluate the effect on the semiconductor industry in China. But at this point, when we discuss with customer in China, it looks like business as usual and utilization is okay. So, I believe it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s still too early to understand if this restriction, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll affect the whole industry or specific area we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know yet. But as I said, for at this point it looked like business as usual. Look, first of all, as we mentioned, most of our customer are not in the high notes, and we are mainly support the OSAT. Second about the backlog and pipeline, I would say that if we just look, a year ago, definitely all the supply chain interruption cause to many customer to place all their ahead of time to secure delivery. Now when delivery back to normal and people feel more comfortable and even some think about, even probability of slowdown, definitely a customer not so hurry to place order. So, we can see that the amount of pipeline is much bigger than backlog. We see leads, but we can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t see today, forecast as we saw a year ago, because the customer looking they place order when they really need it and they don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t feel they need to secure, delivery few quarter ahead. So, as I said, if we talk together, the backlog and the pipeline, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, look, I would say pretty normal, but, I would say to see when the pipeline will be converted to backlog, this can take time and probably as before we will know more before we start the new quarter, we get a better picture. Yes, I mean, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve \u00e2\u0080\u0093 this might have be based on a huge sample size, but I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve noticed or observed sometimes Q1 kind of, maybe its seasonal tends to be sequentially up in terms of revenue. But maybe listening to what you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re saying, Rafi, maybe it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, you could take a step down a little bit given sort of, you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have as much backlog, the define backlog, moving into next year. I, let me try and be a little bit, definitely our visibility at this stage looking into 2023 is limited. Now the backlog is healthy, and we have a very strong pipeline, and I think as Rafi said, it is too early to assess how quickly this pipeline will turn into orders. And this is a little bit different than where we were, let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s say a year ago, but definitely at this stage it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s too early. Hey, thanks for taking my question guys. So, so clearly visibility isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t as strong as it was before, but you guys are guiding to flat business. And then if I look at the mix of business, clearly CMOS image sensing is a little weaker, I think you said in the prepared remarks that that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s coming in below 10%. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s already kind of tracking well below that, so that makes sense. But in the quarter for September, you saw a pretty big decline in what you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve called the other or general business. I mean, we are seeing, and I think we said it in the prepared remarks, our business for the Advanced Packaging is around 60%. It has been in the last few quarters, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a very similar rate. So overall, I would say that 85% of the business is very, very stable. Now, the rest, CMOS Image Sensor historically was above 10%. This year it\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be a little bit less, and this will be compensated by what we call general 2D inspection applications, things like MEMS and other applications which are smaller in the volume. But from the business point of view, there aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t any differences or declines. The only change, I would say is the CMOS Image Sensors, and this is strongly related to mobile phone sales. Yes, so Tom, I think it is much too early to say today, what will be with our current visibility to really say, to give a good indication of the 2023 business, what we believe that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll do better than industry. It is really too early to say, and I believe that within a quarter or so will be in a much better position to give more accurate statements. I have, first a little bit longer term question, not specific to 2023. I think one underappreciated part of your business is that you have a very broad customer base 250 active, I mean, assuming each one of them just by one, two systems, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s enough to support you to $300 million annual run rate. And I think customers either in a greenfield customers or, competitive displacement. Hey it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think about it before, but first of all, I believe it\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll continue to add new customers, and the broad addition of customers is in general, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not related to one specific territory. I think as we grow the business, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re getting into new segments and therefore, yes, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll continue to add the customers, whether it\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be in the range of this year that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve already added 42 customers. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not sure, whether it\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be, or it\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be in a different magnitude, but definitely if we look also historically into previous years, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been adding a significant number of customers every year. Now, specifically wafer manufacturers, yes we are adding new wafer manufacturers to our portfolio. And we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll continue to add, and when I look at the target market for 2023, I believe that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have new customers in this segment as well. So the other question I have is, well, first all, we appreciate you from time-to-time, provide, new press releases about the latest orders you received from your customers, but your last update was in early September. So between September to now over the last two months, how do you see the ordering rate going, and I may have another follow up after this. So, I think what you mentioned it in the previous remark that you talked about, yes we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been adding orders. But when we look to the, at our backlog and add the pipeline, the business is healthy. They\u00e2\u0080\u0099re really, the big question, and this is why we are a \u00e2\u0080\u0093 we have a limited visibility, is the rate of the customers turning potential POs from the pipeline into real POs. Usually when we make announcement of order, it should be, over what we call multiple system orders. And, if we look on our portfolio, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s definitely contained a lot of what we call one and two unit per customer. Well, looking into the backlog, we have backlog today, that is already including, machine shipments in the first and the second quarter. However, we still need, in order to complete shipments for both quarters, we will need to converge some of the pipeline into POs. So, I wanted to pivot to gross margin. Moshe, you talked about some large customer dynamics that impacted gross margin in the quarter. So the main impact of the, the relatively lower gross margin for the third quarter was indeed a few large orders that we have delivered in the quarter. And we will continue, we will complete a delivery of them, over the course of the fourth quarter. So you will see some improvement in the fourth quarter, but not to the full extent. We should go, above the 50% mark, next year. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not sure to the full 52%, the upper limit, but we should be able to go back to above the 50% level. And then the second question just relates to operating expense, and I acknowledge we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re dealing with an unusually uncertain environment, but the question is this, if order trends and other dynamics meant that we weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t seeing the backlog conversion, to firm orders, as you look at operating expense, do you feel like you have any flexibility to reduce operating expense tactically or given the significant increase in customer engagements? So, the two key elements in our operating expense structure is the R&D and sales and marketing, G&A stays pretty much flat. We believe that, our business model is pretty agile, so we can change, some of the old expense mix between, direct and indirect. On the R&D front, I think Rafi mentioned in his prepared remarks that we want to continue to invest. So this is definitely an area that we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to affect, but within the certain marketing, there are certain activities that can be changed based on activity level. And then for my final question, a real strong, cash performance in the quarter. I know you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve talked about it in the past, and one of the things that precluded significant progress was that we had a COVID environment that really made it hard to get out and meet potential targets in person. Yes, regarding M&A, definitely we now you invest a lot of efforts, and the fact that I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not, participated the meeting in Israel because it also, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m investing on this issue, so we really believe that, we can do something in the next few months definitely. But, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a long process, even if you find something you want to make today especially good, good to check everything, to be sure that this is the right merge and not to do, to make any mistake. So, we do it cautiously, but definitely we invest a lot of effort to execute, I would say in the next six months something. You\u00e2\u0080\u0099re talking about M&A priority \u00e2\u0080\u0093 look, I would say that, since we take a major market share, we are not looking for a company similar to Camtek or doing something like Camtek this. This is not, so I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think it bring any effort \u00e2\u0080\u0093 any advantage for us. We focus more on some, in one hand should be in the same market segment, but on the other end in different technology or different product line. And then we can still use our, infrastructure of sales and marketing and support and enjoy this infrastructure to promote another product line. The other thing that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s still targeting the same segment as we focus and we really believe that we can bring some, some results very soon. Not so much scaler, but really technology extension, product line extension. Just on the, frontend side, you mentioned you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got pretty good demand from, excuse me, compound semis. I think today what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s dominant in the business in the last, I would say couple of quarters, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s definitely the silicon carbide portion. Now, I would say, it differs from quarter-to-quarter. It is roughly, I would say close to 10%, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s one quarter more, one quarter less roughly 10% of the business. This is a difficult question Gus, because it really depends on the kind of tool that he wants. It depends, but I would say, it is the, the soonest we can give is roughly four to six months. I mean, you are talking about 16 months to 20 months \u00e2\u0080\u0093 20-weeks, and if you go back let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s say a six month or a year ago, I think those lead time extended up to two quarters. So definitely lead times are shorter today by roughly, I would say they have shortened by roughly if you want to get number anywhere a bit around a month and a half to two months. And that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s exactly the difficulty that we have been describing now because having said that, people understand that we can provide machines at around four months and therefore there are less quick to secure the slots. They understand that there are slots, in our manufacturing and therefore this limits our visibility to the first half of next year. There are some issues here and there, there is a missing component here and there, but we are able to get the material that we need. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think that supply chain issues today are, will create any shortages or lack of all the ability to ship any machine. So, I think this is not the, the main issue today, that we have overall, we can get the parts. I think the supply chain in general is getting to, I would say, more reasonable situation. No, I think that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not, I think we discussed this in previous calls. We have made a significant investment in a clean room capacity and today the capacity is, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not a limitation anymore. Before I ask Mr. Amit to go ahead with his closing statement, I would like to remind participants that a replay of this call will be available on Camtek\u00e2\u0080\u0099s website, www.camtek.co.il beginning tomorrow. Mr. Amit, would you like to make your concluding statement? Again, I would like to thank all of our employees and my management team for their tremendous performance and we look forward to continue it. To our investor, I think your long-term support; I look forward to talking with you again next quarter."
