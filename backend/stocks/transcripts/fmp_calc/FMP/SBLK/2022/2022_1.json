    "content": " Looking at the similar fleet wide adjusted TCE less operating expenses and G&A figure on a full year basis, Star Bulk has been able to significantly outperform the adjusted peer average by more than $5,000 per day per vessel, implying an annual EBITDA overperformance of more than $230 million on a 128 vessels fleet and demonstrating how assets are efficiently utilized in the Star Bulk platform. Looking at chartering coverage for the second quarter of 2022, we have covered 74% of our fleet available days at a daily rate of $29,760 per day per vessel. Given recent rally in the market and the increase in bunker prices, we currently estimate that our working capital will increase by approximately $40 million in the second quarter of 2022, negatively affecting our cash balance at quarter end and our dividend for the quarter by approximately $0.40 per share. For example, with approximately 46,700 fleet available days per year, based on the current 2022 FFA curve, Star Bulk will produce $6.1 of free cash flow per share and a yield of 19%."
