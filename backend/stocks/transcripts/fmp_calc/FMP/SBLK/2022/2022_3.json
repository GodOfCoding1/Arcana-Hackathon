    "content": " Our results for the third quarter of 2022 include a loss on write-down of inventories of $14.9 million, resulting from the valuation of the bunkers remaining on board of our vessels following the substantial decrease of the bunker's net realizable value compared to their historical costs. During the year, we have agreed refinancing totaling approximately $400 million that decreased our annual regular debt repayments by $12.5 million and reduced our interest costs by approximately $5 million per annum as a result of achieving significantly lower margins. What is good is that in the last, essentially, two years, we have managed to refinance approximately 60% of our total debt close to $800 million, saving tens of millions in the spread interest cost without losing a lot of the interest rate swaps that we did back in 2020 because essentially, those swaps, the majority of those were done on the holding level of Star Bulk and therefore, were not affected by the refinancings."
