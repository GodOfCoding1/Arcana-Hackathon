Adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter of 2022 was $59 million compared with $15 million in the prior year, and corresponding adjusted EBITDA margin increased to 5.6% from 1.5% in the prior year. Net sales for the fourth quarter of '22 decreased by $22 million or 4% when compared with the prior year, primarily driven by lower net sales of avocados due to lower selling prices, and also lower net sales of non-tropical fruit as a result of lower selling prices and lower volumes. Moving to our Banana segment, for the fourth quarter of 2022 net sales increased by $33 million or 9% compared with the prior year period, primarily driven by Europe and North America. Adjusted gross profit for the fourth quarter of 2022 was $38 million compared with $9 million in the prior year period, primarily driven by higher net sales, partially offset by higher cost of packaging materials, fertilizer and distribution costs including ocean and inland freight. Lastly, for the fourth quarter of 2022, net sales for our other products and services segment increased by $12 million or 24% compared with the prior year, mainly due to higher net sales of third-party ocean freight services. For the full fiscal year '22, net sales increased $190 million or 4% compared with the prior year period."
