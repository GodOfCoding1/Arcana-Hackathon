    "content": " As noted by Mohammad, Net sales for the first quarter of 2022 increased by $49 million, or approximately 5% compared with the prior-year period. Net sales for the first quarter of 2022 increased $42 million, or approximately 7%, compared with the prior-year period, as a result of increased net sales across most product categories, mainly related to higher pricing. Lastly, the fresh and value-added product segment had $3 million of one-time charges in the first quarter of 2021 related to damage caused by severe range storms in Chile, which impacted our non-tropical fruit category. Moving to our Banana segment, net sales for the first quarter of 2022 decreased by $12 million, compared to the prior-year period, as a result of lower sales volume in North America, partially offset by higher pricing. One-time charges in the Banana segment in the prior-year period included $1.5 million net insurance recovery, related to damage caused by hurricanes in Central America, in the fourth quarter of 2020, there were no one-time charges in the first quarter of 2022. Lastly, net sales in our Other Products and Services segment increased by $19 million or 49%, mainly due to higher net sales of third-party freight services in North America. For argument sake, we have been kind of impacted negatively in the first quarter because the price of oil have increased tremendously while our rate was locked at a lower, let's say, ocean freight and at the beginning of April has been adjusted to reflect the current let's say more or less, fuel cost."
