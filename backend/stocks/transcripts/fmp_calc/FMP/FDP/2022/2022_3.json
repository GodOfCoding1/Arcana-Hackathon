    "content": " During the third quarter, our net sales increased 5% compared with the prior year period. We realized adjusted EBITDA of $58 million, representing more than twofold increase compared with the prior year period. As noted by Mohammed, net sales for the third quarter of 2022 increased by $49 million or 5% compared with the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter was $58 million compared with $26 million in the prior year period, and corresponding adjusted EBITDA margin was 5.5% compared with 2.6% in the prior year. The increase in net sales relates to higher per unit sales prices due to a combination of inflation justified price increases, contractually indexed fuel and freight surcharges within certain of our contracts, our strategic sourcing decisions in response to market conditions and an atypical seasonally low industry supply in certain markets in the third quarter of 2022. Lastly, net sales in our other products and services segment increased by $27 million or 70%, mainly due to higher net sales of third party freight services in North America. For cash flows, our year to date -- we generated net cash from operating activities of $106 million compared with $152 million in the prior year. Long term debt remained relatively in line in both periods, increasing by $9 million to $486 million at the end of the third quarter of 2022 compared with $477 million at the end of the same quarter last year. As it relates to capital spending, we invested $36 million in capital expenditures in the first nine months of 2022 compared with $83 million in the prior year period."
