The  driving our -- having a TV record production performance, it also helps in terms of our unit costs, and in our unit costs in Q2 -- in Q3 Detour ] full year guidance ranges. Compared with Q3 2020, revenue increased by $34 million or 5% year-over-year, mainly due to a higher gold sales volume, which increased from 332,000 ounces in Q3 2020 to 372.1000 ounces in Q3 of 2021 with the increase largely reflecting record gold production at Detour Lake and strong production and Fosterville, partly offset by unfavorable impacts from low -- the lower average gold prices. Looking at income taxes, our Q3 2021 net earnings benefited from a lower effective tax rate of 25.3% versus 31.6% in Q3 2020, mainly as a result of the $15.6 million net tax recovery related to the optimization of the eligible tax deductions for Ontario Mining Tax, following a restructuring of the company's Canadian entities early in 2021. Your line is open. But through effective cost management and higher-than-planned gold sales largely at Fosterville, our operating cash costs per ounce and also our AISC sold in Q3 2021 was significantly better than the full year 2021 guidance ranges, right. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open."
