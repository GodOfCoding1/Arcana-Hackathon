    "content": " However, in Q4, we accelerated a 12.9% portfolio NOI growth driven by senior housing operating business with NOI growth of 28.1%, despite all the challenges of the current economy. This moderating COMPOR growth helped drive the deceleration in overall expense growth, despite continued inflationary pressures in several line items, including food and utilities, which rose 10.5% and 10%, respectively, in the fourth quarter of 2022 on a per occupied room basis compared to the prior year's quarter. Underlying this FFO guidance is estimated total portfolio year-over-year same-store NOI growth of 8% to 13%, driven by subsegment growth of outpatient medical, 2% to 3%, long-term post-cute 2% to 3%, and senior housing triple-net of 1% to 3%, and finally, senior housing operating growth of 15% to 24%, the midpoint of which is driven by revenue growth of approximately 9.5%. So, think about it, I don't know, just -- you will see the future is with our select operating partners, strategic partners, we're going to have bigger density or higher density and a bigger scale in a market and with our investment in the technology platform and the operating platform with our operating partners, the ability to execute on the ground I think, again, this is going to be not only a great win for our owners, our assets, but also a great win for the select operated partners that we'll choose to do business with going forward. John, do you want to add anything to that? John, do you want to add anything to that? I'll just tell you that from a pricing power standpoint, this is something I mentioned in the last call that we are -- despite our average occupancy of the portfolio, call it, circa 80%, there's a significant part of the portfolio, call it, give or take, half of the portfolio, 45% of the portfolio is in that high-80s, mid- to high-80% occupancy."
