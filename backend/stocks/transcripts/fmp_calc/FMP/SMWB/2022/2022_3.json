And regarding the reducing force, I think that when we look at the reducing force, we were mostly adopting \u00e2\u0080\u0093 so we're trying \u00e2\u0080\u0093 the strategy there was not to protect the revenue-generating scheme in marketing sales and honoring innovation and product and \u00e2\u0080\u0093 so basically, G&A, it get hit hard, some things in R&D that have more internal and development. I think we would expect to \u00e2\u0080\u0093 as long as the market condition, what we've seen today, we probably think that looking in next year, we're going to \u00e2\u0080\u0093 we hope to look maybe too tough quarter like maybe Q1, Q2 and then we hope that Q3, Q4, there is some comeback."
