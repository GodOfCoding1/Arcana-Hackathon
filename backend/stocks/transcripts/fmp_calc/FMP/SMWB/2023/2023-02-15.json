    "content": " And I think that's one strong takeaway that we're hearing from our customers as customers went through their cost optimization, exercise it, whether that was headcount or software tools and the like, our customers are telling us that Similarweb is not that product that they're evaluating whether they need it or don't need it because we have the best data and they can't get that kind of information anywhere else, and so they're relying on us. And I think that's what you're seeing over the last couple of quarters as we've taken the right decisions on the -- to drive operational efficiency and you're seeing this quarter, you got a 25 percentage points improvement on the bottom line. And it is our intention to continue to drive that kind of profitability, and I think the first indication that you guys will continue to see is our drive to hitting sustained positive cash flow, and we look forward like we mentioned in the letter to see meaningful improvement in the cash flow already in the first half of the year compared to what it was last year for the first half of the year."
