    "content": " For Royalty Pharma this transaction not only adds another blockbuster to our portfolio as Pablo noted, but we expected to significantly enhance our long-term growth by adding at least $200 million to our adjusted cash receipts in 2025, and deliver returns consistent with our target returns for approved therapies in the high-single to low double-digit range. But as you know, I've outlined the pillars of our strategy and I think there's no question that that the business that is driving and I think will continue to drive very significant growth going forward is the synthetic royalty opportunity in front of us, which is very, very significant. One moment for questions. One moment for questions. One moment for questions. One moment for questions. One moment for questions. One moment for questions."
