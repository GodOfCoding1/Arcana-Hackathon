    "content": "   Operator: Good afternoon and welcome, everyone, to the Beyond Air Financial Results Call for the First Fiscal Quarter of 2022 Financial Results, ended June 30, 2021. We would like to move to a pivotal all-common  trial for LungFit Pro in patients hospitalized with acute viral pneumonia and anticipate starting this study in the fourth quarter of calendar year 2022, the timing of which is due to the seasonality of most respiratory viruses. We are pleased with performance of LungFit Go, especially since this is the first device designed for self-treatment by patients in a home setting in this indication and this is the first study that is using up to 250 parts per million nitric oxide to treat patients with bacterial lung infections. But if you can't, I'll provide you with the key cliff notes, nitric oxide as a monotherapy convey  tumor-immunity to the host after a single five-minute local administration of 50,000 parts per million using Beyond Air's proprietary delivery system in 11 of 11 mice. As far as the phase is concerned, we've been clear that we're going to focus in the first six to nine months on something around up to a dozen locations or hospitals and we're going to focus on the customer service logistics and service and maintenance questions that you would expect, to have that ironed out before going into the next phase."
