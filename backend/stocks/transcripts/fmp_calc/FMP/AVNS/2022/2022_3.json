    "content": " On gross margin, we delivered positive results with adjusted gross margin of over 56% driven by favorable product mix in the quarter, inclusive of OrthogenRx and our plants continuing to incrementally deliver on our manufacturing efficiency strategy we set forth at the end of last year. Although we continue to experience headwinds related to raw material availability, inflation across all manufacturing inputs and shipping and distribution costs that remain elevated, we anticipate similar fourth quarter gross margin results as we experienced in Q3, while our full year gross margin guidance of 55% to 57% remains firm. Positive trends across our Digestive Health franchise continued, bolstered by our NeoMed portfolio enjoying a record quarter, growing over 39% versus prior year, as supply improvements allowed us to maximize North American ENFit conversions. In summary, even with various macroeconomic headwinds, including inflation, currency and supply chain, we delivered a robust third quarter and are well positioned to exit the year with momentum around free cash flow generation, an active M&A pipeline and continuing to demonstrate overall margin improvement. As Joe noted, we are reaffirming our full year guidance with total net sales between $815 million and $835 million, annual gross margins in the range of 55% to 57% and ensuring full year spend remains below 40% as a percentage of revenue. So just as the second quarter, Brett, and what we indicated earlier in the year, whatever improvements we have in gross margin year-over-year, about 50% of that is going to come from OrthogenRx contribution, and 50% would come from the improved manufacturing efficiencies and other programs we're doing within the plan."
