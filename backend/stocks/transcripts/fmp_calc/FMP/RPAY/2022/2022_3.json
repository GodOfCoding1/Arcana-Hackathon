    "content": "  First, I would highlight our complete offering, which includes our TotalPay solution where we can execute supplier payments on behalf of our clients via all payment methods including check, ACH, enhanced ACH and virtual cards; AP automation, where we allow our clients to outsource their entire AP function, including our proprietary approach to supplier enablement; and lastly, merchant acquiring, where we allow our clients to accept electronic payments from other businesses in a highly integrated manner for their ERP accounting solutions such as Sage or Acumatica. Our debit card acceptance offering provides many benefits to the lender, including: accelerated payment cycle, which is the ability to lend more and faster through card processing; 24/7 payment acceptance through always open omnichannel offering; omnichannel payment methods, web, mobile, IVR and text; fewer ancillary charges, such as NSF or borrowers through automatic recurring online debit card payments; direct software integrations to embed payments into loan dealer and other workflow management systems, which reduces operational complexity for our clients."
