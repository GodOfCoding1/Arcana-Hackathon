    "content": " Because forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, they are not guarantees of future performance and actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors, including those risk factors discussed in the company\u2019s annual report on the Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021, as filed with the SEC on March 1, 2022. We\u2019re also encouraged by the increase in the number of treatment centers that have gained experience with DANYELZA with 34 treatment centers now having administered DANYELZA across the nation, up 21% compared to 28 centers by the end of last year. As you recall, we previously received a PRV for DANYELZA\u2019s approval and subsequently sold that PRV for $105 million last year. As we take a closer look at the operating expenses for the first quarter of 2022, we\u2019ll note that research and development expenses increased by $1.3 million from $21.6 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2021 to $22.9 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2022. The net income in the quarter ended March 31, 2021 included a $62 million net gain from the sale of our DANYELZA Priority Review Voucher after sharing 40% of the net proceeds from the sale with MSK as per the license agreement. In order to hit the $50 million, we need an average estimate of about 12 patients per month by the fourth quarter, and we\u2019ve been averaging about 6%."
