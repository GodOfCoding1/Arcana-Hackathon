DANYELZA product revenues for the quarter and 9 months ended September 30, 2022 were $12.5 million and $32.8 million, respectively, which represented increases of 40% and 41%, respectively, over the corresponding period in 2021. The increase in SG&A expense was primarily attributed to an $8.9 million increase in severance and share-based compensation expense related to our former Chief Executive Officer, in the 9 months ended September 30, 2022, as compared to the comparable period in 2021 and to a lesser extent, the commercialization of DANYELZA."
