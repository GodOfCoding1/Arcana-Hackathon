    "content": " We also improved our home sales gross margin by 480 basis points, which all translated to net income of $20 million or $0.49 per diluted share, a 130% increase over the third quarter of 2021. As I mentioned, we have 1,285 homes in backlog, worth a little over $740 million in value, a volume increase of 18% over third quarter last year and a 22% increase in dollar value. As John and Mike said, we are pleased with the results this quarter, delivering $335.6 million in revenues, a 57% improvement over third quarter of last year, putting us past the $1 billion mark for the year. The improvement in revenues was driven by a 9% year-over-year increase in our average selling price to $601,000 and home deliveries of 543, a 43% increase over third quarter last year. Our tax expense for the third quarter was $4 million, which represents an effective tax rate of 16%, reflecting the inclusion of the federal energy-efficient home credits, which were extended as part of the Inflation Reduction Act that was enacted into law in August of this year. The strong top line growth, improved operating margin and lower tax rate helped drive an 85% increase in net income compared to the third quarter of last year to $20 million or 49% - $0.49 per diluted share. Your line is open. Your line is open. Alex, this is John. Your line is open. Your line is open. Alex, this is John. Alex, this is John. Your line is open."
