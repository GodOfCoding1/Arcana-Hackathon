    "content": " Landsea Homes delivered another quarter of strong profitability, generating earnings of $0.34 per diluted share for the period, representing a 48% increase over the second quarter of 2021. Home sales revenue grew 46% year-over-year to $351 million, driven by a 35% increase in new home deliveries, and a 9% increase to our average selling price. Our SG&A as a percentage of home sales revenue increased year-over-year as we worked during the quarter to rightsize the integration of our Hanover acquisition, including creating synergies through combining our Florida operations, transitioning from the Hanover founders to a new division President, rebranding all of the communities to Landsea Homes and ensuring staffing and marketing are appropriate for the closing schedule for the balance of the year. For the full year, we are updating our guidance in anticipation of current market conditions and now expect the new range of new home deliveries to be between 2,500 and 2,700 homes delivery ASPs to be in the range of $525,000 to $550,000 and home sales gross margins to be in the range of 20% to 22% on a GAAP basis or 24% to 26% on an adjusted basis."
