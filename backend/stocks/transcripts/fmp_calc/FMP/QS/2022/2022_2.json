Despite the lower CapEx spend in 2022, we remain focused on achieving our goals for the year, including delivery of A sample prototype cells to a customer, demonstration of a cell format designed to accommodate lithium plating and stripping, scale up of peak film starts to 8,000 per week, and taking delivery of the majority of QS-0 equipment toward a 2023 line start. And we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re actually, as you point out, quite pleased to have those first 24-layer cells on test already today in July, and that gives us a number of months to refine the design, incorporate any improvements and still be able to make the A-sample target for the end of the year."
