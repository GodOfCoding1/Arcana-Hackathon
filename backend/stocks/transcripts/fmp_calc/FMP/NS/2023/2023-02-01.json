    "content": " We generated $197 million of total adjusted EBITDA in the fourth quarter, 16% higher than adjusted EBITDA in the fourth quarter of '21, and the highest fourth quarter in NuStar's history. Our pipeline segment EBITDA was up in the fourth quarter by 18% over the same period in '21, thanks in large part to the continued strong performance of our Permian Crude System. We generated higher adjusted full-year EBITDA for 2022, through a combination of revenue improvement and expense optimization, which helped mitigate some of the impact of 2022's historic inflation, and by continuing to high-grade our capital spending program, we were once again able to self-fund our business, including our capital spending and our growth footprint in the Permian and on the West Coast. In the fourth quarter of '22, our Pipeline segment generated $176 million of EBITDA, up $27 million or 18% over fourth quarter '21 EBITDA, of $149 million, largely from a strong performance of our Permian Crude System as Brad described earlier. And for our Fuels Marketing segment, EBITDA was $12 million, up $7 million from fourth quarter '21, partly due to stronger margins. And by investing that increased cash flow in our growth footprint, we're already on the path to compounding those benefits, with the EBITDA growth we expect from organic capital projects on our Permian System and in our West Coast Renewables networks, as well as the projects we hope to announce later this year across our ammonia system."
