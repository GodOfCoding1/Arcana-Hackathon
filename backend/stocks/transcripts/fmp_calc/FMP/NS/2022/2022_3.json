    "content": " After taking into account the impact of our sale of the Eastern US terminal facilities in late 2021 and our sale of Point Tupper in April, we generated 6% higher EBITDA in third quarter 2022 than adjusted EBITDA in third quarter 2021. In other words, excluding the assets we sold in 2021 and earlier this year, our third quarter EBITDA was up $9 million. In the third quarter 2022 our Pipeline segment generated $155 million of EBITDA, up $10 million or 7% over 3Q 2021 adjusted EBITDA of $145 million, largely from the strong performance of our Permian crude system, as Brad described earlier. At the end of the third quarter 2022, our total debt balance was $3.1 billion and by continuing to pay down our revolving credit facility balance last quarter, we increased our facility availability to $993 million, the facility's $1 billion capacity. We ended the third quarter 2022 with a debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 3.79 times, which has substantially improved compared to 3Q 2021 when our metric was just above four times and also improved from last quarter's 3.93 times. We're seeing some headwinds at St. James due to the market structure and volatility, but luckily since we've sold so many terminal assets in the last couple of years, that's really the only storage facility we have left that's susceptible to the market structure influences."
