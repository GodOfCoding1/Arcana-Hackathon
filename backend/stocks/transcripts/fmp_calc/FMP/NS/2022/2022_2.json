    "content": " Through, the growth we've seen so far this year and what we expect for the rest of the year, based on our producers' drilling plans, we continue to expect to exit 2022 between 560,000 to 570,000 barrels per day or about 10% above our 2021 exit. Moving on from the Permian to our refined product pipeline systems, even though some short-term operational issues at customer refineries reduced our Q2 volumes compared to Q2 2021, our refined product volumes this past quarter were up compared to the first quarter of 2022. In the second quarter of 2022, our Pipeline segment generated $145 million of EBITDA, up $4 million or 3% over the second quarter of 2021 EBITDA of $142 million, largely from strong performance from our Permian Crude System, as Brad described earlier. Our EBITDA for the second quarter 2022 was $49 million, which is about $11 million lower compared to 2Q of 2021 when our adjustment for our asset sales."
