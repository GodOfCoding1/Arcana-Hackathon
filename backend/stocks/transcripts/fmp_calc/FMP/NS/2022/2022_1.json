    "content": " But when we compare our first quarter 2022 adjusted EBITDA with the EBITDA generated from those same assets in the first quarter of '21, in other words, backing out the Eastern U.S. terminals, our first quarter 2022 adjusted EBITDA was up $12 million or 7% higher than Q1 of '21. Compared to the first quarter of 2021, excluding the contribution of our divested Eastern U.S. terminals, our storage segment's adjusted EBITDA was about $9 million lower due to timing of customer transitions and tank maintenance at certain terminals during the quarter as well as insurance proceeds we recovered in Q1 of '21 for our Selby terminal."
