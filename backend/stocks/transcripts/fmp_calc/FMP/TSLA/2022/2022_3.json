Yes, like I said, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re -- like I said earlier, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to go basically pedal to the metal as fast as humanly possible to get to 1,000 gigawatt hours a year of production in the U.S. vertically integrated. Actually one caveat, I should say, growing production by 50% every year because deliveries -- we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re trying to smooth out the deliveries and not have this crazy delivery rate at the end of every quarter, so. And like I said, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re -- our goal is to strive towards 1,000 gigawatt hours a year of annualized production in United States alone by Tesla, not including , will be on top of that. So that also -- we actually see the energy storage business, stationary storage, growing more like 150% to 200% a year, faster than cars by a lot. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you very much."
