    "content": " Similar to fourth quarter, over-the-air local spot increased 7.7%, while national was down 7.5%, including net political revenue of approximately $7.5 million. Looking at previous quarters as well as the last few years, national has been trending down and has decreased from almost 21% of total revenue in 2019 to 12.2% in fourth quarter and to 14.2% for the full year of '22, and this is ex political. As Caroline mentioned, fourth quarter net revenue increased 1.8% or $1.3 million to $72 million, which includes $784,000 from our two esports teams as well as $900,000 from Guarantee Digital, which is our second quarter agency acquisition. Excluding political, fourth quarter revenue declined 4.8% or $3.4 million due to the decline in national. And excluding political, revenue increased 3.5% or $8.4 million, reflecting our outperformance in local and digital revenue. Station operating expenses for the quarter increased $1.3 million or 2.2% to $58.1 million, resulting in fourth quarter SOI of $13.9 million, marking a slight year-over-year increase. Full year operating expenses rose 6.9% or $13.8 million, driven by an increased cost of sales of approximately $4.3 million, a $2.6 million variance from a bad debt reduction taken in 2021 and the addition of Guarantee Digital of $2 million of new expenses. Full year corporate G&A increased 8.6% or $1.4 million to $18 million, primarily related to corporate digital expenses."
