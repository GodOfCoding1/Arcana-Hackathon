    "content": " Now breaking that down, over-the-air local spot revenue increased 1% or by $275,000 while national revenue declined 8.7% or by $1.2 million, and that includes the benefit of $1.9 million in political. Similar to previous quarters, new business initiatives, sports betting, political and a $1.9 million year-over-year increase in digital revenue were the primary drivers that offset the continued national revenue decline. Now to dig into that a bit, national, excluding political, was down 20% or $2.7 million for the quarter, and it now accounts for about 15% of our total revenue. We recorded $3.8 million in revenue or 6% of total revenue in this category during the quarter, which was driven by Detroit, Philly and New Jersey clusters. Third quarter net revenue increased 1.5% or $921,000 to $63.8 million, which includes $586,000 from our 2 esports teams as well as $1.1 million from Guarantee Digital, our second quarter agency acquisition. We grew revenue year-over-year in all but 2 of our markets, and we generated approximately $1.9 million in net political revenue in third quarter compared to $258,000 last year. Station operating expenses for the quarter increased $326,000 or 0.6% to $51.5 million, resulting in third quarter SOI of $12.3 million, a year-over-year increase of approximately $600,000. Third quarter 2022 operating income declined $170,000 to a negative $4.7 million compared to a negative $4.9 million in the year ago quarter, driven by the increase in corporate expense, mostly offset by an increase in station operating income."
