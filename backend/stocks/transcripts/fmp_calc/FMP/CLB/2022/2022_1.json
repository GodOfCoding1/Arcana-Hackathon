    "content": " For the first quarter of 2022, Core Lab's year-over-year revenue increased by 6%. For the remainder of 2022, we expect continued improvement in both business segments in both the U.S. and most international arenas, although the conflict in Ukraine and the collateral impact on Core's European and Russian operations now pose headwinds to year-over-year growth expectations in those areas. Additionally, the financial results for the first quarter of 2022 include a charge of $3.9 million for noncash stock compensation expense associated with the future vesting of performance shares for certain employees who have reached their eligible retirement age. So now looking at the income statement, revenue from continuing operations was $115.3 million in the first quarter, down approximately 7.9% from $125.1 million in the prior quarter, but up 6.4% year-over-year. Product sales, which is equally tied to U.S. and international activity, were $30.6 million for the quarter, down 14.7% sequentially but up over 25% from last year. For the second quarter of 2022, Core projects our business to improve, primarily from increasing levels -- activity levels in the U.S. and moderate improvement in international, offshore and deepwater markets, potentially offset by uncertainties associated with the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Core projects second quarter 2022 revenue to range from $119 million to $125 million and operating income of $9.4 million to $11.8 million, yielding operating margins of approximately 9%. Along with these recent announcements on carbon capture and sequestration opportunities, during the first quarter of 2022, Core, under the direction of the CarbonNet Project, commenced the next phase of advanced laboratory testing on conventional core extracted from the Gular appraisal well located in the Gippsland Basin offshore Southeast Australia."
