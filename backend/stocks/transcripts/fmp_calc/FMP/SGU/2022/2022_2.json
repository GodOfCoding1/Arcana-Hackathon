    "content": " For the quarter, our home heating oil and propane volume decreased by 9 million gallons or about 5.5% to 149 million gallons as the additional volume provided from somewhat colder temperatures and acquisitions was more than offset by net customer attrition and other factors. Adjusted EBITDA decreased by $12 million to $108 million as the impact of a decline in home heating oil and propane volume of 9 million gallons and higher operating expenses more than offset an increase in home heating oil and propane per gallon margins. Our home heating oil and propane volume decreased by 11 million gallons or 4.5% to 236 million gallons as the additional volume provided from acquisitions was reduced by slightly warmer temperatures, net customer attrition and other factors. Our product gross profit increased by $3 million or 1% to $357 million as higher home heating oil and propane margins of $0.066 per gallon or 5%, and higher motor fuel gross profit, more than offset the decline in home heating oil and propane volume. Adjusted EBITDA decreased by $13 million to $152 million as the impact of the decline in home heating oil and propane volume of 11 million gallons and higher operating expenses more than offset an increase in home heating oil and propane per gallon margins of $0.066 or 5%."
