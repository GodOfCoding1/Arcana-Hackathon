    "content": " For the fiscal 2022 third quarter, our home heating oil and propane volume increased by 3 million gallons or 7% to 41 million gallons as the additional volume provided from acquisitions and other factors were more than offset by the \u00e2\u0080\u0093 more than offset the impact of net customer attrition. Our gross profit increased by $8 million or 14% to $67 million due largely due to higher home heating oil and propane volume as well as higher per gallon margins across all liquid products sold. Delivery, branch and G&A expense increased by $9 million or 11% to $90 million, reflecting additional costs from acquisitions of $1 million, an increase in credit card fees, vehicle fuels and reserves for doubtful accounts totaling an aggregate $5 million, and a $3 million or 4% increase in other areas in the base business. The adjusted EBITDA loss rose by $1.2 million to a loss of $11 million as an increase in operating expenses more than offset the impact from higher home heating oil and propane volume and the increase in per gallon margins. Our product gross profit increased by $11 million or 3% as an increase in per gallon margins, again, more than offset the decline in home heating oil and propane volume. Operating expenses did rise by $24 million, reflecting a $2 million lower benefit from our weather hedge program, additional costs from acquisitions of $4 million and an $18 million or 7% increase in expenses within the base business. Higher petroleum costs drove an increase again in credit card fees, the reserve for doubtful accounts and higher vehicle fuels totaling $9 million. Year-to-date adjusted EBITDA decreased by $14 million to $141 million as a decline in home heating oil and propane volume and an increase in operating expenses did more than offset the impact from higher per gallon margins."
