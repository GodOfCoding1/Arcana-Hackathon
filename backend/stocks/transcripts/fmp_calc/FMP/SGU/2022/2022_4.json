    "content": " For the fiscal 2022 fourth quarter, our home heating oil and propane volume decreased by 1.5 million gallons, or about 7% to 19 million gallons as the additional volume provided from acquisitions was more than offset by the impact of net customer attrition and other factors. The adjusted EBITDA loss rose by $3 million to a loss of $31 million reflecting lower sales volume, a 2.4% decline in home heating oil and propane per gallon margins, and an increase in operating cost of 2%. For fiscal 2022, our home heating oil and propane volume decreased by 10 million gallons or 3% to 296 million gallons at slightly warmer temperatures, net customer attrition, and other factors more than offset the impact from acquisitions. Operating expenses did rise by $26 million, reflecting a $2 million lower benefit recorded on the company's weather hedge program, additional costs from acquisitions of $5 million, and an $18 million or 6% increase in expenses within the base business. Net income declined by $52 million to $35 million as an unfavorable again, non-cash change in the fair value of derivative instruments of $53 million and a decrease in adjusted EBITDA of $17.6 million was only slightly offset by decrease in the company's income tax expense of $20 million. Adjusted EBITDA for fiscal 2022 declined by $17.6 million to $110 million as lower home heating oil and propane volumes sold and an increase in operating expenses more than offset the impact from higher per gallon margins."
