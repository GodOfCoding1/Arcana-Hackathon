    "content": " Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the company's expectations are disclosed in this conference call, the company's annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021, and the company's other filings with the SEC. Despite the company facing temperatures that were 6.3% warmer than last year and 18.6% warmer than normal negatively impacting demand, I'm pleased with the overall performance of the first quarter of fiscal 2022. For the quarter, our home heating oil and propane volume decreased by 2.5 million gallons or approximately 3% to 87 million gallons, as the additional volume provided from acquisitions and other factors was more than offset by the impact of warmer temperatures and net customer attrition."
