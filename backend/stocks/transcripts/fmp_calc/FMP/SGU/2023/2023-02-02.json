    "content": " We were well prepared for the start of the heating season and I'm pleased with our overall performance, which included delivering adjusted EBITDA that was $4.6 million higher than the same period a year ago, as well as an encouraging net gain in accounts. Our product gross profit did rise by $14 million, or 10%, to $151 million reflecting an increase in per gallon margins in the higher home heating oil and propane volume. As of December 31, 2022, we also recorded an expense of $400,000 under our weather hedge reflecting the colder weather versus a benefit of $2.2 million recorded during the prior year period, representing an increase in operating cost of $2.6 million. Net income decreased by $1 million to $13.5 million, largely due to the after-tax impact of the unfavorable non-cash change in the fair value of derivative instruments of $4 million and an increase in net interest expense of $2 million, partially offset by higher adjusted EBITDA of $4.6 million. Adjusted EBITDA rose by $4.6 million to $49 million reflecting the higher home heating oil and propane volume, and an increase in per gallon margins more than offsetting higher operating costs."
