    "content": " As a next step, we plan to submit data to regulatory agencies from our ongoing trial in age six months to four years in the first quarter of 2023 to extend accept to our Omicron adapted bivalent vaccine to young children. We have updated our full year 2022 order book and now expect to invoice up to 2.1 billion doses this year, reflecting some rephasing of deliveries to early 2023 due to supply availabilities and projected uptake of our variant-adapted vaccines. On the COVID-19 vaccine market, Moderna has talked about how they expect the COVID-booster market to be in the range of 500 million to 600 million doses per year, not unlike flu, but potentially a bit below that in 2023, and working up to that 500 million to 600 million thereafter. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open."
