    "content": " To this end, we were able to improve the efficiency of our marketing investments in the second quarter while acquiring nearly as many new customers in the second quarter than in all of 2019. As you can see on Slide 17, a number of factors drove the 43% active customer growth, including acquiring a record number of new customers in the quarter and a high retention of existing customers who, in many cases, continue to transact with us over many years. Our balance sheet provides us significant flexibility to execute on our main growth drivers of acquiring new customers at highly attractive unit economics, expanding corridors in new geographies, enabling a world-class remittance experience and building complementary new products for immigrants and their families. And so there's a store value aspect with Passbook in that, obviously, but you, I think, should expect us to think about that more broadly in terms of other problems that are adjacent to remittances to deepen the relationship with the now 3.4 million customers and rapidly growing remittance customers to establish that long-term relationship with them and looking forward to being able to share more in the future as we launch products in that space."
