    "content": " A key driver of our strong results in the fourth quarter was the efficiencies we deliver in our new customer acquisition marketing, as we made a deliberate effort to drive even more higher returns in our marketing spending, while still acquiring a record number of new customers. We're excited to be able to accelerate adjusted EBITDA profitability to 2023 on the back of a strong fourth quarter as we continue to prioritize growth, but increase our focus on efficiencies, while continuing to make investments that we expect to deliver high returns for the long term. One moment for our next question. In terms of your question around the expense, first of all I just want to reinforce again that we have a lot of resiliency in our customers and we've been through multiple cycles where we've seen continued active customer activity growth, even in cycles around sort of environments that are similar to what we're talking about now. One moment for our next question. One moment for our next question. But we're doing this for the long term, so 2023 strong revenue growth that's in our guidance, and break even at $10 million of EBITDA profitability, but really focused on continuing making investments for long term. One moment for our next question. One moment for our next question. One moment for our next question. One moment for our next question."
