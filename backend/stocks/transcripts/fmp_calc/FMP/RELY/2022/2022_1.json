    "content": " In order to continue capturing a disproportionate share of our TAM, we are making focused investments in four areas, as you can see on Slide 9: marketing, which drives our acquisition of new customers at highly attractive unit economics; our global network, which provides scale and additional options for customers; our product technology, which allows us to differentiate from our competitors; and finally, new products and services to serve immigrants and their families. Turning to Slide 19, the robust growth in active customers, stable take rates, and high retention drove the 49% revenue growth that we delivered in the quarter, as we continue our multiyear track record of healthy double digit revenue growth at scale. Turning to costs on Slide 20, the first quarter reflects the leverage we\u2019re seeing in transaction expense and the impact of the investments we are making to drive future growth. We expect to see a modest ongoing improvement in transaction expense as a percentage of revenue in 2022, as we\u2019ll continue to benefit from increasing scale and improve precision around fraud losses, although we expect some variability quarter-to-quarter."
