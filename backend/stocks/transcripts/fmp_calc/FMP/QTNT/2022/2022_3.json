    "content": " Our cash and cash short-term investments as of December 31, 2021, was $103.8 million which enables us to continue to support the MosaiQ pipeline development and commercialization efforts. Fiscal third quarter product sales were $10.2 million, an increase of 16% from last year's third quarter. Excluding the impact of a $2.5 million impairment of MosaiQ inventory, gross margins would have improved to 47% versus 43% in the prior year. Year-to-date, total product sales of $28.5 million increased by 9% versus prior year, with Alba by Quotient sales increasing by 13%. Sales and marketing expenses of $2.9 million increased $595,000 from the prior year's third quarter, reflecting the preparation of the commercial launch of the company's extended immunohematology IH menu for donor labs. We estimate that cash used for operations for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2022 will be in the range of $6.5 million to $7.5 million per month, excluding debt service costs and capital expenditures. We know it's going to cost us -- I think if we look at the first line that we did, it's going to cost us over $15 million."
