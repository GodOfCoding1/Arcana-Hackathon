    "content": " Operating expenses were $30.7 million in the fourth quarter fiscal year 2022, a decrease of $2.2 million over the prior year. Sales and marketing expenses were $3 million in the fourth quarter, representing a $0.1 million decrease compared to the prior year's fourth quarter. This compares to interest expense of $7.2 million, a $2.3 million loss in the impairment of Credit Suisse Supply Chain Funds, and a foreign exchange loss of $1.1 million in last year's fourth quarter. Our net loss for the quarter was $25.9 million or 0.25 per ordinary share, compared to $39.3 million or $0.40 per ordinary share in the prior year's fourth quarter. In addition, last year's cash flow was positively impacted by the Ortho upfront payment of $7.5 million. Moving to the balance sheet, available cash, cash equivalents and investments at the 31st of March 2022 was at $83.2 million compared to $111.7 million at the start of fiscal year 2022. So look, the way to look at the current immunohematology and the tenders that we've outlined, look, if we look at immunohematology overall, it's about $300 million market. If we look at the EU, it's about $100 million and 60% of that is the tenders that we're discussing. So yes, we're very excited with the expertise of Theradiag and the expertise that we have on microarrays, it just represents a significant opportunity again to leverage the capabilities of assay development, control development of Theradiag which again is just basically giving us access to this $2 billion opportunity for autoimmune and then also of course that is just the platform to start the autoimmune and then give us access to other clinical applications like allergy that we'd identified that also become significant opportunity for us."
