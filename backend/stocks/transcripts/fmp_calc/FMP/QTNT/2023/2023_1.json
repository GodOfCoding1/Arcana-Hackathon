    "content": "  Good morning, everybody, and welcome to Quotient's first quarter fiscal year 2023 financial results, as well as the business update. In the first quarter of fiscal 2023, we secured $1.4 million in bookings and generated $0.4 million in revenue for our recently CE Marked extended immunohematology MosaiQ solution. Fiscal first quarter sales were $8.8 million, a decrease of 3.3% from last year's first quarter. The Alba reagent business generated product sales of $8.4 million in the first quarter of fiscal year 2023, down by 6% year-over-year. The decrease in gross margins was primarily driven by lower sales in the quarter, $0.4 million in write-offs for stock at the end of its shelf life, $0.2 million of write-downs of raw materials and in-process inventory associated with MosaiQ to net realizable value and $0.3 million in increased costs for logistics -- production costs. Operating expenses were $28.5 million in the first quarter fiscal 2023, an increase of $2.3 million or 9% compared to the first quarter of the prior fiscal year. Sales and marketing expenses were $3.3 million in the first quarter, representing a $0.8 million increase compared to the prior year's first quarter. Finally, we expect cash used for operations for fiscal year 2023 will be in the range of $6.5 million to $7.5 million per month excluding debt service costs and capital expenditures."
