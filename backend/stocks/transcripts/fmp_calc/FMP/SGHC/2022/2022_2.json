    "content": " Our result for this quarter of net gaming revenue of \u00e2\u0082\u00ac316 million and adjusted EBITDA of \u00e2\u0082\u00ac54 million, and for the half year of net gaming revenue of \u00e2\u0082\u00ac631 million and adjusted EBITDA of \u00e2\u0082\u00ac117 million remain resilient despite the impact of the normalization of entertainment spending patterns post COVID and the current headwind effects of general economic uncertainty on discretionary spending. Compared to Q2 last year, sports book revenue increased by $6 million or 6%, mainly due to good growth in key markets in Africa and APAC regions, despite being partially offset by declines in Europe and Canada. Just curious \u00e2\u0080\u0093 sorry again Neal if you mentioned this, but just where you are in closing that transaction and then maybe just re-examine \u00e2\u0080\u0093 given everything that's changed so fast in terms of the macro conditions, how are you thinking about in hearing the U.S. market today you know versus six months or a year ago and how you think about the impact to your \u00e2\u0080\u009823 numbers? In terms of the 2023 targets \u00e2\u0080\u0093 in terms of the 2023 numbers, we expect the range of impact to EBITDA assuming that DGC was in the Super Group for the whole year to be between \u00e2\u0082\u00ac50 million and \u00e2\u0082\u00ac70 million, with our target breakeven for the end of 2024 beginning of 2025."
