    "content": " We'll focus on the full half year but first on Q1, you probably have seen that and remember that JYSELECA was approved in the U.K. and Japan in -- for UC and that practice U started on all JAK inhibitors and we'll come back to that later on. And lastly, noteworthy for everyone, we'll have Phase III top line data in the first half of next year in Crohn's disease and that should hopefully enable us to make an extra indication part of the life cycle of JYSELECA. And on the next slide, you see the quarterly sales as of basically the very first quarter when we were in the market at the time of beginning in Germany in the Q1 '21 up until now in the second quarter of 2022, where we've reached a level of \u00e2\u0082\u00ac21 million of revenues in the quarter with a good quarter-on-quarter growth compared to the first quarter of the year. We -- first, we will focus on real added value which is very logic but addressing medical needs with highly differentiated compounds and then look at the competitive market on where are we on a global base and see then how we can in that market make competitive products which create significant value."
