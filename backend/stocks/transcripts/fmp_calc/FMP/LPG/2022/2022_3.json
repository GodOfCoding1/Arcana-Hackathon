    "content": " Notably, we also have returned capital by way of our second $1 per share dividend which was paid in January and with our new building order and time charter dual fuel new ships in 2023, we are well positioned with fleet renewal flexibility. For the third quarter we achieved a total utilization of 98.5%, which was up from 95.7% in the September quarter, with a daily TCE, that's TCE revenue over operating days as defined in our filings, of $33,508, yielding utilization adjusted TCE, which is TCE revenue per available day, of about $33,019. Looking at the Helios Pool as a separate entity, the pool reported a spot TCE including COAs of roughly $33,414 per available day for the quarter. Total G&A for the quarter was $5.9 million and cash G&A, SG&A excluding non-cash compensation expense, was about $5.2 million, which was down $400,000 from the previous quarter. On that basis, total cash interest expense for the quarter, excluding $900,000 associated with the repurchase of the Captain John, was $5.2 million, which was down about $300,000 from the prior quarter. Taking account of the payoff of these two vessels and the refinancing of the Constellation and the Commander, we expect to have about $5 million of cash interest expense this quarter on the new capital structure and about $1 million of amounts related to the Captain Nicholas that will not recur in this quarter after the payoff. The average spread for bunker supply between the Port of Singapore, Rotterdam, Houston and Fujairah recently stood at about $150 per metric ton and our scrubber vessels have benefited from the relatively lower high sulfur fuel oil prices versus the very low sulfur fuel oil pricing, which rose faster in response to the crude oil price increases."
