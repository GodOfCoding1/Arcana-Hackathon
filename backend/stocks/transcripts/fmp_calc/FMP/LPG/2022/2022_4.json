    "content": " Turning to our fourth quarter chartering results, we achieved the total utilization of 89.3% for the quarter with a daily TCE, that's TCE revenue over operating days of $43,372, which yields a utilization adjusted TCE, that's TCE revenue per available day of about $38,750. Last quarter's geopolitical events of war in the Ukraine, the Russian oil embargo and position of economic sanctions and increased risk of recession to the world economies have caused volatility in the world financial markets, which have resulted in a significant increase in crude oil and gas prices, due to supply dislocations and anticipated fuel shortages for most of the European countries. The average spread differentials for bunker supply at the ports of Singapore, Rotterdam, Houston and Fujairah for low-sulfur fuel oil and high-sulfur fuel oil have progressively widened during that time from about $150 a ton to about $200 per metric ton at the end of the quarter and to about $230 currently."
