    "content": " As a result of strong organic membership growth within our core IPAs, a more favorable membership mix and participation in a value-based care model for the Medicare fee-for-service population, capitated revenue grew 57% year-over-year allowing us to achieve a 54% increase in total revenue, reporting $269.7 million for the three months ended June 30, 2022. We continue to deliver strong results reporting total revenue of $269.7 million in the second quarter of 2022, a 54% increase from $175.6 million in the prior year quarter. Capitation revenue increased 57% to $227.6 million during the period, accounting for 84% of total revenue for the quarter ended June 30, 2022. Fee-for-service revenue increased 154% to $11.7 million from $4.6 million in the prior year quarter, along with increased visits to our surgery center, which were partially closed in the prior year due to COVID-19, the consolidation of Sun Labs and DMG contributed $5.8 million during this period. The adjusted EBITDA dust figure for Q2 2022 backs out the impact of the non-cash unrealized loss of $1.9 million as a result of a decrease in fair value related to the passive investment in a payer partner's shares held as marketable securities and other investments, which compares to $83.8 million in unrealized gains as a result of a one to three conversion of a payer partner's preferred shares to come in stock in the prior year period."
