    "content": " We ended the fourth quarter with $127 million in revenue, bringing our full year revenue to $450 million representing growth of 20% over the prior year. This resulted in 26% year-over-year growth in clinical revenue in the fourth quarter, which was led by Guardant360 with increasing contribution from new products. Total revenue for the fourth quarter of 2022 was $126.9 million, up 17% from $108.1 million in the prior year quarter. Total precision oncology testing revenue for the fourth quarter was $113.8 million, increasing 28% compared to $88.7 million in the prior year quarter. Precision oncology revenue from clinical tests was $83.7 million, up 13% from $64.2 million for the prior year quarter. Precision oncology revenue from biopharma tests in the fourth quarter totaled $30.1 million, up 23% from $24.5 million in the prior year quarter. Development services and other revenue in the fourth quarter totaled $13.1 million, down 33% from the prior year quarter, primarily due to a onetime catch-up royalty payment that was received in the fourth quarter of 2021, which increased the comparison base. Precision oncology revenue increased 29% to $392.0 million and was comprised of clinical testing revenue of $298.1 million, which grew 26% year-over-year and biopharma testing revenue of $94.0 million, which increased 38% year-over-year. Non-GAAP operating expenses for the fourth quarter of 2022 were $201.2 million, a 37% increase from $146.2 million in the prior year quarter. Non-GAAP operating expenses for the full year 2022 was $736.6 million, a 45% increase from $506.8 million in the prior year quarter. We expect full year 2023 revenue to be in the range of $525 million to $540 million, representing growth of approximately 17% to 20% compared to 2022. Finally, as previously discussed, we expect 2023 operating expenses to be below full year 2022, and free cash outflow to improve to $350 million in 2023 and to further improve in the following years."
