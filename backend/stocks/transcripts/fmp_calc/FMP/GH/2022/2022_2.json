    "content": " We ended the second quarter with record revenue of $109 million, up 19% over the prior year quarter. Total revenue in the second quarter of 2022 was $109.1 million, up 19% from $92.1 million in the prior year quarter. Total precision oncology testing revenue for the second quarter was $92.1 million, with growth of 27% compared to $72.6 million in the prior year quarter. Precision oncology revenue from clinical tests was $70.5 million, up 15% from $61.1 million for the prior year quarter. Note that in the second quarter 2021, clinical revenue included a $9.6 million true-up, representing cash received for tests performed in prior periods, where the total cash received for those tests exceeded the total revenue that had previously been recognized. Because our ability to estimate revenue has improved, the second quarter of 2022 included only $1.6 million of cash true-up relating to prior period tests. Second quarter clinical test volume was 29,300 which is an increase of 40% from the same period of the prior year, as well as strong Guardant360 growth our new products reveal tissue next and response again contributed to the growth for the quarter. For the second quarter 2022, the ASP for Guardant360 was in the range $2,600 to $2,700 which is consistent with the last few quarters and the blended clinical ASP was approximately $2,400 the blended clinical ASP will continue to be influenced by both the volume mix of Gaurdant360 new products as well as the reimbursement for new products. Precision oncology revenue from biopharma test in the second quarter totaled $21.6 million, up 87% from $11.6 million for the prior year quarter. Biopharma sample ASP in the second quarter was approximately $3,600, up 14% from the prior year period was in line with the prior quarter due to a similar product mix. Non-GAAP operating expenses for the second quarter of 2022 were $176.2 million, a 41% increase from $124.7 million in the prior year quarter. Despite the revision to our clinical volume growth expectations, we expect precision oncology testing revenue to grow by approximately 35% over the prior year as we expect second half tailwinds from the real Medicare reimbursement and the continued strength of our biopharma business. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. We've had this ASP of $2,600 to $2,700 now pretty consistently for the last few quarters and the potential it could go up if we get some of the larger private payers to start covering Guardant360 and CGP in terms of as a base case we will probably say for next year it's going to remain the same. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. Your line is now open."
