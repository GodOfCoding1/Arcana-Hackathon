    "content": " We continue to see total prescription growth for JATENZO in the first quarter of 2022, with an increase of 12% sequentially, and 75% year-over-year, driven primarily by advertising and promotion, and an increase in payer coverage across all payer channels. Total prescription growth for JATENZO in the first quarter increased 12% sequentially, and 75% year-over-year driven primarily by advertising and promotional increase in payer coverage across all payer channels. We believe that this will increase our TRT market share and will raise the awareness of JATENZO as we are the only oral product that not only gets 87% of patients in the normal therapeutic range, but also has dosing flexibility to allow healthcare providers to find the right dose that works for their patients."
