    "content": " Led by price appreciation and a 430 basis point expansion in gross margin, our second quarter earnings of $2.73 per share increased by 44% and 59% respectively over last year's reported and adjusted earnings per share. In the second quarter of last year, our reported tax expense of $136 million, or an effective tax rate of 21.3% included a tax benefit of $12 million, and the benefit of federal energy efficient home credits, which expired as of December 31 last year. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. And I think it's all about the financial certainty that a buyer can get by being able to lock in the rate without paying a whole bunch of extra discount points, which you have to pay for a longer-term rate lock, or they're able to take the current market rate and put some incentive dollars against that and buy it down, or do a five year arm or a seven year arm or something of that nature. Your line is open. So, this is a business where you clearly need forward land, we like what we have under control, but we're not blindly rushing into every contract without given everything a second, third and a fourth look to make sure that it still makes sense, based on current market conditions, but also based on our overall land pipeline, and what we think we need to run a profitable high returning business in the future. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open."
