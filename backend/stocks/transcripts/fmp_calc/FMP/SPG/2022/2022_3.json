Presenting on today's call is David Simon, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President; also on the call are Brian McDade, Chief Financial Officer; and Adam Reuille, Chief Accounting Officer. A quick reminder that statements made during this call may be deemed forward-looking statements within the meaning of the safe harbor of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, and actual results may differ materially due to a variety of risks, uncertainties and other factors. Let me walk you through some of the variances for the quarter compared to Q3 2021, our domestic operations had a very good quarter and contributed $0.05 of growth, driven by higher rental income. Our International operations posted strong results in the quarter and increased $0.05, despite the negative currency impact, of $0.05 given the strength in the dollar. These positive contributions were partially offset by an $0.11 lower contribution from our other platform investments, which reflects costs associated with the JCPenney launch of new beauty brands, Reebok Integration costs and some softening of sales compared to 2021 from our two value oriented brands. Domestic property, net operating income increased 2.3% for the quarter, and 4.4% for the first nine-months of the year. Portfolio NOI, which includes our international properties at constant currency grew 3.2% for the quarter, and 5.5% for the first nine months of the year, occupancy ended third quarter 94.5%, an increase of 170 basis points compared to the prior year and an increase of 60 basis points, compared to the second quarter. TRG was 94.5%, average base minimum rent increase for the fourth quarter in a row and was $54.80, an increase of 1.7% year-over-year. Leasing momentum continued, we signed nearly 900 leases for more than 3 million square feet in the quarter, and have signed over 3100 leases for more than 10 million square feet through the first nine months of the year. The opening rate on our new leases has increased 10% since last year, or roughly $6 per lease, reported retail sales momentum continued, our shopper remains resilient. We've reported another record in the third quarter of $749 per square foot for the malls and outlets, which was an increase of 14% year-over-year. Mills ended up at $677 per square foot, a 15% increase, TRG was $1080 per foot, 25% increased. In the third quarter contributing $0.17 in FFO per share, as compared to $0.28 cents in the prior year period. After cash distributions received, we had approximately $475 million of net investment within our other platform investments primarily an ABG and RGG. We expect to generate approximately $300 million in FFO from OPI, that is for those of you like math is a 50% return on investment. We've recently announced our strategic partnership with Jamestown, a global real estate investment and management firm. The Jamestown team, our experienced, mixed use operators, developers, property managers and asset managers, we're pleased to expand our investment platform with this best-in-class operator and we expect to grow their asset management business and accelerate our densification opportunities. Turning to the balance sheet, we completed the refinancing of 16 property mortgages during the first nine months of the year, for a total of $1.8 billion, at an average interest rate of 4.78%. Our balance sheet is strong, with approximately $8.6 billion of liquidity. Today we announced a 9.1% increase in our common stock dividend, and we will pay $1.80 per share for the fourth quarter. Since May, we have purchased 1.8 million shares of our common stock at an average price of $98.57 per share. Given our current view, for the remainder of the year, we are increasing our full year 2022 comparable FFO guidance from $11.70 to $11.77 per share, to $11.83 per share to $11.88 per share, compared to $11.44 last year. This guidance increase comes in the face of a strong U.S. dollar, rising interest rates and inflationary pressures. Now, just let me conclude by saying we had another impressive quarter. And before we get to questions, I would like to share some thoughts with you. For nearly 30 years as a public company, like many companies and industries, we have dealt with significant shifts within our industry. In our case we embrace new challenges, and are better operators and more thoughtful and astute capital allocators. And I need not remind you, when physical retail was closed in COVID, all the naysayers saying that physical retail was gone forever. However, brick and mortar is strong -- brick and mortar retail are strong and ecommerce is flat lining. And importantly, over this period of time, we have paid out $39 billion in dividends to shareholders, as we have become stronger and more profitable. Well, because hopefully this will put an end to the so called negative mall narrative as you can't pay those dividends without a strong underlying business. Now, operator, we're ready for questions. Yes, they are -- when you do comparable space they're wildly positive. Well, just -- that we don't report spreads but they're wildly positive, when you focus on comparable space. Our next question is from Alexander Goldfarb of Piper Sandler, please go ahead. Good morning out there, David. Hey, so, one, appreciate the continued disclosure of the different platforms, the core, the International, Clay, PR and the brands. Because I think one of the questions that certainly comes up, is, hey, retailers have a bad print, oh, that's negative for the landlord's. But that doesn't seem to be the case of, accepted, maybe certain circumstances. Sure, I would say, this is something we monitor every single day, in good times, bad times, mediocre times, we have yet to see any pullback in, opening new stores or renewals. So, there's been absolutely no impact. And I would tell you, Alex, that where -- they're seeing most of the pressure is in the ecommerce business. So the flight toward bricks and mortar is real, it's going to be sustained. And if they're in the retail business, and they want to grow, they're going to open stores. And it's that simple, because the returns on ecommerce just aren't quite what everybody talks about. And, so I think you've seen that, and we've seen no slowdown whatsoever, there's always going to be a deal here or there. But if they're growing retailer, they have to put the money in bricks. Highest return on investment, we understand it, as well as anybody because we see the ecommerce business, not just in the brands that we own with ABG, but also at Penney and RGG. Our next question is from Derek Johnston of Deutsche Bank, please go ahead. David, you've been doing this a long time. How do you\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\n Yes, you're right about that, you're right about that. But certainly we're facing a slowdown, high inflation, it's hitting interest rates. Well, look, you're always as any kind of CEO, you're always worried about the macro -- the macro environment. But, I will tell you, what gives me unbelievable confidence going into the next few years is, the realization that what we have been saying is that don't underestimate physical retail. And its kind of repetitive what I said earlier, but I'll just reinforce we feel really good because physical retail is where the action is. On the retail side, I -- we're trying to -- one is I don't want to make a huge deal out of it. Two, is I want people to understand we've made an unbelievable investment. So if it goes to 70% or it goes to 50, it's -- we are going to have volatility, but it's still the hell of an investment, still being a great thing for us to do, to not only understand but what it takes for retailers to be successful, but kind of where the future is. So there will be volatility in that, but our better brands in there like Brooks Brothers, Lucky Jeans, Monica, really doing well. I said to you on the last call, the lower income consumer is tightened their belt and we do have a few brands that are affected by that. But even with that said, we have an unbelievable return on investment after tax from the earnings that those businesses throw off. So, I expect those investments to pay for future earnings growth. But the macro is concerning, but look, rates will have an impact is probably the most direct impact that we'll have next year. Quick ones, if I could sneak them in. I mean, we expect to garner a lot of the percentage and overage rent to minimum rent as these leases roll, but they take time to roll over. So it's not going to happen overnight, but it will happen over time. So Look, I think we're still on track to achieve our goal -- I mean, I -- frankly, I think we've done an unbelievable job in increasing our occupancy and increasing our cash flow since the shutdowns. So hopefully, in '23, we'll get back to pre-COVID levels. And could you see that platform being acquisition vehicles, U.S. malls or Simon's the operating partner and how minority stake in the fund or investment? But they have a lot of institutional relationships as do we, and we think, our working together, we'll be able to separate account money to invest in kind of the opportunities that exist in real estate. We expect them to continue that and they look for opportunities both internationally and domestically, not in our core business, but in other forms of real estate. They have their premier fund, plus their German fund business and then our adding to that platform in terms of owning 50% of the business. I think it will be attractive for institutional and retail investors, not retail real estate investors, but retail investors to potentially want to have Jamestown invest in real estate form. David, I was heartening to hear you talk about the benefits of physical real estate over e-commerce, your perspective is always much valued on those. And obviously, sales records, tenant sales records, leasing remains strong. I guess the question I have for you is, last quarter, I think you said your SNO pipeline was around 200 basis points. Well, look, I -- we're pushing the group to achieve that next year. And Floris, I would say to you the biggest issue for us next year will be just getting our pipeline open. And a lot of these are really good retailers with really good stores, and it takes time to build them and open them. But I'm hopeful that we can do it, and we are pushing very hard to do that, which is, I think, pretty much ahead of schedule. We've added stuff and we've taken stuff out as we opened, but we're running around 200 basis points consistently. Yes -- we're not disclosing the private company, and we both chose not to disclose it. I'm sorry, Craig, you're breaking up some. And we are hopeful that over time, it's not just quantity, but there is quality involved, but there's no reason why we can't turn that into one of the bigger asset management players with their expertise and our expertise combined, their reputation and our reputation combined, we think it will be an attractive platform to raise additional funds to invest in real estate. I'm not going to put a number out there, but we didn't do it to be flat. And given the existing size, we think we can grow it with time pretty significantly. So look, we -- again, spreads -- ultimately, you see it in our minimum base rent growth. But if you -- and again, we want you to focus on cash flow growth as opposed to spreads. But if we were to track comparable space, space leases to same space, it would be wildly positive, more than the $6 per foot that I mentioned. So, we're trying just to focus everyone on occupancy, minimum rent growth, we've outlined kind of where we get the variable income where we get our contractual income. It's all in the 8-K, and it all manifests itself in the NOI. But if you were to take the subset, which is space for space that's like it's pretty damn impressive. That you're right, over the last certainly in COVID we got -- those renewals were tough that happened to show up during COVID. Then you add that to the pipeline, and that's why we feel good about next year. But unfortunately, the only negative next year will be getting stores open and getting this 200 basis point type open and operate. And that takes time because the retailers that we're doing business with want to have the proper looking, they want to have a proper look in store. That's a good question, Chris. Right now, we think the -- if we do run into a recession, actually, from the standpoint of new projects, actually, we see a slight benefit. They sound counterintuitive, but construction pricing for new projects is higher than what we want to see. So I'm hopeful that any slowdown will demonstrate will reduce cost of new construction, which we will then want to like move forward more aggressively. But again, I'm not looking forward. I hope there's not a recession, but from the standpoint of redevelopment and new development, we actually -- the counter cyclicality of cost of construction may actually be one of the side benefits that we can take advantage of. And it seems like that was up 60 basis points year-over-year, but your domestic NOI was up 2.3%. So I'm just -- and at the same time, it was \u00e2\u0080\u0093 that lease income was down modestly sequentially. I think you had less -- we had a reduction in overage rent, right, would be one of the reasons. Juan, don't forget, we mentioned that we took a charge for the legal write-off and to reduce that line item as well in the current quarter. And then we do have certainly cost containment, as you can see through the P&L. Well, we -- look, I mean strategy-wise, we always try to convert our overage rent into minimum rent. So you -- certainly, some reduction is associated with it. And then usually '21, obviously, on sales was pretty strong. And in certain cases, percent rent where we -- it's not so much the overage say, the percent of rent, we have some tenants that are just purely percent rent. They've had slower sales since '21, and that's showing up in the numbers. On the other hand, our sales are rising and the retailers focused on the higher-income consumer continue to spend, and that's good for us as it shows up in our cash flow. That's a deceleration from last quarter about 130, 140 basis points, but it sounds like there's an offset of 100 basis points from the Regal write-off. So from the last quarter, so I guess -- the question is, is this like the right rate of portfolio NOI growth that we should expect kind of going forward? Well, again, I wouldn't focus too much on quarter-over-quarter. There is volatility in our numbers because of overage rent and other factors, layoff like Regal, which is highly unusual that it would manifest itself in a material number, but it's important to point out. So look, I think you have to go back to the beginning of the year where we thought because '21 was a really banner year, and we were very conservative in our comp NOI estimate of 2%. But it's -- our comp NOI growth is going to be really strong, and we continue to expect it to grow next year as well. And we're making a tremendous amount of progress a number we were one of the few industries that were literally mandated the shutdown, and we're kind of back up and running and producing results that are pre-pandemic, which is very good to see. So what would happen -- it's still going to operate as Regal or ...\n Well, we don't know. I mean you're in bankruptcy, we -- my guess is they'll come out of bankruptcy as it's an ongoing business, but we have to wait and see. We're experts in understanding bankruptcies, but I would imagine they'll reward and some of this may come back as its pre-petitioned. There's trade-offs, we'll just have to see how it goes through bankruptcy at this point. And -- but we have yet to have a -- I think their debt and financing is, I think, just about approved or was approved. If you take a step back to look at and look at it on a kind of net economic basis, meaning regardless of is it minimum rent or income from percentage deals, as you're signing new deals, how does the net economic benefit look like versus the comments you made about the lease spread looking positive? It was really, sorry . So just talking about the lease spreads, you guys mentioned that the spreads were pretty positive this quarter. I'm just curious about the net economic impact of the renewals or new leases meaning as you convert some of the percentage deals into fixed, is the net economic benefit you're getting as good as the comments you made about spreads looking pretty positive? I mean it's -- yes, because we obviously take into account our existing income stream from that space, which includes if we have average 1% rent. So as an example, our -- when we disclosed it historically, we included everything. Well, Taubman as an example, when they did their rent spreads, they included some assumption on overage. Well, when they disclosed it to their rent spreads, is that beneficial or not beneficial. I mean, to the -- so to me, it's like, hey, it all shows up in cash flow man, so you see the cash flow, see the NOI. So, that's why you guys be very careful with rent spreads. They're in some cases, take assumptions and whether you want assumptions or not, we'd rather not have assumptions. So we just say, here's the math. Minimum right, you see our overage, see the NOI next question. I'm just curious if you look at the forward leasing pipeline of new deals that you're looking at as we head into next year, what does that picture look like compared to maybe a couple of quarters ago? And tied to that, I also noticed your 2023 lease expirations didn't really budge all that much quarter-over-quarter. The stuff out there, we're very close to some of the larger accounts just takes time to do renewals, paper and all that stuff. And Ki, you said there about the 200 basis points. I have a question, a follow-up for you on the leasing. The occupancy is up 170 basis points year-over-year, but your lease income is only up about 60 basis points. My question is, when are we going to see the impact of that that occupancy gain. Well, I think you've seen it, and you'll continue to see it. So you've seen it for the first 9 months, 4.4% growth. And then as Brian mentioned earlier, and I have mentioned throughout the call, is we had this other pipeline that's basically leases that will open and start paying commencing rent in 2023. And that's why we're positive about the feeling that we'll continue to have future comp NOI growth for next year, even in the face of potential recessionary environment, okay? And I guess as a follow-on to that, if we assume expenses have to go up given what's going on with inflation and operating expenses, personnel, is it your expectation that you can grow NOI between the fourth quarter year and middle of next year? That's what I -- yes, we said we expect comp NOI growth next year. And obviously, that includes the expense side as well. But nevertheless, one more if I could squeeze in for Brian. Maybe it's a bit follow-up, but the $600 million of unsecured maturing next June, bearing interest in 2 and 3 quarters. Look, we actively monitor markets at all times, and you've seen us numerous times react ahead of maturities or at maturity. It's a change of pace to it in the morning, but we did it in hopes that you got home early enough to trick or treat. Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's conference."
