As Ralph noted earlier, during the fourth quarter, we executed a reduction in force as part of broader efforts to align our cost base with our 2023 strategic priorities, which include breakeven operations, we reduced our headcount by nearly 20% and recorded expenses of $200,000 related to the onetime termination benefits provided to impacted employees."
