    "content": " Adjusting for these items, pre-tax pre-provision income for the quarter was up $770,000 or 3.9% from the prior year, when we record a $541,000 benefit for credit losses and a $1.4 million of PPP related income and fees. For the third quarter of 2022, solid organic loan growth and continued net interest margin expansion in the current rising rate environment, supported net interest income of $43.1 million, up $1.5 million from the linked quarter. Just over $6 million and $23 million of PPP loans were forgiven in the third and second quarters of 2022 respectively with the related fee accretion of $297,000 in the third quarter as compared to $756,000 in the second quarter. Non-interest income, which includes revenue from our insurance and wealth management businesses, was $12.7 million for the third quarter, up $1.3 million or 11.4% from the second quarter of 2022. Income tax expense was $4.7 million in the quarter, representing an effective tax rate of 25.4% compared to $3.9 million and an effective tax rate of 19.8% in the second quarter of 2022. On the salaries and benefits line, which is up like $1 million over the last quarter, how much of that is due to just normal wage increases versus other things that might be in there like I know, if I remember correctly, you guys self-insure and maybe medical expenses tend to pick up a bit in the third and fourth quarter of the year."
