    "content": " We definitely see a number of macroeconomic variables that have the potentiality to impact the labor market right now and whether you're talking about inflation or rising labor costs or the war in the Ukraine, and it's hard to predict how these variables will either directly impact or as is the case with the war in Ukraine, say, the cost of transportation indirectly impact how businesses are operating, and therefore, how they're hiring. And so if that remains the case, which it very well could, then we would expect the labor market would remain quite tight, and job openings might remain high because there's a backlog of jobs still to be filled as new jobs come open."
