    "content": " We made great strides towards building the world's best jobs marketplace, bringing both employers and job seekers together with leading-edge matching technology. With a proven flexible and profitable business model, robust balance sheet and continued focus on innovation for both sides of our marketplace, we expect to continue delivering value to employers, job seekers and shareholders through economic cycles. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. And I think from an SMB concentration standpoint, given our higher than 76% coming from the subscription side of our revenue model that's mainly driven by SMBs last quarter that concentration is probably going to make us a little bit more acutely feeling the January slowdown than potentially some others who are more enterprise-focused, but we'll see. Your line is open. Your line is open. There's a minimum amount of spend, of course, when it comes to marketing, where we already enjoy 80%-plus aided brand awareness on both job seeker and employer sides of our marketplace."
