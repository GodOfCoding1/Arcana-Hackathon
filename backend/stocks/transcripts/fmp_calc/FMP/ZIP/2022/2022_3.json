    "content": " We believe partnering and integrating with so many third-party systems has at least three benefits: first, it makes it easy for new enterprise customers to activate ZipRecruiter as a recruiting solution; second, it creates a better experience for jobseekers who never need to leave ZipRecruiter to apply to these employers jobs; and third, it represents an ever-increasing moat to competition given that implementing so many integrations has taken nearly a decade. Continued improvement in ZipRecruiter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s employer-focused features and our focus on larger enterprise customers resulted in an all-time high revenue per employer of $1,673 in Q3 \u00e2\u0080\u009822, up 33% year-over-year. And while we grow our marketplace, we are very confident in our ability to \u00e2\u0080\u0093 as it grows overall to grow the share of revenue that comes from enterprise, whereas the SMB part of the business started \u00e2\u0080\u0093 when the business started over a decade ago, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re just 2 or 3 years into really making a focused effort in our enterprise go-to-market and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got a lot of investments in flight and a lot of wood to chop there, but tons of reason for optimism and see tremendous opportunity there. And the reason there is principally sales and marketing, where we are going to be able to grow the business faster than we need to grow sales and marketing because we are already reaching such a high percentage of both employers and job seekers in the market as sort of proven by the fact that we have over 70% brand awareness among job seekers and over 80% brand awareness among employers."
