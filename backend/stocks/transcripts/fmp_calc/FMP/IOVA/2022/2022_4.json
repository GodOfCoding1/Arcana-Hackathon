    "content": " Before we start, I would like to remind everyone that statements made during this conference call will include forward-looking statements regarding Iovance\u00e2\u0080\u0099s goals, business focus, business plans and transactions, pre-commercial activities, clinical trials and results, regulatory interactions, plans and strategies, research and preclinical activities, potential future applications of our technologies, manufacturing capabilities, regulatory feedback and guidance, payer interactions, licenses and collaborations, cash position and expense guidance, and future updates. In the fourth quarter, we also reached agreement with the FDA on our recently started TILVANCE-301 Phase 3 trial, frontline advanced melanoma to serve as a registrational triad indication as well as a confirmatory study supporting full approval of lifileucel in post anti-PD-1 advanced melanoma. We are conducting 6 active clinical trials preparing to randomize patients in the frontline melanoma treatment setting and our first Phase 3 study in advancing several genetically modified TIL therapies, which Frederic will also highlight on today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s call. Our confidence in the success of TILVANCE-301 is based on results from Cohort 1a in our IOV-COM-202 trial of lifileucel in combination with pembrolizumab in ICI-na\u00c3\u00afve advanced melanoma, in addition to prior data at the NCI for TIL monotherapy in anti-PD-1 na\u00c3\u00afve melanoma generated in the pre-ICI era. Based on initial Cohort 3A positive results in patients with advanced NSCLC who are naive to ICI treatment, particularly within the treatment-naive and post-chemotherapy success, we plan to meet with FDA in 2023 to discuss data and the potential registration path for lifileucel in frontline advanced NSCLC patients. As of December 31, 2022, we held $478.3 million in cash, cash equivalents, investments and restricted cash compared to $602.1 million on December 31, 2021, taking into account proceeds raised in 2023 from our other market or ATM facility, our unaudited cash position is approximately $670 million as of February 24, 2023, which includes approximately $460 million in net proceeds raised through the ATM during the fourth quarter of \u00e2\u0080\u009822 and into the first quarter of \u00e2\u0080\u009823. Transitioning to the financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2022, our net loss for the fourth quarter 2022 was $105.3 million or $0.64 per share compared to net loss of $99.3 million or $0.63 per share for the fourth quarter of 2021. The increase in research and development expenses in the fourth quarter and full year 2022 over the prior year periods were primarily attributable to cost associated with the growth of the internal research and development team, including stock-based compensation expense as well as facility related expenses and internal research programs. The increase in general and administrative expenses in the fourth quarter and full year 2022 compared to the prior year periods were primarily attributable to cost associated with the growth of the internal general and administrative and promotional teams, including stock-based compensation expense, the build-out of the new corporate headquarter as well as pre-commercial activities."
