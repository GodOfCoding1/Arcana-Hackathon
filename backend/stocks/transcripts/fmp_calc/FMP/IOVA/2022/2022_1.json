    "content": " Before we start, I would like to remind everyone that statements made during this conference call will include forward-looking statements regarding Iovance's goals, business focus, business plans, pre-commercial activities, clinical trials and regulatory plans and results, research and preclinical activities, potential future applications of our technologies, manufacturing capabilities, regulatory feedback and guidance, payer interaction, collaboration, cash position and expense guidance and future updates. We also plan to conduct a Phase III trial of TIL in combination with pembrolizumab in frontline melanoma, where clinical data demonstrated the potential to improve patient outcomes compared with pembrolizumab alone in patients who are naive to immune checkpoint inhibitors. As we prepare to launch the first one-time cell therapy in solid tumors, we believe that our TIL platform, clinical data and people set a strong foundation to establish Iovance TIL therapy as the next class of paradigm-shifting therapies for people with cancer. Our goal is to present and publish clinical data and engage with physicians so that we can attract top centers to participate in our clinical trials, increased scientific awareness, drive patient recruitment and increased share of voice for Iovance TIL therapy within the oncology and cell therapy communities. It's an exciting time to be part of Iovance as we move towards our first BLA submission, continue our ongoing clinical trials and expand our growing TIL pipeline into new clinical trials, including the clinical trial of IOV-4001 that just posted to clinicaltrials.gov yesterday."
