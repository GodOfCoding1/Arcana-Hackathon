    "content": " Before we start, I would like to remind everyone that statements made during this conference call will include forward-looking statements regarding Iovance's goals, business focus, business plans, pre-commercial activities, clinical trials and results, regulatory interaction, plans and strategies, research and preclinical activities, potential future applications of our technologies, manufacturing capabilities, regulatory feedback and guidance, payer interaction, licenses and collaboration, cash position, and expense guidance, and future updates. The second cohort in IOV-GM1-201 is recruiting metastatic non-small cell lung cancer patients whose disease has progressed after up to three lines of prior therapy, including anti-PD-1 therapy and will also include patients with tumors with EGFR out for activating mutation. Thanks for taking the questions. Thanks for taking the questions. Thanks for taking the questions. And then kind of an addendum on the previous question with regard to the cervical cancer cohort that's reopening for enrollment, I know you can't tell me how many patients you're planning to enroll. Thanks for taking the questions. I don't think that we have sufficient information at this point yet either based on clinical data that we generated, nor on really fully understanding what the mechanism of action is that PD prior PD1 therapy might drive that explains some of the differences that have been observed mainly in melanoma really between patients that were previously treated with check inhibitors such as subpatients in cohort 2 and 4 in our C14401 study, versus patients that are checkpoint inhibitor naive."
