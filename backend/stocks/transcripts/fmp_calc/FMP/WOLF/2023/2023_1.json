    "content": " If you think about where we've come from in the last five years, from a $200 million semiconductor business back in 2017, to a global semiconductor powerhouse that is expected to generate over $1 billion of revenue in fiscal 2023 on the way to approximately $2.8 billion in fiscal 2026. We generated revenue of $241.3 million in the first fiscal quarter of 2023, which represents a 6% sequential improvement when compared to the $228 million in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2022 and growth of 54% year-over-year, driven largely by growth in all product lines and the market tailwinds Gregg referenced earlier. From a supply perspective, we expect our revenue to be impacted by lower yields in our materials business, as previously mentioned, and we are also seeing longer lead times on spare parts reducing tool availability and output in our Durham fab. But I think we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re kind of all systems go and things were very positive from bringing Mohawk Valley in the back half of the year from a revenue perspective, and that will certainly help underpin the margin expansion as well. So as you look out into the longer-term goal in 2016 and beyond, as I mentioned, Mohawk Valley, kind of 200-millimeter substrate and the power device cost structure still looks very good, but we just don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have a downtime to make a transition on the RF side as we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re sitting here today. Yes, then on the RF margin impact and if you look out into 2024 and I think, like we said earlier, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re just seeing a really a tremendous pull from the demand side and continue to see that over the \u00e2\u0080\u0093 over both the short term and the long term."
