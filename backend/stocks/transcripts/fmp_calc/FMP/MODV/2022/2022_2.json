    "content": " Revenue growth was driven by 23% growth from our mobility or nonemergency medical transportation business and 48% growth in our personal care business, which is our largest segment in our home business. Adjusted EBITDA grew 13% in the second quarter compared to last year, which was ahead of our expectations due to favorable NEMT contract repricing and a strong reimbursement environment for our personal care services. With $18 million of annual revenue, Guardian is a perfect fit for our remote patient monitoring business as the company is 100% focused on monitoring for managed care and Medicaid clients, similar to our existing business. Second quarter NEMT revenue increased approximately 23% year-over-year to approximately $449 million driven by a 14% increase in average monthly members, a 5% increase in revenue per trip and an 18% increase in trips. Given the strength in membership growth we've seen during the first half of the year, we expect NEMT revenue growth in the low double digits for the year, while NEMT adjusted EBITDA margins are expected to be towards the lower end of our long-term range of 9% to 12% due to higher purchase services per trip. For our personal care segment, we expect revenue growth in the mid-single digits for 2022 on a pro forma basis, and we expect adjusted EBITDA margin will be near the midpoint of our long-term range of 10% to 12%. As we mentioned at our Investor Day, we expect personal care revenue growth will accelerate to the high single digits through 2025 and adjusted EBITDA margin will be in the range of 10% to 12%."
