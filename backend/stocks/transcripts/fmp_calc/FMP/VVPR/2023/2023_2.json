    "content": " Welcome to the VivoPower half year results presentation for the period ended 31st of December, 2022. So at a headline level, we made very good strategic progress during the half year. This is primarily attributable to timing of project execution with one major solar project, Edenvale undertake in Australia versus two in the prior period. However, on a constant Australian dollar, U.S. dollar exchange rate basis, our revenue decrease was reduced at 17%. This was due to the decrease in revenue, as well as one-off Edenvale project losses. This does include $3.6 million of specific one-off weather-driven cost overruns on the Edenvale solar project and this was due to climate change-related higher than forecast rainfall, leading to damage of project works and delays in execution. GP margin, as a result, declined to negative 42% versus the prior year of minus 4%. However, adjusted for Edenvale cost overruns, this was minus 1% for the half year. So for the half year, our adjusted EBITDA loss, excluding Edenvale, actually improved to negative $3.9 million versus $4.5 million negative in the prior corresponding period. Losses were also driven by foreign exchange, not moving favorably and reduced revenues in Australia, as previously mentioned. With respect to our balance sheet, our cash position actually increased at 31st of December, 2022 from the $1.3 million as at June 30, 2022. Strategically, we made good progress, as I mentioned beforehand, so our distribution partner network for Tembo. We've been able to further expand that globally and also have entered into the much larger secondhand addressable markets and our EV kit commitments and order book has now increased to over 10,000 kits. Importantly, the development of our next-generation electric utility vehicle, which we've called EUV23 is on target, with positive feedback from key customers who have visited and test driven the vehicle. Last but not least, in terms of the summary, we were named one of the best B Corp in the world for governance with a verified score in the top 10% of all certified B Corps in the world and we were again recognized as a top 300 global impact company for the third year in a row by the Real Leaders Impact Awards. So this covers some of the key items and key developments since the half year ended 31st December, 2022. So, firstly, we've commenced shipping our vehicles to partners and we've also received our first orders for the next-generation EUV23. So we're thankful to our key partner in Canada, Acc\u00c3\u00a8s for our first material order of the EUV23 conversion kits and we are in the midst of prioritizing ramping up production over the coming months to fulfill this order, as well as others that we already have. So we've secured further bridge financing from our major shareholder, AWN, and that's been followed by private investments out of the Emirates committed September directly for an initial $2 million, noting that VivoPower still maintains majority control of Tembo. We've also been taking advantage of the EV winter, if you will, that's occurred over the last six months and accelerated in the past three months to recruit on a selective basis, great talent from other EV companies who are either downsizing or ceasing business. Last but not least and very importantly, we are concluding on the Edenvale project, which has been clearly very disappointing and has hurt us financially over the last six months given the climate change related to weather patterns that we've had to deal with there. In addition to that, we're seeing our Kenshaw Electrical business which is part of Aevitas as well, start to really build up its order book and pipeline. And recently, in the past few weeks, it's executed a three-year umbrella agreement with Glencore for reactive and scheduled maintenance, repair and overhaul, as well as the sale of critical electrical motors in New South Wales, Australia. As I mentioned before, we're very much focused now on ramping up assembly and production, as well as deliveries over the next six months to 12 months and we'll be looking to build up our team's capabilities in order to do that. So in terms of the results, September for the half year, revenues of $0.9 million were achieved. Underlying EBITDA loss was negative $0.5 million, reflecting growth in OpEx investment, especially engineering talents. As mentioned, the first version of our next-generation EUV23 platform became available on time in December, which is a material upgrade on the previous generation 28 kilowatt-hour battery system. Our distribution partner network expanded with over 5,000 additional kits in the commitment and order book pipeline, and we've entered into the secondhand electrification and repowering markets through deal with ETC in Kenya, as well as our deal with Evolution in Australia and New Zealand. We've also beefed up the talent pool and hired amongst others a new Head of Engineering, Phil Barker since December. Aevitas, as I mentioned before, the big disappointment here has been the unplanned and uncontrollable weather dynamic, which has turned what was supposed to be a very profitable project for us at Edenvale into a loss-making one and this obviously hurts coming off the coattails of Bluegrass, which affected our results in the previous six months. So we are very mindful now and very cautious about weather patterns and -- but notwithstanding that, we still see a lot of potential for growth in the space given the build-out of solar across Australia. As I mentioned before, the Kenshaw business is starting to see a pickup and a rebound in terms of its pipeline and order book, and we're confident that, that business will continue to grow and resume its growth over the second half of this year and beyond. In addition to that, we've seen interest reemerge again in terms of solar developers seeking to buy into or partner with us on these projects and this is in response to the Inflation Reduction Act, which has seen the income tax credit incentive being restored in the United States. However, that's now been in stemmed and off the back of very strong strategic and operational progress in the first half. Thank you, everyone, for joining, and that wraps up the half year presentation for VivoPower."
