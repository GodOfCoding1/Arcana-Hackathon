    "content": " I would note that most of our underwriting units, including general casualty, excess casualty, excess property, Allied Health, Environmental and Sports & Entertainment continued to achieve rate increases in the high single and low double digits during the third quarter that the majority of our E&S premium formulas are revenue rated, providing us meaningful inflation protection. Also notable from a portfolio management standpoint, net written premium in our E&S segment increased 10.2% during the third quarter despite the slight reduction in gross premiums, partially driven by our midyear decision to increase our net retention by 10 percentage points on our excess casualty business, a historically profitable line for River where renewal rate increases have compounded an ex 100% over the last few years. And just to give you some additional perspective of all the underwriting actions we took, the biggest impact on GWP in the quarter were a handful of the large trucking or transportation accounts, again, in excess casualty, happen to be 7-figure premium items, but trucking overall accounts for less than 5% of that excess casualty portfolio."
