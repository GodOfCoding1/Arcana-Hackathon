    "content": " We continue to focus on growing our most profitable segments and in E&S we achieved a 10.5% gross premium growth rate and 17.5% net premium growth for the full year, while also approaching $1 billion in written premiums for the segment. When taken in concert, the sum of these accomplishments resulted in an adjusted net operating return on average tangible common equity of 17.4% for 2022 and 23.5% annualized for the fourth quarter, simply outstanding results that directly support the narrative that our strategic actions over the last 2 years would unburden the earnings power of the organization. The environment remains very robust with renewal rates up 6.5% during the fourth quarter and up nearly 10% for all of 2022, remaining in excess of our view of loss cost trend and our own expectations for the year. For the full year, the E&S platform produced an 85.1% combined ratio and $83 million of underwriting income, the highest level of underwriting income for the segment in the company's history and all told, an excellent year for our E&S platform. Since my arrival at James River, I believe we have repeatedly demonstrated this commitment through the targeted underwriting actions that we took earlier in the year in our E&S segment as well as the reductions in workers' compensation that I alluded to in our Specialty Admitted platform, and most notably, the decision that we made to drastically reduce our casualty reinsurance writings in 2022."
