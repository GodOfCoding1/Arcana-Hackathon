    "content": " Gross written premiums across the segment declined 1% in the quarter, driven by the declines in both our individual risk workers' compensation business and our largest program relationship that is also workers' comp focused. The loss portfolio transfer agreement we executed in the first quarter, which now reinsures most of our casualty reinsurance segment reserves, elevated the group combined ratio by 6.1 percentage points and reduced underwriting income by $11.5 million for the quarter, as we previously announced. In addition to the strong operating cash flow we generated this quarter of $65.4 million between the floating rate exposure that characterizes our bank loan portfolio and near-term maturities and the rest of our portfolio, we expect that over 20% of our current portfolio will have the opportunity for reinvestment or reset over the coming year. In terms of our home production, we saw strong growth across almost all E&S underwriting units in the first quarter, and we're seeing a good flow of new opportunities in our fronting and program business. Look, it can fluctuate in any given quarter, just given our scale, but I think the biggest piece of the annual expense ratio has really been, for example, last year, that it was down at, I think, 14% in the fourth quarter, which would have pushed it down to the 23% for the year. It was a little bit lower this quarter, just given that we've grown the fronting business, other parts of the fronting business around it, but I wouldn't say it's an appreciable change, and I'm not I'm not confident that, that's going to be the case as we look at a year from now or a couple of quarters from now."
