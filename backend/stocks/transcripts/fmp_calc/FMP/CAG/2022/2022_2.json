    "content": " The second quarter volume decline was more than offset by the very favorable impact of brand mix and inflation driven pricing actions we realized this quarter, driving an overall organic net sales growth of 2.6%. But, obviously, given your expectations that you just talked about in terms of margins for 3Q, I think, there\u2019s some 150 basis points, 200 basis points sort of below maybe where consensus was looking for and I get it, it\u2019s a timing lag around pricing coming through and impacting 4Q more significantly and then some of these incremental costs starting to sort of fade a little as the year goes on. And I know you have talked through your confidence in the elasticity and all that, but when pricing gets up to 10% in the May quarter, I mean, that\u2019s a significant change for what consumers are going to see and you are also going to have an Omicron wave that\u2019s going to be fast and dissipate quickly."
