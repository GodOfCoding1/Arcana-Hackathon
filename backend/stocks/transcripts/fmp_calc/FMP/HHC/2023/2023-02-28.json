    "content": " In retail, NOI was $13 million in the fourth quarter, which reflected a 6% reduction compared to the prior year primarily related to increased operating expenses and reduced retail square footage in Hawaii as a result of the decommissioning of Center to prepare for the development of the Park Ward Village Condominiums. In the fourth quarter, we continued to advance our development pipeline with the completion of 3 office and multifamily projects including 1700 Pavilion, a 266,000 square foot office tower in Downtown Summerlin, which is already 50% leased; Marlow, a 472-unit multifamily development in Downtown Columbia which includes 33,000 square feet of ground floor retail space; and Creekside Medical Plaza, a 33,000 square foot medical office building here in The Woodlands."
