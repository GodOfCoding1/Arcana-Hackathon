    "content": " This growth was largely driven by the significant 49.9% increase in Metreleptin revenues, again, allowing for the impact of the $12.1 million of LATAM revenues in the same period last year. The increase in SG&A spend from approximately $18 per quarter, as was the case in Q1 and Q2 last year to an average of $28 million per quarter for the last three quarters suggest the impact of the Chiasma acquisition on our SG&A has been up to $10 million per quarter or $40 million annually. In this regard, I'll draw your attention to Slide 14, where we adjust our Q1 operating loss for non-cash items and get to adjusted EBITDA of $13 million or $13.3 million before Chiasma restructuring and acquisition costs of $300,000 for the quarter. Although as Joe said, with our medical affairs focus, we're staying focused on those 37 pituitary centers, but with our commercial focus, we've really penetrated now into the community, and that's where we believe the future opportunity, and we're certainly encouraged with the growth that we're seeing."
