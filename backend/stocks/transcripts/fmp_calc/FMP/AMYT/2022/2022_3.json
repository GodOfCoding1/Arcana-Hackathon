    "content": " We are pleased to report revenues of $5.7 million in Q3, which was an increase of 26.9% quarter-over-quarter and 292.8% year-over-year. It is really important that people understand that a large part of our cost of goods is noncash items as noted on Slide 12, such as the amortization on our intangibles from our various acquisitions, which was $16.6 million during the quarter and the amortization of the fair value step-up of acquired inventory from the Chiasma acquisition of $3.1 million during the quarter."
