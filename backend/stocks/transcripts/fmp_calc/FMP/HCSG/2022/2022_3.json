    "content": " Yes, I think from a--look, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a lot of moving parts, as you could imagine, between the timing of the contract modification adjustments being reflected, which as I alluded to earlier, are more back-end loaded; but for Q4, once you adjust for the Q1 one-time revenue reduction, and again considering the impact of the Q4 potential new business adds, factoring in the Q3 business adds and the offsetting exits, our estimated range for Q4 would be between 420 and 430. Yes Jack, the majority of the higher than expected revenue was related to, I guess, what I would describe as opportunistic new business additions, opportunistic in the sense that we were able to fairly seamlessly reassign our managers from the facilities that we exited in Q2 as part of that contract modification initiative, right into new business opportunities which certainly helped to offset the impact of those exits, so that was really the primary driver of it more than anything related specifically to the contract modification and the related billing increases, which as I mentioned earlier, we won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really see until Q1 in earnest, the impact in Q1. I think it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s for all of those reasons the promissory notes have a strong payment track record for the company historically, but just for perspective year to date, and a lot of the--you know, in conjunction with that contract modification work, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve originated over 20 million promissory notes, nearly all of them in Q2 and Q3, and I would anticipate that number to grow in Q4 as well."
