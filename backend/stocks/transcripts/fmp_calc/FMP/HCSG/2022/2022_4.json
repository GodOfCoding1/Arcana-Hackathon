    "content": " Our leadership and management team, our business model and the visibility we have into our business execution, our KPIs have translated to customer experience, systems adherence, regulatory compliance and project discipline, our learning platforms for training and development and employee engagement, our strong liquidity position with a nearly  over $120 million of cash and marketable securities and a recently reduced $500 million credit facility and the growth opportunity that lies ahead. But when you think about the untapped market, again, less than 20% in EVS - less than 10% in dining using a third-party contract company, the opportunity and the runway within our core market, it's easy to forget how long and strong that is in light of the challenges over the past few years. In the year ahead, our day-to-day focus will continue to be on operational excellence and execution with the goal of delivering on our operational imperative of customer experience, systems adherence, regulatory compliance and budget discipline, cash collections with the goal of collecting what we bill and growth with the goal of opportunistically adding new business from our growing pipeline of future client partners."
