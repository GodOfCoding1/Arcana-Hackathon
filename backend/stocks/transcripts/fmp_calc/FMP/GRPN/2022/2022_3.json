    "content": " Merchant marketing will support our supply acquisition strategy in three key ways; one, by using marketing resources to target specific inventory verticals and geographies, where we have gaps; second, by helping to improve the perception of Groupon brand before our sales team reaches out; and third, managing leads more effectively and channeling merchants to sell our self-service depending on their needs and potential. We are trying to make sure that we can sell the inventory where customers come to Groupon platform and they are like, they -- as you see, in some of our numbers, you have seen us talk about one and the customers are coming in, they go for a specific deal and then they don't come back to Groupon platform as such. And so, just to summarize what we are doing here and what we are monitoring, better inventory density, with the better incentive structure that aligns with customers coming back and improving our purchase sequencing in that specific market, that's what we are very focused on in Atlanta."
