    "content": " We generated $10 million free cash flow in the fourth quarter and end the quarter with $281 million in cash, including $75 million drawn on the revolver, and we had nearly $19 million active customers worldwide. While I'm not providing this as guidance to give you an idea of how these actions can unlock the power of our financial model that we are able to sustain our local category at 50% of 2019 levels, with our new cost structure, we would expect to generate at least $100 million of adjusted EBITDA. And that's the way to think about our cash flow generation is, primarily our adjusted EBITDA profile to our CapEx, which we have also meaningfully lowered by taking much lower cost in our tech organization, and moving from our on-premise data centers to the cloud, and finally, our net working capital, which is going to be reflective of mostly of our local billings volumes."
