    "content": " Revenue from hosted software was down 4% year over year, and professional services grew 92% year over year To elaborate on the underlying business drivers consistent with the expectations we shared last quarter, COVID 19 testing revenue from our longstanding enterprise customer city dropped to zero in the third quarter, excluding the impact from covid 19 testing revenue and pandemic driven variable revenue. Conversational cloud messaging volume grew 25% year over year and AI based messaging volume group 11% year over year consistent with expectations we shared last quarter, net revenue retention was just below our target range of 105 to 115% attributable primarily to lower pandemic driven variable revenue from gain share and lower revenue from City's COVID 19 testing program."
