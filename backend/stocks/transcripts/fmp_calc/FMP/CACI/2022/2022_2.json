    "content": " The simple reality is, we have a healthy and robust addressable market, with plenty of opportunity to continue winning business, growing organically, expanding margins, deploying capital for additional value and growing free cash flow per share to drive long-term shareholder value, all of which we are delivering on today. On the M&A front, we acquired two additional technology companies during the second quarter, both of which enhance CACI's long-term growth prospects and address technology demands in the near and long-term. We will continue to execute our strategy that focuses on well-funded priorities with plenty of opportunities for CACI to drive consistent long-term growth, margin expansion, free cash flow per share and shareholder value. They also underpin our commitment to deliver growth ahead of our addressable market, margin expansion, robust cash flow and ultimately free cash flow per share growth with the goal to drive long-term shareholder value. And as we go more towards higher-margin cost-plus and firm fixed price development work, the higher level of TAM that we bring in the more cost effective we're able to be and actually the less people we need to hire because we're not filling billets, we're actually hiring talent around the technology work that we're going after. On the EBITDA margin side, I know you didn't ask that Gavin, we're looking at 10.7% and that's going to track along with revenue growth. And in terms of kind of overall kind of indirect expense in the quarter we were up around kind of 2% on a year-over-year basis with comparable revenue growth, absorbing kind of our annual mirror increases which we give to our employees and absorbing some higher onetime expenses in the quarter associated with some acquisitions and kind of refinancing the debt as well."
