    "content": " As an example, we were recently awarded a $200 million enterprise technology contract to modernize the Air Force's legacy financial systems using our agile software development capabilities and to migrate these systems to a scalable cloud environment. Adjusted diluted earnings per share was $4.24, up around 2.5% compared to a year ago, driven by our share repurchase in offsetting the tough comparisons against last year's temporary benefit from materially lower cost under COVID on a fixed-price program. During our guidance call, Tom gave some loose directional quarterly guidance, knowing that the Afghanistan 2% hit would take its fullest impact in our first quarter as we would look at last year's first quarter."
