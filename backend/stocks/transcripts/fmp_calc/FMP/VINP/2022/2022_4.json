    "content": " Vinci ended the fourth quarter with BRL63 billion in assets under management, up 10% year-over-year, driven by fundraising across private market funds and the acquisition of SPS in the second half of the year. In 2022, we started a fundraising cycle for private market products raising close to BRL6 billion in new capital subscriptions over the year, which alongside the acquisition of Vinci SPS, represented roughly BRL8 billion in new long-term AUM for Vinci. FRE totaled BRL51.3 million or $0.93 per share in the quarter, down 5% year-over-year due to a stellar fourth quarter 2021 for our advisory vertical. If we consider only the FRE from our Asset Management segment, excluding FRE for advisory and our investments in VRS, which did not exist in 2021, we posted an FRE increase of 22% year-over-year, an acceleration in the fourth quarter when compared to the rest of 2022. Vinci had BRL17.7 million in realized GP and Financial income this quarter, down 18% year-over-year due to realizations in FIP Infra Transmiss\u00c3\u00a3o that occurred in the fourth quarter of 2021. Disregarding the investments made in the VRS segment, 56% of our FRE over the full year 2022 came from our private market strategies, followed by IP&S with 21%, liquid strategies with 19% and financial advisory contributing with 4%. FRE totaled BRL33.7 million in the quarter, up 25% year-over-year, driven by the strong fundraising over the year and the incorporation of Vinci SPS. Total AUM was BRL28.7 billion for the end of the quarter, up 30% year-over-year, driven by strong fundraising across all private market strategies and the acquisition of Vinci SPS."
