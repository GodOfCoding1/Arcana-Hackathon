    "content": " PRE over the last 12 months totaled BRL 19.1 million, down 47% over the prior period primarily due to the recognition of positive BRL 9 million in unrealized performance fees over the course of the last 12 months, of first quarter of 2021, as opposed to negative BRL 5 million of unrealized performance fees this year's first quarter last 12 months. So far the company has committed BRL 451 million into private market funds of, which BRL 132 million were committed in the first quarter of 2022, with close to 60% of total commitments having been called by the funds. Moving on to each of the segments, starting with our private market strategies on Slide 22, FRE totaled BRL 106.8 million in the last 12 months, up 21% over the prior period, following a strong fund raising over the last 12 months across real estate, credit and infrastructure. As mentioned by Alessandro in his prepared remarks, we are on track for our fund-raising pipeline in private market funds over the course of the next four to six quarters which should impact substantial growth for private markets FRE as these funds carry higher fees than our average management fee rate. Moving on to our IP&S business on slide 24, FRE totaled BRL40 million in the last 12 months, a notable increase of 73% against the prior period, following outstanding fund-raising across our separate mandate strategy over the last 12 months. FRE for financial advisory was BRL27.7 million over the last 12 months, representing a 97% increase over the prior period, thanks to the outstanding year for advisory in 2021."
