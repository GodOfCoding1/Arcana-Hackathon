First, is there any way you can give us some kind of enrollment update for the first cohort of the 6058 Phase 1b and an idea potentially how many patients we can get data on at EHA that have been dosed out to 12 weeks. And just to give you a reminder, the six milligram dose was selected based on the data that we developed in the Phase 1 trial in healthy volunteers, that showed after just two weeks of dosing, we saw a two-and-a-half fold increase in HBG mRNA, which on hands and currently translates into what have potential to be robust increases in patients, that patients are dosed long enough. Your line is open. So I think, first and foremost, as we've said, and as you heard, Judy say here earlier today, based on the strong data that exists from people with hereditary persistence of fetal hemoglobin, and the consistent feedback that we get from KOLs, that we think that 5% to 10% absolute increases in HbF would lead to a transformative therapy, and one that would be utilized as standard of care. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. As mentioned, we're going to provide initial data on the six milligram cohort, we haven't guided specifically as to what we're going to show, but we intend to show data that should provide proof of concept, really proof of concept for 6058 in people with sickle cell disease. Your line is open."
