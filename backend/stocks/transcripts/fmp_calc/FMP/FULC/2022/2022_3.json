    "content": " So in terms of our rationale, I think one of the things, as we mentioned, and maybe we'll start off with our therapeutic goal for the program has always been to see increases in HbF of the 5% to 10% above baseline, knowing that all of the human genetics data, the emerging gene editing data, all of that points to this being a transformative therapy with a small molecule once daily, if we can achieve that. I think we can say as we sit here at this point, to be able to be moving forward with 3 dose cohorts, monotherapy and in combination, we feel like that's going to put us in a very strong position to generate the data set that will allow us to transition into a Phase II/III trial."
