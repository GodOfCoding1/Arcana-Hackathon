    "content": " A wide-body of evidence has demonstrated that increasing HbF by 5% to 10% above baseline levels produces benefits that could be transformative for patients with sickle cell disease, an oral therapy that can produce robust increases in HbF has been a therapeutic goal in sickle cell disease for some time, which is why our initial data from our Phase Ib trial are so exciting. In June, at the European Hematology Association Conference, we showed compelling proof-of-concept that FTX-6058 rapidly induces HbF protein in sickle cell disease patients and demonstrated that it is able to achieve absolute HbF increases within the 5% to 10% range that clinicians have targeted as the future standard of care. The data from initial patients that we presented at EHA, shows not just protein induction within 14 days of treatment initiation, but at the six mg dose, we were already able to achieve absolute increases in HbF within that 5% to 10% range that provides broad clinical benefits. In our clinical programs, we are focused on rapidly generating value-enhancing data from our Phase Ib sickle cell disease and Phase III FSHD programs. As part of the realignment towards our lead clinical programs, we are delaying the planned initiation of the Phase Ib trial in beta-thalassemia and other non-sickle hemoglobinopathies, as well as some ongoing discovery and preclinical projects that are not core to our areas of focus. So I guess just thinking about the cohort three enrollment plan for the fall, would it make sense to start sort of earlier on at say, like a 10-milligram collect all the data from six, two and perhaps a little bit of the 10 and then think about perhaps opening a fourth dose that could really help on the triangulation of that final registration trial level dose."
