    "content": " The total distribution bookings recovery was 57%, which equates to a 63% revenue recovery as a result of the higher booking rate achieved in the second quarter of 2022, versus the same period in 2019. The improvement in forecast includes our better-than-expected second quarter adjusted EBITDA of $24 million, which was driven in part by stronger-than-anticipated revenue per booking as our business mix improved. Total revenue was $658 million, a significant improvement versus revenue of $420 million in Q2 last year, primarily due to the continued recovery in global air, hotel, and other travel bookings."
