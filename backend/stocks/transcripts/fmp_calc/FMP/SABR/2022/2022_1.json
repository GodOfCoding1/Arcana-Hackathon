Bottom-line, we're more bullish about Sabre\u2019s a near-term recovery outlook than at any point since the pandemic started and our medium-term outlook continues to suggest the opportunity to drive EBITDA, EBITDA margin, operating income, and Free Cash Flow higher than 2019 levels. Total revenue was $585 million, a significant improvement versus revenue of $327 million in Q1 last year, primarily due to continued recovery in global air, hotel and other travel bookings. Our average booking fee in the first quarter was $5.28 versus $4.96 last quarter, $4.59 in the third quarter of 2021 and $3.84 in the second quarter last year, the sequential improvement from the fourth quarter is consistent with a broadening of the recovery into more profitable regions and types of travel. Adjusted EBITDA showed meaningful year-over-year improvement and was slightly positive in the quarter, reflecting the $24 million revenue recognition item just discussed but more importantly, the continued recovery from COVID-19 pandemic.
