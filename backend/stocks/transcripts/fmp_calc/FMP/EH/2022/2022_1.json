    "content": " After more than 10 months of in-depth communication and cooperation between our airworthiness team and the Type Certification team of the CAAC, the CAAC formally adopted and issued special conditions for the EH216-S AAV Type Certification in this February, which led a critical cornerstone for our airworthiness certification, and is also a groundbreaking milestone in the development of this innovative industry, distinct from the Type Certifications of other aircraft operated by pilots. Based upon our positioning of the AAV operational platform, we have been actively cooperating with upstream and downstream industry stakeholders, such as the government, regulators, professional scientific research institutions, aviation component suppliers, telecommunication service providers, general aviation operators, the airport and the road infrastructure operators, real estate enterprises, large commercial groups as well as our clients and partners in the field of tourism, transportation, logistics, emergency and rescue, medical and firefighting, to jointly explore and develop a UAM ecosystem tailored for AAVs, thus leading and promoting the development of a safe, efficient and sustainable smart air mobility industry."
