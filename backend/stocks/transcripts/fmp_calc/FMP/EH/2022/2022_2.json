    "content": " In June this year, the CAAC issued the 14th five-year special plan for General Aviation Development to promote the development of low altitude flight tourism, by supporting related authorities to expand areas sizing in more scenic spots and to establish a low altitude of flight tourism network connecting scenic spots, resorts, theme parks and other tourist destinations. Under the national policy of supporting integrated development of aviation and tourism, we formed a strategic partnership with Tianxingjian Cultural Tourism Investment Company, an affiliated enterprise of the Jishou city government in China's Hunan Province with the plan to develop a scenic flight project at Aizhai Wonder Tourism Area, a National 5A level scenic spot in Jishou. As we continue to focus on the EHang 216 Type Certification process, we also made further development in our 100 Air Mobility Routes Initiative, with continuously increased operational trial flights as well as expansion of operation spots in China. One typical example in China is that in Q2, we delivered five units of EHang 216 AAVs, to a local government-backed tourism operator in Hunan province for areas like sting operational services. Basically, the RMB1 billion indicated credit facilities cover comprehensive banking products and services of Agricultural Bank of China to support our operations and business development over the following years, including regular credit loans, financial leasing, supply chain financing, et cetera."
