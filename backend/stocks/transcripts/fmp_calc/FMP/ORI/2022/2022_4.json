    "content": " So ORI had another good quarter, contributing to a strong performance for 2022 with General Insurance producing significantly greater pretax operating income in the quarter and for the year, while Title Insurance pretax operating income was considerably less than the record setting 2021 results, mainly due to the effects of increasing mortgage interest rates. Our consolidated pretax operating income was $300 million for the quarter and just over $1 billion for the year, while our consolidated combined ratio came in at a very profitable level of 89.6% for the quarter and 91% for the year. The loss ratio for the quarter was 57%, including 10 points of favorable loss reserve development, while the full year loss ratio was 62%, compared to 65% in 2021. It came in at 27.4% compared to 26.5% in 2021 with continued growth in lower loss ratio, higher commission ratio, lines of coverage, adding approximately 1 percentage point of additional commission to the expense ratio for the year. Comparing back to the financial crisis, if I understood some of your question, when we look at the loss ratios and what we're seeing today, we're in a very different environment with respect to loss ratios because back in the financial crisis period with all of the issues around mortgages and how those mortgages were underwritten or perhaps maybe not underwritten very well, everyone was looking to find any outlet they could to try to have some kind of recovery and there was -- that resulted in some pressure on our Title business."
