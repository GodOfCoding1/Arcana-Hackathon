This morning, we reported first quarter net income, excluding investment gains and losses of $192 million, a 7% decline from last year. Pretax operating income rose to $142.5 million, and the claim ratio was 64%, and that compares to 66% for the first quarter 2021, while the expense ratio was higher at 27.7%.
