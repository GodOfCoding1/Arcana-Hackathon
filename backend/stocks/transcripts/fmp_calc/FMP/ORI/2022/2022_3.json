    "content": " And Well, as you've seen in this morning's release, ORI had another strong quarter, with General Insurance producing significantly greater pretax operating income, while our Title Insurance business pretax operating income was considerably less than the record-setting 2021 results due, of course, to the effects of the increasing mortgage interest rate environment. General Insurance net premiums earned increased by over 7% for both the quarter and year-to-date periods, while in the third quarter, Title Insurance net premiums and fees earned decreased by 15% alongside a decrease of 7% year-to-date. So for General Insurance, net premiums written increased by almost 10% in the quarter, and we continue to achieve rate increases on many lines of coverage with renewal retention ratios and new business production, both remaining very strong. Pretax operating income for us rose by 15% to $168 million, and the loss ratio for the quarter was 63% compared to 65% in the third quarter of last year. Net premiums written grew by 10%, while net premiums earned grew by 7%, and the loss ratio improved to 64% from 73% in the third quarter last year. More generally, while we continue to follow loss frequency and severity trends very closely and adjust our rates for inflationary trends that drive severity, including both general inflation and social inflation, and we also continue to keep a close eye on case and IBNR reserves relative to these trends and adjust accordingly So we believe our growth strategy and operational excellence initiatives in General Insurance will continue to produce solid growth and profitability with new business production, high renewal retention ratios and generally increasing rate levels all contributing."
