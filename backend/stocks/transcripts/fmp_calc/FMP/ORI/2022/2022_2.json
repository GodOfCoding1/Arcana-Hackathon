    "content": " Well, Old Republic produced another highly profitable quarter in both general insurance and title insurance, even though title insurance revenues and operating income were less than the record setting 2021 results due to the increasing mortgage rate environment. This morning, we reported second quarter net income, excluding investment gains and losses, of $210 million, a 5% decline from last year. So for general insurance, net premiums written increased by almost 12%, and we continue to achieve rate increases on most lines of coverage with renewal retentions remaining strong and new business production also coming in strong. Net premiums in commercial auto grew by 10%, while net premiums earned grew by 6.5% and the loss ratio improved to 66% from 75% we saw in the second quarter last year."
