    "content": " So is it safe to assume or fair to assume that $1.75 million, a lot of that is -- whatever timing in that, you're catching up from one quarter, but we wouldn't expect that would be a good kind of run rate. I think when we started the modeling of this rates going up over time last year, I think everybody thought there was going to be four or five 25 basis point hikes this year, and then we're going to have maybe 200 basis points overall. The last 12 months, we've done a lot with the portfolio in terms of maximizing rate and we're really looking forward to net interest income growth, both from balances and margin expansion going forward. So, as rates go up, you're going to see significantly less payoffs over there and we're going to keep a little bit more on the balance sheet, which we are comfortable with given how well these loans perform over time."
