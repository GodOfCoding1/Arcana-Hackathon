Joining me on the call today are Andrew Meslow, CEO of L Brands and Bath & Body Works, Martin Waters, CEO of Victoria\u2019s Secret, and Stuart Bergdoerfer, CFO of L Brands. Thanks, and now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Andrew. March benefited from stimulus payments hitting customer bank accounts, and we ended the quarter strong with good Mother\u2019s Day holiday performance at both businesses. Our operating income rate for the quarter of 25.9% increased 760 basis points compared to 2019, driven by merchandise margin rate expansion and leverage in both buying and occupancy and SG&A on the high sales growth. As we announced last week, our board has unanimously approved a plan to separate the company into two independent public companies: Bath & Body Works, one of the world\u2019s leading bath, body and home fragrance retailers, and Victoria\u2019s Secret, including Victoria\u2019s Secret Lingerie, Pink, and Victoria\u2019s Secret Beauty, a leading retailer of intimates and beauty products. We heard from them what they love about our brand, including the unmatched beauty, quality, fit and innovation in our products, and we also heard clearly what they want from us as a brand, which is all about representing and celebrating all women and being there for every moment of their lives, including supporting and advocating for things that matter most to them, and that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re doing. At this time, we\u2019d be happy to take any questions you might have. Thanks, and I\u2019ll turn it back over to the Operator. Your line is open. It\u2019s been a really, really impressive career, Stuart, and we\u2019ve enjoyed the journey with you. As we just reported, results on a two-year basis for the direct channel were up 123% in the first quarter, and that\u2019s after the full year 2020 where the business essentially doubled, so very pleased with the momentum we continue to see there. We were surprised to the upside last year at the beginning of the pandemic and while our partners did a great job of expanding capacity throughout the year, we reference in our script that we were a little bit backlogged at the end of the first quarter last year, and so we\u2019ll feel some of that impact on a year-over-year basis in the second quarter. But as we\u2019re looking out to the long term, while we\u2019ve been very, very satisfied with our ability to work with third party providers on our fulfillment capabilities, we also recognize that as this business becomes larger and larger, we want the opportunity to also have some of the capability in-house, which is why we are adding the additional center that you\u2019re referencing. While we\u2019ll start to work in that center through the year this year, it really won\u2019t be online for full capacity until the back half of 2022, so while we\u2019ll get some benefit from it in early 2022, it\u2019s really preparing for the holiday peak at the end of next year that we\u2019ll be reliant on that new capability. We\u2019re also adding a lot of automation into that center, which will be new and cutting edge for us as we continue to figure out how to operate all of our fulfillment centers both as efficiently and effectively as possible go forward. Your line is open. Andrew, do you want to start? You know, at the highest level, I would reiterate that the way we look at our business across all of our businesses is asking ourselves the question first, are we in fact in the right categories. As you can imagine, especially here over the last 18 months, the strong answer to that question for the Bath & Body Works business has been an absolute yes, whether it\u2019s the soap and sanitizer business that obviously has gotten a lot of momentum appropriately here during the pandemic, but then also our home fragrance business has people have shifted their lifestyles to be spending a lot more time at home, and then our body care business which represents a real opportunity for people to treat themselves and to have a spa day, if you will, without ever leaving the house. Maybe if I touch on four or five things that have been really driving the comps, and then I\u2019ll address your question about innovation. What\u2019s been really working for us to drive those comps are, firstly, better merchandise, particularly with a focus on good-better-best structures and really sharp opening price points. A second thing would be the improved brand positioning, moving from a position of, frankly, being irrelevant to being relevant, to being for him to for her, being more inclusive rather than exclusive, and the customer is really noticing it and voting with her wallet, so that\u2019s great. When we\u2019re at our best, we go into the season only 50% bought and then we chase into real-time winners, and that\u2019s worked very well for us in the back half of \u201920 and into \u201921. Your line is open. As you think about the Victoria\u2019s Secret brand and the new marketing that you\u2019ve put in place, you mentioned the strong Mother\u2019s Day that you\u2019ve had, marketing as a percent of sales, how are you thinking about, what are your other initiatives with marketing that we should be looking forward to as we move on this year, and BOPUS was something that was mentioned as an initiative, where are you in each brand and how does that come to fruition? Yes, I\u2019ll try and remember those questions in order, but you might need to prompt me, Dana. If you think about us as aspiring to a $7 billion brand, we\u2019d be spending $350 million supporting that brand across a wide range of activities. What\u2019s different about that is the way that we spend money in the modern era is completely different than the way we spent money historically, so you should see very significant change there. Obviously buy online, pick-up in store is well regarded by customers, but the ship from store is particularly interesting for us because it enables us to leverage inventory where it exists, rather than where we\u2019d like it to be, so very significant there. In terms of Bath & Body Works and buy online, pick-up in store capability, as a reminder, we had had that in Works fortunately as a pilot right as the pandemic hit last year, so we were able to roll that out in a limited way last year, really primarily in markets that were either fully shut down or experienced very, very tight capacity constraints. As we\u2019ve come into 2021 now, we\u2019ve been able to roll out the BOPUS capability to right around 400 stores as we finish off Q1, and we intend to roll that to an additional 100 stores by the end of the second quarter. Primarily, as you might imagine, this is a capability that appears to be most effective and most well received in our off-mall locations, where it\u2019s easier for the customer to drive up and enter the store without having to walk through the mall, and we also in general have more space in those locations in order to be able to accommodate the packing and checkout required for BOPUS. We\u2019re very, very pleased and excited we\u2019ve gotten both qualitative feedback from customers on the capability and the early financial results are also promising, so definitely something that we\u2019re excited about rolling out further. As we think about the future and build-out, especially of our off-mall locations, we\u2019ll be taking into account how to design stores in order to even better accommodate the BOPUS and ship from store capabilities. Your line is open. Andrew, do you want to start? On the first part of your question, Matt, I think we said in our prepared remarks that May has gotten off to a good start, a start that I\u2019ll say in Bath & Body Works is in line with the results that we were seeing in the first quarter, and that that is embedded already in the guidance ranges that we provided. From a category standpoint, what we also called out was that we saw very balanced performance within the first quarter, within our big three categories, and I would say that that trend has also continued so far into the second quarter, and we would expect it to continue for the balance of the quarter. Yes, so when we think about--I\u2019ll comment on merchandise margin, if that\u2019s helpful. From a standpoint of merchandise margin improvement that we saw through 2020, as you know, was very significant as we were able to pull back dramatically on promotional activity, and that momentum, as we called out, also continued into the second quarter. We would not expect that second quarter merchandise margin on a year-over-year basis to improve, and that\u2019s really because last year we had essentially no semi-annual sale activity versus this year, a more normal year with more normal approaches to the business, we will have that. Historically, if you look back at margin over Q2 compared to Q1, our merchandise margin has tended to decline quarter over quarter by about 400 to 500 basis points, and when we look back and compare to 2019, which is really what we\u2019re trying to do as a more normal year, that\u2019s the type of relationship that we would expect here in the second quarter. May has been about the same as we saw from April, and that\u2019s really encouraging given that the stimulus effect has obviously been done and is behind us, so we\u2019re seeing very good momentum that we expect to continue. What\u2019s also very pleasing is that as store traffic has started to pick up, our digital momentum has not slowed down, so all in all feeling very positive about both channels of growth. As it relates to the very back half of the year, don\u2019t know. We could expect to see some cost pressure, we might expect to see some impact from COVID in our base of supply, so we\u2019re deliberating not giving guidance on the back half of the year at this time, but what we can see for Q2 looks absolutely fine. Your line is open. Congrats on the ongoing strength, and Stuart, I\u2019ll echo the well deserved congrats and best wishes on the next chapter. The flow-through on the stimulus sales was really impressive for both brands, so interestingly higher at Victoria\u2019s. As it relates to the international business, the pick-up is primarily due to two very significant areas of restructure that we put in place during the back half of the year and the early part of 2021, and these are obviously in the U.K. and China. In both cases, we have exited the losses in those businesses through some very, very good work to put them on a much more sound footing going forward, so with those losses behind us, we can really focus on the best bits of the business, which are in two areas: firstly, the digital, meaning direct to consumer where we currently ship to about 200 countries and territories around the world, and that business has been booming during COVID and we see lots of opportunity for growth there, particularly moving to new languages, so we launch in Japanese and Korean within Q2, which should be good opportunities for us. Then secondly in the franchise business, where we feel very good about the partners that we have operating businesses for us around the world, they\u2019ve been through a tough time with many markets closed, particularly thinking about continental Europe - very difficult, but the signs for the future are very strong in those regards. The one area of international that hasn\u2019t come back yet, and I\u2019m not sure it will anytime soon, is travel retail, but happily that\u2019s a relatively small part of our business and not one where we feel exposure from an operating income point of view. Your line is open. Probably the past year hasn\u2019t been a great environment to expand that, but curious to get an update as you\u2019re thinking about generating that customer loyalty program, and then any stats that you can share about new customer acquisition over the past year, which I\u2019m assuming was fairly robust online. I\u2019m actually going to answer the second part of your question first, just to talk about general customer performance and growth, because I think it plays into then our approach on the loyalty program that you were asking about. As a reminder, when we talked about customers through the year in 2020, despite very, very strong customer response and reactivation through the back half of 2020, based on the fact that our stores were essentially closed for 90 days in the first half of 2020, we did actually finish the year in customer count at Bath & Body Works down in the low single digits percentage-wise to last year. What\u2019s great news to be able to report is that tremendously strong performance in Q1 has not only closed that gap, but we\u2019re now running up low single digits on a rolling 12 basis to two years ago, so a very nice turnaround based on strong customer acquisition and customer retention that we saw in really the last three quarters sequentially. As a reminder, it\u2019s in just under 300 stores that we\u2019ve been conducting those pilots in, and while we\u2019ve been very pleased with the results in those areas, we have not been all that pleased with the flexibility of our loyalty application, the actual program itself, so as discussed on prior calls, we are in the process of updating that program and that application and we will be rolling it out to additional markets, about another 50 or so stores later this year, and again assuming good response to that, our intent would be to roll it out more fully sometime in 2022. The results that we see with that loyalty program even as it exists today, though, are better retention, obviously, of our customers and better overall responsiveness, both things that we will really be excited to be able to further leverage once we have that program rolled out more fully. Our best customers have been responding very well to the changes that we\u2019ve made around the brand, particularly in new categories that we\u2019ve re-entered. In our swim business, we\u2019ve seen particular affinity from our best customers and our most loyal customers, so that\u2019s really gratifying to see. I\u2019m delighted to tell you that after several seasons of decline in the size of our customer file, in the last third of the year we\u2019ve actually seen an increase in our customer file, so that is incredibly encouraging, proof points that our repositioning is working. As you know, I think you know, our loyalty is tied to a credit card, and that\u2019s fine - we enjoy great success and great customer advocacy and communication through that tool, but we are committed to getting into a loyalty program that will not be tied to the credit card. Your line is open. I wanted to dig a bit more into how your thinking has shifted around VS margins, now that you\u2019re managing to a mid-teens target. As a quick follow-up, VS margins are clearly on a very robust trajectory right now as a result of the changes you\u2019ve made. We\u2019ve said that we expect to manage the business to a mid-teens operating income - that\u2019s below where we\u2019ve been on the historical high, and that kind of reflects the need for some further investment in the business, where we haven\u2019t made investment in the last few years because times have been tough. We want to give ourselves some room to be able to reinvest in the business, particularly marketing strategies, but also reinvestment in our stores which have been somewhat light in terms of investment over recent years. All of that said, we don\u2019t want to get too fascinated with our merchandise margin rates being at peak highs. We want to be more satisfied with delighting our customers, making sure we\u2019re reinvesting in the brand, and putting our best foot forward for the long term. Your line is open. I\u2019m curious for the Pink business, did you see at all a pick-up in sales, do you think related to some students returning to the classroom this spring, and then also just curious what your expectations are for back to school or back to college this year. At VS, I\u2019m curious if there\u2019s new plans for expansion of the lounge category and if you expect to continue to grow sport within that again. The Pink business has been terrific, and it particularly--the Pink business particularly accelerated towards the back half of the quarter and is having an excellent May, so super strong performance, really good reaction to the new merchandise that Amy and the team have developed, but also the brand positioning that they are pursuing. Campuses in towns and cities where we see a higher level of return of students, we don\u2019t really see a difference in performance there. The same is true with states where COVID has been relaxed - we\u2019re not really seeing a material difference, so what that tells us the main thing is the main thing in a fashion business, which is having good merchandise and good marketing, so feel great about that. I think if Amy was on the call, she would remind me to point out that the growth has been particularly strong in intimates because that\u2019s our core, so double digit comp same store sales growth in our intimates business. Super strong performance in the logo business, which is particularly encouraging for the health of the brand, and maybe a couple of other snippets would be shorts - it\u2019s a good season for shorts, it\u2019s a good season for tie-dye, it\u2019s a good season for yellow, and we\u2019ve been on all of those trends, so big congrats to the Pink team. As it relates to the Victoria\u2019s business, yes, lounge has been great for us during COVID, and we intend to continue to invest in that category. The merchants in that area have just done a superb job, and we\u2019re starting to get to the point where we\u2019re saying, our stores are too small again because there\u2019s so much good merchandise coming. We\u2019re determined to win back customers in that core category of intimates, and what we\u2019re seeing in terms of results is that that is working. It\u2019s a category where we\u2019ve been too light, we haven\u2019t had enough investment, and we will be course correcting that in the back half of the year. Your line is open. Just as a follow-on to the margin question earlier, I\u2019m wondering if you can extrapolate a little bit more on the potential for inflationary and/or supply chain headwinds in the second half that you mentioned in your prepared comments, just a little bit on the magnitude of them, if it\u2019s labor, if it\u2019s distribution, freight, etc., and then really what you feel your strongest levers are to mitigate some of these pressures. Just to comment broadly on it, and Andrew and Martin have also mentioned it, there are certainly risks out there and potential pressures, but for the back half of the year, we hadn\u2019t provided guidance, and as we do so, we\u2019ll try to incorporate those views as we move through the year. Your line is open. Andrew, do you want to start? To your point, Janine, on a clarification basis, we would say it\u2019s in line to the stimulus adjusted trend to slightly better, and speaking on behalf of Bath & Body Works, the stimulus benefit that we saw was primarily in March, with a little bit of carryover into April, but really not seeing any lingering stimulus benefit through late April and into May so far. Yes, kind of same answer to Andrew, the clarification point being that May has been similar to the back half of Q1, which was better than the beginning half of Q1, so that\u2019s good. And yes, we think that stimulus is behind us and so we\u2019re not planning any benefit from that go forward. Your line is open. Martin, if you could just talk a little bit more high level about, you know, you\u2019ve been with this company a long time, with Victoria\u2019s Secret a very long time. We have a clear reason why we exist at Victoria\u2019s now, and that is to inspire women around the world with products and experiences that uplift them and champion them and support their journey. Well, we think about it in terms of creating lifelong relationships with women by reflecting what\u2019s important to them, what journey they\u2019re on, what stage in their life they\u2019re at, and perhaps more importantly creating positive change for women through the power of our products and our platform, and also our advocacy. Advocacy is a big, big word for us going forward, and I have a bold ambition that Victoria\u2019s should be the world\u2019s biggest and best advocate for women. That\u2019s an incredibly powerful vision and mission for us to aim towards, and it\u2019s energizing for all of our people. It does reflect a very significant turnaround from where we\u2019ve been, where we\u2019re moving from what men want to what women want, we\u2019re moving from sexy for a few to sexy for all, we\u2019re moving from a look to a feeling. It\u2019s about including most women rather than excluding most women, and being grounded in real life rather than mostly unattainable. It\u2019s a very dramatic change for us, and we have significant proof points already at this early stage in our journey that this is what the customer wants from us, so expect more. We\u2019ll take one more question, please. Your line is open. We want the leverage for both VS and BBW to be well balanced and to compare appropriately to their respective peers, and it\u2019s a work in process. The range that you mentioned seems about right, but again it\u2019s preliminary. We\u2019re going to strike the right balance, and more discussion to come with the board."
