    "content": " Last year, we discussed a $9 million to $11 million increase in operating expenses to support our SaaS business growth. The increase in fiscal 2022 was $6.4 million, and we anticipate operating expenses to increase by approximately $5 million in fiscal 2023, reflecting our continued confidence and excitement in our SaaS business. Revenues for the fiscal 2022 fourth quarter were $16 million, up 7% from the prior year quarter, as compared to the same prior year period, AHD revenue was $11.8 million, down 15%. IMNS revenue was $3 million, 5 times greater than last year, and software revenue was $1.1 million, up 63%. Operating expenses were $20.4 million, up from $7 million in the same period a year ago, largely due to a non-cash $13.2 million goodwill impairment charge associated with the software reporting unit. As a result of the impairment analysis, the company recorded the impairment loss on goodwill at $13.2 million associated with the software reporting unit for the 3 and 12 months ended September 30, 2022. Excluding the impairment charge, operating expenses in the quarter were $7.3 million, a 4% increase compared to the prior year period. The decrease was largely due to the non-cash $13.2 million goodwill impairment charge, lower gross profit margin on higher sales and a non-cash income tax expense of $1 million related to evaluation allowance against deferred tax assets. Revenues for the full fiscal year 2022 were $54 million, a 15% increase over the prior year, as compared to the same prior year period IMNS revenue grew 457% to $11.4 million and software revenue grew 11% to $3.1 million. Gross profit as a percentage of revenue was lower compared to the prior year, primarily due to increased cost associated with continued investment in personnel support the growth of our software revenue and higher product cost in the second half of fiscal 2022. Operating expenses for the total year were $41.9 million, up from $22.3 million in fiscal 2021, largely due to the non-cash $13.2 million goodwill impairment charge that I mentioned in the discussion that the fourth quarter results. This decrease was primarily due to the \u00e2\u0080\u0093 as we discussed, the non-cash $13.2 million impairment charge, non-cash income tax expense of $1 million related to evaluation allowance against deferred tax assets and an increase in operating expenses of $6.4 million. We generated $486,000 of cash from operating activities in fiscal year 2022, after reinvesting approximately $9 million into the software business to support the growth opportunities we foresee.
