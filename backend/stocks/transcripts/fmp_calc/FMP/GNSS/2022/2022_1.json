    "content": " The synergies of our software and hardware systems enable Genasys to expand its engagement within Alameda County with a new mass notification and emergency warning system contract with the City of Berkeley Alameda County launched Zonehaven emergency evacuation software in public safety resources in June, 2021, which help facilitate the new contract to install an integrated mass notification system network that will enable the city to broadcast voice notification with exceptional clarity and coverage. In the first fiscal quarter, LRAD revenues were up 6%, and we also announced international defense, wildlife preservation, and U.S. Navy orders totaling $3.7 million. Revenues for the fiscal 2022 first quarter were $10.7 million, up 33% from the prior year quarter. The increase is largely due to a 42% increase in sales and marketing personnel over the prior year to support future revenue growth opportunities, including the opening of new sales offices, additional personnel, primarily engineers for product development and amortization of intangibles related to the Zonehaven acquisition.
