    "content": " Our software business continues to gain momentum, as evidenced by the 6.1 million in SaaS bookings in the first fiscal quarter of this year. The strong bookings include an enterprise award from as I mentioned a moment ago, Aramco, the largest market cap company in the world, and the California counties of San Diego, where they bought GEM, Riverside, where they bought Zonehaven. The addition of the world's largest oil and gas company in large California counties to our global automobile manufacturing, and regional critical infrastructure customer base, elevates our SaaS profile and demonstrates our ability to successfully close, cross sell and support large enterprise and public safety clients. Revenues for the fiscal 2023 first quarter were $10.5 million, 2% less than the prior year quarter, as compared to the same prior year period, LRAD revenue increased 19% to 9.3 million. We booked $6.1 million in SaaS in our first quarter, which was the biggest we've ever done, and it obviously it's been driven by Aramco."
