    "content": " Research and development and sales and marketing expenses were higher in the third quarter of 2022, compared to the third quarter of 2021 on; one wafer costs associated with future fabrication runs as we received wafers this quarter that we've ordered earlier in the year to mitigate potential supply chain delays; two, higher research \u00e2\u0080\u0093 higher search and placement fees and personnel costs due to head count additions to support both B-TRAN development and our test and evaluation program. For the fourth quarter, our development and commercialization plans include additional wafer fabrication runs including starting a run under our new development program, designing beginning fabrication of and introducing our initial commercial product, further deliveries to DTI under the NAVSEA program, fabrication of additional B-TRAN drivers and customer kits to support the test and evaluation program, adding more engineering and product management talent, starting the design of our second commercial product an intelligent power module and other B-TRAN commercialization activities with potential new customers and partners."
