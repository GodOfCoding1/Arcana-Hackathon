    "content": " I\u2019m proud to report a great start to 2022 with strong first quarter results demonstrated by total growth, continued positive cash flow from operations, positive adjusted EBITDA, and continued progress in scaling our operation across all segments. The third quarter of 2022 was our ninth consecutive quarter of profitable growth with a total revenue of $34 million, almost 3x greater than the first quarter of 2021, representing a sequential growth of 9% and an annual run rate of $138 million. Excluding the   negative impact of 8 pharmacies, which we are developing and in the process of receiving the first medical cannabis dispensing licenses, and one pharmacy activity was temporarily halted, gross margin for the first quarter was higher than 42% and EBITDA margin were higher than 26%. Revenue growth during the first quarter of 2022 reflects increased market share and growing patient demand for our branded products, same store sales growth, and the strength of our medical cannabis dispensing operation."
