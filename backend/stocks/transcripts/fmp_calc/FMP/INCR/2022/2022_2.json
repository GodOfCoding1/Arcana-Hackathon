    "content": " I'm proud to report that InterCure has a record-breaking second quarter with quarter-over-quarter top line growth of 9%, reaching $37 million, more than double the revenue of our second quarter 2021. We just reported another record revenue -- record quarter with total revenue of $37 million or ILS 95 million, more than double comparing to the second quarter of 2021, revenue of $18 million or ILS 45 million, and up by 9% sequentially compared to the first quarter of 2022. Revenue growth during the second quarter of 2022 reflects increased market share and growing patient demand for our branded products, same-store sales growth and the strength of our medical cannabis dispensing operations, which we continued to expand and reached 25 pharmacies. As Alex mentioned, we have invested in our upstream operations and successfully achieving this growth while obtaining our G&A costs at the same level of the previous quarter at $3 million, representing an effective 9% to 10% of revenue; and $11 million for the full year of 2021, which was 12% of revenue. For the second quarter of 2022, adjusted EBITDA was $9 million or ILS 22 million, which is 23% of revenue, 90% more than the second quarter of 2021, which ended with $5 million or ILS 12 million. Looking at our half year results, we achieved total revenue of $72 million or ILS 183 million and adjusted EBITDA of $17 million or ILS 43 million, which is 23% of revenues compared to the first half of 2021 with total revenue of $31 million or ILS 78 million and adjusted EBITDA of $9 million or ILS 22 million. What has your response been to the intensifying price competition, especially in light of weaker patient growth?
