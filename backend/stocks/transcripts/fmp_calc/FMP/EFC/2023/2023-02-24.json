    "content": " Excellent performance from Longbridge Financial, our reverse mortgage originator, and from our Agency RMBS strategy, in addition to another positive quarter from our loan portfolios, drove Ellington Financial's results. So there's a natural drag in our NIM in a market where interest rates are rising and yield spreads are widening, but that should be a short-term drag, since we are originating new RTL loans at yields that are often 200-plus basis points above the rates on the RTL loans that are paying off. As Larry mentioned, Longbridge generated strong performance for the fourth quarter as tighter yield spreads led to net gains on its HMBS MSR and HECM loans. Because the transaction occurred at a discount to Longbridge's book value at the time of closing, and also because the fair value of our existing noncontrolling stake reflected that same discount to book value at September 30, the closing of the transaction generated a bargain purchase gain, which you can see on our income statement. On the commercial side, I think I mentioned it on -- in the prepared comments that you have a lot of -- if you have a mature property, stable property and the person has a 10-year fixed rate loan with Freddie Mae or whatever, that's sort of one thing, and they're in good shape and they'll probably grow rents and that's fine."
