    "content": " As you already know, we are operating in a more challenging environment, notwithstanding though, given the focus and execution of our AppLovin teams around the globe, we are able to continue to grow our top line year-over-year to $776 million, which is a 16% increase led by our Software Platform business. We don't talk about the scale of the DSP business really, but you get back into it in a way by understanding the short-term impact with what we sized MoPub originally, a couple of $100 million business that's now transitional coming over, would then be, let's call it, in a migration period, down a little bit and then have that and then divide by four to get to a quarterly impact. But I don't think the thought process around games changes materially in any way when the combined business would be one of the world's largest, fastest-growing, most cash flow-generative Software businesses."
