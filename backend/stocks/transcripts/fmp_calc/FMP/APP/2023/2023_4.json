And joining me today to discuss our results are Adam Foroughi, our Co-Founder, CEO and Chairperson, and Herald Chen, our President and CFO. Please note, our SEC filings as well as our shareholder letter discussing our fourth quarter performance are available at investors.applovin.com. During today's call, we may be making forward-looking statements regarding future events, market expectations or future financial performance of the company and the strategic review of our apps portfolio. We encourage you to review the risk factors in our most recently filed Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended December 30, 2022, and in our upcoming Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022. These non-GAAP financial measures are not intended to be a substitute for, or superior to, our GAAP results. I'd now like to turn it over to Adam for some opening remarks, and then we'll open it up for Q&A. Recently, I was reflecting on our first 1.5 years as a public company. Every day, there's a scoreboard or a stock price, and of course, we hold these earnings calls every quarter. First and foremost, the most important thing we've got here is our team and culture. Our key team continues to work very closely together to deliver on our products and our vision, and we continue to add great talent to our team while maintaining our entrepreneurial and lean culture. As we talk about the economic slowdown and we talk about the IDFA and privacy headwinds, we sometimes lose sight of the fact that relevant advertising helps consumers discover content, and it helps the publisher monetize the content that they've developed that they're giving away for free. If any part of this equation breaks down, you're going to end up having less usage and consumption and less investment into great content, and it's just going to be a tremendous loss for consumers and businesses because of that, we know that our industry is going to be resilient. Number one, over the last several years since we released AXON, the advancements in AI technologies have been incredible. Well, now we're working on AXON 2. Second, we're really excited about the Connected TV space. This category of advertising is bigger than the one we operate in today, and it's much faster growing. And third, we continue to invest in innovative products to help carriers and OEMs better monetize their users. We all know that handset device sales have slowed down as mobile market is saturated, and these constituents need better products to be able to monetize their audience with and we're going to deliver those products. As we've gone public a little over 1.5 years ago, we continue to operate the same way we did private because we know that works. We were incredibly successful for a decade before we went public, focusing on building long-term products and technologies that are innovative that when we release them into the market and have success with, we can create immense value gains for our business, our shareholders and our customers. With that, I'm going to hand it off to Herald. In our last two shareholder letters, we talked about a theme of stability, which is a very nice thing to have in this current market environment. In particular, we have stability with a fantastic team, and we have stability with our business model and financial profile. That affords us the resources and time to invest wisely in our existing and leading products, new initiatives as well as invest for the future. There's a couple of other themes that we wanted to touch on today as well, two of them being simplification and focus, both internally and externally. Internally, we are focused on what we can control and spend a lot of time ensuring that our best resources are allocated to our best returning projects. We spent the last 6 months working on headcount reductions, reformatting, earn-outs, focused on the sale and spin and closure of underperforming assets. And that's really allowed us now to get to a position where we've increased the cash flow, and management time is now focused on delivering value with our remaining portfolio. One note you'll see in the shareholder letter in our financials that we did is that, we did take a $128 million net loss charge for the divestiture and closure of these assets, including $100 million in the fourth quarter. As Adam mentioned, we've got some amazing projects underway that we're super optimistic about. We're certainly still in the market for assets that are attractive to us, but they would need to be highly synergistic, strategic and a great valuation. And lastly, we remain focused on what we've always been focused on when we were private or public, and that's making decisions for the long term. So that while we will give the first quarterly guidance one quarter out, we're very much focused on the long-term and won't manage to near-term targets. Turning to the financials quickly, and I won't reiterate all the facts and data that's in the shareholder letter, but I will highlight a few key things. First of all, the fourth quarter came in at the high end, both on the top line and bottom-line for where we guided to in the third quarter for the fourth quarter. For the entire year '22, we came in at $2.8 billion of revenue and generated over $1 billion of EBITDA, and that equates to a 38% margin. Then for the first quarter of this coming year, we're guiding to essentially the quarter being flat to the fourth quarter in total revenue as well as total EBITDA. One note for the next quarter is we are going to change and simplify some of our KPIs that we're reporting, in particular with regard to the Software Platform side of the equation. That's because the Software Platform apps, applications and solutions have become much broader. And there's a metric that we've been reporting historically, and we'll report going forward that we do think is important. In '22 over '21, that metric increased 46% in terms of revenue per install for ALX and AppDiscovery and increase in terms of the number of installs by 24%. And of course, we will continue to evaluate one of the best metrics to describe our business going forward as other components of our software business grow over time. In terms of the overall financial performance of our business, we are glad that we had $1 billion of EBITDA and we have now over $1 billion of cash. And you'll see in our shareholder letter, we've added a new table where we've given you the 8 trillion quarters of free cash flow performance. Our definition of free cash flow is the free cash flow from operations, less CapEx and less finance leases. So we think that's a great indicator of not just EBITDA, but actual free cash flow to the bottom-line which we're proud of. And that can range from M&A where there's a high bar, but also share buybacks. In terms of share buybacks, as you can see in '22, we invested over $340 million against our $750 million authorized buyback. But in the fourth quarter, we did not buy back any shares as we are continuing to assess our capital allocation policy as well as increase the amount of cash in the quarter so that we ended the year with over $1 billion of cash. We think we're well positioned today and going forward, given the financial wherewithal for our business to invest in the initiatives we are excited about as well as consider other investments, including share repurchases going forward. So in summary, we're very glad to have the stability that we have in our business as well as the financial wherewithal that we have. We think we've got an amazing team focused on the right things, and we're optimistic about the future ahead. 0And with that, I'll turn it over to Ryan for Q&A. Adam, in your prepared remarks, you mentioned that Connected TV is one of the growth areas. And what we've done really well in mobile over the last decade is enable advertisers to buy advertising, full-screen video ad, high definition and measure all the performance of everything that happens after the fact and be able to buy effectively as arbitrage marketers. The Connected TV device is really exciting for us because it's a television device, full screen, living room, tons of consumption per day. But today, we're not seeing that much performance advertising happening at large scale on that platform, especially when it comes to mobile app developers. In the last couple of years, we invested in an attribution company that's one of the leaders in trying to bring attribution to Connected TV device. We invested in Wurl, effectively we've talked about a CDN for streamers for very high-profile media companies to bring their content to fast channels. I mean, we've also got our core performance platform that, we think is the leader in mobile marketing. And we're going to take that and use Wurl to bring it to market in Connected TV, and we think it can become a big opportunity. As far as revenue and numbers, this is still really early days here. So essentially, will you be acting as a DSP in programmatic CTV device but with performance advertising. So the same way in mobile, we're an SSP and a DSP. We at AppLovin, our biggest business is our DSP. Next, we'll go to Ralph Schackart with William Blair. Adam, in the prepared remarks, you talked about the upgrade that's coming in sometime in 2023 for AXON 2. I mean, look, we released AXON 1, I guess, it was around 3 years ago, started working on it 4 years ago. I mean, that's how these technologies work. In the period of time since we built that first technology, obviously, we all know there's been huge advancements in AI technologies and we're working on bringing those to our core platform. The rollout and potential growth from it is just building more efficiency into our system, which will benefit our advertisers. They should be able to hit their goals at larger scale, creating more growth for them and in the category, and, obviously, will benefit us. We don't yet know if it's going to be a step function and continue to build over time, but we do believe that will be how it will look. And just one more on the macro, if I could, please. In the letter, you talked about Q4 being soft but stable with Q3, and then Q1 being relatively stable. Just any more color you could add on the macro, that would be great. And so in our business, what was directly tied to our revenue, the biggest part of our revenue is performance marketing. And in particular, the largest part of our segment is game advertisers. Game advertisers, our performance marketers, they're buying on some sort of return curve. As cost of capital went up last year, advertisers got conservative in performance because you just can't afford as long a payback as before. But in the performance marketing sector, the advertisers got conservative but they're not getting any more conservative because we're not seeing material changes in the economy today versus a couple of quarters ago. So on the first question, the reality is performance marketing advertisers have an approach. As we all know that these core technologies, these AI-based implementations of technology are continuing to evolve. As they get more efficient, what ends up happening is advertisers have the same goal, but you can drive them more scale. And on the back end, the algorithm continues to perform better as the technologies evolve over time. So on the apps side, as we mentioned, we've been in the process of optimizing that portfolio. And we do think in the first half of this coming year or this year, that we'll start to  in terms of the trough of revenue. And the margin has gone up, as you've noted. I'd say from there then, it really depends on our opportunity to grow the assets. So we're excited that of the 11 studios, I think all of them have opportunities for growth. And so if we have a hit, we'll invest in dollars there, and we'll bring down the margin. Right now, we're obviously in the very high teens. If we're investing in new games, it really depends on how robust that return is on those dollars. So I'd say expect the revenue side to still come down a bit in the near term, but eventually, we'll reach a steady state and then we think about how to grow the business from there. And just on the M&A side, look, we would take an offer if it was the right price for these assets. But as we said, we've now winded it down to these 11 studios that we really like. And if people do show up at the right price, we'll look to optimize the portfolio as we said we would along the way. The only thing I have to add, too, is we've removed the distraction of weaker-performing studios. I had a question maybe first on competitive dynamics across maybe both the sort of gaming but also broader ad market in light of, I guess, more recently sort of peer mergers, but also some of your peers talking about making progress closing the targeting gap relative to sort of pre-IDFA levels. We do expect it to go full scale in '23, and obviously, we always have products to come to market at large scale faster. It does take time to develop, and we first started talking about it a few quarters ago. All we can tell you today is, we think, it's going to make an impact in '23. On the first question, competition in the ecosystem with M&A or ad algorithms improving. Now what we do know about our sector is that if algorithms improve, if targeting can get back to pre-IDFA levels, the category was growing almost double digits every single year consistently for a decade. And when together, the category gets to a point where it was before, the category itself will get back to growth. Well, look, all we can do is speak about our experience with Google. So with us, we're great partners, and we look forward to expanding that partnership into the future. With regard to the $1 billion and the buyback, there's nothing magical about $1 billion. This is a lot of money, and we're glad to have it on our balance sheet. But the reality is, we're bullish on our business as we talked about. And then, the fourth quarter as well as the third quarter, we had different projects going on. The market was changing, the financial market was also, the cost of capital was changing. So we will, again, as we always do with our Board, think carefully about capital allocation, and we still think our stock is a great place to put money to work. I guess you're pretty well-positioned to assess, both from your view into the market and from your own games whether or not that might be true. But maybe more importantly, whether or not the rate of change of consumer spending is bottoming out. When that does ultimately turn, like we've been through a year to really weak spending. Now it's been 1.5 years, technologies are starting to adapt. Whale hunting, which is an industry term, but marketing to go buy whales for games they can monetize consumers at immense levels is just not something that's possible anymore in today's identity-free universe. When these Chinese development teams have been highly inefficient in a zero-COVID state, and that's just reversed out. We don't know exactly when, as the marketing platforms improve and as the game developers adapt to this new era. And then, using the new disclosure, if I read it correctly, I think that pricing grew at almost double the rate of volume in the quarter. It's actually the annual metrics from '22 over '21, I guess, the revenue per install was twice the rate of the actual installs. And that really has to do a lot with the efficacy of AXON and then the increase in the volume, both from our network side as well as our ability to bring on more publishers. So entering last year, you had talked about the expectation to have $10 billion transacted through your platform. So I think the first question, you're talking about our maximization platform, how many dollars are flowing through it. The MAX platform, though, has a ton of reach in the industry. And about 2/3rds of those apps, top downloaded apps are monetizing using your MAX solution. So in terms of usage, there's been exactly what we expected with that platform, market leading. What's changed versus the beginning of last year and today or end of the year are CPMs, in particular from brands. As the economy became more difficult throughout the year, the dollars and the density in the ad auction, which is monetized by many companies more than us, has decayed. On the magnitude of the AXON investment, that's all built into our P&L. Our R&D investments, in line with what I mentioned on my talk track around our culture, are always going to be lean. But we're adding them in the tens, not hundreds or thousands, so you don't see a dramatic R&D expense line in our business yet, we do invest heavily into new products that can make a big impact. Obviously, you talked earlier in the call about Connected TV. And I know, obviously, the central dynamic is still around mobile gaming. But how do you think about taking the data engine and the platform and thinking about a wider array of canvases and possibly a wider array of SKU and industry verticals from the advertiser side, either through your own organic efforts and maybe through partnership around the broader advertising landscape, that would be number one. And you talked a lot on the call about how we've gotten sort of back to a level of stability, but probably not full return from a demand perspective on the advertising side. On the first one, to answer the question simply, we're super excited about the potential to extend our marketing engine and the algorithms to other platforms. So CTV, obviously, being the first. Games is, obviously, the largest part of our AppDiscovery solution. But really the limitation, so far, has been that our advertisements almost always show up in the games. While Connected TV offers a completely different landscape for us, we believe what's missing from that platform is performance marketing and we can do that well. Wurl, for instance, works very closely with a lot of high-profile streaming businesses. And we think as we talk about our Connected TV to business in a couple of years, we're going to be talking about a wide breadth of advertiser types. The margin side for our business, we're at a steady state and stable as we talked about. But we are excited by the fact that if we can lift, for example, our biggest business, in particular, on the AppDiscovery side with an AXON 2.0 implementation at some point, those are very high-margin dollars to flow to the bottom line, and that would be a pretty meaningful increase in EBITDA for the segment and EBITDA for the overall business. What does offset that is there is infrastructure costs that do increase, but, obviously, at a much slower rate potentially. As Adam said, more in the 10s and 20s, not hundreds, to go after some of these new initiatives that are pretty big, whether it be CTV or endeavor into a business called Array, which is focused on the OEM carrier space. But we're comfortable with the margins we run out today and we think it's more incremental on the upside, in particular, for our biggest business to the extent we can get that to grow. Thank you for taking my question. And as you saw in our numbers in Q4, our numbers were really stable. And in Q1, we're guiding to similar numbers to Q4, both for top-line and bottom-line, implying that our software business is really healthy right now. So yes, certain categories, especially those that are dependent on ads, might perform worse. On the flip side, when you have a super dense auction and you work with tons of advertisers across a lot of different genres and you've got a good targeting engine that doesn't create exposure for you and your business. And then, the follow-up question is that, according to industry experts, Google has begun sending rejection notices for ad exposures and formats that are not compliant with its new Better Ads Experiences policy. We don't expect any going forward because the best apps, the ones with a lot of users, they don't tend to show ads out of place. So for example, you go click a Play the Game button and you get a pop-up ad. That's disruptive, and Google doesn't want that. Well, the highest quality publishers and the ones that are at scale that we work with or know personally, our bigger customers, they can never run ads like that because users usually churn out of those games. And I think in the past, we've talked about the advertising opportunity outside the games vertical. But when you're selling an advertisement in a game app, it's really hard to suggest that you could go, especially as the Wurl goes to more contextual with some data in order to drive relevant advertisement, but with more of a contextual signal, it's really hard to suggest that it's a good strategy to go outside the gaming sector in that publisher set. If you recall, when we first did that transaction, we talked about the majority of their 4,000-plus customers are non-gaming customers. Thank you for taking my question. Well, look, with the changes in marketing, the bar has gone way up for new games. Traditionally, you can create iterations of working concepts in the market. We'll make sure that the data looks strong before we release it to market, that it will be something that we're confident in. And we think this is where the whole market is going to go, you're going to take longer-term bets that are more innovative. There might be less likelihood of success to new games, so you don't expect one out of every two games to hit, maybe it's one out of every four or five. But by creating innovative new concepts, it can expand the market over time. And so that's where we're investing, and we think we have the teams to do that well. We think it's a requirement now for developers to make hybrid, just as you said. Well, you've got to monetize the whole audience. And traditionally, the IAP category, 95% of the users were unmonetized, 5% were whales. And that's actually really good for us in our MAX business and our AppDiscovery business because it brings more inventory online, and we're starting to see some of those trends. Martin, please check that you've unmuted your equipment. If we look at your software platform clients and the revenue for that client over the last four quarters, it's consistently been down sequentially. Sorry, Mark, I'm not sure which metrics you're referring to. So the composition has changed so much that those metrics aren't very comparable anymore to the past, and they're not very predictive of the business going forward and that's why we decided this quarter to remove them. Again, Mark, that number has gone up. But this is exactly the reason why we're going to remove these metrics from our reporting because they're not indicative nor to give you a better sense for how the software business is performing, which is obviously flat, essentially flat from Q3 to Q4. But as Adam said, we're excited and optimistic about the platform. So as we're able to launch new capabilities and hopefully, the market returns to growth."
