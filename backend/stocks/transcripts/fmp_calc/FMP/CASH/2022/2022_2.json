    "content": " Our commercial finance loan portfolio totaled $2.9 billion at March 31, an increase of 4% on a linked-quarter basis, and a 16% increase year-over-year, reflecting growth across our product lines. Net income for the quarter ended March 31st totaled $49.3 million, or $1.66 per share, a decrease of $9.8 million from the second quarter of fiscal year 2021. Quarterly average loans and leases grew $124 million or 3% compared to the prior year, driven by growth across our operating units, which was partially offset by the sale of the remaining community bank portfolio, lower average tech services loans, and Payment Protection Program loan pay downs. Income tax expense increased to $8 million for the quarter, representing an effective tax rate of 13.8% as compared to $1.1 million, with an effective tax rate of 1.9% for the prior year. And that's where he see our refund transfer -- our payment tax payment processing product did well and will grow that a little bit year-over-year year the refund advances which are tied closer to the refund amounts, those are -- they're basically the same year-over-year, well, we thought they would be higher this year."
