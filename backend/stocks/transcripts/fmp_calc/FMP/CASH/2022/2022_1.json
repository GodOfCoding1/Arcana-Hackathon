Quarterly average loans and leases grew $211 million or 6% compared to the prior year, driven by growth in our loan portfolios partially offset by the wind down of the Community Banking portfolio. 10:49 Non-interest income increased to $87 million for the quarter and included the $50 million gain on sale of trademarks, the $8.4 million loss on sale of the Community Bank loans and a $3.3 million negative mark-to-market adjustment of our equity investment in MoneyLion. 25:29 And then you're right on that credit space, that's a little bit of the consumer credit, where we will over time do more of that, most of it, we will not hold -- retain the risk but drive that more towards fee business, but it's that banking-as-a-service that Brett and Anthony talked about, where when you think about those large partners with great distribution that brought us the deposit accounts, well, their customers also have more banking needs than just a deposit account and allowing them to compete against some of these neo banks and other fintechs that are starting up that we're also serving."
