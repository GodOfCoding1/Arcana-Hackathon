    "content": " As previously disclosed, our earnings this year have been impacted by a slowdown in the renewable energy tax credit lending market, lower tax advanced demand than we assumed and certain one-time branding and separation agreement expenses. For the nine months ended June 30, total tax product income net of losses and direct product expenses was $43.5 million, up from $40 million recorded in the prior year period. Excluding the 3.4 million of rebrand-related expenses, 3.1 million in separation costs and 1.2 million in expenses related to the nonrenewal of the two tax partner agreements, core expenses increased 9% year-over-year. When adjusting for gain on sale of trademarks, rebrand-related expenses and separation expenses, the company expects fiscal year 2022 adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $4.28 to $4.48 and fiscal year 2023 adjusted EPS to be in the range of $5.10 to $5.60."
