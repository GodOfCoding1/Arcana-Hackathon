    "content": "   Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Pathward Financial's First Quarter Fiscal Year 2023 Investor Conference Call. Our continued focus on our key strategic pillars of asset optimization, deposit optimization and operational simplification, helped drive further expansion of our net interest margin, which rose over 100 basis points to 5.62% for the first fiscal quarter compared to 4.59% in the prior year quarter. Total GAAP net income for the first quarter was $27.8 million or $0.98 per share, down from the $61.3 million or $2 per share recorded in the prior year quarter. As a reminder, the last fiscal year's quarter included an initial $50 million gain on sale of the Meta trademarks and this fiscal year's first quarter included the remaining $10 million gain associated with the sale. Excluding the onetime gains and expenses associated with rebrand related activity and severance expenses, core net income of $23.2 million decreased slightly compared to the $24 million in the prior year. Excluding the $50 million and $10 million trademark sale gain in the first quarters of fiscal years 2022 and 2023, respectively, noninterest income increased 52% year-over-year. On the expense side, total GAAP noninterest expense of $105.1 million represents an increase of 27% from the prior year quarter. Tim, this is Glen. Tim, this is Glen."
