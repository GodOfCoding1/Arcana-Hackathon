    "content": " During the second quarter, U.S. employers posted over 1.6 million IT jobs, up 60% year-over-year and 38% from the first quarter according to Information Technology Trade Group, CompTIA, and even in this difficult macro environment, this growing demand for technologists showed no signs of slowing down as U.S. employers posted over 500,000 Open Tech jobs in June alone, up more than 62% year-over-year. Our bookings for Dice increased 27% year-over-year in the second quarter, and our revenue renewal rate remained strong at 99%. Our bookings for CJ increased 27% year-over-year in the second quarter, and our revenue renewal rate remained strong, coming in at 99%. Total bookings for the quarter were $35.3 million, up 27% year-over-year. Our Dice revenue renewal rate remained strong during the quarter at 99%, down 4 percentage points from last quarter and up 10 percentage points from last year. Our Dice customer count renewal rate was 85%, down 1 percentage point from last quarter and up 4 percentage points from last year. Our average annual revenue per CJ recruitment package customer was up 2% over last quarter, and up 12% year-over-year to $18,708. Our CJ revenue renewal rate was 99% for the second quarter, down 5 percentage points from last quarter and up 2 percentage points over last year. Our CJ customer count renewal rate was 84%, down 3 percentage points from last quarter and flat year-over-year. Adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter was $7.8 million, a margin of 21% compared to $7.1 million and a margin of 25% in the second quarter a year ago. Deferred revenue at the end of the quarter was $54.1 million, up 25% from the second quarter of last year. Our total committed contract backlog at the end of the quarter was $104.1 million, which was up 39% from the end of the second quarter last year. Short-term backlog was $86.2 million at the end of the second quarter, an increase of $21.6 million or 34% year-over-year. Long-term backlog that is revenue to be recognized in 13 or more months was $17.9 million at the end of the quarter, an increase of $7.4 million or 78% from the prior year. Looking forward, based on our strong bookings performance, we expect third quarter revenue to be in the range of $37 million to $38 million, a growth rate of 20% to 23% year-over-year. For the full year 2022, we are increasing our expected total revenue range to $145 million to $147 million, a growth rate of between 21% and 23% over 2021. So ultimately, as we discussed this even last quarter, we thought that being over 100% was kind of an aberration and that best-in-class SaaS-based business model maintained revenue renewal rates in the 90s. I would say that, as I indicated in the last question that was asked by Max, that in Q1, we felt like having a revenue renewal rate above 100% was aberrational, what drove it was a one-time transactional non-subscription based activity that were sold into packages in the first quarter."
