    "content": " I\u2019m happy to report that we again delivered outstanding financial results for the quarter, with total bookings growth of 32% year-over-year and total revenue growth of 29%, as more employers are using our subscription-based offering. Our bookings for Dice increased 32% year-over-year in the first quarter and our revenue renewal rate continued to grow, coming in at 104%. Total bookings for the quarter were $50.7 million, up 32% year-over-year. Our Dice revenue renewal rate during the quarter grew -- was 104%, up 13 percentage points from 91% last quarter and up 22 percentage points year-over-year. Our CJ revenue renewal rate was 104% for the first quarter, down 1-percentage-point from 105% last quarter and up 15 percentage points year-over-year. Adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter was $6.9 million, a margin of 20%, compared to 5.6 million and a margin of 21% in the first quarter a year ago. Deferred revenue at the end of the quarter was $56.8 million, up 27% from the first quarter of last year. Long-term backlog that is revenue to be recognized in 13 or more months was $18.2 million at the end of the quarter, an increase of 124% from the prior year. Looking ahead, based on our strong bookings performance, we expect second quarter revenue to be $35 million to $36 million, a growth rate of 22% to 25% year-over-year. For the full year, we expect total revenue to be $144 million to $146 million, a growth rate of 20% to 22% over the prior year. That\u2019s where I wanted to start, the $144 million to $146 million for the year, that 20% to 22% growth, pretty big step-up versus the prior guide for the double-digit expansion."
