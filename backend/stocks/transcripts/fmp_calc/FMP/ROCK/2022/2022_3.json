    "content": " In our Agtech business, although project design and quote activity is robust, backlog was down at the end of the quarter when compared to last year's strong order inflow. Backlog at quarter end was $356 million, down approximately 7% from third quarter 2021, driven by customers' waiting greater visibility on near-term solar panel availability and project timing in Agtech, partially offset by continued demand in Infrastructure. Segment adjusted operating and EBITDA margins improved 200 and 230 basis points, respectively, as the benefits of higher-margin backlog converted into a stronger business mix, improving price/cost management, continued improvements in supply chain, 80/20 and lean initiatives. The Q&A that we already have about the double-digit 2023 operating margin, it sounded to me like you were saying that that's what you're expecting, the double-digit operating margin for 2023, but not in the first quarter, later on in the year, like second quarter and second half. But I think as we've always seen in Q2, three and four, with two and three being your most busy quarters, that's where typically the business generates its highest margins during the year."
