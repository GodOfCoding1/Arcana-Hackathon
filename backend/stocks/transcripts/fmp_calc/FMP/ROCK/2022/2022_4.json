    "content": " The organic decrease related to volume impacts from the markets returned to historically lower fourth quarter seasonal demand patterns as supply chain reliability improved, along with market prices beginning to align with changes in commodity indexes and residential, along with continued impacts from project rescoping and rescheduling in our Renewables and Agtech businesses. Backlog at quarter-end was 299 million, down approximately 12% for fourth quarter 2021, with continued impacts from renewables customers owing greater visibility on near-term solar panel availability and project rescoping and rescheduling at Agtech, partially offset by continued demand in infrastructure. Our outlook for 2023 expects progressive revenue growth throughout the year based on our assumption that panel supply will improve in the second half of the year as suppliers move up the   importation process learning curve, and we expect margins will continue to show improvement through 2023. We're focused on driving continued improvement in our operating cash generation in 2023 with lower investment in working capital as we work down inventory further, and we're targeting free cash flow   10% of revenue for the year. Our initiatives in this business first support produce customers with their capacity expansions, execute the rollout of retail greenhouse additions and deliver our 80/20 CLS and PLS projects and finally drive margin performance of 10% plus for the year."
