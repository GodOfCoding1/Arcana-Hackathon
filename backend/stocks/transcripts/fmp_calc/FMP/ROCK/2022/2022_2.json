    "content": " Versus last year, adjusted operating margin and EBITDA margins decreased 430 and 420 basis points, respectively, through the aforementioned project inefficiencies and delays due to panel supply, along with price material cost misalignment driven by structural steel inflation. I would say there's not - we have not had a lot of incremental price versus the start of the year, that is for sure, I think it was probably a price increase around aluminum-based products that effectively, we've not had a lot of incremental price increases this year."
