    "content": " During Q2, total repayments and sales were $66.1 million, primarily driven by five full realizations with repayments outpacing origination activity and additional transfers of investments into the STRS JV, net effective leverage decreased to 1.18 times at the end of Q2 as compared to 1.3 times at the end of Q1. After the effects of the STRS JV asset transfers, as well as $3.5 million in net mark-to-market -- net mark-to-market decreases, $1.9 million in realized gains and $1.6 million of accretion, the fair value of our investment portfolio was $766.5 million at the end of the second quarter, down from $800 million at the end of Q1. Since we generally serve the lower mid-market, we've been able to build a portfolio with average leverage at the portfolio company level of only about 4.5 times, by keeping our portfolio company leverage low our portfolio companies are better able to cover their debt service in this rising interest rate environment. I wanted to follow up on your commentary about the repayments that are coming in, it sounds like there -- if I heard you correctly, some repayments that are expected, but maybe were delayed or starting to materialize, but taken with your comments about wanting to kind of run at -- run portfolio leverage at the higher end of your target range, should we be thinking about the back half of this year has seen a pickup in repayment activity, but also sort of expecting net deployment given the robustness of the pipeline. It raised another question in my mind, and given some of the struggles that you're starting to see, some portfolio companies have at least on the cost side and maybe a little bit on the top line as well, is this an environment where you would think of skewing more towards sponsor deals and away from non-sponsored just to have the potential backed up equity capital and owner to step in and inject more capital as needed."
