    "content": " Notably, our full-service portfolio ADR has also returned to 95% of 2019 Q1 levels, highlighted by two of our best performers, Sonesta Hilton Head, and Sonesta Miami Airport, achieving rates of 144% and 135%, respectively, of 2019 Q1 ADR, along with other leisure and urban hotels in markets such as Fort Lauderdale, San Juan, Scottsdale, and New Orleans; each outperform in Q1 2019 ADR by more than 110%. The recovery of SVC suburban select-service in urban full-service hotels, which have historically generated approximately 75% to 80% of their revenues from business related travel or meetings, continues to lag our airport reserve location but that gap should continue -- that gap should close more workplaces reopen and employees returning to the office. SVC's non-exit hotels have a $36 ADR premium to the exit hotels, and a $20 RevPAR premium during the quarter and grew RevPAR by 80% over the previous year quarter versus 40% for the exits, highlighting the relative quality of performance of the retained hotels. Lastly, our share of normalized FFO recognized from our 34% ownership interest in Sonesta increased $1.8 million or $0.01 per share over the prior-year quarter. For our 295 comparable hotels this quarter, RevPAR increased 75%, gross operating profit margin percentage increased by 18.2 percentage points to 21%, and gross operating profit increased by approximately $56.8 million from the prior-year period. In April 2022, we made a $25 million capital contribution to Sonesta to partially fund their acquisition of the portfolio of hotels in New York City Todd mentioned earlier. I think, and maybe you've asked us on previous calls but where do you see the allocation of assets going forward -- the mix and I think we'll -- I think we see hotels being anywhere long term from 50% to 60% of the portfolio, which they're right in the middle of that today. If you noticed that the Sonesta Select brand, it's a little under a year since that was launched and we really want to be able to see business travel back and more for us before we can sort of form any conclusions but we do expect the margins again, Q1, I think it's an anomaly and it will get closer to that 20% range as we roll through going forward."
