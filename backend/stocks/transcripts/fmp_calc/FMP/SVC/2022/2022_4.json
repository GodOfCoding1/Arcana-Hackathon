    "content": " The major drivers impacting normalized FFO over the prior-year quarter included: the improving performance of our hotel portfolio, which generated an additional $25.7 million of hotel EBITDA or a 90% increase over the prior-year quarter; a repayment of $500 million of senior notes in the second quarter and repaying the remaining balance on our revolving credit facility, which was fully drawn as of year-end 2021, resulted in a $14.6 million decline in interest expense. For our 236 comparable hotels this quarter, RevPAR increased 21.4%, gross operating profit margin percentage increased by 4.1 percentage points to 28.4%, and gross operating profit increased by $31.6 million from the prior-year period."
