    "content": " Pre-provision pretax earnings of $2.5 billion and revenue of $5.6 billion were both up 10% from the prior year, supported by broad-based balance sheet growth, improving margins as well as higher trading and investment gains. The strength of our Canadian P&C franchise underpinned this quarter's results, delivering revenue and pre-provision pretax earnings growth of 16% and 19%, respectively, over the prior year. Pre-provision pretax earnings of $668 million were up 13% from a year ago, benefiting from strong results in Commercial Banking, partially offset by the impact of unfavorable markets on the Wealth Management business. Wealth Management revenue was comparable to the prior year as higher fee-based revenues and net interest income in our brokerage and private banking businesses was offset by the impact of 5% lower AUM, driven by market depreciation as well as lower commissions due to decreased transactional activity. This quarter, we delivered near neutral operating leverage despite some pressures on revenue from the markets that were unanticipated and we're focused on continuing on that positive operating leverage actually next quarter and going forward, and getting to that mid-single-digit expense growth over time that we've talked about at Investor Day as we get into next year. Again, as we outlined on Investor Day, we're simply making investments in our people, our technology, our product offers and our infrastructure teams in the U.S. And we're doing all that to fuel organic growth and -- that we've achieved and planned for, for the coming quarters and years."
