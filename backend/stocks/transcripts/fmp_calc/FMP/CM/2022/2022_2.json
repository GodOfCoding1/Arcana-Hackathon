    "content": " Pretax pre-provision earnings growth momentum remained strong, while pre-provision -- provisions for credit losses against performing loans trended higher due to a more pessimistic economic outlook and the initial IFRS 9 expected credit loss against the Costco credit card portfolio treated as an item of note. Pre-provision pretax earnings of $2.3 billion were up 7% from the prior year and revenues of $5.4 billion were up 9%, supported by broad-based volume growth, stable margin, robust trading and fee income. Expenses were up 11% over the prior year, or 9% excluding higher performance-based compensation, driven by strategic initiatives, most notably the Costco credit card program and investments in our US platform, as well as the impact of inflation on baseline operating expenses. Net income in Canadian Personal and Business Banking for the quarter was $577 million, down 4% from a year ago, driven by higher provisions for credit losses. Revenues of $2.1 billion were up 10% from the same quarter last year due to broad-based volume growth, including the Costco card portfolio and higher fee income, partially offset by margin pressure, particularly in mortgages. The team is working extremely well to deliver capital markets products across our franchise, including our commercial wealth and retail clients, so we've seen revenue growth in the US of around 30% year-over-year and double-digit growth servicing nontraditional clients I just mentioned. Our growth in the US is notable, but one in every $ 4 in revenue in the capital markets business comes connected to our overall bank in retail, wealth management and commercial banking and other retail banking partnerships that we have outside our country through our direct financial services business."
