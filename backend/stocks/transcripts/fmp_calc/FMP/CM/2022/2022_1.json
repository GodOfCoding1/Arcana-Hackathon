    "content": " Revenue was $5.5 billion, up 11% year-over-year, driven by broad-based volume growth, resilient margins and robust fee income across our bank, including strong performance in our trading and wealth management businesses. Expenses were up 1% sequentially and 10% from the prior year, largely due to performance-based compensation, continued increase in investments to fuel sustainable growth, the impact of inflation and increasing activity, including business development across our business. Our North American wealth management business continue to benefit from both market appreciation and client flows, driving strong growth in mutual fund and investment management and custodial fees, which in aggregate were up 16% from a year ago. Revenues of $2.2 billion were up 8% from the same quarter last year, largely due to NII supported by broad-based volume growth and double-digit growth in fee income, which benefited from mutual fund commissions and improved consumer activity. Commercial Banking revenue was up 24% from a year ago, driven by 19% loan growth and 12% deposit growth over the same quarter last year. Commercial Banking momentum continued to benefit from the economic recovery driving average year-over-year loan growth of 13% in the segment, excluding PPP forgiveness. Underlying this, revenues of $1.3 billion were up 11%, driven by strong performance across all businesses, particularly in equities and foreign exchange, corporate banking and direct financial services."
