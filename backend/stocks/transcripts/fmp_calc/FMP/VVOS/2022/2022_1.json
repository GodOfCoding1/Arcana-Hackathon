    "content": " One morning, a week or two ago, Terry called me and with great excitement in her voice said, \u2018Kirk, I just wanted to call and let you know what happened with my Sleep Test last night.\u2019 I said, \u2018Sure Terry, what happened?\u2019 \u2018Well, I took the Vivos score sleep test again last night, because the first time I couldn\u2019t believe it. Now to understand just what this means to that one rather average-sized DSO, let\u2019s assume all 100 of their offices eventually integrate the Vivos program, and let\u2019s assume further that average production per practice remains constant at today\u2019s levels after just five months, they never get any better. Well, that rather typical 100 location DSO that we were just mentioning, operating at the average level they\u2019ve already achieved in just five months\u2019 time would generate program enrollment and training revenue of $1.25 million and annual recurring revenue for Vivos at full capacity of nearly $15.2 million from a client sales and ancillary services such as medical billing and software. In terms of our total addressable market, just among the DSO groups, if we assume 30,000 DSO offices in the U.S. and Canada, and we achieved even a 10% penetration in the next three to five years, with those offices producing at the same, really minimal levels that we are currently seeing, we\u2019re talking about 3,000 offices generating over $455 million in annual revenue for Vivos."
