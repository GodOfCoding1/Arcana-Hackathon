    "content": " For the third quarter 2021, we delivered: total revenue of $1.02 billion, up 8% on a constant currency basis; Global Client revenue of $921 million, up 11% on a constant currency basis; adjusted operating income margin of 16.6% compared to 17.1% during the third quarter of 2020; and adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.66 per share, up 18% year-over-year. For example, during the 12-month period ended September 30, we grew the number of Global Client relationships with annual revenue over $5 million from 129 to 142 or a 10% year-over-year increase. Excluding the effect of approximately $40 million in revenue related to the GE divested businesses, we continue to expect GE full year revenue to decline 10% to 12%. We are pleased with our performance that we believe reinforces our medium- to long-term trajectory of double-digit to low teens Global Client revenue growth driven by continued momentum in Transformation Services, particularly analytics with an expanding adjusted operating income margin and adjusted diluted earnings per share growing ahead of total revenue, all supported by strong cash flow generations. And then the recent focus over the last 4 years on our talent and training and development and learning platform on-demand, self-service genome, that's really been one of the hallmarks of the way we build talent, I mean just that data analytics program that I described in my prepared remarks is a fabulous example of the way 70% of our workforce are actually, at the moment, as we speak, going through that program, with 43,000 of them already certified."
