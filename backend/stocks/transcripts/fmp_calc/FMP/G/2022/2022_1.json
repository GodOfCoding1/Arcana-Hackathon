    "content": " Global Client revenue of $973 million up 15% on a constant currency basis, adjusted operating income margin of 15%, expanding 60 basis points from the fourth quarter and adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.60, up 2% year-over-year. Global Client revenue was up 15% year-over-year on a constant currency basis, led by continued strong performance from our analytics, digital and consulting businesses that make up Transformation Services, which grew 29% year-over-year and now represents 37% of total Global Client revenue. Global Client revenue, which represents 91% of our total revenue, increased 14% year-over-year or 15% on a constant currency basis, largely driven by continued strong demand for Transformation Services that was up 29% in the quarter as well as a 7% growth in intelligent operations, primarily related to deal ramps. As a reminder, our higher-than-normal adjusted operating income margin levels during the first quarter of 2021 largely resulted from lower travel expenses and the deferment of certain planned R&D and sales and marketing investments for the second half of the year, reflecting the impact of COVID-19. Our effective tax rate was 23.5%, down from 24.1% in the same period last year, primarily due to new lower taxes in certain jurisdictions we operate in the fourth quarter of 2020 \u2013 the first quarter of 2022 as compared to 2021. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. I think the fact that we often enter these conversations with change agendas, digital technologies, all the acquisitions we have done, I have to say, and I named a number of them in the recent few years have made a big difference to the way we engage with our clients, some of the examples I gave, where our Rightpoint experience team comes in and helps along with our team, really improve the experience of users and customers."
