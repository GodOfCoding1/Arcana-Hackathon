    "content": " The total proceeds could be up to $188 million and will be used to fund Libmeldy in Europe, while simultaneously preparing for a potential U.S. approval and launch as well as advance our portfolio of next-in-line MPS programs and research in larger indications. In terms of the cadence of launch, if you look at the size of the opportunity in the U.S., it's roughly similar to the EU, again, taking kind of the current estimates of 1 in 100,000 births, live births in the U.S., you're looking at anywhere between 40 and 50 potential new patients each year that we would have to try to find and identify. We had detailed conversations with the FDA, what else needed to be addressed on the clinical side, the predictability of the clinical course is presymptomatic patients, the robustness of the natural history comparator cohort, the use of an independent review committee to review all the clinical data, both of treated patients and of the natural history cohort and had a constructive type B clinical meeting where these items were clear."
