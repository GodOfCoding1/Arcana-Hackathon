    "content": " Sales keeps going up, as you can see on the right, 20.9% versus pre-pandemic levels in the second quarter of 2023 and 12.4% comparing to last quarter of -- the same quarter of last year. Now if we go to Page 11, the net financial results during the semester generated a gain, a smaller gain than last year, 26.8% below but still a gain, it's important here, I think, two lines, the interest -- net interest that we can see a reduction of around 50% from ARS4.4 billion against ARS6.4 billion last year that is related to the deleverage of the Company during the year. Well, EBITDA from the quarter from sales on six months were just $11.1 million, so together with a rental of 87.3, reached an adjusted EBITDA -- were some losses from others, that you get to almost $80 million EBITDA comparing to last year that was much higher because we had sales for almost $100 million or $95 million that we did more asset sales."
