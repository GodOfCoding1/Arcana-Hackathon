So, we can see that the gross asset value of the company remain at a levels of ARS2.3 billion with a net debt decreasing to $445 million at official exchange rate that give us a net asset value of $1.8 billion at the official exchange rate with an LTV of only 19.6%. And also, as I mentioned, we sold the Rep\u00fablica building for $100 million cash, so this number, going forward, will reduce more to levels of $347 million, and probably we will see more disposals of -- the company will continue to deleverage strongly. So, the company is recovering very well after the pandemic, we see levels of EBITDA increasing, good levels of cash generation, deleveraging the company very optimistic on the rental recovery in the next quarter in shopping malls and hopefully with the end or with the reduction of the effect of the pandemic, we will see better numbers also in the hotels."
