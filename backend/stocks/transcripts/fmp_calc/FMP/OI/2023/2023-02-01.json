    "content": " Earnings improved in both the Americas and Europe as segment operating profit increased to $960 million, reflecting strong net price realization as well as modest sales volume growth and solid operating performance despite higher asset project expense. As shown on the left, we reported free cash flow of $236 million which exceeded guidance, yet was down from the prior year due to higher CapEx given expansion project investment. Adjusted free cash flow which excludes the strategic CapEx, totaled $426 million, an increase from the prior year, demonstrating O-I's improved operating performance. And as we look to 2023, overall, we think probably there's probably more volume growth opportunity in the Americas given that all markets are dealing with low inventory levels but we are adding new capacity over in Europe -- I mean in the Americas, primarily in Colombia and Canada."
