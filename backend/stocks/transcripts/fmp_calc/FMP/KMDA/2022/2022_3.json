    "content": " All of these were indeed important contributors to the sales of stability growth in the third quarter in which we generated total revenues of $32.2 million, representing a 40% increase year-over-year and gross margins of 40%, up from the 25% in the third quarter of 2021 and 31% in the second quarter of 2022. As a reminder, the acquired product generated collective revenues of approximately $42 million in 2021 with over 50% gross margins and we anticipate that we will significantly grow the new portfolio revenues year-over-year beginning already this year. Total gross profit for the third quarter of 2022 was $12.9 million, representing 40% margins, compared to $5.7 million or 25% margin in the third quarter of 2021. Adjusted EBITDA for the first nine months of 2022 was $10.6 million, representing 13% margin, which is in-line with our annual financial guidance and represent a substantial increase over the $6.7 million of adjusted EBITDA in the prior year period. Based on our expectation of significant revenue growth and enhanced profitability for the remainder of the year, we continue to expect revenue in the range of $125 million to $135 million and anticipate generating adjusted EBITDA at a rate of 12% to 15% of total bookings."
