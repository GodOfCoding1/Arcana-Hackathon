    "content": " We are also seeing already meaningful sales growth from this product in the international market outside of North America, including the recently signed $11.4 million agreement to supply VARIZIG, one of the four acquired FDA approved commercial products, to an undisclosed international organization operating principally in Latin America. Our outlook for stronger second half of the year is driven by multiple key factors, including anticipated continued growth of the new IgG portfolio, including sales boosted by the new VARIZIG supply agreement, and the expected growth of KEDRAB sales to Kedrion, supporting the product continued increased in-market sales during 2022. As Amir mentioned, we forecast a strong second half of the year, driven by multiple factors, including continued growth of the IgG product sales in the U.S., which will be driven by the ongoing marketing efforts, as well as expansion of ex-U.S. sales of these products by the VARIZIG supply agreement. Looking ahead to the second half of 2022, the increased sales of the new IgG portfolio and KEDRAB would generate meaningful gross profitability, as each of these products generates more than 50% gross margin. The growth we see and we expect to continue to seeing in our distribution business in the Israeli market, including the portfolio of the 11 biosimilars that we planned to launch between this year and 2028 adding $40 million to our business, the royalty payments from Takeda which started earlier this year and we had the full quarter, second quarter of $3.7 million, which is exactly according to our expectations and GLASSIA and KamRAB, the anti-rabies immunoglobulin in the international markets outside of the U.S."
