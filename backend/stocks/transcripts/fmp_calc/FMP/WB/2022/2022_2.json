In the second quarter, despite the disruption from COVID resurgence weighed on the top line, our non-GAAP operating margin reached 32%, which remained at a relatively decent level in the industry with non-GAAP sales and marketing expenses decreasing 27% year-over-year and its percentage of revenue decreasing 2% versus the same period last year. Weibo's second quarter 2022 net revenues were $415.2 million, a decrease of 22% and or 19% on a constant currency basis. Weibo's advertising and marketing revenues for the second quarter 2022 were to $385.6 million, a decrease of 23%. Ad revenues from Alibaba for the second quarter decreased 41% to $23.7 million, primarily attributable to its own conservative marketing strategies and cost optimization initiatives amid weak consumption and lockdowns as mentioned earlier. Net income attributable to Weibo in the second quarter was $109.7 million, representing a net margin of 24% compared to 32% last year. So in the latter half of the year, in respect of our core competitive edge, actually, we are using the cost reductions to help our teams, especially the R&D teams to focus on areas where we have - where we can improve the efficiency and where we have the advantage, for example, we can generate more cooperations with more platforms and also we can improve our market - content marketing."
