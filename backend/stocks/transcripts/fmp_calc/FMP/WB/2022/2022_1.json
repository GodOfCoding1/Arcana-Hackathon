On the user front, Weibo\u2019s MAUs reached 582 million and average DAUs reached 252 million in March 2022, adding approximately $51 million and $22 million a year respectively. On monetization, the medical environment, industry policy and recent domestic COVID-19 resurgence had posed short and medium term impact on the production and operation of many companies to different degrees, causing most advertisers to defer or reduce their marketing budget since March. In the first quarter, our total revenue reached $484.6 million, up 6% year-over-year, and our ad revenues reached $427.1 million, up 10% year-over-year and 94% of our ad revenue came from mobile. On product font, we continue to focus on operating efficiency, driving steady user base extension and engagement improvement, so as to update our monetization efficiency. On competition, we will continue to step up investment in operations of hot trends and social content, deepen strategic cooperation with partners from media, entertainment, gaming and sports verticals, to encourage discussion around hot trends and IPs and maintain our competitiveness in core user function. In the first quarter, with the Spring Festival Holiday and Winter Olympics, our user base and traffic grew robustly, demonstrating Weibo\u2019s advantages in hot trends and social attributes. From the Winter Olympics events to sports campaigns and the IPs of , we worked with the Winter Sports Administrative Center to encourage athletes to open accounts as they engaged on Weibo and build a content distribution network with the state media and , among other media, to enhance the dissemination and discussion of content around the games. Not only did the traffic driven by the Beijing Winter Olympics surpassed that of the Tokyo Olympic games, but the athletes and their followers were also more engaged on Weibo based on historical data. However, in March, we grew our user and traffic nicely, mainly attributable to more social events occurred and increased content online due to the disruption from COVID-19, coupled with our optimized channel strategy and improved operating efficiency of hot trends and social content. On channel front, we further optimized our channel investment strategy with focus on efficiency as the content operation of the Spring Festival and the Winter Olympic Games helped grow our user and increased user engagement. And meanwhile, we improved our capabilities of serving products to clients and increased the long term retention of the monetizable traffic and users to continue to optimize channel ROI. Hence, in the first quarter, we optimized our product from several aspects, driving to precisely targeting users with the recommended content. In March, the per capita consumption of channel user increased by 40% from the fourth quarter last year. On social attributes, we continued to strengthen the social features of our user product by focusing on promoting scale and engagement of Weibo\u2019s core users. On relationship based feed, the number of feed refreshment continued to improve from December, benefiting from the optimization in content distribution of the relationship based feed, we've effectively retained and engaged users throughout our platform by hot trends. Additionally, we continue to invest in social content enrichment, personalize the content distribution, and front end product experience to improve the experience of user consumption and the social stickiness of the relationship based feeds. At the same time, we strengthened the integration of products and operations to further expand community to more verticals, enrich vertical content, so as to better fulfill users\u2019 need for social relations based on interests and location within the communities. We have seen that community  effectively increased user engagement and promote user intention in the long run, which boost our confidence in Weibo\u2019s new positioning and growth potential in the market of social attributes. On videos, we continue to focus on the scale and engagement of video accounts, especially on verticals that can drive more traffic and engagement, and also high quality content creators. In 2022, we will provide more support on products and operations to these video content creators to encourage video generation and interaction with VAS and ensure the quantity and the quality of video content, which in turn drives user engagement. We also launched the hot media list in the discovery page, which not only stimulated video consumption, but also further strengthened the positioning of the discovery page in the consumption of hot trends and the popular content. On one hand, we worked with Shanghai released People's Daily, CCTV news and other official accounts of governments and state media and organized more than 2,200 topics on the COVID situation in Shanghai, which generated nearly 200 million views and over 22 million discussion in total. We have also established an efficient rumor refuting mechanism in cooperation with the government department to promptly address rumors and misinformation, while optimize our product mechanism to amplify information reach for more users. In addition, this year, we also attempt to coordinate with NGOs, business, media, volunteers,  veterans to build a society-wide rescue system against COVID, providing assistance and support for people seeking medical treatment, supplies, psychological consulting, so as to further amplify our value in this society-wide emergency relief and assistance. Underpinned by the resilience of Weibo\u2019s brand cross performance and ad offerings in key verticals, we are dedicated to expanding the marketing combo of brand cross performance ad with content operation to more industries and clients, aiming to strengthen our industry-based marketing capability as well as our market competitiveness. From an industry perspective, our ad revenue increased by 10% year-over-year in the first quarter, mainly benefiting from the Spring Festival and the Winter Olympics as well as our improved capabilities to fulfill customers\u2019 brand cross performance marketing needs in key industries. For example, during the Winter Olympics, we helped Olympic sponsors to build hype in the market, featuring a combo of our ad offerings, such as topic, hot trend, launch screen ad, et cetera, to uplift their brand recognition, leveraging hot trends of Olympic sports event and athlete endorsement. Considering the approval policy of , the game license, we launched event-based ad offering and service with top gaming clients in the first quarter to better align with clients event pipeline and fulfill their marketing needs in connection with major version updates and new character promotion. Entering the second quarter with more regions setting up lockdown and the prevention measures, various aspect of economics activities has been significantly disrupted, including production logistics and other offline activities, which directly weigh on the growth of the overall advertising market. For one thing, we offer targeted favorable policies and resources to support the customers and industries hit hard by the COVID-19, inviting customers to exploit our brand cross performance ad offering so as to boost their confidence in the social media marketing, while raising the utilization rate of Weibo\u2019s core ad inventories at the same time. Our major initiatives include optimizing our brand cross performance ad offering to improve efficiency, beefing up our content marketing service and extending customer scenario, just to name a few. In March 2022, Weibo\u2019s MAUs and average DAUs reached 582 million and 252 million respectively, representing a net addition of 51 million and 22 million users, respectively on a year-over-year. Weibo\u2019s first quarter 2022 net revenues were $484.6 million, an increase of 6%. Weibo\u2019s advertising and marketing revenues for the first quarter of 2022 reached $427.1 million, an increase of 10%. Weibo delivered a relatively resilient ad growth in the first quarter, even though the overall advertising market was capping off amid macro uncertainties, resurgence of COVID-19 and lockdown disruptions. For first quarter 2022, our leading verticals in terms of ad revenue contributions were FMCG, 3C products and gaming. Despite regulatory and macro challenges weighing on demand set, the relatively resilient performance of FMCG and 3C product sectors demonstrated that Weibo\u2019s brand cross performance ad offerings resonated greatly with customers in these sectors and enabled them to build  around major events, such as the Winter Olympic Games. as we entered mid-March and second quarter, the lingering national wide Omicron outbreaks and subsequently restrictions and lockdown measures has significantly disrupted the advertising market and demand set, industries with high offline exposures such as  and also industries cut ad budget due to suspension of offline activities and disruption of production. The restriction and lockdown in major areas in China, especially Shanghai, has also negatively impacted consumption sectors, such as FMCG and ecommerce, which suspended ad campaigns originally scheduled for the quarter and cut ad budget accordingly. As COVID-19 resurgence rapidly evolved national wide and restriction and lockdown disrupt economic activities, including production, consumption, logistics, and offline activities, based on our current observation and our best estimate, we expect the potential impact on advertising business in the second quarter is material and even more severe than the COVID-19 impact on our business in 2020. Given the major areas impacted, duration of restriction and lockdown, as well as the current macroeconomic condition, we're closely monitoring the evolving situation and we'll make relentless efforts to mitigate such headwinds, leveraging our diverse industry mix and broad sale network coverage national wide, while doing our utmost to protect our employees, partners and the communities. Despite near-term challenges ahead, we\u2019re encouraged to see our user and engagement metrics remain the solid momentum, laying a foundation for us to further tap into a wider demographic and increased monetization scale as business recovers. Ad revenues from Alibaba for the first quarter decreased 22% to $25.9 million, primarily attributable to its own conservative marketing strategies amid weak consumption and lockdown, as mentioned earlier. Value-added service, VAS, revenues were $57.5 million in the first quarter, a decrease of 17%. Total costs and expenses for the first quarter was $342.9 million, an increase of 7%. The increase was primarily due to, first, higher personnel related cost; second, step up in content costs, mainly associated with Winter Olympic Games; third, recognition of culture business construction fee . Operating income in the first quarter was $141.7 million, an increase of 3%, representing operating margin of 29%, exceeding our expectations as we continued to effectively balance growth and margin performance amid uncertainties. Net income attributable to Weibo in the first quarter was $132.9 million, representing a net margin of 27% compared to 28% last year. In the first quarter of 2022, cash provided by operating activities was $248.6 million. So you can see that if we're talking about the mid-March as well as the Q2, in China, due to the COVID, we have been seeing the escalation of the control policies due to COVID here in China, and this is impacting a lot of marketing campaigns offline of our customers as well as those ads budget as well. And also talking about the different ad, for example, the performance ad, we can see that especially the information flow ad, this kept quite stable in terms of the volume. And second of all, talking about those brand advertisement, so you can see that because majority of the agents are located in East China, so I think that in terms of the budget, this has been impacted due to the COVID. And also, talking about the April, because of the impact to the logistics as well as the execution of a lot of the projects in East China, we have been seeing a driven down trend of the brand advertisement. And also, because Shanghai just resumed work and also all the kind of lifestyle things 1 June and there is a lot of uncertainty here in terms of Shanghai and also the performance in the second half. And also, however, talking about the brand customers because they have a whole process which is going to be followed if they want to resume the kind of budget and also resume advertisements in terms of the budget allocation and then the marketing plans as well as the execution, et cetera, so we expect that the brand customers are going to recover slower than the performance. And also talking about industrial verticals, first of all, we believe that the gaming industry has been least impacted. And also, in May, of course, we had a little bit impact because of the unavailability of the gaming license, but still that particular impact could be controlled. And also, because 50% of our businesses are focusing on FMCG, luxury products, as well as the automotive industry, so you can see that, for these three verticals, they've been impacted heavily in April because of COVID. However, when there was a little bit recovery of the control and also containment of the COVID in May, we've seen a very quick and also robust rebound of these three verticals. So, that is to say that, in the future, if the COVID could be better contained, we're going to see, for example, more marketing campaigns organized by the customers in those categories or those verticals, we're going to see a very good recovery and rebound of their budget to us. And then next, I would like to say that, talking about the other verticals, especially those offline activity oriented industries, so for example, the aesthetic medicine and also OTO  customers, they will also receive the impact after Q3 even. And also, talking about the mobile or smartphone industry, we also have experienced a driven down of the sales of this particular industry vertical and, of course, in Q2, there wasn't a big impact to the smartphone industry. And of course, if we're talking about the smartphone, this is not only the customer that we have, but also this should be regarded as the channel for us to do the marketing and also ad. And also, lastly, I would like to say that, in Q1 of this year, we had about more than half of the month of the impact. And also, I think that this particular impact is larger than our expectation because Shanghai just reopened itself in June 1 and also, in Beijing, there are still certain areas having people working from home still. And also, because talking about the brand customers, they're having a longer process to follow to restart and also reboot their business and also this required collaboration closely between publishers and also agents. So, first of all, we are having a stricter control and also a stricter policy in terms of the ROI and also keeping it quite preservative in terms of the placement among different channels and also the purchasing of the feeds, for example. And also, talking about Q1, however, still we had stricter rules on the appraisal ROI and also if the channel, for example, could not provide with us the returns as required within three months or six months, we are going to cancel collaboration with that channel. So, in terms of margin, as a result of better monetization, larger business scale and higher operating leverage, we achieved a good profit margin in the first quarter of last year. And we have been doing more complicated works and also world works as well in terms of our business operation or business development, especially we're talking about video. So in terms of the video, the impact is actually going to be bigger than the social media and also the business driving forces are going to be more as well than the social media only. So that's why that even if we've had a lot of headwinds, as well as the market competition in the video content area, we're still trying to invest as many as possible. So, we believe that we have a very key positioning and also important positioning in the video area and then we are going to further uplift the upper limit of the number of users and also the others. And also, lastly, I would like to say that talking about a business value of a company, this does not only relate it to the DAU and also MAU number, but I think it's more relevant to the activity of the users. So especially, in Q1, we've been saying that our total traffic has been reaching the kind of upper limit or the kind of a peak level before any reconciliation and also some ratification conducted to the entertainment industry, right, because activity was all about the stickiness of the users. And also, we really believe that with the business model of Weibo combining social media together with the media, hot trends, for example, this is going to be our key strategy to be sustainable in the future. And also, in Q1, because of the recognition conducted to the entertainment industry, we already said that the entertainment industry will not be recovered until the second half."
