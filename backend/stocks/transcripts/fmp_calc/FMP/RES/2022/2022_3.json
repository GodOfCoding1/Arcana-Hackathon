    "content": " Third quarter revenues increased by 22.4% to $459.6 million from $375.5 million in the prior quarter due to higher customer activity levels and pricing improvements, as well as increasingly favorable job mix. As a percentage of revenues, cost of revenues improved to 67.4% from 69.5% in the prior quarter, due to the leverage of direct employment costs over higher revenues, coupled with improved pricing for RPC's services. Selling, general and administrative expenses during the third quarter increased by 6.6% to $38.2 million from $35.9 million in the prior quarter, primarily due to employment related costs, including variable incentive compensation consistent with improved operating performance. Our Technical Services segment revenues increased 105.7% to $435.8 million, resulting in a segment operating profit of $89.5 million, compared to $8.3 million in the same quarter of the prior year. Our Support Services segment revenues increased 76.9% to $23.8 million, resulting in a segment operating profit of $5.3 million compared to an operating loss of $55,000 in the same quarter of the prior year.
