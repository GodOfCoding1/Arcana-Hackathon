    "content": " It's worth pointing out to those that are new to the story that both FastPay and PayClearly, which are media advertising books of business, are more weighted towards both the midterm and presidential election cycles in the U.S. Our strong revenue growth also resulted in total transaction yield expanding to $4.23 in the quarter, up 11.6% from $3.79 in Q1 2021. Non-GAAP sales and marketing costs increased by $2.9 million to $16.3 million in Q1 of '22 over Q1 of last year, with the increase driven by the continued investment in our direct and channel strategies to acquire new buyers and suppliers as well as the consolidation of FastPay and PayClearly results. Your line is now live. Your line is now live. Your line is now live. Your line is now live. Your line is now live. Your line is now live. Your line is now live. Your line is now live. And so I'm not sure if that's a sign of kind of economic times in terms of being harder to sell other more treasury products or not, but we're certainly seeing the interest from the channels to -- for sales reps to want to get more training, and to really lead into how they introduce more customers to our products. Your line is now live. So I would say it's more driven by those dynamics than kind of where we see kind of card acceptance because we pretty much have seen our ability to get good, both card acceptance and AvidPay direct acceptance has been across really all the verticals we've operated in. Your line is now live. And I think especially coming out of COVID, we're really seeing some kind of really strong interest just in the last two quarters with now CFOs attending these in-person conferences and really leaning into how do I use technology to move everything to the cloud to automate my back office, so I don't have to add headcount going forward. Your line is now live."
