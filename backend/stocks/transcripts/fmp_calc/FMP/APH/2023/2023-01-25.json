For the full-year 2022, sales were a record $12.623 billion, which were up 16% U.S. dollars 19% in local currencies and 15% organically, compared to 2021. For the year 2022, GAAP operating margin was 20.5% and adjusted operating margin was 20.7%, when compared to 2021, adjusted operating margin increased by 70 basis points, which was primarily driven by normal operating leverage on higher sales volumes, as well as the benefit of pricing actions.

Compared to the prior year fourth quarter segment sales increased 1% in U.S. dollars and organically, compared to the full-year 2021, segment sales increased by 17% in U.S. dollars and 13% organically.

Operating cash flow in the fourth quarter was a record $705 million or 147% of adjusted net income and net of capital spending, our free cash flow was a record $613 million or $127% of adjusted net income. The company booked $2.884 billion in orders in the fourth quarter, representing a book-to-bill of 0.89:1, and this negative book-to-bill was driven by order reductions in several of the communications related markets as certain customers adjusted demand in light of excess inventory that they had built up throughout 2022. We expanded our position in the overall market, growing sales by 16% in U.S. dollars, 19% in local currencies and 15% organically reaching a new sales record of $12.623 billion. We also bought back in 2022 almost 10 million shares under our share buyback program and increased our quarterly dividend by 5%, representing as Craig detailed a total return of capital to shareholders of just over $1.2 billion for the year. I'd like to spend a little bit of time to talk about our trends and progress across our served markets, and I would just comment that we remain very pleased that our balanced and broad end market diversification continues to create real value for the company with no single end market representing more than 25% of our sales in the year of 2022. Sales in the quarter grew strongly from prior year, increasing by 11% in U.S. dollars and 13% in local currencies and on an organic basis sales increased by 12% with broad-based growth across virtually all applications, but particularly military vehicles, space and airframes.

For the full-year 2022, sales grew by a strong 14% in U.S. dollars, 19% in local currency and 13% organically, and we really had broad-based growth across virtually all segments of the global industrial market. The automotive market represented 21% of our sales, both in the fourth quarter and for the full-year and we had another great quarter in automotive sales growing by a strong 21% in U.S. dollars and 31% in local currency and organic. For the full-year 2022, I'm very pleased that our sales increased by a strong 22% in U.S. dollars and 29% in local currency and organic, reflecting broad strength across our automotive markets, including in particular in next generation electronics, including electric and hybrid drivetrains. Our sales in the quarter declined from prior year by 11% in U.S. dollars and 7% in local currency and organically, and this was driven by reduced sales of products incorporated into smartphones, laptops, tablets and wearables. For the full-year 2022, sales in this market increased by 3% in U.S. dollars and 5% organically, as growth in smartphones and wearables was somewhat offset by a moderation in tablets coming off the higher levels of the pandemic. Sales in the quarter declined from prior year by 8% in U.S. dollars, 6% in local currency and 12% organically as we experienced the pause in demand from operators after a number of quarters of strong growth.
