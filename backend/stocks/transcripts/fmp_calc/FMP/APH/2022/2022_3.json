    "content": " The automotive market represented 20% of our sales in the quarter, and sales in the third quarter grew by a very strong 27% in U.S. dollars and 37% organically, driven by broad-based strength across most automotive applications and particularly strong growth once again in sales to electric and hybrid electric vehicle applications. The mobile networks market represented 5% of our sales in the quarter, and sales increased by a strong 19% versus prior year and 15% organically as growth in our sales to mobile service providers was only partially offset by a moderation of sales to equipment manufacturers. You may go ahead. You may go ahead. You may go ahead. You may go ahead. Now is the overall market having some piece of inventory build, that may very well be, but I think that when you look at our overall performance at roughly 15%, as you say, organic growth expectation for the year compared to an industry and industry peers, who are quite a bit below that, you would probably come away thinking to quite a bit of that to share gains. You may go ahead. You may go ahead. You may go ahead. You may go ahead. You may go ahead. You may go ahead. You may go ahead. You may go ahead."
