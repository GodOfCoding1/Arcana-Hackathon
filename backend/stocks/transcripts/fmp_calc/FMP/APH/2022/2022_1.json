Relative to the first quarter of 2021, sales in the Harsh Environment Solutions segment were $728 million and increased 16% in US dollars and organically. The mobile networks market represented 5% of our sales in the first quarter and sales in this market grew from prior year by a stronger-than-expected 14% in U.S. dollars and 5% organically as strength from products sold directly to network operators, together with the benefit of acquisitions more than offset a moderation of our sales to equipment OEMs."
