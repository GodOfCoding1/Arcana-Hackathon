    "content": " We achieved GAAP net income of $9.3 million, compared to a net loss of $5 million in last year's second quarter. Driving this improvement was performance of the investment portfolio, which generated $10.5 million in revenue in the quarter compared with $3.2 million in the prior year second quarter. Second quarter saw a strong trend in annuity direct written premiums on a statutory accounting basis, which were $156 million for the second quarter of 2022, up 59% compared to $98.1 million at first quarter of 2022 and up from $125.9 million in the second quarter of 2021, a year-over-year growth rate of 24%. Overall, we received $3.2 million in ceding commission fees during the second quarter of 2022, compared to $4.9 million in the second quarter of 2021. With the positive trends we saw in the second quarter and the premium written at the start of the third quarter, along with the backlog in process, we're confident in the anticipated premiums written being in the range of $500 million to $600 million for the year."
