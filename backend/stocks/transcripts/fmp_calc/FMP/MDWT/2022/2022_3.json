    "content": " For the third quarter of 2022, we achieved GAAP net income of $7.4 million compared to a net loss of $3.1 million in last year's third quarter. Driving this improvement was an increase in written premium at $255.5 million for the quarter, supporting performance of the investment portfolio, which generated $12.9 million in revenue in the quarter compared with $6.2 million in the prior year third quarter. Third quarter saw strong trends in annuity direct written premiums on a statutory accounting basis, which were $255.5 million for the third quarter of 2022, up 63.8% compared to $156 million for the second quarter of 2022, which was up 59% compared to $98.1 million at first quarter 2022 and up from $117.9 million in the third quarter of 2021. Ceded premium was $113.7 million in the third quarter of 2022, or 44.5% compared with $60.1 million in the third quarter of last year or 51%. Given the close of the additional reinsurance arrangement at the end of the third quarter and the current margins being generated on the retained business, we now anticipate ceding approximately 40% to 45% of new business overall for the year. Given the increase in premiums written expected for the year now and the impact that will have on premium taxes, technology support and product fees, we now expect general and administrative expenses on a management basis, a non-GAAP measure, to be within approximately $31 million to $32 million for the full year 2022."
