    "content": " Driving this improvement was an increase in direct written premium on a statutory accounting basis at $715.8 million for the year, more of which was retained and supported the performance of the investment portfolio, which generated $35.1 million in revenue for the year compared to $15.7 million in the prior year. We saw strong annuity direct written premiums continue in the fourth quarter, which were $206.2 million, down slightly from the third quarter of 2022, but up 97.9% compared to $104.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2021."
