    "content": " Moving to our wealth management business, trust, investment and other servicing fees were $454 million, down 7% compared to the prior year and down 5% from the prior quarter. Assets under management for our wealth management clients were $351 billion at quarter end, down 16% year-over-year and up 5% on a sequential basis. Yes, I can--first of all, the thing that we look at to litmus test how we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re doing from an expense management perspective is still expense to trust fees, and even pulling out the charges from this quarter, being anywhere near 120, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not where the business is going to be in the long run. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve also noted GFO was much stronger than the regions, but again that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to ebb and flow over time; but organic growth the way we have calculated it and communicated it historically was negative in the regions for the quarter, and call it flat for GFO--actually, slightly positive GFO if you think about it on a year-over-year basis. Just to give you some color there, we know base pay is going to come online in second quarter - that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to be a $20 million lift, and then to severance activity, we think that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to help us help offset that a little bit, probably $5 million to $7 million on a quarterly basis starting in second, third quarter. But you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re right in that sitting at 10:8, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a much better position, and then back to this concept of $1.4 billion in AOCI pulling a par over the next several years, plus the return on equity in the business is still attractive, so we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re still each quarter accreting capital, so no reason we won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be in the market at some point."
