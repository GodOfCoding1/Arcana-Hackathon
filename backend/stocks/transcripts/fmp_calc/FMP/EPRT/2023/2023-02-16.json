    "content": " As our fourth quarter results indicate, our portfolio continues to perform at a high level with unit level coverage of 4x, occupancy of 99.9%, and same-store rent growth of 1.6%, which speaks to the de minimis credit losses that we experienced in 2022 as our weighted average contractual rent escalations are approximately 1.6% per annum. During the fourth quarter, we invested $328 million through 39 separate transactions at a weighted average cash yield of 7.5%, which was up 40 basis points versus the prior quarter. In terms of dispositions, we sold 26 properties this quarter for $75.5 million in net proceeds at a 6.9% weighted average cash yield and a weighted average unit level coverage ratio of 2.1x. Lastly, I'll mention that our current investment pipeline, the outlook for our core portfolio and our continued strong performance at the end of 2022 provided us with the basis to maintain our 2023 AFFO per share guidance range of $1.58 to $1.64, which as Pete mentioned, implies a more than 5% year-over-year growth at the midpoint. Please proceed with your question. Please proceed with your question. Please proceed with your question. Please proceed with your question. And we feel \u00e2\u0080\u0093 I would say we feel incrementally much better today than we did when we first issued guidance based upon some of the factors you mentioned, our execution in the fourth quarter, the dynamics in the sale leaseback market, and quite frankly, the first quarter pipeline that we see, but it's still early in the year and we'll certainly continue to evaluate guidance and as the year progresses, but at this point we're just affirming our guidance.
