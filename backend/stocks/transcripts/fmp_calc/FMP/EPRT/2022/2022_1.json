    "content": " In terms of investments, during the quarter, we invested $238 million into 105 properties at a weighted average cash yield of 7%. Total revenue was up $21.6 million, or 44.4% versus the same period in 2021, totaling $70.1 million for the quarter, which reflects the benefits of our 2021 investment activity, and nearly 85% of our $238 million of Q1, 2022 investments closing before March. Lastly, I'll also reiterate Pete's important note that our current investment pipeline outlook for the core  portfolio and strong performance this quarter, provided us with the basis to increase our 2022 AFFO per share guidance range to $1.50 to $1.53, which imply a 13% year-over-year growth at the midpoint. Please proceed with your question. Please proceed with your question. And I would assume that from a modeling perspective, you would assume mid quarter convention, which would be mid Feb, that doing $238 million a deal wouldn't cause a $0.03 positive impact, especially given the things you just talked about, which are negatives, right? Please proceed with your question. Please proceed with your question. All that said, I wouldn't expect our disposition activity to deviate materially from what we've done in the past, kind of that $15 million to $20 million quarterly average would be a good barometer there. Please proceed with your question. And we've grown our quarterly investment activity from $125 million a quarter to close to $200 million a quarter, since coming public back in 2018, and there's nothing that would indicate. Please proceed with your question. Please proceed with your question. Please proceed with your question. Please proceed with your question."
