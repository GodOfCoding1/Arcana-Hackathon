    "content": " Looking out to the back half of the year, we see our investment pace trending towards our trailing 8-quarter average at modestly higher cap rates, which, along with the recent closing of our $400 million unsecured term loan, supports our decision to increase our 2022 AFFO per share guidance to a range of $1.52 to $1.54 from a previous range of $1.50 to $1.53. In terms of dispositions, we sold 8 properties this quarter for $26.1 million in net proceeds at a 6.2% weighted average cash yield with a weighted average unit-level coverage ratio of 1.1x. The notable elements of our reported operating results for the second quarter of 2022 are as follows: Total revenue was up $14.4 million or 25.2% versus the same period in 2021 totaling $71.4 million for Q2 2022, which reflects the impact of our net investment activity and the performance of our tenant base. Our nominal AFFO totaled $50.6 million for the quarter, up $10.7 million over the same period in 2021, which on a fully diluted per share basis was $0.38, an increase of 12% versus Q2 2021. Lastly, I'll reiterate that our current investment pipeline, outlook for the core portfolio and strong performance this quarter provided us with a basis to increase our 2022 AFFO per share guidance range to the $1.52 to $1.54 that Pete mentioned, which implies a 14% year-over-year growth rate at the midpoint. Pete, just kind of going back to the disposition pool that you guys are thinking about and just kind of reviewing the last trailing 8 quarters, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sort of a mix of what appears to be sort of risk mitigation in terms of low coverage-type assets being sold as well as maybe some more median credit issues."
