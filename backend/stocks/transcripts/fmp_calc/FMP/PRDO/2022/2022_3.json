    "content": " For the third quarter of 2022, total company operating income decreased by 22.5% to $29.3 million as compared to an operating income of $37.9 million in the prior year quarter. Total revenue for the quarter was $168.4 million or approximately 3.2% lower than the prior year quarter, primarily driven by lower total student enrollments at AIU System and continued growth in the number of students participating in the corporate partnership program, especially at CTU. Operating income of $31.5 million during the quarter was $9.7 million lower versus the prior year quarter primarily due to the decrease in revenue, while operating expenses remained relatively optimized in line with total enrollment trends. As it relates to the fourth quarter, we expect adjusted operating income to be between $25.5 million to $28.5 million as compared to $42 million in the prior year quarter, with adjusted earnings per diluted share for the fourth quarter to range between $0.27 and $0.30 per diluted share versus $0.40 in the fourth quarter of 2021."
