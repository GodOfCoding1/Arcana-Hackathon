    "content": " For the second quarter of 2022, total company operating income decreased by 5.6% to $33.9 million as compared to an operating income of $36 million in the prior year quarter. Total revenue for the quarter was $167.7 million, or approximately 4.5% below prior year quarter, primarily driven by lower total student enrollments. As it relates to our segments, total student enrollments as of June 30, 2022 decreased by 2.3% at CTU and by 14.5% at AIU System as compared to the prior year quarter end. However, we believe that once changes to our marketing processes annualize beginning with the third quarter and as student engagement continues to improve, the rate of decline in total student enrollments should lessen in the second half of 2022. Second quarter revenue at CTU was $100.5 million or 1.5% lower than the prior year quarter, primarily due to lower total enrollments at CTU. Revenue was $66.9 million for the quarter, resulting in a decrease of 8.6%, primarily due to lower total enrollments at AIU System. Second quarter operating losses increased to $9.8 million versus $8.7 million in the prior year quarter, primarily due to increased legal fees including those associated with the responses to the Department of Education relating to loan forgiveness applications by former students as well as acquisition-related expenses. For the third quarter of 2022, we expect adjusted operating income to be in the range of $28 million to $30 million as compared to $46.3 million in the prior year quarter with adjusted earnings per diluted share to range between $0.28 to $0.30 per diluted share versus $0.45."
