    "content": " For the first quarter of 2022, QualTek's revenue was $148.2 million, an increase of 24.4% year-over-year. We increased our 24-month backlog to $2.2 billion, positioned our recovery logistics business to meet ever changing demands of our power/grid and telecom customers by adding additional leadership and resources. First quarter telecom revenue increased 24.6% to $132.7 million, compared to $106.5 million for the first quarter of 2021. First quarter Renewable and Recovery segment revenue was $15.5 million with adjusted EBITDA of $5.3 million, an increase over the same period last year of revenue of $12.6 million and adjusted EBITDA of $2.9 million. I know our peers have talked in their calls, but as you get into Q3, everyone is literally going to be over 100% capacity on people and really for us the keen focus is matching materials to build schedule but also matching people and making sure that we have the labor resources necessary to build and that's really where we're focused right now. So I think our optimism really stems around just the vast amount of projects that have to be built and opportunities that we're seeing, I think for the next quarter or so, we're going to be at a pretty steady run rate in that business, a lot of projects have been delayed or pushed out into 2023 because of materials."
