    "content": " Total company adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $15.7 million, a decrease from the prior year, same quarter which is attributable to the timing of the 2022 hurricane season and inflationary pressures. Moving to our Renewables and Recovery Logistics segment, in previous years the third quarter has been our most profitable time of the year for our business, as the timing of the hurricane season has generated significant demand from our recovery of logistics services. Third quarter 2022 Renewable and Recovery segment revenue was $27.8 million with adjusted EBITDA of $8.7 million, a decrease over the same period last year of revenue of $79.9 million and adjusted EBITDA of $38.2 million. Your line is open. Your line is open. I'm really confused on the backlog you guys have call it $675 million in revenue this year plus or minus and telecommunications, but $2.4 billion in backlog, which should lead to great visibility because it's kind of unprecedented versus trailing 12 versus your peers like Dycom and MasTec. So the demand for our services from our largest customers in Q3 caused us to build and ramp fast, as we spoke about with margins, there's a lot of pressure on margins particularly in wage and fuel inflation that has continued through the course of this year. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open."
