    "content": " We ended the year with $519 million in revenue, up 68% year-over-year, improved overall efficiency and achieved positive free cash flow for the second year in a row. And just to your comment about the G2 rating, I think this shows exactly our strategy that because those products are built on top of the Work OS platform, they already are pretty mature, they offer a lot of advanced features, and we're able to compete in each one of those markets and achieve high ratings in customers, which is perfectly kind of what we expected and a big part of our strategy as we build those products. Just to add to what Eran said, let's say we increased the headcount in more than 50% and we believe we are now well positioned to grow to 2023 and beyond in terms of sales and marketing headcount with regards to going upmarket as well. Having said that, the situation there is very stable, like you said, and we do see a very healthy top line demand that Eran mentioned with our performance marketing and getting new customers to join monday. I was wondering if you could talk about how we should think about leverage going forward, especially as you add new features and roll out CRM's existing customers and invest in new products, like monday DB."
