    "content": " I would say that the additional new products that we launched last quarter definitely also make a big impact on the customers, our ability to sell more products overtime and expand their usage. Also in regard to your question about consolidation, I think that kind of in addition to what Eliran said with the macro economy, we see here a great opportunity for us as a company, because a lot of our customers realize that they can do much more with monday as a platform. The fact that we're actually getting more momentum with customers with 10 plus users and enterprise accounts also improving our gross retention, we usually don't disclose this number but this is getting better as we continue to move up market. I don't think we're going to see like immediate impact in terms of our already great momentum in the enterprise customers, it might take some more time to kind of have another growth on top of the already existing growth that we have. But I think if we continue to deliver the growth and improved margins as we see now, so potentially with regards to free cash flow, as we said in the past, it's going to be low double digits free cash flow as a percentage of revenue by the end of the year."
