    "content": " We posted strong growth with enterprise customers, saw continued momentum in our new Work OS product suite with monday CRM exceeding expectations, scaled our global workforce and operations, and did it all while generating positive adjusted free cash flow. Brent, your line is now open. Your line is now open, please go ahead. Your line is now open, please go ahead. So it's definitely a different conversation in terms of like the length of when we talk to new customers, the length it takes to create -- to close a deal, the number of people involved and those kind of things are happening now. So historically if you look at Monday, five years ago, and I think I mentioned it in the past, it was an 80% to 90% performance marketing, but over time, we introduced a sales lead organization and that included salespeople, partners, customer success managers, and obviously the marketplace. Your line is now open, please go ahead. Brent, your line is now open."
