So we can have more targeted marketing to those audiences, as opposed to having like a more of a broader broadcast to a mass audience when we talk about the work with having those independent products will allow us to have more specific targeting resulting in what we already seen early signs of lower customer acquisition costs, and, you know, better adoption in terms of acquiring new customers. It's still early days, but as I've mentioned, from what we already see, by releasing those products, and doing although limited, but some are getting to them, we see a lot of efficiency in terms of customer acquisition, and profits and other growth opportunity in terms of go-to-market."
