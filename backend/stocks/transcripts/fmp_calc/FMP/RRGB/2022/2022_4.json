    "content": " Our guidance for 2023 is as follows: total revenue of approximately $1.3 billion, restaurant level operating profit of at least 13% inclusive of investments in the guest experience, primarily in labor. I think broadly what I may say is, the proof points that we're going to be looking for that confirm to us that we're on the right track are sequential improvements in guest traffic, sequential improvements in guest satisfaction scores, which we're seeing by the way, and sequential improvements in restaurant level operating profit."
