    "content": " Importantly, we believe we are effectively positioned to realize our large market opportunity and we are currently focused on three key objectives, one, increasing dispensing MedCenters and optimizing utilization to drive profitable growth, two, expanding pharmacy technology, leveraging Epic Willow and McKesson enterprise RX integrations, and three, producing costs across the enterprise. I think on the utilization side, we\u2019ve seen utilization, I think come back sort of the pre-COVID market based on what we\u2019re hearing from our partners, with their patient visits and that, that component and then also what we\u2019re seeing on the prescription side coming out of not only our new clinics, but our new SpotRx MedCenters, as well as our existing base."
