    "content": " We grew pro forma adjusted EBITDA in Q2 by 5%, a repeat of last quarter's performance, which is particularly noteworthy given the strength of last year's second quarter. It's therefore not surprising that as our technology clients experience challenges, they will pare back their advertising expenditures, but we've used this as a cyclical dynamic, not a secular challenge, and continue to realize the benefits of having category diversification in our advertising business, subscription revenues by 11% in the second quarter. We reported pro forma revenue from continuing operations of $337.4 million for the second quarter as compared with $330 million for the prior-year period, reflecting growth of 2.2%. Pro forma adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations was $118 million for Q2 2022 as compared with $112.1 million for the prior-year period, reflecting growth of 5.3%. Additionally, the company's Q2 2022 other revenues grew 45% year-over-year to $10.6 million driven by our Humble Bundle publishing business. For the last 12 months, total revenue growth was 12% again, in part reflecting FX headwinds, and while second quarter organic growth reflects a 5% decline or minus 3% adjusted for FX, this is compared with our 2021 second quarter during which organic growth was 20%. So, there's obviously managing the existing business and generating the kind of earnings growth that that we experienced in this quarter, and the kind of earnings and growth that we are guiding to for the year, 9% EPS growth doesn't just happen in an environment like this with the pressures we have."
