    "content": " One, because of the increased economic uncertainties and the disruption in the capital markets, we believe that, that has curtailed some of the capital expenditures by MVE's customers for the larger cryogenic systems and freezers towards smaller units. And then just to emphasize on what Mark said, is if you look at the Cryoport Systems revenue, if you look at overall growth year-over-year, it's 25.4%. We haven't quantified that at this point\n And maybe just a few things to point out for you when you look at that relationship and the business initiatives, specifically looking at the clinical trials, the Cryro Systems Support, we mentioned there's about 30% of those trials or 190 triclinical trials that are allogeneic therapies. If you look at the number of clinical trials we're supporting, the 80 Phase III trials that we are supporting, there's going to be a significant demand for Cryoport solutions and so that's really the main driver for a lot of the business initiatives that we have for some of the innovation that we have in terms of new technology, software and shippers. So if you look at the services revenue of $33.3 million for the quarter, it's up year-over-year, 8%. In summary, the third quarter was a challenge where we experienced a plethora of economic pressures that impacted revenue despite these short-term external issues, we continue to see solid demand in our target markets from primary cell and gene manufacturer customers demonstrated by Cryoport Systems growth and continued momentum as evidenced by the increased number of clinical programs we support."
