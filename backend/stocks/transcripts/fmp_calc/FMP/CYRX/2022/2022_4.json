    "content": " The regenerative medicine market continued its development in 2022 as one of the fastest-growing therapeutic segments while Asian demand remained robust our commercial revenue ramp was partially impacted sequentially, due to our clients' continued cell therapy manufacturing capacity constraints shortages of Fludarabine and a pause in the shipment of ancillary therapy dosage to biostorage for a separate client due to their supply chain issues. Part of the reason for our confidence today is that 2022 marked a year of significant achievement for Cryoport as reflected in our adjusted EBITDA which is $13.7 million for the year, we continue to make significant strategic investments to build out our informatic competencies, global supply chain center network, manufacturing capacities bioservice offerings and capabilities to support and accelerate our growth. But more importantly Jerry talked about some of the initiatives that we've put in place during 2022 and expanding our bioservices in Houston and New Jersey, the acquisition of Cell&Co which adds bioservice capabilities in Europe and then a number of key new product introductions in Q2 of this year. I mean, I think, one thing to have in mind looking at last year is the fact that there was a onetime event in the New Prague facility that had an impact on the revenue of about $9.4 million."
