Your line is open. As I said in some of my remarks, we anticipate costs, even though they're more back-end loaded because of a lot of the turnarounds and the maintenance work that's happening in the second half, we expect to be right in line with what we would have thought coming into the year. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open."
