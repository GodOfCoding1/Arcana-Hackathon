    "content": " In addition to the onboarding of new vendors and the impact of several large customers not taking a portion of their early pay discounts, our gross profit as a percentage of adjusted gross billings was 5.1% versus 5.0% and as a percentage of net sales was 17.7% compared to 16.4% in the prior quarter. The slight increase in SG&A was attributable to the following: variable commission expense attributed to the increased sales volume, acquisition-related costs that are separately identified on the income statement, acceleration of the amortization expense from our UK ERP also specified on the income statement, and the onboarding of our Spinnakar team which as I mentioned previously, did not have a meaningful contribution in Q3, but will have a meaningful contribution in Q4. Vincent, your line is now open. Please ask your question. Please ask your question. As we look into Q4, Howard, we're going to add somewhere between just on Spinnakar's performance somewhere between $10 million to $20 million, is a good range right now, much lower than that in the six-week sub period that you referred to, probably slightly over $1 million in adjusted gross billings with a nice GP associated with that. Please ask your question. Please ask your question. Vincent, your line is now open. Please ask your question."
