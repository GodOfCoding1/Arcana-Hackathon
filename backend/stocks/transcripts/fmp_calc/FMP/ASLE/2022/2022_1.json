    "content": " Adjusted EBITDA during the quarter was $29.9 million or 24.4% of total sales, setting another single-quarter record compared to $16.5 million or 28.3% of sales in the prior year. In the first quarter, we sold $51.9 million of flight equipment that included 6 aircraft and 4 engines in the quarter. Our first quarter revenue was $122.8 million, which included $75.9 million of flight equipment sales. First quarter Asset Management Solutions, or AMS, revenue, increased to $74.5 million from $29.3 million in the first quarter of 2022, primarily on account of the flight equipment sales mentioned before. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $23.8 million in the first quarter compared to $6.9 million in the first quarter of 2021, primarily from higher payroll expenses on account of higher wages and the hiring of additional workers. Adjusted for noncash equity-based compensation and mark-to-market adjustments related to our private warrants, adjusted net income was $22.2 million in the first quarter and $10.3 million in the first quarter of 2021. First quarter adjusted EBITDA was $29.9 million or 24.4% of revenue, while adjusted EBITDA in the corresponding year-ago period was $16.5 million or 28.3% of sales. In addition, adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter of 2021 reflected the benefit from $6.4 million in Payroll Support Program proceeds, for which, there were no corresponding proceeds in the first quarter of '22. As a result of strong first quarter performance and a supportive outlook for the year, we are reaffirming our guidance calling for revenue of $420 million to $450 million and adjusted EBITDA of $80 million to $90 million in 2022."
