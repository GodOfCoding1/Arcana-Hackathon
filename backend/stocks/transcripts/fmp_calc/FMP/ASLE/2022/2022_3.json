    "content": " During the quarter, our flight equipment sales were just $2.7 million, which included two engines compared to $27.4 million in the prior year period, which included three aircraft and one engine. Our third quarter revenue was $51 million, which included $2.7 million of flight equipment sales comprising of two engines. Revenue in the third quarter of 2021 was $73.3 million and included $27.4 million of flight equipment sales, which consisted of three aircraft and one engine. If we exclude flight equipment sales, our third quarter revenue would have been $48.3 million compared to $45.9 million in the third quarter of 2021. Third quarter Asset Management Solutions, or AMS, revenue declined 57.9% to $20.6 million in the third quarter of 2022, primarily due to lower flight equipment sales. Leasing revenue of $7.8 million in the third quarter of 2022 was close to third quarter 2021 leasing revenue of $8 million, as engine demand from wide-body freighter operators partially offset lower revenues from aircraft leasing with only one aircraft on lease during the current quarter. Excluding flight equipment sales, our third quarter AMS revenue would have been $17.9 million compared to $21.5 million in the third quarter of 2021. Adjusted for noncash equity-based compensation, mark-to-market adjustments related to our private warrants, secondary offering costs and relocation costs, adjusted net loss was $1.9 million in the third quarter as compared to adjusted net income of $9.2 million in the third quarter of 2021. As a result of our strong performance during the first three quarters of the year and having closed on all of the remaining flight equipment sales that had been contemplated in our full year guidance, we are reaffirming our '22 guidance for revenue of $420 million to $450 million and adjusted EBITDA of $80 million to $90 million."
