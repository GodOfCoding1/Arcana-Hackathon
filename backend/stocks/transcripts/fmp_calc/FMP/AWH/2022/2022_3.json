    "content": " I believe the net proceeds of $7.7 million, along with our aggressive cost containment efforts will provide adequate liquidity to sustain the company to the execution of our strategy, including the launch of OvaWatch this year, the implementation of an aggressive marketing campaign to drive provider and payer adoption of our suite of ovarian cancer risk assessments, and the development and commercial launch of EndoCheck. Our cash utilization this quarter was $8.1 million, including an $852,000 payment to Harvard\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Dana Farber Cancer Institute for the development of our endometriosis testing portfolio and $130,000 in severance payments. The 26% product revenue increases due to an increase in Ova1 test volume compared to the prior year, partially offset by a lower average unit price or AUP, which decreased from $378 in the third quarter of 2021 to $369 in the third quarter of 2022. The number of tests performed increased 29% to 5,524 during the three months ended September 30, 2022, compared to 4,281 product tests for the same period in 2021. Research and development expenses for the 3 months ended September 30, 2022 increased by $639,000 or 42%, compared to the same period in 2021. Sales and marketing expenses for the 3 months ended September 30, 2022, decreased by $1,133,000 or 22%, compared to the same period in 2021. General administrative expenses for the 3 months ended September 30, 2022, increased by $907,000 or 24%, compared to the same period in 2021."
