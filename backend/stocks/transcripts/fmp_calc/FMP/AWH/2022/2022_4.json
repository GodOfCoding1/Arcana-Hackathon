    "date": "2023-03-22 22:49:01",
    "content": " The 20% full year and 16% fourth quarter revenue increases were due to an increase in Ova1Plus test volume compared to the prior year, partially offset by a lower average unit price of $372 for the year and $369 for the fourth quarter of 2022 compared to $378 and $381 for the same period in 2021, respectively. Research and development expenses for the year increased 12% to $6 million, primarily due to costs related to our sponsored research collaboration agreements and increases in employment-related expenses, partially offset by decrease in costs attributed to clinical trials. Sales and marketing expenses decreased 13% for the year to $14.9 million and 40% for the quarter to $2.9 million, primarily due to decreases in employment-related expenses, consulting expenses and other marketing expenses, offset by an increase in travel costs. General and administrative expenses for the year increased 22% to $16.2 million, primarily due to legal costs, severance for role eliminations and incremental cost of the Executive Chairperson and costs related to our capital raise."
