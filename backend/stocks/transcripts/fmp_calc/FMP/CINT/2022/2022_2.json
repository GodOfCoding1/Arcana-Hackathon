    "content": " The main factors contributing to our higher growth base continued to be the expansion of our engagements with existing clients, the addition of 17 new clients this second quarter with annual revenue above BRL 1 million in the last 12 months and our programmatic M&A strategy. We ended the second quarter of 2022 with more than 6,700 CI&Tiers, which represents a net addition of 2,700 employees in the last 12 months or a 68% growth year-over-year. Our net revenue in the second quarter 2022 was BRL 525 million, a 66% growth year-over-year. And as the Brazilian real appreciated against these currencies during the quarter when eliminating the FX variation, our net revenue in constant currency would have been BRL 550 million, a 73% increase compared to the second quarter of last year. As Cesar mentioned, our strong revenue growth derives from our expansion within existing clients, the addition of new clients every quarter and our programmatic M&A strategy. In terms of revenue by industry verticals, Financial Services grew 50% year-over-year, Food and Beverage increased 17% and TMT grew 120% in the first half 2022 compared to the same period of last year. It's worth mentioning that adjusted EBITDA grew 17% compared to the first quarter '22 and margin improved 160 basis points sequentially due to the higher utilization rate and the price increases that happens throughout the year, as planned and as we mentioned in the previous quarter. Based on current market conditions, we expect our net revenue in the third quarter of 2022 to be at least BRL 540 million, a 46% growth year-over-year in a constant currency basis. One is cross-sales opportunities that in both ways, adding CI&T global capabilities near shore  capabilities to their operations that also drives margin improvements and also leverage their global clients in different geographies or business units."
