    "content": " Our net revenue in the third quarter of 2022 grew 49% year-over-year, of which 35 percentage points were organic growth and 14 percentage points were acquisitions. Our global talent base continues expanding, and we ended the quarter with almost 6,900 CI&Ters, a 28% growth year-over-year. Our net revenue retention rate over the past 5 years has been around 120%, which demonstrates that new logos should also expand and flourish over time, guaranteeing our sustainable growth towards 2023 and the following years. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 19.2% in the quarter, a reduction of 2.1 percentage points compared to the third quarter '21, mainly as a result of 2 factors: lower margins from recently acquired companies and an increase in G&A expenses in light of our IPO. Based on current market conditions, we expect our net revenue in the fourth quarter of 2022 to be at least BRL 605 million, a 41% growth year-over-year on a constant currency basis."
