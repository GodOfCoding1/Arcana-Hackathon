    "content": " During the quarter we delivered 2,713 homes for $1.1 billion in revenues at an average sales price of $418,000 with deliveries generally flat year-over-year, while our average sales price was up 15%. Backlog at quarter-end consisted of 4,767 sold homes valued at $2 billion, year-over-year increases of 7% and 12%, respectively. During the second quarter of 2022, net income increased 35% to a second quarter record $158.7 million or $4.78 per diluted share compared to $117.9 million or $3.47 per diluted share in the prior year quarter. Home sales revenues for the second quarter grew to $1.1 billion, a 13% increase compared to year ago levels. This improvement in revenues was driven by a 15% year-over-year increase in our average sales price to $418,000 and the delivery of 2,713 homes in the quarter. Versus the prior year, we increased our quarter-end backlog 7% to 4,767 homes valued at $2 billion, a 12% increase. We ended the quarter with a strong financial position, including $2 billion in stockholders equity, a 31% year-over-year increase and $820 million in total liquidity. And then, as we look at -- having opened up new communities in the first and second quarter and started a number of homes in those communities, we just don't have that many homes finishing here in the third quarter that are going to be made available for sale that are really going to cater to what the buyers are looking for today in terms of near-term completions."
