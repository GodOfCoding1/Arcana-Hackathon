    "content": " Our net interest income on a tax equivalent basis, adjusted for acquisition-related accretion and PPP, was $64.1 million, an annualized increase of 20.8% from the second quarter. For the third quarter, our beta on total deposits moved to 31%, and for the full rate height cycle to date, our beta on total deposits is 20%, which is still below our beta from the last period of rising rates that ended in 2019, which was 30%. In addition, the company's criticized loans and classified loans to total loans and leases at the end of the third quarter, improved to 2.35% and 1.29%, respectively, as compared to 2.37% and 1.43% from the prior quarter. As Larry mentioned, we strengthened our total risk-based capital ratio during the quarter, with our subordinated debt issuance and stronger earnings posting an improvement of 115 basis points to 14.55%, while our tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio declined to 7.68% at quarter end, compared to 8.11% at the end of June. Hey, good morning, guys. Hey, good morning, guys. And so, just to recap what's happened and give you a little bit of guidance going forward, so we saw a pretty significant impact of accretion in the first quarter of the transaction, which would have been Q2 at $1.7 million."
