    "content": " After adjusting for the one-time costs associated with the Guaranty Bank acquisition, our adjusted net income for the year was $114.9 million and our adjusted EPS was $6.80 per diluted share, up 14.8% and 8.5% respectively over our 2021 results. This strategy includes at a minimum generating organic loan and lease growth of 9% per year funded by core deposits, growing fee-based income by at least 6% per year, and limiting annual operating expense increases to 5% per year. In addition, the company's criticized loans and classified loans to total loans and leases at the end of the fourth quarter were fairly static at 2.68% and 1.08%, respectively, as compared to 2.35% and 1.29% from the prior quarter. We feel really good about not only the intra-quarter improvement and that traction on fixed rate loan pricing, but part of the challenge we have with margin in the fourth quarter is, we saw a very significant, more than we had forecasted, shift from noninterest-bearing and low beta deposits into higher beta and CDs. We've seen no degradation in credit that's apparent in the numbers as you see with our classified numbers coming down, our NPA numbers coming down in the quarter, but we all expect at some point for things to start to return to more normal, there's certainly nothing in the numbers that show that that's going to happen in the first quarter or two of next year \u00e2\u0080\u0093 or this year, excuse me, depending on what happens to the economy, certainly, there's some of that possible later in the year, but it's not showing up yet."
