    "content": " Plus, if you exclude amortization expense and the non-routine charges mentioned in the slides, then SG&A would have declined even further, declining from 30.3% of sales in Q3 of last year to 26.8% of sales this quarter. And if you exclude the after-tax impacts of the non-routine WPS charges and amortization expense, then our EPS would have increased by an even stronger 17.8% to $0.86 this quarter compared to $0.73 of non-GAAP EPS in the third quarter of last year. If you exclude the sizable increase in amortization expense from our three acquisitions last year, then segment profit as a percentage of sales would have been 21.8% this quarter compared to 22.4% in last year's third quarter. And if you exclude the $1.8 million of nonrecurring costs that were incurred to streamline the WPS business, segment profit increased 58.2% in the quarter."
