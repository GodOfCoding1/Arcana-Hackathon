    "content": " So the key financial takeaways this quarter are strong organic sales growth, nicely improved EPS, solid performance in each of our two divisions, and a continued commitment to returning funds to our shareholders. Organic sales grew in each of our two segments, but with the stronger U.S. dollar, foreign currency translation reduced total company sales by 6.6%, thus bringing total sales growth to 0.3%. If you exclude amortization expense, then SG&A would have declined from 28.9% of sales in Q1 of last year to 26.8% of sales this quarter. If you exclude amortization expense from both the current year and the prior year, then our non-GAAP pre-tax earnings would have increased by 11.3%, increasing from $48.5 million in Q1 of last year to $54 million this quarter."
