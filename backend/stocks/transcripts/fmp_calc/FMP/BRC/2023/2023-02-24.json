    "content": " So, the key financial takeaways are another quarter of healthy organic sales growth, nicely improved EPS, organic sales, and segment profit growth in each of our two divisions and significantly improved operating cash flow and free cash flow, all of which helped us overcome the year-over-year appreciation of the U.S. dollar and deliver another very respectable quarter. At the same time, our Europe and Australia segment showed strong organic sales growth of 5.2% this quarter, but this was offset by a substantial year-over-year strengthening of the U.S. dollar versus the Aussie dollar and the other major European currencies. What I can say and I guess where I'm going to leave this is, we do look at our gross margin because if you take all of our custom products and you blend them together and you look at what we're experiencing in terms of labor costs and material costs and the other factors that come into play, if we're essentially treading water, we should at the very least maintain our gross margin for given this particular blend of products that we have in any given quarter."
