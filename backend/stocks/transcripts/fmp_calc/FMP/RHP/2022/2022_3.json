    "content": " That is what is impressive as our hotels delivered $62 million more in revenue, $28 million more in adjusted EBITDAre, despite 5.6 fewer points of occupancy compared to the last pre-pandemic third quarter of 2019. For example, another quarterly record was our leisure transient ADR of 288 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 $288, up 42% over the third quarter of 2019 and adding $5 sequentially to the previous all-time leisure ADR record set in the second quarter of this year. That is evidenced by another record total banqueting revenue of $122 million was the highest all-time quarterly banquet spend by groups across the Gaylord brand, surpassing the previous record set just prior in the second quarter of this year. We're also particularly pleased with the Gaylord National, as the broad repositioning of this hotel's F&B offerings layered on top of the strong banquet performance of groups in general that I just mentioned, delivered an $8 million increase in F&B profitability on an incremental $9 million of F&B revenue were a flow-through of 88% in this department when compared to the third quarter of 2019. On a total basis, Opry Entertainment Group delivered $21.1 million of adjusted EBITDAre in the third quarter, which was within our updated guidance range. Looking into 2023, as Colin noted, we ended the third quarter with 46.6 points of net group occupancy already on the books for next year at an average rate of over $221. Total consolidated adjusted EBITDAre for the third quarter of $150.1 million was above the high end of our guidance range of $146 million, reflecting the outperformance of our Hospitality segment as described by Colin. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open."
