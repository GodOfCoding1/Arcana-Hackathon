    "content": " Sizeable volume mix growth, price increases, and the incremental contribution of HRA revenues for two months overcame significant inflationary pressures on costs, the Latin America and ScarAway divestitures, and the higher operating expenses in the quarter versus last year, which included $8 million of costs not expected to repeat. On an adjusted basis, net income from continuing operations was $59 million and adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was $0.43 per share, or $0.49 per share on a constant currency basis versus $0.50 per share in the prior year quarter. Gross profits grew 8.7% or 17% on a constant currency basis versus prior year, driven by higher volumes and increased pricing as well as the addition of HRA. The bulk of the 37 to 39, let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s face it, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re getting a big piece of that from HRA, so the depressed core margin is still for the grabbing, and this whole supply chain initiative that I talked about, $100 million to $300 million, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re talking--you know, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s meant to get gross margin growth and progression for years to come, not just for \u00e2\u0080\u009923. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve come through the transformative years and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re very focused on now accelerating margins and profitable growth, but it was notable to me as the quarter was going on, sort of the win after win after win we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve had, which were the results of years--you know, the filing wins, the Nasonex switch, the filing of HRA, the results of HRA being included, share gains across the board in the company, and you can feel it, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s vibrant in the company."
