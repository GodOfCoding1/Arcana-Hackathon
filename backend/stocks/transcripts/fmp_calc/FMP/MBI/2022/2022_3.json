    "content": " The company reported a consolidated GAAP net loss of $34 million or negative $0.67 per share for the third quarter of 2022, compared to a consolidated GAAP net loss of $123 million or a negative $2.49 per share for the third quarter ended September 30, 2021  The lower net loss this quarter was largely driven by a loss in LAE benefit at MBIA Corp due to higher discount rates applied to its wrapped first lien RMBS, which caused case reserves net of recoveries to decline, lower loss in LAE at National, higher investment income, and mark-to-market gains on our interest rate swaps associated with our legacy ALM business due to higher interest rates. MBIA Inc's book value per share decreased to a negative $15.70 per share as of September 30, 2022, versus a negative $5.73 per share as of December 31, 2021, primarily due to unrealized losses on investments recorded to other comprehensive income, driven by higher interest rates and wider credit spreads, as well as the $143 million year-to-date net loss."
