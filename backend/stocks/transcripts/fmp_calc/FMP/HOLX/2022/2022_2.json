    "content": " First, we will discuss Q2 growth in light of the macro environment, including updates on the breast health chip shortage we spoke to in Q1; second, provide progress on acquisitions turning organic in our third quarter; and third, highlight our additional efforts to lean into ESG and how our purpose, passion and promise are elevating women\u2019s health around the world. Last year in its first full quarter post-acquisition, Biotheranostics posted $13 million of revenue, which was more than 30% higher than their best quarter prior to the pandemic. COVID related items, inclusive of a small amount of discontinued product revenue are expected to be approximately $35 million in the third quarter and $215 million for the full year. And frankly, the additional access we have gotten to a lot of the health ministers of the world through both COVID time as well as the Hologic Global Women\u2019s Health Index to, I think start to get women\u2019s health moved up the priority list, where we will be able to get more screening guidelines and things to put in place in the coming years, particularly in Western Europe."
