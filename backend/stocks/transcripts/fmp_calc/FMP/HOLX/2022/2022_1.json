    "content": " As a result, we are raising our revenue and earnings guidance significantly as we expect upside from COVID-19 testing, along with strength in our diagnostics and surgical businesses to more than compensate for temporary supply chain challenges that have emerged in our breast health business. As an example, leveraging our leadership in women's health, our vaginitis panel is off to a great start with $13 million of revenue in the first quarter, roughly 2.5x the first quarter of 2021. COVID-related items, including revenue from discontinued products and diagnostics, are expected to be approximately $50 million in the second quarter and $190 million for the full year. Yes, from an ASP perspective, certainly, pricing has held pretty nicely here, I think, roughly $20, with the overall average in the quarter, I think as we look forward, we do expect that pricing will come down, one as we renew international contracts, which are lower ASP, as well as in the U.S., when the higher -- when the public health emergency ends in this higher lower payment for the testing will probably come down. Even our psychology business is actually doing well, particularly in a few key markets in Western Europe, the overall diagnostics as we've been placing those Panthers, I think you can go back really over three, four -- three or four years now, where the molecular business outside the U.S. is oftentimes been at 20-ish percent growth rate, and if anything, it's just going to be turbocharged here. So I think on the breast health business, if we think about operating margins, certainly the service business is accretive to the operating margins, which is the biggest part of revenue for that division, Then I would say, then there's probably equal contribution from gantries and interventional from an operating module perspective."
