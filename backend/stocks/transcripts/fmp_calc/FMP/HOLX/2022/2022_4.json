    "content": " Looking forward to 2023, we are confident our international business, excluding the impact of COVID, will return to double-digit top line growth and sustain the momentum created by our strong response to COVID and from our groundbreaking initiatives like the Hologic Global Women's Health Index and our global access initiative. Lastly, in our Skeletal business, revenue of $24 million increased approximately 4% and compared to the prior year period. As it relates to our guidance, we expect Breast Health revenue to be down low double digits in our first fiscal quarter of 2023 given that the prior year was not yet impacted by supply chain shortages. COVID related items, inclusive of a small amount of discontinued product revenue are expected to be approximately $35 million in the first quarter and $130 million for the full year. And I'd also add on that when you think about in this macro environment in our initial guide for the full year to say that our margins -- operating margins are going to be at 30%, which are pretty rich compared to the industry is pretty strong results, and we're really proud of that."
