    "content": " We are very pleased to have started 2022 with an extremely strong quarter that saw record oil, natural gas and NGL revenues, adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution, which led to a first quarter cash distribution to our unitholders of $0.47 per common unit, which is also a new record for Kimbell. I\u2019ll start by reviewing our financial results from the first quarter, beginning with record oil, natural gas and NGL revenues of $65.1 million, which is an increase of 25% compared to the fourth quarter of 2021. Kimbell\u2019s first quarter 2022 average realized price per BBL of oil was $92.01 per Mcf of natural gas was $4.48, and per BBL of NGLs was $43.24 and, finally, per BOE combined was $45.69. But to your point, I think, if I look at \u2013 I think we\u2019re at, what, 15% free cash flow yield right now and 11% dividend yield, if you just use this quarter and annualize it, and things are looking better going forward obviously with what\u2019s happened to pricing."
