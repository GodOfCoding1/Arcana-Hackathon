    "content": " At Kimbell, we updated our detailed portfolio review that we initially introduced in May of 2021, and we are very pleased to report that the results of the review confirmed an estimated 19 years of drilling inventory, a superior five-year annual average PDP decline rate up 12% and only 4.5 net wells needed per year to maintain flat production. The fourth quarter run rate daily production includes only 17 days of production from the company's $270.7 million acquisition of mineral and royalty interest held formally by Austin-based Hatch Royalty that closed on December 15, 2022. Today, we are providing full year 2023 guidance, which includes production guidance that at its midpoint reflects roughly flat daily production relative to our fourth quarter 2022 run rate daily production including a full quarter of the acquired production from Hatch. We think it's even more important in that environment to pay down debt, particularly when the -- when interest rates have risen so rapidly that - the return you get from paying out our revolver is better today than it obviously was really at any point since we've gone public."
