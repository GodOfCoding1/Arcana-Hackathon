    "content": " While last quarter's record production was driven by a surge in natural gas production in Haynesville, this quarter's record performance was driven by accelerated oil-weighted activity, primarily in the Permian and Eagle Ford, which drove an 8% sequential increase in oil production. I'll start by reviewing our financial results from the third quarter, beginning with oil, natural gas, and NGL revenues of $73.9 million, a decrease of 6% from Q2 2022, primarily due to a decline in realized commodity prices. Kimbell's third quarter 2022 average realized price per barrel of oil was $92.65, per MCF of natural gas was $6.92, per barrel of NGLs was $35.50, and per BOE combined was $53.58. I would say that since we started tracking that and since we started quantifying our net DUCs and permits, this is probably the best we've ever felt, well, maybe I can just say certainly the best we've ever felt in terms of the ratio of net DUCs and permits on our acreage relative to the number of wells that need to come online in order to maintain production."
