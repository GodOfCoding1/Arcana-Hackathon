    "content": " I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m particularly pleased with the 4% organic growth \u00e2\u0080\u0093 organic production growth in the quarter, which drove record run rate production in Q2 2022, driven mainly by significant new production from multiple high interest wells in the Haynesville. As of June 30, 2022 and we had 74 rigs actively drilling on our acreage, up 1% from last quarter and representing over 10% market share of all rigs drilling in the Continental U.S. After a significant correction in natural gas prices from June highs, these prices are again trending higher, reflecting record power demand and tepid production growth. I will start by reviewing our financial results from the second quarter, beginning with record oil, natural gas and NGL revenues of $78.6 million, an increase of 21% from Q1 2022, reflecting improved realized commodity prices, coupled with growth of organic production. What I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m excited about through the years and going through the cycles, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t like the volatility right now, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been my experience with us buying high-quality royalties that as prices keep on going up like they did earlier this year, that people tend to hold on to them saying that we think prices are going to go up even further."
