    "content": " New equipment orders in the first quarter were up 8.8% at constant currency and up 10.9% on a rolling 12-month basis, contributing to backlog growth of 6% versus prior year. Turning to service, we now expect organic sales to be up 5% to 6%, an improvement from the prior outlook of 4% to 6%, driven by better than expected maintenance pricing and repair orders in the first quarter and higher confidence to execute our modernization backlog from the steps we have taken to resolve the supply chain challenges. Your line is open. So we still have a mix as China is growing at the high teens in terms of the portfolio, but really pleased that between the volume in the portfolio and the service pricing, that\u2019s why we\u2019re seeing such a nice guide in service, and we raised our outlook 5% to 6% growth there. Your line is open. Your line is open. So it was an across-the-board gain in terms of share from our China team, and I think that\u2019s what really led to the up 3% in new equipment orders and the backlog up mid-single now. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. And now that\u2019s 45% over 2 years, and already bought back $200 million of shares in the first quarter. Your line is open."
