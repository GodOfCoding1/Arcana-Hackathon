    "content": " Our weighted average portfolio grade of 2.1 was unchanged as compared to the past few quarters, and the percentage of risk rated one and two investments, the highest ratings our portfolio companies can receive accounted for 87% of the portfolio at fair value, down modestly from last quarter. Finally, for the first quarter of 2023, our Board declared a $0.41 per share quarterly cash dividend, which will be paid on April 17, 2023, to stockholders of record as of March 31, 2023. Moving to the right-hand side of the page, you'll see that our unitranche first lien investments have continued to become a more prominent percentage of our total portfolio, accounting for 66% of total portfolio fair value at year-end compared to 59% the year prior. Total investment income of $34.6 million for the fourth quarter, the highest quarterly figure we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve reported since inception compares to $29 million for the prior quarter, representing an increase of approximately 19%. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve generated significant investment income in the form of fees, dividends and accelerated amortization of OID from the Alcentra portfolio over close to the last two years having realized 136% of our cost basis with approximately $22 million of unrealized value remaining. Net realizations of $26 million in the fourth quarter, coupled with unrealized mark-to-market losses on our investments ultimately led to our total investment portfolio, holding roughly steady at approximate fair value of $1.3 billion as of December 31, 2022, down approximately $30 million quarter-over-quarter. Finally, for the first quarter of 2023, our Board declared a $0.41 per share quarterly cash dividend, which will be paid on April 17, 2023, to stockholders of record as of March 31, 2023."
