    "content": " For the third quarter, 133 out of our 136 debt investment portfolio companies representing over 99% of total debt investments at fair value made full scheduled principle and interest payments, 90% of our debt investment portfolio today is marked above $0.95 on the dollar with an average mark of approximately $0.97 . Our weighted average portfolio grade of 2.1 was unchanged as compared to the past few quarters and the percentage of risk rated 1 and 2 investments, the highest ratings our portfolio companies can receive remains unchanged at 89% of the portfolio at fair value. As of quarter end, we had investments in four portfolio companies on nonaccrual status representing 2.0% and 1.3% of our total debt investments at cost and fair value respectively. Growth deployment on the third quarter was $90 million, as you can see on the left hand side of the page, over 90% of which was in senior secured first lien and unitranche investments. Importantly, what we consider recurring yield related investment income comprised of interest income, PIK income, amortization and unused fees was up 18%, quarter-over-quarter from $22.8 million to $26.8 million the record figure for us driven by rising base rates and a growing portfolio. Positive net deployment of $30 million in the third quarter was partially offset by unrealized mark-to-market losses on our investments ultimately leading to modest portfolio growth and a total investment portfolio at fair value of $1.3 billion as of September 30, 2022 up approximately $8 million quarter-over-quarter."
