    "content": " Our net asset value per share ended the quarter at $20.69, down just over 2% as compared to the record $21.18 per share, which we reported in the prior quarter. We ended the quarter with our second largest portfolio since inception, with nearly $1.3 billion of investments at fair value across 137 portfolio companies with an average investment size of less than 1% of the total portfolio. As of quarter end, we had investments in 3 portfolio companies on nonaccrual status, representing 1.3% and 1.1% of our total debt investments at cost and fair value, respectively, as compared to 1.4% and 1.2% in the prior quarter. Gross deployment in the second quarter was $112.4 million, as you can see on the left-hand side of the page, 96% of which was in senior secured first lien and unitranche investments. If the full impact of the market rate moves this quarter had flowed through the entire quarter, we calculate that our second quarter adjusted net investment income per share would have been $0.07 higher. Additionally, as of quarter end, holding all else equal and after considering the impact of income-based incentive fees, we calculate that a 100 basis point increase in short-term rates could increase our annual earnings by approximately $0.20 per share, which would represent an 11.5% lift to our LTM adjusted net investment income per share. Importantly, interest income, excluding onetime accelerated amortization which represents the recurring component of our total revenues, grew from $21.7 million in Q1 to $22.8 million for the second quarter and was a key driver of quarter-over-quarter total investment income growth. At June 30, our stockholders' equity was $639 million, resulting in net asset value per share of $20.69 as compared to $654 million or $21.18 per share last quarter and $591 million or $20.98 per share at June 30, 2021. Our total investment portfolio at fair value of $1.3 billion as of June 30, 2022, was down approximately $3 million quarter-over-quarter given unrealized mark-to-market losses on our investments."
