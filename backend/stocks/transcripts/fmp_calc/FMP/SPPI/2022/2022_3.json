    "content": " So I think if you look at the burn rates of 2021 and then in even starting in 2022, the company was burning somewhere in the neighborhood of $30 million a quarter and I think this quarter you are seeing that burn rate going to $17.9 million which I think speaks to the discipline that we are implementing to ensure we are making thoughtful decisions in our investments as it relates to late-stage assets, because we are fully funded for the launch of ROLONTIS and ROLVEDON and that is the full test of where we go."
