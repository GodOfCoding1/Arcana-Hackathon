    "content": " The decrease in revenue for the quarter partially reflects a liquidation of legacy beauty inventory in the first quarter of 2021, ahead of last year\u2019s beauty restage, as well as a tough comparison against elevated sales in the year-ago period related to sanitizing and disinfecting products. So in total, by the end, of course the second pricing going in at the end of Q2, so in total we\u2019ll have taken mid to high single digit increases on two-thirds of the portfolio, and that is across the entire portfolio, so it will cover diapers, personal care, wipes, as well as select beauty items as well, so kind of pretty robust. We\u2019ll be doing things in the back half of the year like changing the way our subscription business works with new bundles and some more cross-category duration that we anticipate will launch in Q3, and then as we get farther in the year, things like loyalty personalization and you know other main features to really drive and improve. And do you \u2013 I guess do you lose something in the lack of I guess first-party data, maybe that you\u2019ll acquire and/or your ability to cross-sell using some of the tools you use on honest.com or do you just see this as a great opportunity to try and bring new users into the franchise and perhaps then kind of usher them into the digital side of the business as well? I think the headwinds that we\u2019re seeing as we think about the digital decline in traffic, you know really being kind of offset by the new distribution and innovation, I think we are seeing growth as we\u2019ve seen it attract data and kind of our legacy distribution is actually seeing great growth in the retail side."
