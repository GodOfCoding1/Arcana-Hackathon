    "content": " Highlights in the quarter included our performance in retail where honest growth in tracked channels continues to outpace the category, significant distribution expansion that will continue into the fourth quarter and the broadening of the Honest lifestyle brand through the integration of our rapidly growing baby clothing business. We continue to invest at a high level value of our brand with marketing spend at 14% of sales in the third quarter, recognizing the elevated cost of digital marketing as well as consumers shift to in-store shopping, we continue to optimize our marketing investment, finding higher return opportunities in areas like retail marketing, where we can cost effectively reach our consumers and support new distribution. We expect full year gross margin to be between 30% and 31%, reflecting approximately 6 00 basis points of higher supply chain costs versus 2021 and 100 basis points in incremental trade investments, supporting new distribution, offset by roughly 35 0 basis points from pricing and cost savings. But as all kind of the back half, this kind of incremental business that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re talking about from a Walmart perspective, a baby perspective with the baby clothing line, we see that contributing between 5 to 7 points of incremental growth moving forward, and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s coupled with the innovation pipeline that we have, the hit back half of the year, the benefits of pricing on an annualized basis as well as kind of expected new distribution, gives us reason to believe that 2023 is going to be a very good year for the Honest company."
