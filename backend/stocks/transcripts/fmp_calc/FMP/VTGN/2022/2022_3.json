    "content": " In addition to the milestones we achieved in our PALISADE Phase 3 program during the recent quarter, we launched our Phase 2a clinical study of PH94B in adjustment disorder with anxiety is the first study in our exploratory clinical evaluation program for PH94B and anxiety indications beyond SAD. Later this year, we also plan to initiate additional small exploratory clinical studies to assess PH94B\u2019s potential in populations suffering from anxiety disorders beyond both SAD and adjustment disorder indications, where we believe the current treatment alternatives are inadequate. This increase results primarily from expenses related to preparing for and conducting our PALISADE Phase 3 program for PH94B in SAD, including the continuation of our PALISADE-1 and PALISADE-2 clinical trials as well as initiating our PALISADE long-term safety study and our Phase 2a study of PH94B for treatment of adjustment disorder with anxiety. These studies and the continuation of non-clinical and preclinical development and outsourced manufacturing activities for both PH94B and PH10 accounted for increased expenses of approximately $3.1 million during the quarter ended December 31, 2021 compared to the same quarter of the previous fiscal year.
