    "content": " To highlight how clients are leveraging Rimini Street services globally to achieve their strategic goals across different industries, I'd like to share 2 case studies from the second quarter. Revenue for the second quarter was $101.2 million, a year-over-year increase of 10.5%. Second quarter aggregate year-over-year revenue growth in the United States was 8.8%, while growth for international clients was 12.5%. We note that the U.S. revenue growth has continued to improve over the last 4 quarters, improving from the 2021 second quarter year-over-year growth rate of more than 2% to the current year's second quarter year-over-year growth rate of 8.8%. Billings for the second quarter were $101.6 million compared to $107.3 million year-over-year, a decrease of 5.3%. Gross margin was 63.1% of revenue for the second quarter compared to 62.2% of revenue for the prior year second quarter and 63.7% of revenue on a non-GAAP basis, which excludes stock-based compensation expense compared to non-GAAP gross margin of 62.6% of revenue in the second quarter of last year. On a non-GAAP basis, which excludes stock-based compensation expense, sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue was 34.9% during the quarter compared to 35.2% in the year ago period. General and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue, excluding outside litigation costs, was 18.6% for the second quarter compared to 18% for the prior year second quarter and also declined as expected sequentially from 20.4% in the first quarter of fiscal 2022. For the second quarter, net income attributable to shareholders was $110,000 or $0.00 per diluted share compared to the prior year's second quarter loss attributable to shareholders of $4.8 million or a loss of $0.06 per diluted share. I'd also like to highlight our non-GAAP operating margin, which excludes outside litigation spend and stock-based compensation of 11.8% for the second quarter, underscoring the significant profitability potential and substantial leverage to our operating model. On a cash flow basis, for the second quarter, we generated $15 million of operating cash flow and year-to-date, we generated $60.8 million, up from $47.2 million in the prior year first half. Deferred revenue as of June 30, 2022 was approximately $300 million, up 13% from $266 million for the prior year second quarter. Backlog, which includes the sum of billed deferred revenue and noncancelable future revenue was approximately $551 million as of June 30, 2022 compared to $571 million for the prior year second quarter."
