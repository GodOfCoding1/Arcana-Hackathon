    "content": " However, as we have already seen with key sales wins in the third quarter, there is increased movement by organizations to optimize their IT spend and we believe Rimini Street is well positioned with its new broader portfolio of services to ultimately benefit from the most of background environment challenges with growth in both new client acquisitions and cross sales. To reach clients and prospects with pandemic travel restrictions nearly eliminated globally, our senior executives, including myself have restarted heavy travel to participate in a growing number of successful, in-person Rimini Street and third-party events at executive sales meetings with hundreds of clients and prospects, and to collaborate with local Rimini Street management teams to set strategy for accelerated sales growth. To highlight how clients are leveraging Rimini Street services globally to achieve their strategic goals across different industries, I would like to share two case studies from the third quarter sales wins. Gross margin was 61.5% of revenue for the third quarter compared to 65.1% of revenue for their prior year third quarter, and 62% of revenue on a non-GAAP basis, which excludes stock-based compensation expense compared to non-GAAP gross margin of 65.5% of revenue in the third quarter of last year. On a non-GAAP basis, which excludes stock-based compensation expense, sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue was 34.5% during the quarter compared to 33.2% in the year-ago period. We remain focused on making the appropriate investments needed to capitalize our growth opportunities and thus see full-year 2022 sales and marketing expenses, including the pull forward of the 2023 sales kickoff event into 2022 to be in the range of 35% to 36% on a GAAP basis and 34.1% to 35.1% non-GAAP standpoint, up 50 basis points from prior guidance ranges."
