So I find it interesting as I kind of come into the company here that the improvements have been made over the last several quarters in the value of these customers, their credit quality, their scores, the ability to buy more product and generate more revenue per customer, I think all those things are positive. But as I've been educated by the team here and looked at the results here lately, it seems like you're bending that curve a bit, and we're getting much better results where we would have expected on prior year's numbers to be higher from an attrition rate standpoint just because of the timing of those contracts coming through fishing there."
