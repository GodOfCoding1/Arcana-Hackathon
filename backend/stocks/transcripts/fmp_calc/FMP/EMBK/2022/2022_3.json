    "content": " I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll go into more detail on each of these throughout the presentation, but a quick reminder of our 2022 milestones: First, to deliver the first truck into the fleet of a carrier customer through our truck transfer program; second, to demonstrate two of the remaining five capabilities in our technological road map, bringing the total capabilities accomplished to 13 of 16 by the end of 2022; and third, to launch the backbone of the Embark Coverage Map across the Sunbelt region. Establishing the coast-to-coast backbone of the Embark Coverage Map was the third and final 2022 milestone that we laid out in the beginning of the year and is key on our path to commercialization as it provides our carrier partners the visibility they need to plan their deployment of Embark-equipped trucks, improving the ecosystem\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ability to rapidly scale following commercialization. One of the things that I would highlight about the Coast-to-Coast network is, I think this is a really useful demonstration of Embark\u00e2\u0080\u0099s asset-light approach here, where Embark is able to bring these sites online, but without going on and buying a bunch of physical facilities, and in fact, we have a lot of flexibility to scale up and scale down the actual footprint on many of these sites because of our partnership with Alterra."
