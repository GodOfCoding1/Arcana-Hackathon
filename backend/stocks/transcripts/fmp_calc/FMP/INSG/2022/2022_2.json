    "content": " From a business perspective, what we are most excited about is that, we started to see several enterprise customers convert 5G pilots into full-fledged large multi-location deployments. This means, we can earn recurring revenue each month for every device over a multiyear contract period, capturing our fair share of this emerging enterprise 5G FWA market is one of the ways we see Inseego delivering increased revenue growth, improved gross margins and sustainable positive free cash flow. We are already in pilots with multiple customers, and we expect our first launch customers this quarter, much like our other software offerings attaching 5G SD EDGE to our enterprise sales will further increase our subscription revenue streams, increase customer stickiness and expand our gross margin. Similar to Q1, our growth was again driven by demand for our 5G mobile hotspots, further uptake of our solutions by enterprise customers and steady growth in our attached software revenue, which partially offset by declines in our 4G product sales."
