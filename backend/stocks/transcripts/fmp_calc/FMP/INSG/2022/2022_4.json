    "content": " Our FY 2023 outlook also assumes a steady increase in our mix of enterprise fixed wireless business throughout the year, continued improvement in gross margin from the 30% achieved in Q4 2022 and a full realization of the over $30 million in reduction in costs recently implemented. So I'd say, anything close to like $50-ish million in revenue will get us to \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and obviously, that depends on more and more FWA, it could be even lower number than that, but that would be enough to get us cash flow positive. And that's where we've seen a bunch of variability in the business: one, 4G kind of just dwindling down as we had forecasted; and second, we basically launched a new generation of 5G hotspot here with multiple large carriers in Q3 and Q4, so there's some seasonality with the switchover, so we're seeing lower run rate on that 5G hotspot we saw that in Q4."
