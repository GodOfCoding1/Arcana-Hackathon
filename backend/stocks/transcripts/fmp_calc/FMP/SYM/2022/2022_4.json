Now I think as we're deploying these systems through these first wave of systems, we can see some significant quarter-on-quarter variability just due to the number of systems in our overall growth, but you should think about the general trend that we're trying to take those number of systems that we're deploying and pushing that to fully functional live and grow it as fast as we can. Your line is open. So in the fourth quarter, we continued to see what we had seen all of fiscal \u00e2\u0080\u009922, which was, we are bearing some costs associated with just growing fast in the COGS line along with those steel pass-through costs so that's been consistent throughout the course of fiscal '22, that does represent several 100 basis-points of gross margin impact to where we see a more structural gross margin, mid to longer-term. These initiatives to really accelerate our path with supply chain partners, we think provides us greater profit in the mid and long term in the immediate near term as obviously as is implicit in our fourth quarter and first quarter, we're investing just a little bit more to get there. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. I think our goal is to continue to start deployments of new systems and complete deployments of systems each and every quarter, you should expect that there will be some variability on a quarter in quarter out basis on, that but as you think about on the annual basis, our goal is to continue to ramp and grow this business year-on-year full year, so looking for growth. Your line is open. Your line is open."
