    "content": " The $402 million increase in noninterest income for the linked-quarter was driven primarily by the estimated bargain purchase gain recorded in connection with the CIT merger, higher core noninterest income, the gain on debt extinguishment, partially offset by declines in gains on sale of operating leases and legacy CIT consumer mortgages. Core noninterest income increased $16 million or about 6% over the linked-quarter, primarily due to higher rental income on operating leases, an increase in card and merchant income, partially offset by a decline in factoring commissions due to expected seasonal decline in volume. Core noninterest income increased by $36 million when compared to the first quarter, led by an increase in net rental income on operating leases, higher card and merchant, service charges on deposits and wealth management income, all partially offset by a decline in mortgage income."
