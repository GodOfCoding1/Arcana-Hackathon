    "content": " Pet care centers were a significant customer acquisition engine with another double-digit increase year-over-year, including strong growth in active veterinary and grooming customers. As just mentioned, at our Investor Day in March, we emphasized our commitment to operational excellence with a relentless focus on cost management while making the appropriate long-term investments in our business, investments that will deepen Petco's relationship with our customers, driving share of wallet and providing pet parents with the one-stop shop they want and need. When I think about the first quarter, while we remain focused on driving performance every day, we are equally maintaining our commitment to making investment decisions with a long-term perspective, not limiting our horizon to a month, a season, a quarter or even a year but thinking about how to position Petco as the definitive leader in the pet health and wellness category. Looking at the quarter specifically, we delivered yet another strong quarter with comparable sales of 5% or 33% on a 2-year stack with particular strength in average basket trends, and net revenue at $1.48 billion, up 4% year-over-year. On an absolute basis, SG&A expense was $558 million, up $8 million or 1.5% from prior year as we remain adept in aligning all of our costs, including labor and continued to invest in sustained future growth through infrastructure and our people. We generated strong cash from operations of $58 million and had $66 million in capital expenditures, which increased CapEx investment by 39% year-over-year as we continued to reinvest in future sustainable growth."
