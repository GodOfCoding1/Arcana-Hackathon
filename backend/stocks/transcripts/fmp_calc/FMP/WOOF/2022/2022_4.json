    "content": " This combined with the benefits from our cash management initiatives meant that earlier this month we paid down an additional $35 million of principal on our debt, as well as taking further actions to manage our floating rate exposure and we're committed to pay down additional debt, while continue to invest to enable our long-term growth strategy. Total revenue of $6 billion for the full-year was also up 4% year-over-year and our cash flow came in significantly above our expectations, allowing us to take further actions to reduce principal on our debt, which I'll elaborate on more. Our digital business also showed strength with double-digit sales growth in both the fourth quarter and the full-year and expanded gross margin in the fourth quarter, buoyed by strength in our digital pharmacy and repeat customers and the continued growth of our rapidly scaling ad network. On an absolute basis, fourth quarter SG&A expense was $550 million, down $3 million from prior year, inclusive of continued investment in our pet care center partners. We've continued to make meaningful improvements in our cash flow performance with a 96% increase in Q4 operating cash flow over the prior year and free cash flow of $71 million, up $76 million over the prior year. Last quarter, we said we expected to be free cash flow positive for the year, while still investing in pillars of future growth, including veterinary hospitals and cooling infrastructure to accelerate our Fresh Frozen business."
