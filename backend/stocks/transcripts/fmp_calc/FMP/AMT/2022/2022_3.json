    "content": " Growth was primarily driven by solid organic leasing, execution on our international new build program in contributions from our US data center business, partially offset by headwinds of approximately 2% associated with revenue reserves taken in India during the quarter, as discussed, and another 2% from Sprint related churn. Growth also included another strong quarter of gross organic new business standing at 7.5%, putting Africa on track for its best organic new business year on record and continuing past quarter trends, we saw the strong organic leasing activity complemented with an active new build program, constructing just over 250 sites in the quarter as we see 4G coverage and densification initiatives continue to drive strong top line growth and returns on our capital deployments across the region."
