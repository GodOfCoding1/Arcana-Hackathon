    "content": " As you know, our EOD business and our Holster business is also slated to holsters and we feel like there\u2019s an opportunity there for us to continue to leverage those relationships across the board, especially those accounts where they\u2019re not buying Cyalume products and then also potentially where they\u2019re not buying the Cadre brand of products. When you look at the due to gear side of things, you look at our Armor portion in the U.S., we continue to -- we\u2019re seeing some good run rates there, which is also a good sign that they\u2019re continuing to move forward with it, but we don\u2019t have visibility to the exact number of headcount that they\u2019re missing. Yes, so I think if you\u2019re talking to a number of openings versus kind of what we\u2019re selling, I think that\u2019s accurate, Bert, that if we kind of flipped the switch today and said we\u2019re going to get fully higher in the next 6 months, that would drive volume, but it\u2019s not impairing our ability to fulfill kind of -- there\u2019s nothing in pairing our ability to fulfill current volume, if that makes sense. The out years drops dramatically, a good portion of the stock comp in Q1 was related to the Phantom plan that\u2019s been in our S-1 as well as our K. So you kind of go forward, maybe just to kind of answer, Mark, I mean, 2023, rates obviously early at this point, but we expect it to drop to more like 10% and then continue to decline as it falls off on the Phantom Plan."
