Your line is open. Your line is open. So the first one on supply chain, comparing where we're at in the first quarter in supply chain to what we've seen really toward the end of the second quarter and then what we're seeing in the third quarter so far is, I would say overall, the frequency of issues that we're experiencing has increased but it's in some of our smaller product categories within each of those. Your line is open. And so duty gear being one of the more favorable margin businesses, they were relatively light to the overall portfolio in the first half, in particular some government orders that have been coming in that will ship out later in the year, and that's certainly a big component. Your line is open."
