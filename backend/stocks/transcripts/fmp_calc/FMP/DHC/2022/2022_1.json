    "content": " At the end of the first quarter, the size of our consolidated office portfolio is approximately 8.7 million square feet and our entire senior living portfolio is comprised of 264 communities with over 27,000 units. Over the next several quarters we expect senior living segment NOI to increase as we deploy capital to rejuvenate and stabilize our SHOP segment, see renewed operator focus on occupancy, rate and community level EBITDA growth and as we continue to deliver exceptional leasing results in our Office Portfolio segment, as we've done since the onset of the pandemic. Within our Office Portfolio segment, leasing velocity in the first quarter remained approximately in line with the three-year quarterly average, highlighting the continued demand for high quality medical office and life science space. For the first quarter of 2022, we reported net income attributable to common shareholders of $240.4 million or a $1.1 per share, which includes a $327.5 million gain on the joint venture sale of 10 office portfolio assets that we discussed during our last earnings call. Our consolidated same property cash basis NOI increased 10.3% compared to last quarter, largely driven by a $6.6 million increase in same property SHOP NOI. We believe it's important to note that while normalized FFO was negative, DHC ended the quarter with approximately $1.5 billion of cash available to repay debt and make investments in our portfolio, and had total outstanding debt of $3.6 billion. In the first quarter, we spent $60.4 million on capital expenditures across our portfolio, which included approximately $36 million of CapEx within the SHOP segment and $24 million of capital was deployed in the office portfolio."
