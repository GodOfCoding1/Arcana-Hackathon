    "content": " Same property cash basis NOI and our office portfolio segment increased 4.7% year-over-year, and 1.2% compared to the second quarter. Starting with our office portfolio segment, the 4.7% year-over-year, same property cash basis NOI growth is indicative of the strength and quality of our medical office and life science assets and the leasing results we continue to achieve. From an operating expense perspective, over 90% of our portfolio of medical office and life science assets have expense recovery structures in place where the tenants are responsible for increases in expenses either fully or over a base year, largely sheltering this segment's results from the current inflationary environment. Our consolidated cash basis NOI decreased approximately $13.2 million from the second quarter with $12.2 million of that decrease coming from the SHOP segment, which included a $7.5 million decrease in the same property SHOP communities and a $4.7 million decrease in our non-same property portfolio. In the third quarter, we spent $70 million on capital expenditures across our portfolio, which included approximately $52.9 million of capital improvements within the SHOP segment, and $16.9 million of capital was deployed in the office portfolio. Just one last quick one, on the cash, the $800 million in cash, I know that a lot of it is kind of earmarked over the next year and some is being held as cushion, but I'm assuming that you guys are starting to collect some pretty sizable interest income off that with money markets now kind of in the 2.5% to 3.5% range."
