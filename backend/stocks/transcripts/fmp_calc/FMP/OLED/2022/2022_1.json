As we look to the OLED market, we believe that panel makers and OEMs are preparing for an extensive new wave of medium and large area capacity investment, driven by escalating push from leading OEMs for OLED IT products and meaningful strength in the OLED TV market, there are reports that leading panel makers, including Samsung, LG Display and BOE are planning to invest in Gen 8.5, 8.6 capacity for OLED IT. During last week's conference call, Samsung announced that it expects its display sales to increase as its portfolio of foldable products expands and from accelerated adoption of OLEDs in new application areas such as IT, where demand has increased in the pandemic; gaming, as portable gaming device OEMs are moving to higher picture quality displays; and automotive, where there is increasing demand for premium displays in markets like electric vehicles. Revenues for the first quarter of 2022 were $150.5 million, compared to fourth quarter 2021's $146.2 million and first quarter's 2021 $134 million."
