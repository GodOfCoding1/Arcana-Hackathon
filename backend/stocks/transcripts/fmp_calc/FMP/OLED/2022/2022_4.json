    "content": " 2022 operating expense excluding cost of sales, was $222 million, up 5% year-over-year. Our 2022 operating income was $267 million, up 17% year-over-year, which translates into operating margins of 43%. 2022 net income was $210 million or $4.40 per diluted share, up 14% year-over-year. Revenue for the fourth quarter of 2022 was a record high of $169 million, up 16% from $146 million in the fourth quarter of 2021. Adesis revenue for the fourth quarter of 2022 was $5 million, up 14% from the comparable period in 2021. It's \u00e2\u0080\u0093 $550 million to $600 million, a little bit of a wider range than you typically start the year out with. If I look at the guidance you imply this year, when I compare it to FY 2021, where you had like $553 million in revenue and $3.87 in EPS, clearly, the earnings power this time around is going to be lower, I mean, at the $550 million to $600 million revenue range."
