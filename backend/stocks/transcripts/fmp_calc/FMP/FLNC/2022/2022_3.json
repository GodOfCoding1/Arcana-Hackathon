    "content": " Even though we increased prices throughout fiscal year 2022, the 1,493 megawatts of new orders for the first three quarters combined already exceeds the 1,311 megawatts of new orders for the entire fiscal year 2021, demonstrating the growing demand for energy storage worldwide and the resilience of our customers' business cases. The $239 million generated during the quarter represents a 14% decrease year-over-year, which is mostly attributable to revenue we accelerated in Q2 fiscal year '22 and the aforementioned COVID driven lockdowns in China, which delayed shipments of our products into Q4 fiscal '22 and fiscal year '23. Otherwise, in terms of kind of the more near term margin progression, I think we stay in line with our statements, especially from the last earnings call, where we said, hey, expect to see in '23 somewhere in that low to mid single digit and then fiscal year '24 in high single digits, also here is that addition that's all prior to any IRA upside."
