    "content": " Consistent with the findings of the EF-14 randomized Phase III trial and other independent data sets presented to date, the use of Optune increased progression-free and overall survival in all patient cohorts and demonstrated a clear dose response with increased usage. This was a single -- this is a single-arm study, but concomitant matched control comparison already showed that while the 2-THE-TOP study population achieved a median overall survival of 25.2 months, on EF-14 matched controls, it was about 10 months less so than incorporation of new checkpoint inhibitors to Optune in the intended use or a good indication led to a significant improvement. So it's true that immune checkpoint inhibitors have unfortunately failed to demonstrate the efficacy in newly diagnosed and recurrent GBM, but it seems that there are potential penetration across the blood-brain barrier, be it lower or decreased, still results in a very significant immune response and leads to a clear clinical benefit coming from this study."
