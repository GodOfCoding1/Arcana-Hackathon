    "content": " We are narrowing our focus and investments to drive growth in 2 priority areas: our 2 largest services, Injection Molding and our new integrated comprehensive CNC offer that combines the speed and automation of our digital factory with the broad capabilities of our digital network powered by Hubs. In the fourth quarter, our longer lead time CNC offer fulfilled by both the digital factory and the digital network grew over 48% year-over-year, again, providing evidence that our comprehensive offer strategy is gaining traction. In Europe, fourth quarter revenue grew 19.9% year-over-year in constant currencies, driven by strong growth in our European CNC Machining and 3D Printing services. Fourth quarter CNC Machining revenue grew double digits year-over-year at constant currencies and excluding Japan, driven by outperformance in our longer lead time offerings fulfilled via both the internal digital factory and the digital network. And so as a result, just like we're building the most comprehensive CNC service, right, through the combination of the digital factory and the network through Hubs, we're really taking that same strategy to Injection Molding and greatly expanding our capabilities to drive our mold sales, which will then drive Injection Molding overall. And so as Rob laid out in the call, returning Injection Molding to growth, focusing on the combined offer within CNC, we see as some of our highest potential areas and where we're focusing investment. We had really strong growth in Europe, and we're making focused investments to drive growth in Injection Molding and to even further accelerate growth in CNC by bringing these comprehensive offers to the market."
