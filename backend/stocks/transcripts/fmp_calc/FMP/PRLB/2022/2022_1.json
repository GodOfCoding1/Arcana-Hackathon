    "content": " First quarter revenue of $124.2 million was within our guidance range and represents a 6.9% increase year-over-year, or 6.2% organic growth in constant currencies. Hubs generated $10.3 million of revenue in the first quarter, representing growth of 78.6% year-over-year. On an organic basis first quarter Hubs revenue grew 38.2% year-over-year, as the U.S. dollar has continued to strengthen changes in foreign currency at a $1.5 million unfavorable impact of revenue in the Quarter. Non-GAAP operating expenses increased $500,000 year-over-year, driven by a full quarter of Hubs operating expenses in the first quarter of 2022, and higher incentive compensation due to material inflation. The year-over-year decrease in earnings per share was driven by lower gross margins in our legacy business, partially offset by the absence of the Protolabs 2.0 launch logic sensors incurred in the first quarter of 2021 and higher value. And, and Brian, maybe to talk more directly about the first quarter, and Hubs gross margin Chinese New Year occurs in the first quarter and there's less capacity then amongst our China manufacturing partners. So part of our focus is on improving the volume within that injection molding business and seeing that sequential growth quarter-to-quarter is part of what I talked about, in terms of and when we need to see the volume we have to see improvement in injection molding business as we move forward and we have actions on that, to see that gross margin improve."
