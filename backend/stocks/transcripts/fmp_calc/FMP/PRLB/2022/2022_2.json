    "content": " Hubs generated $11.3 million of revenue in the second quarter, representing growth of 26.3% year-over-year. Our CNC and 3D printing services continued their strong performance year-to-date with second quarter revenue growth of 17.7% and 12.6% year-over-year in constant currencies, respectively. Regarding the eventual exit of our Japanese operations, the decision to close Proto Labs Japan business resulted in a $5.2 million in GAAP operating expenses during the second quarter, including $2.2 million of employee severance, $1.2 million related to the write-down of fixed assets, $900,000 of facility-related charges, $600,000 in goodwill impairment charges and $300,000 in other closure-related charges. We expect to generate revenue between $121 million and $129 million in the third quarter, representing year-over-year growth of up to 7% in constant currencies, excluding the impact of the closure of Japan."
