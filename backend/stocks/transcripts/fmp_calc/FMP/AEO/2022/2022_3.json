    "content": " So between IMU benefits and ending this quarter in a very good inventory position and being able to react to the business next year, which is something we couldn't do this year, I absolutely believe that we're going to have higher merch margins next year. And then, we're just -- we believe that that's going to be something that we're going to annualize next year, and we really feel good about that. And Jay, just for Aerie, building on what Jen was saying, I just want to make sure it's totally clear that -- we've opened a ton of new stores in the last year or so. But again, it's a business that's delivering results for American Eagle and providing very unique benefits in the industry that we're confident that other brands and retailers are going to want to take advantage of. The reason I keep saying ending -- our ending inventory is clean is so important is, I think if you're a retailer and you're carrying over inventory from this year into next year, you're going to be carrying that -- the higher transportation costs and cotton cost with it as it flows through the P&L. So, there's a lot more to come there I just -- like I said for both brands I just approved the spring early sets and oh my gosh, I mean is it fun and new and just feels -- you know at the end, I hope we're going to stand out in the mall and stand for what we do an each in brand."
