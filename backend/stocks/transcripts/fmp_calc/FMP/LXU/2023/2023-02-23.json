    "content": " So given our view on sales volumes and pricing, locked-in natural gas costs and the approximately $10 million impact from the Cherokee freeze event that impacted production through mid-January, we would expect the first quarter adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $55 million to $65 million. The current gas price level in Europe translates into an ammonia production cost on average of approximately $600 per ton and European ammonia production costs will likely continue to be significantly above domestic costs, continuing to provide a substantial advantage to US nitrogen producers. Regarding our green ammonia project, we continue to expect that this project will qualify for the full $3 per kilogram of CO2 federal incentives for hydrogen production rolled out as part of the inflation Reduction Act and enable us to produce approximately 30,000 tons of zero carbon ammonia to sell to our customers. I think there is -- I believe there's going to be a lot of pressure from Washington on the EPA, to start moving through some of these applications and getting some approvals through, because it's a little bit -- it's kind of odd to me that, Washington is really incentivized folks to invest in carbon capture through the changes that they made in the IRA, yet they really haven't increased any budgetary allocations to the EPA, to add more staff. As we move forward, I think we just have to balance, where do we think we're going to generate the highest ultimate shareholder return, whether it's investing in our internal projects, buying back stock or ultimately reducing some debt. I would imagine that, if we hear a positive feedback from the USDA that ultimately, if we're lucky enough that they're going to grant us $100 million once the grant happens, I'm not sure that we have to keep cash on our balance sheet."
