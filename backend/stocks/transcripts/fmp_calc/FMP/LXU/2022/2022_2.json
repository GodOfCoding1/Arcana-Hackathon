    "content": " Pricing for our industrial products remains well above year ago levels, reflecting continued strong nitrogen fertilizer demand, which is creating competition for nitrogen products, in addition to the continued strength in the ammonia export market, which is reflected in the Tampa Ammonia price to which a number of our industrial product contracts are indexed. Additionally, the Tampa Ammonia benchmark pricing settled at $11 per metric ton in August versus $625 per metric ton last August, and could increase further due to very high natural gas prices in Europe impacting ammonia production in that region. Looking to the fourth quarter, assuming some modest increase in pricing, which we typically see coming out of the summer months, and natural gas costs average in the $6.50 to $7 per MMBtu range, we would anticipate adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter to exceed last year's fourth quarter, and put us around $400 million in adjusted EBITDA for the full year of 2022."
