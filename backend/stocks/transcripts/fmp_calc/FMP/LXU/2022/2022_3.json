    "content": " The demand and pricing trends we're seeing across our business add to our confidence in strong profitability and cash flow for the fourth quarter of 2022, and we remain optimistic about 2023. The positive selling price impact is shown net of increased variable costs, primarily raw material costs that increased by approximately $36 million versus the third quarter of 2021. Also, we believe that natural gas prices in Europe, which have moderated substantially in recent weeks, will trend back to previous levels, and that continue to impact the ability of UAN and producers to operate economically, translating into a continued supply-demand imbalance for nitrogen products and supporting strong pricing. Assuming nitrogen pricing remains at current levels and despite lower volumes from our previously discussed turnarounds, we expect the fourth quarter 2022 adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $110 million to $120 million above the fourth quarter of 2021 results and our previous outlook that I communicated on our second quarter earnings call back in August. So if we saw a recession and we saw industrial demand drop, we would try and pivot towards either increasing fertilizer production where we could or the mining markets where right now, they're experiencing high demand for coal, and that means there's high demand for our low-density ammonium nitrate products and ammonium nitrate solution as well. And I would say expectations for next year, I think I've said previously that we're in the low 90s operating rates on our ammonia plants."
