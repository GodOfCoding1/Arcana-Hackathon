    "content": " Given the soft global economic outlook for 2023, we expect the current challenging environment to persist through the first quarter as customers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 days of inventory are still higher than normal while order visibility remains low. I mean we  in terms of our guidance right now for 2023 and we also -- I mean, it's our intent to preserve that structure of the profitability and protecting the pricing position in terms of AC management, and we'll continue to manage that with our customer closely. Quantify, that is -- it's still too early right now, because given the current inventory correction, I think many of this is under the discussion in terms of volume and the product and also the process. So we expect this 28, 22 nanometer will be partially impacted by -- partially impacted by the inventory correction in communications segment during the first half of 2023, and we do anticipate a full rebound in our 28 and 22 nanometer business starting from second half 2023. I mean we -- it's not -- well, I mean, given the alignment that we have with our customer and we're closely working with them, the capacity growth even within the IDM is actually incorporated to our sourcing strategy with us. And I think given our long-term alignment with the customer and while the customer also recognized the semiconductor supply chain is essential now and I think they've been sharing the data with us in a much better way, and it's more transparent, high-visibility, so -- no, I mean, at this point, we don't anticipate any impact on that."
