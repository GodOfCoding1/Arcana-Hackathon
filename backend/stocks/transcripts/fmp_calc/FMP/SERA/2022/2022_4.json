    "content": " We refer you to the documents the company files from time-to-time with the Securities and Exchange Commission, specifically the company's annual report on Form 10-K, its quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and its current reports on Form 8-K. During 2022, we made incremental progress in adding new payer contracts and more recently have publicized new data that we believe will support the growth of our business in future periods. Considering these and other factors, while we believe the AVERT results are encouraging given these differences are clearly not completely predictive of the outcome of the PRIME trial, and we must wait -- that we must await PRIME's results to know to what extent they support Sera's PreTRM test-and-treat strategy. Given that we are still in the early stage of market development, the availability of new positive data, both the AVERT PRETERM TRIAL and other readouts later this year, all of which are of keen interest to early adopter customers and the growth we experienced last year on a small base, it is still difficult to predict precisely what the revenues will be for this year. And then, but I -- what I was also wondering there is -- understood that AVERT was full data, but in terms of PRIME, you -- I assume you will not -- unless the interim is so strong that they advise you to stop the study, and then I guess you can have a publication on it."
