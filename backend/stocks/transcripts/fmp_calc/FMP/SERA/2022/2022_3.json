    "content": " Over the last couple of quarters, we've communicated that early adopter systems are a strong focus for us and that we have aligned our sales structure to pursue contracts cost effectively with these types of organizations as a means to efficiently establish revenue while reducing these customers' financial burden for prematurity. As you can imagine, as preterm testing is deployed across these organizations, communications must take place with key stakeholders, for example, obstetricians, individual physician office staff, IT administration, accounting, laboratories and patient outreach services in order to enhance the effectiveness of rolling out Sera's life changing preterm strategy. As a consequence of all these efforts, Sera's preterm test is ideally suited to help make a difference in underserved patients who experience health care disparities here in the U.S. Our company is proud to have worked to create and now to commercialize the preterm test that we believe can have substantial value in addressing the adverse consequences of prematurity in these populations who need it the most."
