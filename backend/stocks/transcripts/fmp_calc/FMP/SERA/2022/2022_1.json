    "content": " We are pleased with the continued progress in our commercial efforts to secure new payment contracts, increase test revenue, and publish additional data that further demonstrate the significant health and economic benefits of Sera\u2019s pre-term test and treat strategy. As a consequence, MultiPlan network participation encompasses a large number of pregnancies annually in the U.S. We view our MultiPlan agreement as evidence of recognition of the unique health and cost benefits of using our pre-term test, the first and only commercially available blood test for proactive interventions by measuring each expected mother\u2019s risk of spontaneous pre-term birth months ahead of when it occurs. Earlier, Greg had mentioned that we are seeing some encouraging signs that awareness of our preterm test, which is the only commercially available test of its kind on the market, is leading to increases in orders, ordering providers, and providers with MultiPlan orders among other things that we are tracking, Although, we are early in the commercialization process and building from a rather small revenue base, the increase in revenue for the quarter that we just reported is promising."
