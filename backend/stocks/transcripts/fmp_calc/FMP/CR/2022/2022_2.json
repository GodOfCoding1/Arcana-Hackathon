    "content": " We also delivered core sales growth of 7%, with further strength in demand reflected in core order growth of 14% and core backlog growth of 21% compared to last year, continued solid underlying trends in our primary end markets. At Process Flow Technologies, sales of $296 million decreased 5%, driven by a 7% impact from the May divestiture of Crane Supply and a 4% impact from unfavorable foreign exchange, partially offset by 6% of core growth. Sequentially, compared to the first quarter, core FX-neutral backlog increased 5% with core FX-neutral orders up 7%, both adjusted for the Crane Supply divestiture. Compared to the prior year, core FX-neutral backlog increased 14% and core FX-neutral orders increased 8%, also both adjusted for the Crane Supply divestiture. From a cadence of earnings perspective and timing through the quarters, we expect the third quarter to be similar to the second quarter after adjusting for the approximate $0.10 of earnings contribution from Crane Supply in the quarter, said another way, we expect third quarter EPS to decline sequentially about $0.10 which is the amount Crane supply contributed in the second quarter prior to the May divestiture of that business. I think it's generally -- check me, Rich, Jason  but I think it's generally accurate to say that while we've been a little supply constrained managing to the sales and price volume, there is more offsetting in our backlog and order rates, though, we do see a core volume increasing significantly versus just price. Nathan, just a reminder, we -- I hope investors appreciate the significance with which we are addressing the portfolio comprehensively and really positioned well to add significant value with the separation moved on Crane supply, clearly indicated for years that while a great business and a great team."
