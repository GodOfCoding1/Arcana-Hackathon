    "content": " Core orders increased an impressive 30% compared to last year and backlog increased 24% but sales remain constrained by material availability, consistent with conditions across the aerospace industry and supply chain. In addition, I think what we really liked about Aaron's thinking was understanding how in this environment to drive this core business forward and the incredible growth trajectory we have core for decades to come, while also exploring adjacencies that will take Crane NXT into very exciting growth vectors as we move forward. So well, the commercial recovery, clearly one of the elements that's driving both the core order growth of 30% and the backlog growth but in addition to that, we did see some excellent continued progress, I would say, along the electrification front and strategic direction and investments we've been making there."
