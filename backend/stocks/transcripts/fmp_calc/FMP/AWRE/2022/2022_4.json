    "content": " Those of you following our story for the past couple of years now know that this transformation has been accomplished with a significant shift towards recurring revenue, which hit approximately $10 million in 2022. The sequential improvement in revenue was largely driven by increases in revenue attributed to Knomi and BioSP For the 12 months ended December 31, 2022, total revenue was $16 million compared to $16.9 million in the same year ago period. As such, recurring revenue grew 7% to a record $9.7 million in 2022 as we progress further on our business model transformation. For the fourth quarter of 2022, GAAP net loss totaled $1.8 million or $0.08 per diluted share compared to a GAAP net loss of $1.3 million or $0.06 per diluted share in the same year ago period. Adjusted EBITDA loss for the fourth quarter, which we reconciled to GAAP net income in our earnings release, totaled $1.5 million, which compares to an adjusted EBITDA loss of $0.9 million in the same year ago period. For the 12 months ended December 31, 2022, adjusted EBITDA loss totaled $5.4 million compared to an adjusted EBITDA loss of $3.8 million in the prior year period. That said, for 2023, we have three strategic goals: to drive growth by focusing on scalability through partners and marketplaces, to protect the base by retaining and expanding core customers and business areas and to confirm and establish AwareID's product market fit through targeting adoption in select industry verticals. And in 2022, our recurring revenue totaled nearly $10 million or more than 60% of our total revenue for the year, which is an 80% increase from 2019 after which we started this transformation. So to put that in perspective, our annual recurring revenue at the end of 2022 was approximately $10 million or approximately 80% of the company's total revenue in 2019."
