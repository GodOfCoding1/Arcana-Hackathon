    "content": " We are pleased to join you today and on today's call, I will discuss how the progress we've made on our strategic roadmap during the first quarter has paved the way for continued long term predictable growth for Aware. Overall, we made tremendous progress in the first quarter, executing our partner strategy, continuing to build a strong recurring revenue base and setting the foundation for continued long-term growth. However, with the continued growth in recurring revenue and a mix of subscription contracts based off of the number of transactions or based off of the number of users, we believe recurring revenue is a more reflective indicator of the continued adoption of Knomi and our company's transition into a subscription-based SaaS platform company. Our financial results reflect a continued traction we're realizing on our three-year business model transformation into a SaaS platform company, with consistent subscription and recurring revenue. Our recurring revenue base continues to grow steadily with subscription revenue up 73% year-over-year, we are excited for the upcoming launch of our SaaS platform, Aware ID, which has been enhanced with the capability as a Fortress ID and now our new strategic partnerships with MIRACL and Anonybit. And so we believe that recurring revenue will be a more reflective indicator of the continued adoption of Knomi in our company's transition, as we get into a subscription-based SaaS platform."
