    "content": " Our core organic growth for the quarter was 2.7%, reflecting ongoing strength in our core business, partially offset by inventory destocking in liquid handling and single-use tubing that we flagged in our third quarter call, a weaker-than-expected year-end budget flush and approximately 170 basis points of headwind as a result of fewer selling days in the fourth quarter of 2022. From a regional perspective, Americas, which represents approximately 60% of annual global sales was flat on a core organic basis in the fourth quarter, with strong growth in serum, process ingredients and excipients for bioprocessing and custom formulations for the semiconductor space, offset by destocking headwinds in liquid handling consumables and single-use tubing. Health care, which represents approximately 10% of our annual revenue, declined mid-single digits on a core organic basis in the fourth quarter and grew low single digits for the full year, driven by strength in biomaterials, offset by inventory destocking in liquid handling consumables, which was particularly pronounced in the fourth quarter. Advanced technologies and applied materials, representing approximately 25% of our annual revenue, achieved high single-digit core organic revenue growth in the fourth quarter and double-digit growth for the full year, driven by growth in proprietary materials for semiconductor and electronic device applications, partially offset by a moderation in industrial demand in Europe."
