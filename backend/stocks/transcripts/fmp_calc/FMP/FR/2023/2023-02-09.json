    "content": " As of last night, we are through 50% of this year's lease expirations at a cash rental rate increase of 33%, which is already ahead of our 2022 pace. With 4 of the 5 largest remaining lease expirations by net rent in the Inland Empire, our current outlook for cash rental rate changes for the full year 2023 is 40% to 50%. During the year, we placed in service 4.1 million square feet of development, representing a total investment of $448 million, all 100% leased at a cash yield of 6.6%. First question, I just wanted to see if you could talk a little bit about some of the moving pieces, I guess, looking at same-store NOI growth and the FFO growth that contemplated with the guidance, which is expected to be a little bit more muted around 2% at the midpoint or I guess, 3% excluding the insurance claims, but that compares to the 7.5% to 8.5% same-store NOI growth forecast. In terms of under construction, if you look at where we've developed, most of the construction are coming into the submarkets we're not invested in, so for example, on the developments under construction, 85% of our developments under construction are either in Florida, Northern California or Southern California, which I would deem this is one of the top five markets in the U.S. where we expect further rent growth because of its infill nature and kind of the lack of supply."
