    "content": " Our cash same-store NOI growth for the quarter, excluding termination fees, was 8.5%, primarily driven by higher average occupancy, increases in rental rates on new and renewal leasing and rental rate bumps embedded in our leases. But if you look at the other two main components of rental rate bumps and rental rate increases on new and renewal leases, I'm just using roughly a 30% increase next year of cash run rates, which we talked about in our script, we think it's going to be higher than that, you're at least going to have -- handle just from those two components for same-store."
