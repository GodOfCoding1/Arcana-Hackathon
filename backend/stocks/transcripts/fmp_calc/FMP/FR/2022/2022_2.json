    "content": "  Operator: Good day, and welcome to the First Industrial Second Quarter Results Call. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Art Harmon, VP of Investor Relations and Marketing. Hello, everyone, and welcome to our call. These statements are based on management's expectations, plans and estimates of our prospects. Today's statements may be time sensitive and accurate only as of today's date, July 21, 2022. The supplemental report, earnings release and our SEC filing are available at firstindustrial.com under the Investors tab. Our call will begin with remarks by Peter Baccile, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Scott Musil, our Chief Financial Officer; after which we'll open it up for your questions. Also on the call today are Jojo Yap, Chief Investment Officer; Peter Schultz, Executive Vice President; Chris Schneider, Senior Vice President of Operations; and Bob Walter, Senior Vice President of Capital Markets and Asset Management. Thank you, Art, and thank you all for joining us today. Our team delivered another great quarter, which included several significant leasing successes and the large land sale in our Phoenix Joint Venture, which have culminated in an increase in our FFO per share guidance, which Scott will discuss shortly. CBRE EA reported second quarter national vacancy at 2.8%, a new all-time low. Net absorption was 57 million square feet, in line with new completions of 61 million square feet. New construction has been increasing to meet tenant demand, but at levels that are generally measured especially in the coastal, supply-constrained submarkets, where we are focused. In our portfolio, we finished the quarter with an occupancy rate of 98.4%. And since our last earnings call, we signed a few key rollovers. We backfilled our largest remaining 2022 expiration, a 341,000 square footer in the Lehigh Valley, where we captured a 40% cash rental rate increase with only a few days of downtime. Through yesterday, we had taken care of 89% of our 2022 rollovers. Currently, our overall cash rental rate change on new and renewal leasing is 23%. For the full year, we now expect cash rental rates to be up 22% to 25%, 2 percentage points higher at the midpoint than our expectations last quarter. Looking at 2023, we've already taken care of our 2 largest lease expirations. The first is a 627,000 square foot building in the Kenosha submarket of Chicago. The second is a 581,000 square foot tenant located in Minneapolis that we inked at a cash rental rate change of 15%. As of today, our largest expiration for 2023 is 366,000 square feet in the first quarter located in the Inland Empire, which is one of the strongest markets in the United States. The building will be completed soon, and the tenant is taking occupancy in September. We also leased our 208,000 square footer in New Jersey with commencement upon completion in October. We also signed another lease at First Park Miami, bringing the 592,000 square foot first phase of that project to 89% leased. In addition to the 83,000 square foot facility in the Inland Empire that we spoke about on our last call, we started 3 more buildings. Our largest is the 699,000 square foot sister building at First Park 283 in Central Pennsylvania. At First Park Miami, we will expand our investment there with a new 56,000 square foot building with an estimated investment of $16 million and projected yield of 5.5%. Lastly, we started a 37,000 square foot project in the Infill 880 corridor of Northern California with an estimated investment of $20 million and a targeted yield of 4.7%. Including these second quarter development starts, our developments in process totaled 5.8 million square feet with an investment of $776 million, which are 24% leased as of yesterday. The projected cash yield for these investments is 6.8%, which represents an expected overall development margin of approximately 75%. We were also busy on the acquisition front during the quarter, investing a total of $99 million in a handful of buildings and a few land sites, all were in coastal markets, including Southern and Northern California, Miami and Seattle. Thus far in the third quarter, we acquired 2 buildings comprised of 96,000 square feet in South Florida and Southern California, plus a small site in the Inland Empire for a total of $35 million. Overall, we continue to be well positioned to support future growth with balance sheet land today that can accommodate an additional 14 million square feet. This represents approximately $1.9 billion of potential new investment, based on today's estimated construction costs and the land at our book basis. Lastly, we've been active with our Camelback 303 Joint Venture in Phoenix. Our share of JV contributions to date totaled just $33 million, and the venture still owns 219 acres of land, all of which features desirable highway frontage. I'll conclude with a hearty thank you to the entire First Industrial team for all of your hard work and many successes, as you continue to drive significant long-term shareholder value. And with that, I'll turn it over to Scott. Our cash same-store NOI growth for the quarter, excluding termination fees, was 9.4%, primarily driven by higher average occupancy, increases in rental rates on new and renewal leasing, rental rate bumps embedded in our leases, and slightly lower free rent. As Peter noted, we finished the quarter with in-service occupancy of 98.4%, up 180 basis points compared to 2Q 2021. Summarizing our leasing activity during the quarter, approximately 4.3 million square feet of leases commenced. Of these, 800,000 were new, 1.5 million were renewals, and 1.9 million were for developments and acquisitions with lease-up. As we announced on our last earnings call, we closed on a $425 million term loan in April with a tenure of 5.5 years. Proceeds were primarily used to refinance our $260 million term loan and pay off a $68 million, 4.03% mortgage loan. As of the end of the second quarter, our portfolio is 99.3% unencumbered. The new term loan has an interest rate of SOFR, plus a SOFR adjustment of 10 basis points, plus a credit spread of 85 basis points. In the second quarter, we entered into interest rate swaps to effectively fix the interest rate on the entire $425 million loan at 3.64%. The new fixed rate is effective in October of this year, once our existing swaps from the prior term loan expire. Our guidance range for NAREIT FFO per share is now $2.15 to $2.23 with the midpoint of $2.19, which is an increase of $0.04 per share at the midpoint. The increase in our guidance is primarily due to earlier lease-up in our developments, and in-service portfolio, and an increase in capitalized interest due to our newly announced development starts. This assumes the lease-up of the 644,000 square foot Old Post Road building in Baltimore will occur in the fourth quarter. Same-store NOI growth on a cash basis before termination fees of 8.25% to 9.25%, an increase of 50 basis points at the midpoint compared to our prior earnings call. For the full year 2022, we expect to capitalize about $0.10 per share of interest, $0.01 higher than last quarter. And our G&A guidance range is now $34 million to $35 million, an increase of $500,000 at the midpoint. Other than previously discussed, our guidance does not reflect the impact of any other future sales, acquisitions or new development starts, the impact of any future debt issuances, debt repurchases or repayments, and guidance also excludes the potential issuance of equity. The leasing markets are strong, and we're seeing good prospect activity at our properties under construction. In addition, as I mentioned earlier, we are well positioned to serve additional customer demand through our on-balance sheet land holdings. As we move forward in these unsettled capital markets, we will continue to emphasize proper risk management and remain prudent in allocating capital in the pursuit of profitable growth. Operator, with that, please open it up for questions. While there aren't a lot of data points, there are very few trades. We felt like to be intellectually honest and conservative in our estimations of our margins, it was prudent to bump the cap rate on average across the markets about 50 basis points. So our plan for Camelback was the same and is the same as our plans that we have executed now in PV-303, which has always been to identify sales to potential users, to do build-to-suits, to go ahead and do speculative development. So all of the above, and we're very, very pleased with the execution on the sale of that 391 acres. We always intended to sell to some other users, at least a portion of the site. And we'll take our next question. Mike, a couple of things. The primary change was the exit cap based on pro forma on our developments, pro forma terms on our developments. In fact, from the same pool from last quarter to this quarter, less than 1%. And there was a slight -- very slight increase in NOI, because rents have increased, but the total offset is what's reflected in the margin. Mike, it's Peter Schultz. So 2 of the 3, the first is in Nashville, where we continue to see a decent activity from full building users. That market, we typically see an uptick in activity as the building is near completion, which is what we're seeing now, interest from both full buildings and partial building users. For first deal, which is in Seattle, we have multiple inquiries for both full building and half building users, and we have proposals out, but no lease to report yet. We're trading lease comments with 2, they're all full building users. The 2 that we're trading lease comments with the anticipated commencement date is in the fourth quarter, consistent with our guidance. Similar to my earlier comments, tenants continue to have limited choices and rents in that market continue to go up as well. Yes, it's Peter Schultz, Ki Bin. So activity across the country, across space sizes continues to be solid, particularly on our new buildings. As you heard in our remarks, in New Jersey and Pennsylvania, we leased both of those developments ahead of completion, well ahead of pro forma. Our largest rollover in Lehigh Valley, we backfilled with downtime measured in days, and that's consistent with the level of activity that we're seeing across the country. So one of the reasons we continue to achieve good rent growth is that our properties are well located, but at the same time, we have multiple prospects on each of every space that actually we have. In fact, if you look at the market reports on the activity, Q1 of last year is pretty much the same as Q1 and Q2 or first half last year is pretty much the same as the first half of this year. And we'll take our next question. I wanted to ask maybe on dispositions for the second half of the year, capital raising, fundraising activity. It seems like there's obviously a lot of price discovery going on and I understand the exit cap, and that's a good conservative call. So with respect to sales, yes, our guidance remains at $100 million to $150 million. It will be back-end loaded, and we are definitely in a period of price discovery. Our expectations are that we will continue to feel some pretty good offers, but again, we are in this period of price discovery, so we'll see. In terms of being aggressive -- more aggressive or less aggressive on developments and new opportunities, I don't think our stance has really changed a whole lot. And so far, that has not really factored. So we'll see -- we're going to remain prudent as we go in terms of taking risk, Dave. And then maybe, Jojo, a follow-up on the construction. I mean, there's some big under construction and planned builds out there in terms of the numbers from the brokerage houses. Last year, there seemed to be some supply constraints in terms of steel and components. As you know, we're in the market for development, too. One thing, I can tell you is that steel came down a little bit. Right now, they're pulling back about 2 to 3 months. But conversely, that was offset by some material components that actually increased. For example, switchgear and transformers, and dot levelers and RTUs or in our industry is called rooftop units, HVAC, they've actually extended. In some cases, some markets they have extended to about a year. So whatever offset that we got on steel delivery, we kind of lost it in other of the materials. And First Industrial, we just actively talk to our contractors, we do prices commitments. In terms of our own development, we do forward purchase commitments, if it's appropriate, and we just work with the municipalities as hard as we can. In terms of the whole construction, deliveries or under construction in the whole market, we have increased a little bit, but there's also quite a bit of releasing going on in a lot of those. And I think whatever is announced today, it's going to be delayed. Whatever -- whoever announced development out there, I think it's going to be delayed a little bit. Last one for me, sorry. Peter Baccile, going back to you. So we look at 2023, right now, we stand, we've taken care of about 24% of the leases, and that's at a cash rental increase of 20%. And we'll take our next question. It's Todd Thomas, KeyBanc Capital Markets. First, I wanted to just follow up again on the 50 basis point increase in exit cap rates across the development pipeline. Yes, it is a blended average, clearly in the highest barrier markets, the coastal markets, it's closer to 0 than 50. But that's -- the range is probably 10 to 60 or 70 basis points, averaging right around 50. What I will tell you for the transactions that have closed so far in the last couple of weeks, it actually were closing at cap rates like of a quarter to 2 quarters ago, so not much change. So there's been a lot of talk about retrades in the marketplace, a lot of the times, it hasn't happened. So there's a lot of talk of that, but when we surveyed the market, there's not a lot of huge retrades going on too. So again, back to what Peter says, lack of visibility right now. I don't think that at some point, you're far better off keeping the asset and enjoying the rent growth over time, than you are taking a haircut relative to, call it, the pricing of the first quarter. We have, as we mentioned, call it, 3 to 5 years of supply in the balance sheet right now. Well, I guess, so your appetite for land acquisitions hasn't changed. Just I guess, pricing for land and price trends. I think, again, for the most valuable, well-located land, especially if it happened to be entitled, which doesn't happen often these days. And we'll take our next question. About the comment on the 1.1 million square foot leased from the e-commerce retailer was pretty positive, given all the headlines. Yes, Anthony, it's Peter Schultz. Most of the requirements, if not all, that we're seeing continue to be about growth and net additions of space. Nobody is moving from one 300,000 square foot building to another. So demand, as we commented a couple of times earlier, continues to be really solid around the country. Tenants for the most part, are in a hurry to find spaces, because they have very few choices, particularly as we've said, in the higher barrier markets and where we're building. In the spaces we do have with them, the rents are below market. So we might welcome some conversations, but they seem to be very happy with our spaces. In terms of the broader market, again, the headline was much bigger than what's happening on the ground. Yes, they have put a few spaces on the market for sublease. Interesting to us that they're all very short term in nature, which would be one to believe that they believe they're going to need that space soon enough and that maybe they're just trying to manage costs in the short term. So other than that, I don't have a lot of data for you. Jojo or Peter, I don't know if you... And in the markets we focus on, we haven't really seen subleases in the markets that we're focusing on in terms of our investments. If there were any, I can tell you in some parts of the West, basically, the subleasing by Amazon happened within a couple of months. And there was a scurry of activity, and it got leased. And we'll take our next question. I understand this is in a big part of your balance sheet, but it is important to the overall health of the transaction market. I would say the secured debt markets are pretty open for life company-type executions and the rates there are probably in the mid-4s, but albeit at lower leverage. The CMBS market right now is still very challenged, and I haven't really seen that market open back up. You're going to be wider than the life company market, exactly where that data point is, is very challenging because they're just. Again, it hasn't been a lot of financing activity to point to. Well, again, I would say you just haven't seen a lot of deal activity, but those transactions that you have seen hit, I would say, more life company and more of the local and regional bank market is where a lot of those buyers are getting their financing. And we'll take our next question. But for the remaining, I think it was 200, 219 acres at -- in Camelback for the JV. Right now, the 219 acres have freeway frontage. All of the sites have freeway frontage, which's great, on 303. And it's one-off, if not the closest, amalgamation of sites closest to the juncture of 10 and 303, so a great location. So the strategy is still the same, really value creation for a joint venture, and that could involve those pursuits, that could involve speculative buildings and that could also mean strategic sales to users -- to a higher and best use user, for example. So all facets of value creation could be used there, but nothing new to announce yet, Mike. Mike, the taxes, let me look at the supplemental real quick, I think it's about -- income taxes are going to be about $24 million, haircut off those sales proceeds. And we'll take our next question. I think the best market to look at continues to be the bank market, Rob. What we're hearing from our banks, spreads are holding. So for us, that would be 85 basis points at a BBB flat rating. Last -- I think a couple of days ago, I got an e-mail from one of our banks. And I think if you swapped it 5 years, you were probably 2.75 to 2.85 at that point in time. I think we're in really good shape, Rob. And again, as I mentioned before, if we wanted to raise other capital, we can look to the bank term loan market as well. And we'll take our next question. In terms of underwriting, we have put the word out that we're going to increase our return requirements. We've always been pretty conservative in our underwriting, Ki Bin. Sometimes when we lose opportunities, we lose to people who don't do that. I meant tenant underwriting, tenant credit, sorry. Yes, we've always been very, very focused on tenant credit. We have an in-house team, who analyzes every new tenant that we consider taking on. In fact, if you want to look at a time when it was tested, I guess, it would have been in 2020 when we had the lockdowns in COVID and we still collected 100% of our 2020 rents in 2020. And just one more factoid out of our roughly 1,000 tenants, we only had 14 deferral agreements. So tenant credit is important to us, and I think our team does a great job. Hard to say where pockets of weakness would be, Ki Bin. Clearly, in terms of the overall market, the bigger risk is one on the demand side and the supply side in these higher barrier markets where land is so difficult to come by. Yes, it's a good question. And we'll take our next question. So first question, you ran through some national stats vacancy, absorption, completion. Yes, well, when we execute, we usually go market into market to submarket. But broadly, I would say, it's a broad for the whole U.S., I mean, year-to-date, market rents have increased in the sub-15% range, 10% to 15% range. And of course, there are markets where you're in the like 3%, 4%, 5%, but there are markets that are significantly more than that. But year-to-date, I mean, whole industrial market has been strong. You have the amount saying 10 million to 30 million square feet of giveback, whatever the number ultimately will be, we're comparing that against a static Amazon. But I would argue that 2020, Amazon added, yes, I don't know the number of 100 million square feet of distribution space that we should really be talking about that is the basis of comparison and not 0. So it's not a 30 million square feet reduction, but 130 million square feet reduction as it relates to your planning and your vision of the growth of the business. In 2020, they took between 70 million and 80 million square feet, that equated to more than the next 30 most active tenants combined. And so that additional space is being taken up by third-party logistics providers, for example, who are way up in their leasing, general retail and wholesale, which is next, they are way up in the leasing. Manufacturing has gained in market share in terms of leasing share, and building materials and construction. So while Amazon was the most active in 2020, nobody else really was, and now they are, and that's picking that flag up. Going forward, we look at it as a very, very broad-based demand where tenant requirements currently exceed what the industry in the higher-barrier markets can deliver, and that's why the rent growth hasn't slowed. In fact, it's accelerated. So the Amazon news, it should not be just to broaden the point, should not be extrapolated to a broader industry move. In fact, it's the opposite. More than that, they're taking up the giveback. And lastly, I mean, Amazon is going to continue to grow. So clearly, once that we get through this period, Amazon will continue to grow, and they'll continue to take up more space over time. At this time, I will turn the conference back to Peter Baccile for any additional or closing remarks. Well, thank you, operator, and thanks to everyone for participating on our call today. We look forward to connecting with many of you in person in the coming months, be well."
