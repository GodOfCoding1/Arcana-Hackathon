    "content": " In the international irrigation markets, revenues of $80 million increased 108% compared to the prior year quarter. Total irrigation segment operating income for the second quarter was $24.7 million, an increase of 37% compared to the prior year quarter. Second quarter operating results were also reduced by approximately $2.8 million, resulting from the impact of the LIFO method of accounting for inventory, under which more recent and more expensive raw material costs are recognized in cost of goods sold rather than in ending inventory values. Infrastructure segment revenues for the second quarter were $19.4 million, a decrease of 23% compared to $25 million in the prior year quarter. Infrastructure segment operating income for the second quarter was $300,000 compared to $6.3 million in the prior year quarter. Our total available liquidity at the end of the second quarter was $143.9 million, with $93.9 million in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and $50 million available under our revolving credit facility. I mean still built inventory in North America in our second quarter but that's really -- that inventory build is because those higher costs are being flush through cost of goods sold, whereas if we were under FIFO, it would be capitalized as part of the inventory cost."
