    "content": " Operating income for the quarter was $27.3 million, an increase of 49% compared to $18.3 million in the same quarter last year. Strong operating income results helped drive improved operating margins of 16.4%, up meaningfully compared to 9.2% in the prior year. Total irrigation segment operating income for the second quarter was $32.8 million, an increase of 33% compared to the prior year despite the year-over-year decline in segment revenues. The increase in operating income and operating margin resulted primarily from improved price realization, less inflationary impact on input costs and a more favorable margin mix of international irrigation revenues compared to the prior year. Infrastructure segment operating income for the second quarter was $2 million compared to $300,000 in the same quarter last year. This increase in operating income helped improve operating margin for the quarter, which was 10.9% of sales compared to 1.7% of sales in the prior year. I think, again, a year ago coming into the quarter, both international and North America, we had stronger backlogs as that pull ahead in orders to try to beat the price increases was going on."
