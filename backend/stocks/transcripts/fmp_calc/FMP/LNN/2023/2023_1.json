    "content": " Total revenues for the first quarter of fiscal 2023 increased 6% to $176.2 million, compared to $166.2 million in the same quarter last year. Irrigation segment revenues for the first quarter increased 4% to $152.1 million, compared to $145.9 million in the same quarter last year. In the international irrigation markets, revenues of $68.1 million increased 2% compared to last year\u00e2\u0080\u0099s first quarter, including unfavorable effects of foreign currency translation differences of approximately $1.6 million. Total irrigation segment operating income for the first quarter was $28.6 million, an increase of 66% compared to the prior year first quarter and operating margin was 18.8% of sales, compared to 11.8% of sales in the prior year first quarter. The increase in operating income and operating margin resulted primarily from improved price realization, less inflationary impact on input costs and a more favorable margin mix of international irrigation revenues compared to the prior year first quarter. Infrastructure segment revenues for the first quarter increased 19% and to $24.1 million, compared to $20.2 million in the same quarter last year. Infrastructure segment operating income for the first quarter increased 22% to $3.4 million, compared to $2.8 million in the same quarter last year. This increase was partially offset by a less favorable margin mix of revenues compared to the prior year first quarter, because of lower Road Zipper lease revenue. Ryan, I think, last year, in our fourth quarter, we had -- we kind of quantified that exceptional incremental storm damage in the neighborhood of around $15 million in revenue and so we would expect this year to kind of fall back into the more traditional storm season."
