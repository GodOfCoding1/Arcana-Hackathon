    "content": " With that, let me start our prepared remarks by reminding everyone that this presentation, including comments regarding our financial outlook for the fourth quarter and full year 2022, our 2022 to 2025 long range plans, the acquisition of Hillrom, new product development, the potential impact of proposed pricing actions, business development, portfolio optimization and regulatory matters contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, and of course, our actual results could differ materially from our current expectations. Both top line and bottom line performance in the quarter reflect the continued impact of macroeconomic headwinds, including significant inflationary pressures, as well as ongoing global supply chain constraints consistent with what many others are encountering globally. In total, we estimate that the semiconductor and raw material constraints we've experienced negatively impacted Baxter top line performance in the quarter by more than $100 million, or approximately 400 basis points. BioPharma Solutions sales in the quarter were $172 million declining 10% on a constant currency basis, and reflecting a step down in sales of COVID vaccines compared to the same period last year. Moving through the rest of the P&L, our adjusted gross margin of 42.9% decreased by 110 basis points over the prior year, reflecting increased cost of goods sold primarily driven by the factors we've discussed around inflation, freight and supply constraints. Adjusted SG&A of 821 million represented 21.8 as a percentage of sales, an increase of 200 basis points versus prior year, driven by the addition of Hillrom as well as higher freight expenses.
