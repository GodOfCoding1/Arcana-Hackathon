    "content": " Sales in our Acute Therapies business were $188 million, declining 7% on a constant currency basis and reflecting a difficult comparison to the first quarter of 2021 when we experienced heightened demand for CRRT given the rise in COVID cases. On a constant currency basis as compared to Q1 2021, when Hillrom was a stand-alone company, its sales were flat year-over-year, reflecting a challenging comparison as sales in the first quarter of 2021 benefited from COVID-related sales of approximately $40 million."
