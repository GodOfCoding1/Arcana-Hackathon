    "content": " So, fast forward, prices have gotten up, we've mentioned in 2021 that, \u201cHey, that that might be a little bit sooner since you\u2019re making some more money.\u201d  So generally, rule of thumb it's almost like once we were across that 3 plus billion threshold, that's when you could be in a zone where you can be a material cash taxpayer on and obviously, it depends on what you do with the free cash flow between now and then as well. So that's why from our perspective, as a low cost producer, and a free cash flow generator coupled with a balance sheet metrics, we've got to say, when I'm talking balance sheet metrics, it\u2019s not just absolute debt or leverage ratio, I'm also talking about maturity schedule, liquidity, those types of things. We've achieved a position where we basically take free cash flow generation, and when we're looking at the opportunity to allocate between debt and shareholder returns, we can have very, very healthy levels of shareholder returns and also manage our debt in a way where we never would need to access the debt markets and the capital markets."
