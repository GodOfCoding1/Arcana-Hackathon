    "content": " In Q4, we delivered on all three objectives, generating $80 million of cash from divestitures, investing $9 million of growth capital in our Mat fleet, using $18 million to purchase nearly 5% of our outstanding shares, and exiting the year with net debt at roughly one times our EBITDA run rate. In terms of fourth quarter operational performance, consolidated revenues grew 2% sequentially to $225 million, driven by double-digit growth in our industrial segment, while adjusted EBITDA improved 9% sequentially to $21 million. In Fluid Systems, while there were many moving parts during the quarter, our ongoing North American land and international business units grew 4% sequentially, delivering $148 million of revenues and a 5.2% operating margin, largely in line with our expectations. Total Industrial Solutions revenues increased 12%, both sequentially and year-over-year, posting fourth quarter revenue of $57 million, representing our strongest quarterly result in four years. In Fluid Systems, while our fourth quarter was complicated by the effects of the multiple divestitures, the segment generated $168 million of revenues and adjusted EBITDA of $7.4 million in the fourth quarter, or a 4.4% adjusted EBITDA margin."
