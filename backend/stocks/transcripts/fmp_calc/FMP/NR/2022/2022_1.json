    "content": " Consolidated revenues decreased 2% sequentially to $176 million in the first quarter, as the anticipated pullback in Industrial Solutions direct sales were substantially offset by broad-based growth in the Fluids Systems business and our expanding rental and service presence in the power and transmission sector. Rental and service revenues improved 8% sequentially to $31 million in line with our expectations, particularly noteworthy R&S revenues from power transmission and other industrial markets increased by 17% sequentially benefitting from the December acquisition, which expanded our presence in the Northeast as well as the ramp up of large scale projects in the South. Comparing to the first quarter of last year, rental and service revenues increased $2 million or 8% while direct sales activity declined by $16 million, as Q1 of last year benefited from pent-up demand following COVID related shutdowns in 2020. Operating income for the Industrial Solutions segment declined by $8 million a year-over-year, primarily driven by the impact of the $18 million revenue decline, along with the previously discussed pricing mix associated with large scale projects and the first quarter 2022 loss attributable to the wind down of the Industrial Blending operation. Outside of North America, revenues improved 6% sequentially to $48 million in the first quarter with operations in Europe and the resumption of activity in the Congo (ph) being the primary driver of the growth, benefiting from the $13 million increase in revenues Fluids Systems' operating income increased by $2.4 million sequentially, which after consideration of $900,000 of restructuring charges in the prior quarter reflects an incremental margin of 12%."
