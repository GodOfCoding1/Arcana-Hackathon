    "content": " As expected and as shared with you on our last call, that is below last year's second quarter of 17.9% when our growth had begun to accelerate very significantly, yet certain variable expenses were historically low due to the effects of the pandemic. A differentiator of our performance in the quarter and over a period of many years now has been our ability to bring together creativity, digital technology and data to create higher order marketing and media solutions that are responsive to the evolving business transformation needs of our clients. Turning now to highlights from the quarter, much of the demand we're seeing and in many cases converting into growth comes from more transformational services as clients seek to tap into the areas where IPG has made significant investments in recent years. Highlights in Mediabrands in the quarter included continued strong new business performance as the network helps clients make data-driven decisions that are central to effectively investing marketing dollars in an increasingly complex, digital and addressable media landscape. You may go ahead. You may go ahead. You may go ahead. You may go ahead. You may go ahead. You may go ahead."
