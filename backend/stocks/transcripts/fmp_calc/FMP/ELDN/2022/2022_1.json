    "content": " If we're able to show a relationship between target engagement reduction in pro-inflammatory markers in either a change in disease progression measured by ALSFRS or reduction NFL levels, we consider this a tremendous win that further validates that a reduction in pro-inflammatory markers by tegoprubart may provide therapeutic benefit for people living with ALS. Our goal remains developed the best-in-class therapeutic targeting the CD40 Ligand pathway, which we believe and transform treatment options for patients living with ALS or IgAN or undergoing organ or cellular transplantation. But obviously we're looking at target engagement, we're looking at multiple downstream pro-inflammatory markers that have been well described, not only being present in people with ALS, but also related to CD40 ligand and inflammatory activation."
