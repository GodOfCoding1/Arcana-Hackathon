    "content": " Capital spending for the quarter was $735 million, including the company's $306 million investment in DCP Midstream, LLC associated with the merger, net of cash acquired. This slide highlights the change in adjusted results by segment from the second quarter to the third quarter, including the impact of consolidating DCP Midstream, Sand Hills Pipeline and Southern Hills Pipeline effective August 18. During the period, adjusted earnings decreased $163 million, mostly due to lower results in Refining and Chemicals, partially offset by higher Midstream and Marketing and Specialties results. During the quarter, we funded $735 million of capital spending, including the company's $306 million investment in DCP Midstream, LLC associated with the merger, net of cash acquired. We anticipate fourth quarter Corporate and Other costs to come in between $300 million and $325 million pretax, reflecting a full quarter of DCP Midstream interest expense."
