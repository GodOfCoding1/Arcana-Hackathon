    "content": " So, we are now constructing already their future site based on their Apollo, so we are very encouraged not only going, selling the Apollo to existing customer for the enablement market of one-off, but we see a massive opportunity to sell these systems to the replacement market, replacing the screen market and for the first time, Kornit is bringing a quality that is better than the screen and with all the trends of moving onshore production, initial production, and shorter runs, Apollo is the perfect fit to replace screen for shorter runs in very high quality and in sustainable way."
