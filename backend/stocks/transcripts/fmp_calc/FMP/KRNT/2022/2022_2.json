    "content": " As Ronen mentioned, second quarter revenues were $58.1 million, net of $4.5 million noncash warranty impact related to a global strategic account, lower-than-expected DTG systems revenues drove the shortfall between the guidance we provided in May and our second quarter results, while consumables were in line with our second quarter plan. Non-GAAP operating loss was $18.3 million, net of $4.5 million noncash warrants impact -- as I mentioned, the substantially reduced level of second quarter revenues, coupled with materially higher sequential operating expenses drove the operating margin to negative 31%, inclusive of the noncash warrant impact of approximately 10%."
