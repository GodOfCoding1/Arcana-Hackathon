    "content": " In addition, considering the near-term volatility on the topline and the continued investments in the business, including investments in multiple NPIs, and significant events like Fashion Week Tel Aviv and London, and industry events, including FESPA, we expect operating profitability in the second quarter to be lower than the first quarter. Asia is the second quarter - a record quarter for Asia, but also in EMEA, while other businesses see a slowdown in EMEA, we actually see a major growth coming from EMEA, and we expect a very strong Q2 also from EMEA due to some of the major activities that we are doing there, with Fashion Week in London and FESPA. This is a very interesting market space, but I don't see anyone else there with, first of all, the quality that we have by far, nothing to compare to the print quality that we have with the MAX, the durability that we have, the ease of use, the automation, the productivity now that we are bringing also with the Apollo, the mix of the platform that we have, both DTG and DTF, with the leading Presto technology, on top of that, the KornitX platform that\u2019s really connecting demand to fulfiller. Claudia, next question, please. Claudia, next question, please. Claudia, next question, please."
