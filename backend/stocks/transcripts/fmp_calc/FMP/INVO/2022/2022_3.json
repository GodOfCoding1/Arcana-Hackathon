And we see that with whether it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an existing IVF clinic wanting to be more proactive about trying to use our technology and asking for our help in training and even marketing in their local communities, to physicians that want to partner up with us and build INVO Centers to now physicians that even want to put their practice under our umbrella and really team up with us in a more extensive way."
