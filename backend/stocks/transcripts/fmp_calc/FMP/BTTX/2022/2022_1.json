    "content": " I will share more in our progress momentarily, but I want to begin with the headline that with continued positive data, we expect to file a de novo classification request with the FDA in the third quarter of 2022, seeking marketing authorization of BT-001 for the treatment of patients with Type 2 diabetes. Second, we expanded the scope of our real world evidence study for BT-001 and expect to report data on the first 250 patients to complete 90 days of treatment in the fourth quarter. We expanded the scope of our real world evidence study for BT-001, and expect to report data on the first 250 patients to complete 90 days of treatment in the fourth quarter of 2022. Your line is open. Your line is open. The last point I'll make there, Charles is certainly the first step is to get the end of study data as an FDA authorization, payers will also be looking for real world evidence and what that evidence tells us around durability of effect and impact on cost. If I could just follow up on our last part, durability effect that's to track patients after they've received treatment and to see if the effect is lasting so I guess, ultimately right, is the idea here that patients over time don't necessarily have to be on BT-001 in perpetuity, because they'll have learned the skills, have be able to change behavior and get their blood sugar under control. Your line is open. Well, this is a real world evidence study is ongoing and still recruiting for \u2013 so we don't have a full set of baseline characteristics to report, but our expectation is that we'll see very similar demographics because I think the strength of the BT-001 pivotal trial is that we were able to recruit a nationally representative sample. Your line is open."
