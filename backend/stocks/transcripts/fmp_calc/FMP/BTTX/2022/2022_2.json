    "content": " The exploratory endpoint data specifically highlighted that behavior change that addresses the root cause of a disease has the potential to significantly improve a specific symptom, such as blood sugar, but that whole array of additional health measures can also be positively impacted, potentially putting patients on a different long term health trajectory, and thereby potentially changing the course of the disease. We believe the BT001 pivotal trial has generated strong evidence about the potential of this first-in-class investigational therapy to benefit patients, providers, and payers in the treatment and management of type 2 diabetes."
