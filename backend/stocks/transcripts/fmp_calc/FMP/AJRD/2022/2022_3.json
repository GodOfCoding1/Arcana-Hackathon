    "content": " Also as a reminder, backlog includes the RL-10 contract signed with ULA in the second quarter for Amazon's Project Kuiper satellite broadband system as well as a number of key multi-year contracts such as RS-25, RL-10, Standard Missile, PAC-3 and THAAD which were signed over the past several years. The year-to-date adjusted EBITDAP of $186.5 million was an 18% decrease from the prior year, driven by the unfavorable cumulative contract adjustment in the second quarter related to the portion of the standard missile program. As I mentioned last quarter, the current year-to-date negative free cash flow is largely impacted by working capital growth on large multi-year fixed price contracts in defensive business units."
