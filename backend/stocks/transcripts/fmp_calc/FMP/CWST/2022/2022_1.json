    "content": " Along with a brief review of those results and an update on the company\u2019s activities and business environment, we will be answering your questions as well. But first, as you know, I must remind everyone that various remarks that we may make about the company\u2019s future expectations, plans and prospects constitute forward-looking statements for the purposes of the Safe Harbor provisions under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. And with that, I\u2019ll turn it over to John Casella who will begin today\u2019s discussion. Needless to say we\u2019re really pleased with the results for the beginning of the year, myself, Ed, Ned, Jason, the entire senior team, we\u2019re really proud of the work that our entire team is done to offset really significant inflation that everyone is faced with unfortunately in business today. We continue to grow the business meaningfully on a year-over-year basis in the first quarter, revenues were up 23%. We\u2019ve advanced strong price, a hedge of \u2013 ahead of budgeted levels as we aim to pass through heightened operating costs to our customer base. We\u2019re also taking a proactive stance with our fuel recovery fees that are offsetting rising fuel costs, albeit a lag in a rising price environment. Overall, our core pricing and operating programs, outpaced inflation, but several unique items weigh on margins this quarter that Ned will go through in greater detail. First on the landfills, we\u2019ve advanced positive price, and in fact, our average price per ton was up on nearly 9% year-over-year in a quarter. This is a result of our team\u2019s effort to offset significant inflation, including heightened regulatory costs. In the quarter, harsh winter weather results in lower \u2013 resulted in lower volumes both year-over-year and versus our budget. As I mentioned, we\u2019ve been nimble with our pricing programs and we\u2019re off to a great start this year. There\u2019s no material operating income \u2013 excuse me, operating impact in 2022, with this revised timeline. Finally, I\u2019d like to highlight our capital allocation and growth strategy. We remain well positioned to continue to execute against our growth strategy, given the strength of our balance sheet and we are focused on opportunistically putting capital to work on deals that meet our criteria that drive further value. And wrapping up, I\u2019d like to take a minute to thank Ed Johnson for his outstanding contributions in helping to shape and build the company to where it is today. As announced last week, Ed is retiring on June 30, Ed\u2019s 12 years, will leave a lasting impact as he\u2019s made instrumental improvements to the organization that have become core principles to the way we operate on a day-to-day basis. Myself and the rest of the company will miss his guidance, but I know we\u2019re in good hands. And with Ed\u2019s retirement, I\u2019m confident that we have a seamless transition as we have the right people in-house to continue to drive value and execute. We couldn\u2019t be more excited for all of those individuals and as I said, well, deserved promotions. We\u2019re getting a few texts that the web conference call is cutting in and out, but we\u2019re hearing that the phone call\u2019s okay. So, I hope that\u2019s the case, hopefully there aren\u2019t a lot of problems out there. And with that said, I\u2019ll move on. Solid waste revenues were up 21% year-over-year with price up 5.6%, volumes up a 0.5% in acquisition growth of 12.5%. However, several identifiable factors negatively impacted margins in the quarter, including the construction delays at a landfill the expected margin dilution from acquisitions, margin and headwinds from the fuel recovery fees, and margin headwinds at our transfer stations due to higher fuel surcharges on long-haul transportation. Resource Solutions adjusted EBITDA was $6.7 million in a quarter up $2.7 million year-over-year with improvements from recycling, organics processing and non-processing. With our floating SRA fees for hauling customers in a floating processing fee or rebate structure at a recycling processing facilities, much of the year-over-year increase in recycling commodity prices was passed back to our customers in lower fees or higher rebates. Cost of operations in a quarter was up $35.3 million or up 234 basis points as a percent of revenues with a majority of the increase driven by higher fuel costs, higher labor cost and parts inflation. This out of period, Willimantic depreciation and amortization true up resulted a headwind to operate income margin to 60 basis points and a $0.03 per share headwind as well. Adjusted free cash was $16.3 million in the quarter up $6.1 million year-over-year with net cash provided by operating activities down $7.4 million, mainly driven by timing differences for accounts receivable associated with acquisition activity. This decline was more than offset by lower capital expenditures in the first quarter 2022, as compared to last year. As stated in our press release yesterday afternoon, we have increased our fiscal year 2022 revenue net income adjusted EBITDA and net cash provided by operating activities, guidance ranges, and reaffirmed our adjusted free cash flow range. As we currently expect at higher net cash provided by operating activities to be mainly offset by higher capital expenditures, including growth capital investments for new contracts and customers, additional investments to accelerate collection operating efficiencies and higher prices on certain budgeted capital items. Despite the margin headwind in the first quarter, we remain very confident in our ability to outpace inflation in fiscal year 2022 and improve adjusted EBITDA margins year-over-year. As a point of validation, our adjusted EBITDA margins were up 20 basis points year-over-year in the month of March. As we work past several of the operational challenges we faced during the winter months, our pricing programs further improve sequentially with solid waste price up 6.2%. As we discussed last quarter, if our cost inflation increases further, we have great flexibilities to advance additional price increases across our business and our floating energy and environmental fee effectively offsets most of the fuel exposure. With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Ed. I can\u2019t help, but think of what happened in Q2 of 2019, when our cost spiked in that case, it was all labor related and we temporarily lost margin. So it excludes disposal both from the revenue and cost, but it\u2019s a great indicator of how healthy our core business is. And Q1 on a same-store basis this metric improved 13.5%, the highest jump since we\u2019ve been tracking it. There was some temporary margin pressure, but as you know, with a general statement, the tons that don\u2019t come in the first quarter allow for more available capacity for the rest of the year. So over the past few years, I\u2019ve focus much of my efforts on building a strong ops team and developing the key individuals and that team to be able to take on additional responsibilities. As I said in the past, he\u2019s the best CFO I\u2019ve ever known. With that, I\u2019d like to now turn it back to the operator to start the Q&A. Your line is open. We\u2019ve been monitoring really closely what our core inflation is in our business, and it takes a little bit of work to get at because you\u2019ve got volume changes. You\u2019ve got acquisitions, you\u2019ve got new business, there\u2019s a lot of things happening, but we\u2019re calculating our core, the total inflation is 4.3% today. So, if you look at that and you look at our pricing across the solid waste business, our pricing across resource solutions, we yielded as a full company about 5.3% price. Now, if you layer in fuel, our fuel inflation was close to 125 basis points year-over-year in the quarter. So you look at that we\u2019re ahead about of a 100 basis points on the core business, then backwards about 30 basis points on fuel. So, we\u2019re in pretty good position, but then you start to get under the hood. Then we had acquisition headwinds as we\u2019ve been talking about that will start to mitigate into Q2, Q3 as we anniversary Willimantic. So those couple factors offset a lot of really good work in cost recovery, costs offset programs and the rest of the business. So it sounds like some exceptional items in the quarter that, won\u2019t repeat in the remainder of the year. And then just on the fuel recovery it\u2019s, I\u2019m just looking at diesel prices in the Northeast. It seems as, so they\u2019ve remain flat. So for the last few weeks, so just as the lag catches up, I assume provided the prices stay relatively consistent that you won\u2019t see much headwind from that and provided that plays out. Yes, you\u2019re absolutely right. So, we\u2019ve had a really effective energy and environmental recovery fee for a lot of years close to 17 years now. And in rapidly rising markets, it\u2019s a lagging fee. That\u2019s looking at, a standard index, diesel index, and if you\u2019re looking at trailing numbers and in setting the fee for the upcoming month. So, we\u2019ve never quite seen a market like this with diesel rise as fast as it did. So some of what we completed in the first quarter we would\u2019ve, thought would\u2019ve taken a little bit longer. But we were able to get those transactions done much quicker than we\u2019d anticipated, but we\u2019ve got a full opportunity from an M&A standpoint, and we\u2019ve got various opportunities under LOI at this point. Your line is open. Hey, first off, I know there\u2019s been a lot of title changes. Some position changes, just congrats to everybody, but particularly to Ed sounds like you\u2019re going somewhere warmer. For the full year, we\u2019re still expecting around a 35 basis point headwind for acquisitions. And that\u2019s more of a relative issue where our margins overall we\u2019re a little lower, so acquisitions didn\u2019t pull them down, but our acquisition activity came in right around the targeted level in the quarter. And then it looks like you\u2019re looking for 20 basis points up at this point versus 40, I think 90 days ago. But if you think about the big puts and takes for the year, I mean, my hunch is that fuel, it sounds like maybe M&A is about the same, but it feels like fuel\u2019s more dilutive than what you were originally expecting. Yes, it\u2019s a good question where we\u2019re expecting acquisitions to be about. So, we\u2019ve taken down, as you said guide, we\u2019re expecting to be up about 40 basis points now about 20 basis points. We really didn\u2019t change a lot of other parts of our guidance, Tyler, since it is the first quarter, but we felt compelled to change with such a larger acquisition for us coming into the business. So it\u2019s interesting because if you look at diesel and this is just national average, but I think it was up called a little over a dollar year-over-year in Q4 is up above 40 in Q1. So it takes the step up in Q4, some of that was recognized in Q1 and then you\u2019re absolutely right. And in terms of the break down between solid waste and Resource Solutions about $28 million in Resource Solutions in terms of revenue dollars and about $47 million in solid waste in terms of breaking down that $75 million, if that\u2019s helpful, Tyler. I\u2019ll pull up the dollars, but I don\u2019t have that open in front of me. And I don\u2019t want to talk too much month to month, but it just to be clear, it feels like April is starting to track better. I think that we\u2019re beginning to, see the natural transition coming into spring Tyler with, roll offs picking up the construction demolition season. So, I think, we\u2019re cautiously optimistic in terms of where things will be, but obviously a good deal of that remains tied to what happens from an economic perspective. Your line is open. I\u2019ve done that before, which give you a headache and depress you on some level. And Ned and Jason, Sean, well done but more importantly, John, bothers to you for really thinking this through, succession planning is probably the most important thing you do and you\u2019ve done it well. Appreciate that Michael we\u2019ve had, we\u2019ve got great interface with the board and we\u2019ve done a good job over the last three or four years, really trying to position the company for the future. Yes, so you\u2019re not talking huge numbers, that\u2019s the whole thing. We\u2019re \u2013 that we are off 32,000 tons, but as Ed said, things like that, we have a sites that have very high fixed costs. And important sort of observation is you feel good enough about the room in your annual caps plus, I mean, we\u2019re talking about a 100,000 tons on a $4 million basis that you run through your system. So I don\u2019t have to use price to move volume around to fill up this whole, this is, there\u2019s enough volume in the market that it\u2019ll come at you naturally plus your own efforts to manage cost and you use pricing. Well, that\u2019s interesting because we, the innings keep extending as we move forward and create more momentum. Michael, as you know, every time you do a transaction, you\u2019ve got more opportunity from a routing perspective and efficiency standpoint. So that, and that\u2019s the way to think about it is, is that there\u2019s, what has it been almost $200 million have added revenue, right, M&A in the last three years, four years. And then, within the guidance Ned, I appreciate that you\u2019ve moved it for the M&A, that was chunk enough to do that. Michael, we\u2019re going to be north of 5%, maybe even closer to 5.5% but we\u2019re still, inflation stepped up as well against that model, as our margins reflect. So, we stepped up price costs are up and, we\u2019re reassessing on a weekly basis right now where things sit, it\u2019s a pretty dynamic time. Their comment about the $75 million of revenues is including rollover from last year, plus this year done. So would you share what you have under LOI, and two, you used to talk about the addressable market as $400 million, so you\u2019ve now increased it by 25%. I think that, it\u2019s a function of what\u2019s happened in the marketplace in that, the challenges, from a labor standpoint, challenges across the board have caused folks that we never thought would really be interested in monetizing our really coming to market. So, I think that, we don\u2019t have anything as chunky as what we did in the first quarter on LOI right now, it\u2019s sporadic a few smaller deals. We don\u2019t have one large transaction, Michael under LOI at this point in time. I\u2019m asking, it\u2019s sort of a question and statement in the same breath. I think there\u2019s, this is exactly right. We have that challenge and we\u2019ve added tremendous resources, Kelly Robinson and his team from an HR standpoint, we\u2019ve built our own CDL School. We\u2019re, teaming up to build a mechanic school as well. So, you really have to that the work Ed\u2019s done over the last couple years to just really have a great vision for the future, what our replacements are and what we need in the system for a growth standpoint, position us really well during this period. As Michael, we\u2019re ordering our trucks now a year in advance. We\u2019ve gone to the board for the last four years, five years to get our CapEx for trucks a year in advance, because we\u2019ve got to get the orders and slots for delivery. Yes, no, all the class eight guys have made it clear they\u2019re on allocation. But to that point, just to close the loop on this, that\u2019s not impacting your ability to grow, given the breadth of your model, you can work more overtime, you\u2019ll find a way to do it in routing where the smaller guy just can\u2019t add the capacity. We\u2019ve modeled not before the quarter reported, we assumed you were going be slightly negative in 1Q and 2Q, just because of comparability issues. But right now we\u2019re sitting in our model, slightly negative from margins in Q2. We are up in Q3, Q4 Jason\u2026\n Yes, 75 basis points to 100 basis points, which gives us up close to the 20 basis points to 25 basis points for the full year embedded in our guidance, Michael. Your line is open. Actually, no but, I\u2019m looking forward to it. I don\u2019t think that, I think that we need to be really thoughtful stay within the bounds of the financial returns that Ned is outlined. I think that, we \u2013 you don\u2019t see or feel the number of transactions that we don\u2019t do. So, I think that we\u2019re probably going to stay to our disciplined approach. They\u2019ve served us very well over the last seven, eight years and so probably no changes from our perspective. But we\u2019re \u2013 when you go in and you look from a due diligence standpoint, you\u2019re evaluating fleet, you\u2019re looking at the trucks. You\u2019re looking at how many people that are down from a routing standpoint, all of those aspects of the M&A process are incorporated into the due diligence that we\u2019re doing. So, I don\u2019t think that we\u2019re going to change things. It\u2019s not growth for the sake of growth, this growth for the sake of creating and growing free cash flow. Yes, so we did have quite a bit of growth in the non-processing side of this business, which is a combination of our multi-site kind of retail, industrial brokerage business, our industrial services business, and then also our organics sourcing, and transport and disposal part of the business where we don\u2019t process. I mean, we\u2019re very focused on ESG, and every major institution across this country, whether it\u2019s a company or institution, college, university, hospital. So that part of our business is really growing, you\u2019re right, Sean, we\u2019re having many of our customers who are thought leaders in this area, and they\u2019re working with us to find solutions to create more value from the waste stream. So, you seeing quite a bit of that there, and it really is a continued opportunity for us to grow gain share of wallet from existing customers and quite a bit of this growth this year was from that area and will continue to be as well. It\u2019s just, it\u2019s becoming more and more important to every company, every institution. Yes, that\u2019s super interesting. I mean, I think that it\u2019s pretty fair to say that there\u2019s a tremendous knowledge throughout the economy in terms of what\u2019s happening from an inflationary standpoint. I think that, we really haven\u2019t received a tremendous amount of pushback. And I think it\u2019s a function of people having a clear understanding every time they go to the grocery store, they go to fill up their car. We think about, we\u2019re now being asked to solve for PFAS and leach , and we\u2019re doing our first pilot program at our waste USA facility. And by creating flexible fee structures, we\u2019ve been able to be fair as well. So our customer base 16 reduction there, and we\u2019ve been able to pass some of those higher commodity prices right back to our customers, which really has helped us a bit. And these programs are set up to be fair and they\u2019re set up to manage risk, and we\u2019ve seen that on both sides. One more meaningful data point, with all the price we\u2019ve pushed through our customer count and each main line of business went up in the quarter. We had strong customer growth that\u2019s on an organic basis or a same-store basis, excluding acquisitions. Your line is open. Can you discuss, I know you touched on this briefly a minute ago, but can you discuss sort of driver attrition in the quarter, it seems as the wider industry seems sort of accelerating pay for drivers in Q1 and some pretty large companies announcing, they\u2019re paying their drivers 140K plus you haven\u2019t \u2013 it doesn\u2019t seem you\u2019ve had any margin hand with their given pricing. I think that we\u2019re \u2013 we\u2019re still struggling, like everyone is to fill all of the seats. It\u2019s and we\u2019ve had \u2013 we\u2019ve had from a driver\u2019s standpoint, we\u2019ve had some bumps in terms of negative issues from a retention standpoint. But I think when you look at, Casella you have to look at it over a three or four year period of time, because we\u2019ve been raising rates over that period of time. So it\u2019s not like we\u2019re just \u2013 you\u2019re seeing one raise, we\u2019ve been doing market adjustments now for about four years. We\u2019ve put 60, 65 people through the driver\u2019s school, so far where we actually pay for them to get their CDL. So, I mean, we\u2019re doing everything that we can, we\u2019ve added some fairly Ned reminds me every now and then how much overhead we\u2019ve added from a HR standpoint, in terms of adding people to help our teams, you can\u2019t have ops managers out in trucks and interview drivers. So, we\u2019ve added some people in the field to help interview drivers to when the application comes in, turn it within 24 hours, get that individual in for an interview and then help to source that for the ops managers and then get them obviously in front of them, and do a much better job of reacting very quickly to the applications that we do get. So, we\u2019re doing a lot of things there. We\u2019re putting the resources to it that are necessary to be successful, but we\u2019re still struggling to fill all of the seats. And we\u2019ve also been investing heavily in automation, which makes to be less seats to get the same work done. It\u2019s a little bit less manual, intense work, and we see more and more women. And the work we\u2019ve done in a lot of markets and through your team, sometimes we\u2019ll take three manual trucks and replace it with two automated trucks. So into our waste USA facility, we\u2019re doing a pilot program to remove the PFAS from the leach , which is something that every facility across the country will be facing over the next few years. And it\u2019s, again, I was talking about it in the context of the regulatory environment that we\u2019re in and the reality of higher costs and inflation, and some of that\u2019s being driven by the regulatory environment that we operate in. Not only is it difficult to get that capacity permitted in place, it\u2019s also very difficult to meet the issues from a regulatory standpoint. It\u2019s interesting to see somewhat of a interest in hazard waste volume, what\u2019s the sort of competitive dynamics or any advances you\u2026\n I think \u2013 it doesn\u2019t pose a negative for us in terms of if we find a solution, then we\u2019ll incorporate the cost of that solution into our tip fees at the facility. If we\u2019re expected to do these things, we can certainly do it. And I expected to continue, because I\u2019m still a stockholder. And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference call."
