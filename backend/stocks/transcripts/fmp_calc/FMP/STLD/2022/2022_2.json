    "content": " Our second quarter 2022 net income was $1.2 billion, or $6.44 per diluted share, inclusive of cost of $77 million, or $0.29 per diluted share associated with the continued start-up of our Sinton, Texas Flat Rolled Steel Mill. Our second quarter 2022 record operating income of $1.6 billion improved 8% versus first quarter results, driven by record steel fabrication earnings. Our steel operations generated very strong operating income of $1.1 billion in the second quarter with record shipments of 3.1 million tons, of which Sinton contributed 171,000 tons. Second quarter operating income for our mills recycling operations remained strong at $58 million, representing a 20% sequential quarterly improvement as ferrous metal margin and volume improved. Steel operations had another terrific quarter, record shipments of 3.1 million tons, strong operating income of $1.1 billion. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to be 100% funded with available cash and cash flow through operations, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s expected to add a good $650 million to $700 million in through-cycle consolidated annual EBITDA per year. We started out with an additional cash, lower leverage on the balance sheet so that we were able to very easily commit to a capital investment that would be funded through cash and cash flow from operations, while maintaining flexibility and optionality in case there were to be some sort of acquisition opportunity that were to become available, et cetera, or in the absence of that, so that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re able to continue to have our very, we believe, is a positive shareholder distribution plan, which allows for us to continue to keep increasing the dividend at an appropriate level, because it is a forever type of investment for us."
