    "content": " From a geographical perspective, our Europe, Middle East and Africa region generated 24.4% growth in sales or an increase of $2.5 million for the first quarter of 2022 versus the prior year period. In terms of dollar contribution, I'd highlight our other category, which benefited from sales of our Control Tech equipment in Spain and Chile, and contributed about $0.9 million of growth as well as our fungicides and disinfecting category that I mentioned a few moments ago, which grew nearly 19% in the first quarter and contributed $0.8 million of growth versus the first quarter of 2021. SG&A expenses decreased 12.2% to $11.9 million in the first quarter of 2022, as compared to $13.6 million in the prior year period, driven primarily by savings in administrative expenses. Adjusted EBITDA increased by $0.8 million or 5.9% to $15 million in the first quarter of 2022, as compared to $14.2 million in the prior year period. And I think we've been advantageous around buying in anticipation of some of these and also as we continue to increase our volume of sales that's giving us some efficiencies with our suppliers, but also as we move into the second half of the year to smartly and responsibly take price, which has not been a consistent activity for AgroFresh in the past, given the larger disproportionate impact that SmartFresh for apples has had on our historical portfolio."
