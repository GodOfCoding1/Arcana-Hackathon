In addition to attaining profitability, we also generated a sizable net operating cash inflow of RMB476.7 million and recorded a year-over-year increase in cash reserves during the quarter, bolstering the long-term development of our company and validating our continuous improvement and efficiency optimization efforts. As our businesses continued to gain traction and our retention rates rebounded, gross billings from our non-academic tutoring services increased roughly 90% quarter-over-quarter, creating a strong foundation for the future revenue growth. Aside from the above mentioned, the other crucial component to learning services is educational services for college students and adults, which nearly doubled in revenue compared to the same period of last year, constituting more than 30% of revenues for the quarter. Selling expenses decreased 22.3% year-over-year and 14% quarter-over-quarter to RMB289.8 million, accounting for 46% of net revenues, which was 9.5 percentage points lower than in the third quarter. Based on our current estimates, total net revenues for the first quarter of 2023 are expected to be between RMB686 million and RMB706 million, representing a decrease of 5.3% to 2.6% on a year-over-year basis. So, first, for the product structure, for the revenue structure, we foresee it to maintain sustainable in the first quarter in 2023, which means the learning services will still be the largest revenue contributor that it will contribute over 90% of the revenues, and the remainder of the 10% will contributed by the digital products."
