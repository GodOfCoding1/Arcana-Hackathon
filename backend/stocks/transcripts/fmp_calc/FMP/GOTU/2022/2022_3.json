    "content": " During the quarter, our post-graduate entrance exam prep business recorded roughly 76% quarter-over-quarter increase in net revenues and at over 46% quarter-over-quarter increase in growth billings, which was partly driven by the good branding gradually established by our top notch teaching guidance and their high quality services. As you may have noticed, even though the third quarter is not a peak season for cost retention, our gross billing for the quarter remained at the same level as that of last quarter, indicating that the gross billings contributed by new students are taking up a higher percentage due to our effecting new customer acquisition strategies. So, we do so see like the gross billings in a first quarter to increase meaningfully and also we'll be having a sizable positive net operating cash flow in the fourth quarter, and that majority was contributed by our academic education, learning service and others that may serve the students from junior school to high school."
