    "content": " I\u2019d like to \u2013 at this time, hand the call over to Dr. Steven LaRosa, Aethlon\u2019s Chief Medical Officer, who will provide an update on our clinical trials in infectious diseases and I will then make some remarks on our clinical trial efforts in the cancer space. The $190,000 decrease in our professional fees was primarily due to an $80,000 decrease in our scientific consulting expenses, a $51,000 decrease in our legal fees, a $37,000 decrease in recruiting fees and $19,000 decrease in website services and a $17,000 decrease in our directors\u2019 compensation, which were partially offset by a $17,000 increase in our accounting fees. And the $190,000 increase in G&A expenses during the quarter ended December 31, 2021, was primarily due to an $183,000 increase in our clinical trial expenses. As a result of the changes in revenues and expenses that I just reviewed, our net loss before noncontrolling interests increased to approximately $2.5 million for the three months ended December 31, 2021, from approximately $2.4 million for the three months ended December 31, 2020."
