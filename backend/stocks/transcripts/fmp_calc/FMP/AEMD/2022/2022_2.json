During the recent quarter, we entered into an agreement with PPD, Inc., a leading global contract research organization, or CRO, to oversee our U.S. clinical studies investigating the Hemopurifier for critically ill COVID-19 patients. As a result of the changes in revenues and expenses that I just reviewed, our net loss before non controlling interests increased to approximately $2 million for the three-months ended September 30, 2021, from approximately 1.8 million for three-months ended September 30, 2020."
