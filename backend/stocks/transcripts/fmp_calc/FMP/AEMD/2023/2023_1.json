    "content": " Our consolidated operating expenses for the three months ended June 30, 2022 were approximately $2.91 million compared to $2.23 million for the three months ended June 30, 2021. This increase of approximately $680,000 or 30% in the 2022 period was due to increases in our general and administrative expenses of approximately $402,000 and our professional fees of approximately $261,000. The $402,000 increase in our general and administrative expenses in the Jun 30, 2022 quarter was primarily due to the combination of a $161,000 increase in our clinic trial expenses, a $97,000 increase in supplies, a $91,000 increase in our rent expense and a $27,000 increase in our insurance expense. Our cash based compensation expense decreased by $82,000, primarily because our CEO received a $215,000 bonus in the June 2021 period for achieving certain contractual milestones and as employment agreement and there were no bonuses paid out in the June 2022 period. We did not record any revenue related to our government contracts with the NIH in the three months ended June 30, 2022 compared to approximately $132,000, in the three months ended June 30 2021. As a result of the changes in the revenues and expenses I just noted, our net loss before non controlling interests increased to approximately $2.9 million for the three months ended June 30, 2022, from approximately $2.1 million for the three months ended June 30, 2021. During the three months ended June 30, 2022, we raised approximately $690,000 in net proceeds under our ATM agreement with HC Wainwright and Co, pursuant to sales of our common stock."
