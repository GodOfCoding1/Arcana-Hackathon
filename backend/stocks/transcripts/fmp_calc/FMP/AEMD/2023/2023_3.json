As a result of the changes in revenues and expenses that I just noted, our net loss increased to approximately $2.85 million in the three months ended December 31, 2022, from approximately $2.5 million in the three months ended December 31, 2021. So, we've taken the opportunity to actually device -- design a new trial where we're still going to focus on patients who have had a lead-in period with a checkpoint inhibitor, but either have stable disease or progressive disease, and it will be a basket type of trial, which means there's many tumor types for which checkpoint inhibitors are used."
