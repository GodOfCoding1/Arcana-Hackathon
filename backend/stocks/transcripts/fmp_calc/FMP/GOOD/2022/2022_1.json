    "content": " We acquired an 80,000 square foot industrial facility in Wilkesboro, North Carolina for $7.4 million with 12.7 years remaining lease term, acquired a 56,000 square foot industrial facility in Oklahoma City for $5.9 million with 7 years of remaining lease term, renewed and extended the lease and removed the termination option at our 127,400 square foot industrial facility at Mercedes Benz assembly plant in Vance, Alabama through December of 2032. Subsequent to the end of the quarter, we acquired two industrial facilities totaling 260,719 square feet in Fort Payne, Alabama and Cleveland, Ohio for $19.3 million, with 11.4 years of remaining lease term, and leased 29,500 square feet in our 92,187 square foot Blaine, Minnesota industrial building, raising the occupancy in that property 100%. Inflation is one that is going to hurt all of us over time, but the good news is, you get about a 7% yield while you watch us work, and then second of all, you're in a hard asset and hard assets do perform much better in the kind of inflation that we're expecting over the next couple of years."
