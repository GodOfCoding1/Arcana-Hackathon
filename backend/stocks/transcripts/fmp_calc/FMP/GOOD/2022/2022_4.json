    "content": " We acquired a 69,000 square foot industrial building Denver, Colorado for $12 million in a 20 year sale leaseback transaction with a GAAP cap rate of 8.2. Our team finished the year with 114.4 million in acquisitions totaling 1.2 million square feet, comprised of 13 properties, 7 tenants with an average remaining lease term and acquisition of 14.5 years. In the fourth quarter, we did closed two transactions for a total of $16.9 million again the first was a 20-year sale leaseback located in Denver, Colorado purchase price was $12 million and cap rate was 8.2%. Second, South Carolina 11.28 purchase price was $4.9 million GAAP cap rate of 9%, it's a 12-year term. Per JLL, the industrial market finished 2022 $468 million square feet of net absorption second highest year on record behind 2021. But only 3.9 million square feet broke ground in the fourth quarter, increasing the total construction volume by 7.5% quarter-over-quarter, tenants continue put their space up for sublease to reduce costs. With year-end sublease vacancies totaling 136 million square feet expectations are for increase in office vacancy rates as leases roll over the next few years, which will lead to downsize and lower renewal rates for spaces currently offered for sublease. Our pipeline of acquisition candidates is approximately $300 million in volume, representing 20 properties, all of which are industrial, of the 20 properties two properties are in due diligence totaling $20 million, three properties are in a Letter of Intent stage totaling $68 million and the balance are under initial review. You've all heard a lot today and the numbers of new transactions and new leases and we acquired two new industrial assets, sold two office properties and collected 100% of the cash-based rent during the fourth quarter, all of that's good news."
