Just kind of following up on Brian\u2019s, Billy, maybe just a little bit more of what pushed this change, was it a thought that we don\u2019t want everyone to run into capacity constraints as we did last year and we need to get faster or there\u2019s something on the demand curve where you felt like, just trying to understand why the change now because it\u2019s obviously a big, it seems like a very positive change. Okay, now that helps, And then Heather, just understanding that it is early in the year and there\u2019s a lot of moving parts but with the quarter and kind of commentary trying to get my arms around maintaining kind of full year guidance, especially on the EBITDA and I think what you said was -- and I just want to confirm that, there\u2019s still more kind of backfill of inventory to refilling stores that go in 2Q, so it wasn\u2019t all done in just 1Q. You may proceed with your question. And the second part of it is we also have the ability to scale it up much more quickly because I think, as we\u2019ve said, before, most people know, we brought the Ennis production team, so the hourly laborers who are going to be starting up that facility to Bethlehem, some of them been in Bethlehem since last June, so they could learn and practice on the exact same equipment that they\u2019ll be starting up in Texas. You may proceed with your question. You may proceed with your question. You may proceed with your question."
