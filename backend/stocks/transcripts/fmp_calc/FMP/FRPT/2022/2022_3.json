    "content": " I will touch on that in more detail in a few minutes as well, but the headline is that we are now projecting that our CapEx spending over the two-year period of 2022, 2023 will be reduced by $100 million versus our last projection with no change to our near-term growth or our 2025 net sales targets. We aren't ready to provide the full impact of those decisions yet, but we can say that our expected CapEx spending this year and in 2023 will be approximately $100 million less than we previously anticipated with a $30 million CapEx reduction in 2022 and $70 million next year. Scott, do you want to take that? Scott, do you want to take that? Well, John, what we were trying to say was, we freely recognize that because of all the inflation that we've had in the past year and the impact that it's had on buying rate, potential impacts on household penetration or customer acquisition costs and then also on our margin structure. Scott, do you want to take that?"
