    "content": " In simple terms, the cost increases we have seen since we set our budget are in the range of approximately $10 million to $11 million or about $15 million on an annualized basis, and our price increase will cover less than half of that this year primarily because it won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be effective until the beginning of Q4. Like just how you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re thinking about kind of the EBITDA margin flow through, kind of incremental margins on sales growth using this new method and then maybe getting past some of the noise that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s out there right now in terms of just what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going on with -- in the business. So there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to have to be some over delivery, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not exactly clear how big that number is going to be because the trade inventory needs to grow year-on-year as well as we get more distribution and a bigger business, the customers hold 3 weeks of inventory and 3 weeks inventory is a bigger number on the 35% larger business than it was a year ago. And just reconstruct the model that gets us from where we are to the 11 million households and the $1.25 billion in net sales because as I think I said when I framed it up, I framed it up and saying, we know we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re running at a rate that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s well in excess of what you need to get to the target. If we look at pushing the investment in the innovation center more into 2023, just given the overall inflation in building materials and things that go into setting up a new facility, does that $80 million add that into the CapEx, I would assume that if you shifted some of that goes into the new year, but it looks like the CapEx cadence outside of this year is still the same $300 million, $200 million, $100 million ."
