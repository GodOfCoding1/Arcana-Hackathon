    "content": " The initiatives that could have implications for WWE's performance for the remainder of 2022, include the continuing execution of our live event touring schedule including our stadium strategy for WWE's premium live events, additional monetization of new original series, the licensing of Raw second window rights, additional licensing of WWE Network in international markets and sponsorship sales. This estimate reflects strong year-over-year revenue growth from the contractual escalation of domestic media rights fees for the company's flagship programs and premium events as well as the benefit of ticket sales from Clash at the Castle, our premium live event in Cardiff Wales and increased monetization of content."
