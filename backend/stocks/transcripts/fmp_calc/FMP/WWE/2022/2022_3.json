    "content": " The estimate reflects year-over-year revenue growth primarily from an unexpected increase in domestic media rights fees for the company's premium events, as well as the increased monetization of third-party programming. This revenue growth is expected to be partially offset by the negative impact related to the timing of consumer product licensing revenue for certain agreements with minimum guarantees that I discussed earlier in my remarks, as well as the timing of the airing of the company's flagship weekly programming, in particular SmackDown, which is scheduled to air one less episode as compared to the prior year period. We believe our long-term outlook is supported by the rising value of live sports content, increasing spending by streaming platforms on live and sports content to acquire and retain customers, increasing brand spend with media companies that deliver reach and fan engagement, and increasing premium for celebrities and compelling content, fueling new IP monetization opportunities, and the growth of media and entertainment in international markets. We also think the way that it's ended up for us with Raw on basic cable, SmackDown on free to air, and the premium live events on a streaming service Peacock has worked out perfectly, in that it allowed us to test each platform out or our product and to see where we could get a stronger result."
