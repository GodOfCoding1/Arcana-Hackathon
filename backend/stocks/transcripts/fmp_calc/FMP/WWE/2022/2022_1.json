    "content": " To put it into context, in 2021, WrestleMania's first year on Peacock, we saw a 15% increase in viewership from 2020, which was the last WrestleMania to air in the U.S. on WWE Network. In terms of viewership, this show saw a 41% increase domestically and 42% increase internationally over our last show in the region, which continues the viewership growth that we've all been seeing for our premium live events, look for more news to come on plans for another Saudi event to take place later this calendar year. In our consumer products segment, page 7 of our presentation, adjusted OIBDA increased 78% or $5.2 million with the growth primarily attributable to our franchise video game, WWE 2K22, which, as Stephanie discussed, was released in March and has had record performance for the franchise. As we discussed on our last earnings call, this range reflects our projection for record revenue, with growth driven by full year impact of ticketed live events, the staging of additional large-scale international events, escalation of right fees for the Company's flagship programs and monetization of new original series. Key initiatives that could have meaningful implications for WWE's performance for the remainder of 2022 include the continuing execution of our live events touring schedule, including our stadium strategy for our premium live events, the licensing of Raw second window rights, additional licensing of WWE Network in international markets, further increases in sponsorship sales and the ongoing monetization of new original series."
