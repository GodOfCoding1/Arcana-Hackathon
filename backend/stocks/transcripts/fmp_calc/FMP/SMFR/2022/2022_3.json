    "content": " This is one of the world's largest rare disease data sets, which when coupled with Centrellis allows us to combine clinical and genomic data to deliver better insights to patients, providers, pharma partners and leapfrogging other in the space to advance precision medicine. So we would envision that we are going to be able to actually provide carrier screening to a woman who is thinking about having a family at some point that absolutely is part of the strategy because realistically, we are \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0080\u009c the cost efficiencies associated with running exome genome versus trying to keep hundreds of panels rev and the operational expense associated with that and all of the billing expenses, that's a very expensive endeavor for any company that's in the panel space. I will say though, I think the importance of being able to procure data from additional partners beyond health systems is going to be one of the key results that I think defines our ability to really have a good diverse expanding data set that is one of the goals is to continue to grow the data set for Centrellis on the clinical data side, the genomic data that we're going to be able to procure will, of course, grow with our -- with selling our GeneDx platform."
