    "content": " With measures we\u2019ve already undertaken, and several others that are in process, we\u2019ll be able to end this year with at least $200 million cash on our balance sheet, which extends our runway well into 2024, and I'm sure as we can continue to invest in building our data platform and service of health systems, biopharma partners and ultimately patients. As we exit this year, we anticipate Sema4 will be a company with trailing revenue on a pro forma basis of $350 million, an exit gross margin run rate of 30%, more than $200 million of cash on the balance sheet, cash runway into 2024, and an operating model that gives us the ability to achieve positive free cash flow by the end of 2025. As summarized in slide 10 of our earnings presentation, by the end of this year we expect Sema4 will be a business generating $350 million of pro forma revenue on a trailing basis, an exit gross margin run rate of 30%, more than $200 million of cash on the balance sheet, cash runway into 2024 and an operating model that gives us the ability to achieve positive free cash flow by the end of 2025. So when you look at the total performance in the quarter, with 159% growth, you know most of that was in the HC business which continues to do very well for us, both in the broader market as well as with some of the health system partners with whom we\u2019re working, where we mentioned in the past, we've been able to drive much higher rates of compliance, relative to the targeted populations."
