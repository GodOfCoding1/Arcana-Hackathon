    "content": " NORI-D alone is estimated to contain 356 million tons of wet nodules, representing 22% of TMC\u2019s total estimated resource and we expect that it steadies total production, NORI-D could produce up to 125,000 tons of nickel annually, equivalent to roughly 10% of current global production of Class 1 nickel. I am sure we announced the signing of a non-binding MoU with Epsilon Carbon in March detailing their intention to finance, engineer, permit, build and operate the world\u2019s first commercial polymetallic nodule processing facility in India, building upon our pilot work finalized in Q4 last year, which successfully turned nodules into nickel, copper, cobalt matte and manganese silicate products. And I \u201cwhere there are threats of serious or irreversible damage lack of full scientific certainty shall not be used as a reason for postponing, cost effective measures to prevent environmental degradation.\u201d While we don\u2019t have to go far to find two major threats of irreversible damage and environmental degradation, firstly, there is the obvious threat to the world\u2019s rainforests carbon sinks posed by land-based mining on which the world would be even more dependent without an alternative like nodules that there is also the threat of continued climate change exasperated by a lack of battery metal supply."
