    "content": " The US and Canadian nickel projects are an order of magnitude lower grade, compared to the TMC portfolio and often face significant permiting risk with the largest US nickel project seen as federal permit rejected in 2021 and in addition, ESG rating agency, NSCI estimates that 97% of all nickel reserves and resources in the US are located within 35 miles of native American reservations and many proposed projects, risk infringing on areas of cultural and environmental significance. Exploration and evaluation expenses decreased in the first half of 2022, compared to the same period in 2021, as a result of a decrease in offshore campaign activity following the completion of the NORI area D environmental baseline campaigns in the fourth quarter of 2021, a decrease in share-based compensation, partially offset by an increase in the -- excuse me, in the expenses incurred in 2022 for the PNTS trials in monitoring survey work in advance of PNTS work in the clearing clipping zone. The increased cash spending in the first half of 2022, included payments made for various offshore campaigns, including $10.5 million to Maersk, $10 million paid to all season as their second milestone payment and increased payments for environmental monitoring costs and PMTS trials."
