    "content": " Even though we continued to show strong credit quality metrics, including reduction in non-accrual loans and realizing net recoveries for the quarter, we recognized provision for credit losses of $1.9 million during Q3, due mostly to increases in loan balances as well as the lengthening of the duration of certain loan segments, which impacts the allowance calculation. Criticized loans, those risk-rated special mentions and substandard, declined by approximately 9% or $16 million during the third quarter and are now down 18% from year-end 2021. It's important to note that much of the improvement in our substandard loan totals declining by $28 million during the quarter, was due to the upgrade of two hotel loans to special mention, based on improved operating performance. Using this measurement, loans increased $118 million during the quarter or 12% annualized rate."
