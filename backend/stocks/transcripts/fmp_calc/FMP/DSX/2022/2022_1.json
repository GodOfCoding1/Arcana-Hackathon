    "content": " Lastly, our consistent chartering strategy has allowed us to have currently secured approximately $184 million of contracted revenues for full year 2022 with 62% contract coverage and $25.6 million on contracted revenues for 2023 with 8% contracted coverage. Our time charter revenues increase from $42.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2020 to $68.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2021, which is an increase of about 61%. Our general and administrative expenses increased to $8.1 million compared to $7 million for the same quarter last year, mainly due to increased costs on restricted stock awards and legal and audit fees that was partly offset by decreased payroll costs. Now, if we look at the year-ended numbers at December 31st, 2021, net income attributed to common stockholders amounted to $51.6 million, that\u2019s $0.64 per basic share or $0.61 diluted share including the gain from the spin-off mentioned earlier. The improvement of the market conditions in 2021 was shot without daily time charter equivalent rate for the quarter of 2021, almost double compared to the fourth quarter last year and increased to $21,354 from $10,940. As I was saying earlier, at the same time, we managed to reduce our daily operating expenses for the fourth quarter of 2021 at $5,657 compared to $6,089 for the same quarter of 2020, which represents a decrease of approximately 7%. We also managed to improve our daily operating expenses for the whole year was decreased by 3% compared to $5,596 compared to $5,750 last year."
