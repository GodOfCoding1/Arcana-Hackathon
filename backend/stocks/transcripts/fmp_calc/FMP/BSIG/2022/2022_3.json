    "content": " We reported ENI per share of $0.30 for the third quarter of this year, 7% higher compared to $0.28 in that we reported for the third quarter of 2021 as our sizable share buyback in Q4 of '21 and Q1 of this year more than offset the decline in our earnings caused by the impact on our AUM from the significant equity market decline this year and a stronger U.S. dollar. So -- and as we outlined, we'd probably use about $75 million to $80 million over the next 3 years in those 2 opportunities, let's call it $20 million to $25 million a year, in that."
