    "content": " On the left hand side of this chart, you can see that our existing prescriber base at the end of the second quarter was 9% higher than the base of new and existing prescribers from the quarter before, indicating that existing writers are satisfied and importantly, continuing to find new patients for Trudhesa. As you can see on our next slide, Slide Number 7, we are pleased to report that the percent of reimbursed prescription shipments of Trudhesa has reached new heights, achieving 60% reimbursement so far in the third quarter compared to the 53% and 54% seen in the first and second quarters respectively. However, we maintained the flexibility to invest into the opportunity should we see the opportunity to accelerate our growth, or broad payer access with continued churn over within the acute branded market and of course, the momentum generated by our existing 60 person sales team have led us to the decision to expand our sales team by 50% to 90 sales professionals by the end of July."
