    "content": " In regard with the strength, the quality of the balance sheet, NPLs continued to trend down, the cost of which remains well inside our expected range, and our capital is a slight level of 12%, the core equity Tier 1 following a strong net organic generation of 18 basis points in the second quarter. First half underlying profit over \u00e2\u0082\u00ac1.9 billion, 7% year-on-year, and higher return on tangible equity reaching -- staying above 20%. Looking forward, we expect these trends to continue with NII growing well, although probably at lower rates than until today, flat costs and cost of risk normalization close to around 10 basis points. In Brazil, in the first half, when we had a negative impact due to our balance sheet's initial negative sensitivity to higher rates, higher inflation that is putting pressure on costs and the cost of risk that deteriorated in unsecured loans to individuals, we earn a 21.5% return on tangible equity. Finally, in cards, we managed 96 million cards throughout the group, and revenue grew 28% year-on-year to circa 12 -- sorry, \u00e2\u0082\u00ac2 billion, with double-digit growth in America and Europe. We got already 14% market share, and we're going to continue to grow in the consumer space, but also in credit cards, where we launched in September last year a new car that is selling 100,000 cars a month, and we are growing well there, and we expect the growth to accelerate -- is accelerating."
