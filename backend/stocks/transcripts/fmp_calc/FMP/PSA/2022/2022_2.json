    "content": " So, the assumptions as we move into the second half on the same-store are pretty consistent and quite strong with modest deceleration into the second half given the tough comps that we have, particularly on rates, but also the typical seasonal occupancy pattern that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re expecting this year more so than we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen in the last couple. A couple of very simple examples, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s definitely playing through with the two bigger portfolios that we bought in 2021, the easy storage portfolio that we took down in April of last year, a $1.8 billion transaction, seeing very good lift relative to not only the results we expected in the first year, but we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re even doing better than expectation."
