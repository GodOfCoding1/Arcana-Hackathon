    "content": " While we've continued to see the higher O&M expenses we mentioned on last quarter's call and which we'll discuss further shortly, we expect to remain within our utility guidance range for the year, albeit within the lower half of the range. Net interest income of $61.8 million was up $1 million versus the second quarter of last year due primarily to higher average earning asset balances, partially offset by expected lower fee income associated with the Paycheck Protection Program or PPP as PPP loans continued to pay down. But that statement, as you recall, we're referencing the '22 through '24 earnings grow and whereas we are definitely seeing some PIMs headwinds this year, we are still looking at a potentially robust RPSA PIM in the years, '23 and '24 and then as far as the field cost sharing PIM, yes, we are in particular being challenged this year because of the high fuel oil prices, but like everybody, we are expecting that to moderate as we go forward. We're not at the finish line yet, but as Scott mentioned, we're very pleased with the Clean Energy incentives that will further incentivize Hawaii's transition to 100% renewable, which will again, as Scott mentioned, lower cost for our customers, but also accelerate the utilities progress in achieving its aggressive climate action plan."
