    "content": " Despite an unprecedented combination of macroeconomic challenges occurring in the first full-year under our new regulatory framework, Hawaiian Electric grew earnings 6% year-over-year to $189 million. Second, net income in 2021 benefited from over $11 million in higher PPP fee income compared to 2022. On the utility side, we saw $25 million more in ARA revenues, $4 million in higher fee revenue, $3 million in higher revenue recovered under our major projects interim recovery mechanism, $1 million in higher AFUDC and $1 million due to the reset of heat rate requirements leading to lower penalties for fuel efficiency at our Hawaii Island facility. These items were partially offset by $13 million in higher O&M expenses, which were driven by increased generating station maintenance, higher bad debt expense and increased transmission and distribution, preventative and corrective maintenance, $4 million from higher depreciation expense, $3 million higher interest expense and $2 million in net tax adjustments due to tax credit benefits recognized in 2021. Higher yields on loans and investment securities, strong loan growth and higher balances of investment securities benefited the bank's NIM although these items were offset by lower PPP fee income and a higher cost of funds. I've already covered our expectations for 2023 regarding CapEx and contributions from PIMs, but I'll add that beyond 2023, we expect a long-term utility earnings compound annual growth rate of 5% through 2025 of a 2022 base, including an average of $4 million to $5 million pre-tax annually from PIM. We expect holding company expenses to be higher than 2022 levels due to higher interest rates and debt balances leading to increased holding company interest expense, and we expect a holding company net loss of $0.34 to $0.36 in 2023."
