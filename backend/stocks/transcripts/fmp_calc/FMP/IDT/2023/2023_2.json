    "content": " They can really see basically what I would say is everything that they could get from a big box retailer, but maybe even more because like in a certain way, I think that we are more open with them than what some of the big box retailers might give them. So I mean I think one of the things you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll see from net2phone over the course of the next couple of quarters is continued expansion of average revenue per user and margins from Integra, taking a deeper relationship into a lot of the customers that we already have. I mean, again, like I think the business as well, as you saw, we threw off $20 million plus or minus this past quarter, which is did not decide to invest it in buying back stock this quarter. What we do is we give \u00e2\u0080\u0093 I think what we do is we focus on giving customers good value and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s in every way, from the experience that they have using us to the systems that we have in place to make sure that none of their information is compromised, that the transactions are safe, etcetera, etcetera."
