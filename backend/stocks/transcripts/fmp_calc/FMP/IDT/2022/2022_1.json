    "content": " In today\u2019s presentation, IDT\u2019s management will discuss IDT\u2019s financial and operational results for the three-month period ended October 31, 2021. During prepared remarks by IDT\u2019s Chief Executive Officer, Shmuel Jonas, all participants will be in listen-only mode. After Mr. Jonas\u2019 remarks, Marcelo Fischer, IDT\u2019s Chief Financial Officer will join Mr. Jonas for Q&A. Any forward-looking statements made during this conference call, either in the prepared remarks or in the Q&A session, whether general or specific in nature, are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those which the Company anticipates. In their presentation or in the Q&A session, IDT\u2019s management may make reference to non-GAAP measures, including adjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP earnings or loss per share. I\u2019m joined on the call by Marcelo Fischer, IDT\u2019s Chief Financial Officer, and we\u2019ll both be available to answer questions after my remarks. Our first quarter operational results were  strong once again, highlighted by robust performance from our high-margin net2phone, NRS, and BOSS Money businesses, as well as from Mobile Top-Up. At our net2phone-UCaaS segment, subscription revenue increased 37.5% year-over-year, and revenue and margin increased 20 basis points to 82.3%. In the United States, our expanding network of channel partnerships drove a 42% year-over-year increase in UCaaS subscription revenue, while in Latin America, our strategic focus on mid-sized businesses, multi-channel go-to-market strategies, deeply localized in-country offerings all helped to increase UCaaS subscription revenue by 58%. Net2phone has been getting especially strong traction in several markets, including Mexico, where service revenue increased nearly 150%. Across net2phone\u2019s market, our commitment to provide every customer with top-notch service regardless of size continues to help us win new business, many as a result of referrals from existing satisfied customers. net2phone won the Global Partner of the Year award from UC Today, a popular news service covering the business communications and collaborations industry. In 2022, we will provide our managed service partners with real time account access, enabling them to directly support, configure and modify their clients\u2019 accounts. At NRS, strong demand for NRS PAY payment processing, and our recently launched funding service to provide retailers with ready working capital, digital advertising and transaction data services, coupled with the continued expansion of our POS network, boosted NRS revenue by 104% year-over-year to $10.1 million in the first quarter. Recurring revenue, which excludes revenue from the sale of new terminals, increased 126% to $8.6 million. This opens new markets, creates additional revenue streams to boost ARPU and accelerates growth in our terminal network. This quarter, we deployed software that enables retailers to process electronic benefits provided by the supplemental nutrition program for women, infant and children nationwide which provides nearly $5 billion in benefit annually to over 6 million beneficiaries. Although the first quarter \u201822 revenue decreased 18% compared to the year-ago quarter, the decline is entirely due to the impact of our transitory foreign exchange market conditions that materially improved revenue and gross profit during calendar 2021. Absent that impact, first-quarter fiscal 2022 revenue increased by 45% from the year-ago quarter. Within Traditional Communications, Mobile Top-Up revenue increased 34.1% to $128.5 million, and IDT Global carrier services revenue climbed slightly. Our Mobile Top-Up business generated double-digit year-over-year growth in its three largest sales channels, strengthening its unique position as the only significant omnichannel player in the top-up space. These data bundles now account for roughly 30% of our total sales, and that helped increase average revenue per transaction by 11%, compared to the year-ago quarter. On a consolidated basis, income from operation and adjusted EBITDA both increased modestly compared to the year-ago quarter, rising to $13.8 million and $18.3 million, respectively. This quarter, we had a loss per share of $0.10 compared to EPS of $0.32 a year ago, plus an unrealized $0.49 per share loss on the mark-to-market value of our investment in Rafael Holdings stock. To wrap up, this is a strong quarter for each of our high-margin businesses and sales of Mobile Top-Up continued to drive growth in our Traditional Communications segment. And when we think about NRS PAY and the merchant services vertical, we will continue to focus on growing the payment processing side of the business and offering that very compelling solution to our retailers. And also more recently, we have been able to start onboarding higher-risk retailers such as like tobacco shops, and there the processing fees are higher. So, while our focus so far has been on the small independents that also purchased our POS system, in reality, NRS PAY is now in position to expand payment processing services beyond this channel as well. Like another merchant service product that NRS have launched recently, which you may have heard about is called NRS Funding, which provides our retailers access to capital in a very easy and seamless process. So, it\u2019s still very early. And then, when we think about like our digital-out-of-home vertical, we are seeing that this market continues to grow rapidly. So, for example, if an advertiser wants to offer advertising in California and then we need to pay X dollars per terminal in California, obviously, the more terminals we have in California, the more is the amount of dollar advertising that we\u2019re going to generate. And on that, we leverage that sales force together with our other IDT offerings at retail, such as BOSS Revolution products, , Money Transfer and Top-Up. So, if the team continues to focus on all these types of items, it should really translate into a very healthy growth rate for NRS going forward. Well, again, we don\u2019t do loans. Right now, we\u2019re -- unlike say  become a bank, we haven\u2019t taken that step. And again, as Marcelo said, it\u2019s small right now . I mean, I\u2019d say two things. Like, I don\u2019t -- again, I don\u2019t know the timeline for when change exactly happens. And when it comes to pricing on Money Transfer, I can tell you already that you have Facebook announced their first, I\u2019ll say, country, I think -- their product is called Novi. Like I don\u2019t remember the saying, the saying about any product that\u2019s free, like if it\u2019s free, then you  they\u2019re selling. When it comes to social media, as we\u2019ve all seen with Facebook, they  charge you to use Facebook, but they seem to make $30 billion a quarter now I think. There\u2019s a cost of banking, et cetera, et cetera. So, again, my own opinion -- and again, this isn\u2019t in terms of a timeline, I don\u2019t have them. But my own opinion is like over time, money transfers are definitely going to get significantly less expensive. So now, whether or not the cash money transfers, the people are doing in-stores versus the online money transfers that people are doing today, which one of those has a more rapid change in the pricing, I can\u2019t tell you for sure. And I can see arguments why cash will be harder to, I\u2019ll say, change. But I can see by the same token, there\u2019s a lot more margin there. And you\u2019re seeing numerous services of -- we\u2019re now able to open up 22 -- in 22 countries, we\u2019ll be able to open up basically a Visa card where people can use to spend money in country, and we\u2019ll be making money on every transaction that people are doing in that country. In terms of our growth rate, I mean, again, I think that we are doing very well on Money Transfer. I\u2019m pleased that we now have retail growing again and online is doing quite well as well, thank God. And we\u2019re just trying to focus on improving the product, more customers to use it, getting them to be stickier, et cetera, et cetera. So again, we can\u2019t control what\u2019s happening everywhere in the world, but we can do our best to control what we can control. You\u2019re up to 15,100 installs now. Because I\u2019ve seen that you\u2019re in beauty salons, you\u2019re in some coffee shops, you\u2019re in grocers, you\u2019re in tobacco and liquor. What I would say is that the amount of deployments that we\u2019ve done recently has increased, and we see it continuing to increase. I mean, right now, we\u2019re starting to work on a new business line, which I\u2019m not yet ready to talk about. But we believe that will be something that\u2019s capable of adding 10,000 terminals to our, I\u2019ll say, network. I mean, we\u2019ve talked about Petro in the past. I mean, I think there\u2019s definitely opportunity in international markets for our services, and we\u2019re starting to deploy our first units in Canada. And again, we\u2019re very excited about where the business is going. I mean, we\u2019re really not focused on enterprise, like that. That\u2019s the -- I mean, that\u2019s the one thing I would say for sure is -- we think that that\u2019s a saturated market. And frankly speaking, it\u2019s -- it requires a different kind of sales force and a different -- it\u2019s a very different business, frankly, than who we focused on supporting today. And we don\u2019t see ourselves as going after that space any time in the next couple of years, at least. And so, on payment processing accounts, you\u2019re at 6,800, so that\u2019s 45% of your base and a year ago, you were at 28%. I mean, I think that it will, personally, I mean, but I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m right. And frankly speaking, like we haven\u2019t really even focused on going after, I\u2019ll call it, our base of customers. So, so much like we really focus on making sure all the new customers that we get in, get turned up. But over the next quarter, we\u2019re hoping to add a bunch of salespeople and installation people that will help us go after our existing base of accounts. That\u2019s a gross -- yes, I mean it is net of fees. So, like...\n Again, I\u2019ve read other of our -- I won\u2019t say competitors, I\u2019ll say I\u2019ve read other people in the spaces numbers and most of them do not report it that way. So you would be reporting, I mean, I think over $100 million in revenue for NRS, if you were to report it gross. Well, I mean, I think it\u2019s over $100 million if you\u2019re doing your\u2026\n It very well could be. So, I mean, I guess, just broadly speaking, going back to what you said earlier, my questioning was, you really don\u2019t see a slowdown in growth. I mean, this is -- I mean, this could really be like $100 million ARR business, net of the merchant services, in a couple of years. But I mean, that\u2019s like $1 billion in enterprise value and the entire stock today is at 1 point -- what is it, $1.3 billion, $1.4 billion. Again, we\u2019re -- we don\u2019t want to commit to a time line at this point in terms of a potential spin. Right now, we\u2019re really focused on, a, getting our spin that\u2019s already announced on. And once we\u2019ve completed that, we\u2019ll start to think about others. But again, we\u2019re right now focused on building this into a huge business, and that\u2019s our number one priority. Well, I think it will be a huge business. And you look a few years out, I think this -- the stock is tremendously undervalued, if you just think about where NRS could be in a few years. But anyway, I\u2019ll get off my soapbox. Although I know it\u2019s early stages, but I\u2019d be interested in your thoughts. I mean, it\u2019s definitely early stages. I think all I can say is I think we\u2019re very, very far from it. In terms of the data partners, all of the data partners that we sell to are adding more things that they\u2019re buying from us. We are adding a number of people because like everything else, you have to get your story out there and in front of the right people. Just -- I haven\u2019t asked, but I appreciate that color. For Mobile Top-Up, again, another segment that\u2019s been incredibly impressive in terms of your recent efforts and kind of propping up Traditional Communications overall. And I\u2019m kind of just wondering how you guys are thinking about growing this business moving forward, whether you\u2019re looking at geographic expansion or I guess, highlighting some of the unit economics or breaking some of the stuff out or maybe making a push into more of that direct channel versus retail, and I\u2019d be interested in your thoughts there as well? I mean, I\u2019m going to let Marcelo answer a little bit of the question because he\u2019s been doing more of the work on that in the background in terms of breaking it out and what have you. What I would say is from a sales perspective, and again, I think I also talked about this a little bit last quarter. And we\u2019re really putting in place a team, sort of as we speak, to capitalize on the growth. But again, this is a business again where we really think that, a, we have a very small piece of the market; and b, we\u2019re really, right now, only a U.S. and Africa player. And we think that there\u2019s a ton of market share to be gotten, and we intend to have a very, very sizable and predictable business. I mean, Mobile Top-Up business today is a U.S. story. At the same time, we are also not just a one pony show -- only selling Mobile Top-Up. Recently, we\u2019ve seen that some private equity investment into that space. I think we had a company which we know well called wi-charge.com, just got a nice funding of about $35 million private equity funding into the business. Internally at IDT we\u2019re trying to also to carve out the economics of that business away from the rest of the Traditional Communications products, not only carve out from an accounting perspective, but even managerially, we are trying to make MTU to become more independent in its operations, in terms of its management team and resources. Today, obviously, the top-up business shares a tremendous amount of resources all across the spectrum with our other U.S. offerings, especially  and Money Transfer sales force along the operations people, a lot of it in technology in some areas. And once we get better at doing that, we\u2019ll be glad to share that with our investors. Yes, that\u2019s -- I really appreciate that. And I would echo David\u2019s comments as well, and I\u2019m looking forward to watching you guys continue to execute. I\u2019d echo the thoughts mentioned by Adam and David, I think IDT as a business in challenges doing great. So, you mentioned that you guys have recently extended with your acquisition of the African Mobile Top-Up business. I mean, I\u2019ll let Marcelo speak about the specifics related to the financials of it. Tomorrow -- I\u2019m sorry, not tomorrow, Thursday, we have a Company-wide kickoff, and they will be presenting about their business to everyone. And they\u2019re joining all of our meetings that we have with carriers around the world and tell them about their abilities of selling into Africa as well as, I\u2019ll call it, pan-Africa as well. So, I mean, we\u2019re very happy to have them on board. Hi, Kevin Yes, the company that we acquired is no new -- it\u2019s not a new relationship to IDT. They are -- they have been one of the largest aggregators supplying to us, the Mobile Top-Up time for African MNOs for a long time. So, that improves the cost that we get for time for African carriers, and having a lower cost allows our team in the U.S. to price Mobile Top-Up offerings better in the marketplace. And by doing so, they\u2019ll be able to gain market share and expand the market in the U.S. So, it\u2019s a real good relationship, initiative we have known for a long time and the integration, the synergies, the pricing, the cost, and approach to go to market have been very strong. And because of the fact that they have boots in the ground in several African countries, it also opens our ability to market our products in that continent faster as part of our international growth strategy. And I would add one more thing to what Marcelo said is that they, on their own have been doing quite well in sales to African carriers and their own margins have improved. No, that\u2019s amazing to hear. I\u2019m glad that it\u2019s -- the integration is going well and that in terms of the P&L, it\u2019s also pretty good in terms of reducing costs and verticalizing relationship. I think that recently, if I read correctly, I think there is a company, we know them well, I mean that with ours, wi-charge.com. It\u2019s just anecdotal, right, example of the fact that now people are interested in this type of Mobile Top-Up and all the prepaid digital offerings right now. So, I think you guys have talked a lot about how you guys are mostly in the United States right now and domestic, but you\u2019re thinking about doing some sort of expansion outwards. And so just looking at like year-over-year growth, Mobile Top-Up is somewhere around like 30%, 40%. Again, right now, we\u2019ve been focused on acquiring customers in the U.S., and we haven\u2019t focused on acquiring customers outside of the U.S. And that means that we have to hire D2C marketing, personnel essentially in each of the markets that we go after because each one of them is different. They all need their own SEO and SEM, and they all have their own advertising partners and their own -- and then from a technology point of view, you need to be able to accept different payment types in different countries. So again, I think that it might be, I\u2019ll say, not linear growth internationally. But definitely, over time, I think that the amount of growth that we could get from international is way in excess of 30% a year even -- I think that that would be an understatement. And I guess, the second thing I would ask is just like in general, I like Mobile Top-Up. So, you guys are probably getting a better take rate than most other Mobile Top-Up businesses. I think I mean, domestically, I think that we have done a good job of improving, I\u2019ll call it, our take rate by moving more of the business to direct-to-consumer and negotiating really good deals. As far as internationally, again, we don\u2019t have as much experience with it. We definitely don\u2019t think that in every country, we\u2019re going to be able to get the same take rates that we have here in the U.S. I mean, we\u2019re hoping that when it equalizes out, that it will be similar to where the U.S. is, but it might end up being slightly lower."
