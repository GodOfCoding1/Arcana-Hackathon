    "content": " Within our Fintech segment, NRS had another outstanding quarter, increasing recurring revenue by 157% year-over-year to $17.7 million. net2phone\u00e2\u0080\u0099s loss from operations decreased to $1.8 million in the fourth quarter, half the level of the year ago quarter and we expect that net2phone segment will achieve EBITDA profitability by the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023 while continuing to grow robustly. However, thinking about the future of Mobile Top-Up, which is now the largest revenue generator within the Traditional Communications segment, it's instructive to look at our fourth quarter results exclusive of that volatile corridor. We anticipate that the continued growth of high-margin fintech and cloud communications businesses and our Mobile Top-Up offerings will further significantly improve IDT's consolidated adjusted EBITDA, more than offsetting the decreasing contributions that we expect from our BOSS Revolution Calling and IDT Global businesses within the lower-margin Traditional Communications segment. The quarter ended fiscal year's strong results would not have been possible without the hard work of IDT's employees worldwide, who continue to rise to the challenges and beat expectations. That's incredible, and then I guess if I look at the EBITDA contribution from the Fintech segment, which obviously includes both NRS and BOSS Money Transfer, the segment did $6.2 million in EBITDA this quarter alone."
