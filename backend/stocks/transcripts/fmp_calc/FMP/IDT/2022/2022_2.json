    "content": " We are still in the early stages of NRS development in terms of our addressable markets, new service offerings and monetization of our current offerings and net2phone subscription revenue increased 32% year-over-year to $12.5 million in the second quarter of 2020. We're delighted to welcome them to the IDT family, we will incorporate Integra\u2019s CCaaS service with net2phone UCaaS solutions to create a higher value integrated offering that we expect to drive growth and significantly enhance net2phone's unit economics as we become more competitive of market. But if our stock continues to perform as poorly as it's done over the past couple of months, it's definitely not out of the question that at some point, we would start to either buy back shares or some other idea, but again, I don't want to say that we're going to do it because we haven't discussed it with our Board, and we do not have a plan in place at this particular moment."
