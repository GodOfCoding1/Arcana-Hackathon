    "content": " Watch and special mention credits totaled a combined $35.9 million at December 31st, down $3.5 million this quarter, and as compared to $60.8 million a year earlier. At 3.3 million in loans past due 30 days or more, they represent 14 basis points of total loans, which is down from 21 basis points last quarter, and 35 basis points or $7.7 million, 1 year ago. Turning to our Ag portfolio and agricultural update, our Ag production and other loans to farmers were down $22.7 million in the quarter, and up $5.4 million compared to this time last year. While Ag real estate balances were up $10.5 million over the quarter, and are up $10.2 million compared to December last year. Our net interest margin in the December quarter was 3.77, which included about 6 basis points of contribution from fair value discount accretion on acquired loan portfolios, or $381,000 in dollar terms. Even so, our continued positive credit metrics along with the stabilized projection for economic recovery indicated that no provision for credit losses was appropriate for the quarter after a modest recovery in the September quarter and as compared to a charge of $1 million in the December quarter a year ago. The quarter's loan growth, while we didn't make a provision for credit losses, moved our allowances of percentage of gross loans down 7 basis points from the linked quarter to 1.36% at December 31st. Our volume per loan originations was about $335 million in the December quarter, up from the September quarter and up from the first half of the calendar year when our totals were elevated due to second round PPP activity."
