    "content": " Most importantly, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve asked a ton of questions and taken time to listen fully to understand the opportunities that lie ahead for our industry, our company and all our stakeholders, homeowners, guests, employees, communities and stockholders alike.Before we get too far along, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d like to take a moment to thank our local team members in Florida and the Southeastern United States that supported Vacasa\u00e2\u0080\u0099s homeowners, guests and communities, in addition to their own loved ones during Hurricane Ian. Gross booking value, which is the combination of nights sold and gross booking value per night sold reached $969 million in the third quarter, up 25% year-over-year. Nights sold were $2.1 million in the third quarter, up 12% year-over-year, with the increase primarily driven by the addition of new homes to the platform. Revenue, which consists primarily of our commission on the rents we generate for homeowners and the fees we collect from guests, was $412 million in the third quarter, up 25% year-over-year and above our guidance range of $385 million to $395 million. Adjusted EBITDA was $46 million for the third quarter, below our guidance range of $55 million to $60 million, with the shortfall largely due to higher cost of revenue and operations and support expenses, relative to our expectations."
