    "content": " Nights sold reached 1.3 million in the first quarter, up 64% year-over-year, with the increase primarily driven by the addition of new properties to the platform. Gross booking value, which is the combination of nights sold and gross booking value per night sold, reached $494 million in the first quarter, up 101% year-over-year. Revenue, which consists primarily of our commission on the rents we generate for homeowners and the fees we collect from guests, was $247 million in the first quarter, up 91% year-over-year and within our guidance range of $245 million to $255 million. On your second question, GBV per night sold sustainability, I'll point out that in our guidance, we've mentioned that we're assuming that the combination of gross booking value per night sold and occupancy do take a step back from those record levels that we saw primarily in peak season, Q3, Q4 of last year."
