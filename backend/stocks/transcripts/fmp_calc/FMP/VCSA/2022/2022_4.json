    "content": " Revenue, which consists primarily of our commission on the rents we generate for homeowners and the fees we collect from guests, was $218 million in the fourth quarter, up 14% year-over-year and above our guidance range of $195 million to $215 million. Given our focus on profitability, we believe full year 2023 revenue will likely decline by a low double-digit to high single-digit percentage year-over-year; primarily driven by our assumed reduction in gross booking value per home versus last year, our reduced investment in our portfolio programs, the wind down of our real estate brokerage services, and lapping the recognition of future stay credits in 2022. Please go ahead, your line is open. Please go ahead, your line is open. Please go ahead, your line is open. Please go ahead, your line is open."
