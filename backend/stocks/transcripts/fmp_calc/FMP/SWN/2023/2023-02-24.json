    "content": " When we look at the quality of our Haynesville inventory and the view that \u00e2\u0080\u0093 this is a relatively short-term downturn and the cycle times with bringing those Haynesville wells online, I think with where prices are at right now, we believe that sets us up nicely going into 2024, where we think there is a more constructive market. But I think as \u00e2\u0080\u0093 in a $3 gas price environment, a lot of capital, we believe, needs to \u00e2\u0080\u0093 the cost needs to come way down and on the LOE side that would lower that annual capital number. I think the other thing that we have talked about is access to the international market, going to be particularly careful with that to understand what that actually means and how you protect whatever you think you are going to get from enhanced margins or low-cost liquefaction, turning high cost liquefaction, shipping political dynamics, fiscal, all of the different things you would look at to want to take on that potentially higher priced commodity."
