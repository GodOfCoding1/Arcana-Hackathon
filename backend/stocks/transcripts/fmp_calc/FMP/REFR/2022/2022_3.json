    "content": " We also discussed in our August 4 conference call, new cars being introduced in the third and fourth quarters of this year as well as other developments in the smart-glass industry. We also noted earlier increased economic activity in other product areas, including multiple programs by Vision Systems, Gauzy, AGP, which is now producing SPD for two new car models coming out next year and LG display with their transparent OLED display products using SPD film. Well, thanks for the question. Well, thanks for the question. And given the popularity of the SPD-SmartGlass roof within McLaren, can tell me that their customers love it, and it is a highly taken option for our percentage, the CEO's experience at Ferrari with the Purosangue and the strategic contribution of SUVs to revenue and profit at luxury carmakers, this can be a quite nice development for research frontiers. And with each new product introduction, whether it's a new car model, a new way of using our SPD technology such as what LG is doing for televisions and transportation windows for trains, what BMW and others have done with adaptive headlights and heads-up displays or other products and other vehicles."
