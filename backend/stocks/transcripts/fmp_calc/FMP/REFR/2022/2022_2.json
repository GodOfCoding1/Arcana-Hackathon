    "content": " During today's presentation, all parties will be in a listen-only mode. The words expect, anticipate, plans, forecasts and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. These statements reflect the company's current beliefs and a number of important factors, could cause actual results for future periods to differ materially from those expressed. The company will be answering many of the questions that were e-mailed to it prior to this conference call, either in their presentation or as part of the Q&A session at the end. In some cases, the company has responded directly to e-mail questions prior to this call or will do so afterwards in order to answer more questions of general interest to shareholders on this call. I would now like to turn the conference call over to Joe Harary, President and Chief Executive Officer of Research Frontiers. It's great to have you, and hello, everyone, and welcome to our second quarter of 2022 investor conference call. And as of June 30, 2022, the company had cash and cash equivalents of $1.9 million, working capital of $2.3 million and total shareholders' equity of $2.4 million. The company expects to have sufficient working capital for at least the next 2 years of operations, which would take us into the middle to late 2024. This is based upon our lower quarterly burn rate of $300,000 to $350,000 per quarter with higher projected revenue during that period, mostly from new car models. In our last conference call, we spoke about new car models coming into production in Q3 and Q4 of this year with our SPD-SmartGlass technology in it. In aircraft last year, there were significant new projects in the aircraft industry, including the ACJ TwoTwenty program by Airbus, Comlux and Vision Systems, has put electronically dimmable windows by Vision Systems in the new Epic aircraft and in the Daher TBM 960 aircraft. Some have asked me how these items will affect Research Frontiers business, going forward. When I was at the New York Fed, we were experiencing high levels of inflation, like today, that was driven by disruptions in the labor market and international debt crisis, high energy prices and a variety of other factors. So that's helpful, . But with some payment focus and applying basic principle of  studying economic tools and , we were able to fix things. And even though we went through this 4 decades ago, I never lost the lessons I learned from that period. Research Frontiers has been through 8 recessions, probably the most recent one that had many of us worried other than perhaps the current situation was the world economic crisis in 2008. But if you look back on that period, companies that produce high-end products such as Mercedes, Porsche and Audi and BMW, have reported, in some cases, even record profits. Nothing is totally immune to reduced economic activity such as a recession, but some of the business that we are in are felt to be recession-proof, and history has supported this. I, of course, do not wish high energy prices on anyone, but we're also seeing in the United States gas prices that only existed in Europe historically. If you look at how Europe reacted to that over the last few decades, they tended to be on the forefront of energy efficiency in cars, homes and offices. Our SPD-Smart technology can increase the gas mileage of cars, lower CO2 emissions by 4 grams per kilometer and extend the driving range of electric vehicles by 5.5%. So we expect that even though there is uncertainty and turmoil in other parts of the market, if history and experience is a guide, Research Frontiers and our well-run licensees will actually do quite well. In addition to certain CPI adjustment provisions in our license agreements that benefit us, more importantly, remember that we get paid on the percentage of sales by our licensees. Simply put, the higher those sales, the higher our license royalties. And going back to my experience at the Fed, I mentioned that we look at broad macroeconomic trends. And today, we spoke about some of the bigger ones such as recession and inflation. Now let me talk about leading economic indicators, which is the other thing that I used to focus on as an economist to get a clear look at the future. In our last conference call, I reported on multiple car models that were expected to come out in the near term, using our SPD-SmartGlass technology, starting in the second half of 2022. As I mentioned, that's still on track. Also, the information that we have received is now that even more cars than we originally expected will use SPD near term. I may be wrong, looking and get at the leading indicators, Gauzy has made substantial additional investments in expanding production capacity. So the area that I may be incorrect about is not whether our business will expand, but by how much. On the personal side, I want to take this moment to send a special congratulations to Gauzy's CEO, Eyal Peso and his wife on the birth of their new son earlier this week. Yes, nothing made be happier than to see the photo of you holding your new son that you sent me from the hospital that day. With that, I look forward to answering your questions. Let me take a few that were e-mailed to me, and then we'll open the queue up for additional questions. Well, from an accounting standpoint, we look forward 12 months. From having a clear visibility on where our licensees and their customers are, I look forward at least 12 to 18 months. Yes, actually, the Dynamic Glass Act provisions are still in there, and that would benefit us because it gives us tax credits for smart glass on cars. It's expected to, and they're making substantial moves in that area. Jeff Harvey asked, when I talk about  as a competitor with a competitive technology, I had the opportunity to actually see  product at the CES this year. And they, like all the other smart glass companies, were using a variant of an electrochromic technology, where they have an electrochemical reaction inside the glass. And it has the same limitations that all electrochromic devices have, which is it's slow and non-uniform. Now what they do to try to mask that, and you can't see it unless you go up to the window to look through it, but that's where people can actually see the glass is there. First of all, about architecture, we've had architectural projects use the new Gauzy film. The backlog that we're having, which is why also they're expanding their production capacity, is really focusing where their film is going right now to the automotive market and the train market, in particular, automotive though. But right now, the most predictable large market is automotive and trains and also aircraft. When they did file their numbers again, though, there's kind of some interesting things. So in the last financial filing, and the next one is the 8th of August, not too far away, they were talking about their revenues being up from $9.7 million to $17 million. It sounds like a nice increase, except that they bought 2 companies that are in facilities management and electronics. They were kind of saying, \"Well, our revenues went up quite a bit and our cost of revenue only went up a little bit.\" And we believe that almost all of that, if not all of it, is in the smart glass area. So what they were doing is, in my opinion, fully subsidizing, even to a larger extent than before, their customers' purchases. But with their smart glass sales where they are, we actually and our licensees have higher sales levels historically, and we didn't spend $2 billion to achieve it. By my estimate, unless they raise capital, they will be out of cash by mid-October -- I'm sorry, mid-November. Our other public competitor, Crown Electrokinetics, I believe, by my estimate, will run out of cash, even though they did 2 offerings, including one at a pretty high dividend rate of 12% with a redemption premium of 25%. Even with all of that in 1 million share public offering, they're probably going to run out of cash unless they raise more capital. And when they file their financials, maybe we'll know more by August 25. These might have been most of them that were e-mailed, and I thank everyone that took the opportunity to ask the questions so that we can either incorporate them into our presentation or answer them efficiently. So Karen, if you wouldn't mind opening up the floor to any questions that might exist. Just to clarify, you said that Gauzy has increased their capacity, but they also make PDLC. And our next question comes from August Berman, an investor. Just one question, I was walking my dogs off and I was listening to a Bloomberg podcast talking about the potential oil crisis or natural gas crisis in Europe in the winter time. I would imply -- how do...\n No, no. Stuttgart, Germany -- I've been to Stuttgart, Germany many times in the winter time, and you have to be careful. But remember, they also scaled up their new film production facility in the middle of COVID when people couldn't even come in and out of Germany. And if there's an issue, they could always shift things over to Israel, but obviously, the production facility in Stuttgart is much higher capacity, much more efficient and optimized for SPD. And then actually, just one other question I had. I was looking at Gauzy's website, and they talked kind of a promotional about us with the new integration between Gauzy and Vision Systems. And they talked about in their fiscal press release, there were 5 manufacturing sites and on Gauzy's information, it says 4 manufacturing sites. When I was there for their -- when I was there for their -- they actually had their company-wide meeting in the middle of COVID and I happened to be there and the people in Israel were there physically, the people from different parts of the world were dialing in and -- on Zoom. And they were introducing all of the new people they hired, and there just was one engineer after another one, production person after another for the SPD project, and this was way back in December 2019 -- 2020. So -- and since then, if you go on their website, you'll see their advertising for more and more people. So once again, a leading indicator that I like to look at is hiring. I've seen that and a couple of other shareholders have seen that, too, with  hiring and then enroll for  specifically, so that was great to see. And our next question comes from Leonard , an investor. I guess, in your comments today, you were talking about the near-term markets would be mostly automotive, transportation, trains, et cetera, planes. The only one that I've seen publicly announced was the Cadillac towards peak, which is like, I don't know, not that many cars. I think when I -- earlier on, when I said that these near-term introductions can double our best year in SPD use. And remember, in the introduction, sometimes there for -- what some of these companies would consider test markets, test regions of the world and things like that. Even with it just being test regions, you're talking about a substantial increase over our best year. I'm in an industry where you got to let the automakers speak for us, the Tier 1 suppliers speak second and then Research Frontiers quickly speak third to draw the connection. But I think that in the past, you've heard us talk about who some of the strategic investors in Gauzy were, and you could probably get a good sense from that. And our next question comes from John Nelson, an investor. And are any of your other licensees working on sun visor because it seems like it's going to... Well, that's one of the holy grails. Let me say yes to your questions, and I can't go into more detail about it. But by the way, just to the , it's always been one of my favorite applications. And maybe rest in peace, Bob Saxe, I used to drive back west from Research Frontiers every evening into the bright sun. And every time the sun was at our eyes, Bob would say, \"We got to get those sun visors as soon as we can.\" So it's a pet project for him, and I hope I can honor his legacy by getting that out in a big way. And we've made good progress, but I don't want to promise anything until it's commercial on that and other areas as well, including supporting our licensees with their efforts as well. So helping them do it better, faster and improving the technology consistently. And our next question comes from Art Brady, an investor. I wanted to know December 5, Russia is supposed to stop  gas  to the Germany. I'm not directly involved in that, but our licensees are pretty good planners for contingencies. Earlier on, August Berman asked a similar question about natural gas shortages expected for Germany, and I don't see that as being a problem. No, it was a Japanese glass company, Nippon. NSG has been -- other than their ownership of Pilkington, which maybe what I was referring to, Pilkington is the British glass company that they bought many years ago. Other than that, they're focusing on the display market. We are talking about later this year or early next year, is what the last report I saw, 55-inch TV. And our next question comes from Bill Berg, an investor. In the near term, Joe, auto is the area to look to for revenue. Yes, that's what I said earlier. I believe -- yes, yes. And I think one of the drivers, and that's a great question, Bill. One of the drivers on that is that for the first time, we have a film that's wide enough for architectural applications for both commercial and residential. And also, some of the things that I can't talk about are different ways of delivering that product to the customer much more efficiently and making it much more usable for all types of architectural applications, whether it's new construction or otherwise. Of course, it's -- that and automotive are keeping them busy. I don't know if people remember, but when we had the factory launch for Gauzy, it was in Stuttgart, Germany, I might have mentioned on a call either before or after that, that they built in the space to replicate their existing SPD film , which is their only business out there, right on that same site. Although I imagine that now that they know what they need to build and where to get it and the normal things that you go through when you're commissioning a new film line, they may build the second one in South Korea or somewhere else that's closer to the customer, but they have the capacity to do a lot. And God bless them, they make the investment as do our other licensees, when this business is supporting it. I was surprised to see $154,000 charge-off in bad debt. I think that ultimately, that is going to be collectible. I think that there are some pockets of the world where people need a little help to get started and I'm not giving up on it, and I probably -- it's probably more of an accounting issue than anything else, not an operational or a collection issue as far as I'm concerned. But what somebody hasn't paid for a while, put into -- dictates that you take some kind of reserve. And if we didn't take that reserve, our costs for this quarter would have been lower than for the first half, would have been lower. $270 million, what I could do with $270 million, which is what they burned last year, would certainly be a lot better than what they did with it. But I listened to the conference call right before, just one -- and they did say that in the next 2 months, they are going to beef up their balance sheet. Well, as an institutional investor, you probably know that it's probably not going to be available on such good terms for them. I think last year, they went through -- they burned through $270 million in cash. It's a royalty that I am owed that quite frankly, my accountants and I would probably disagree, I believe it's fully collectible. But we have policies in place that say that after a certain period of time, you take an appropriate reserve and that's fine. In theory, that's like $1.5 million worth of revenues to somebody. We've taken reserves in the past, and we've penultimately collected it. But anyway, I look -- as the guys said, we're on the cusp. Well, back in the old late 1800s, that could have been a cliff. Our next question comes from Francis , an investor. We don't think so. We don't think so. The most expensive component of this is not so much the materials that are inside the emulsion, although they're specialty materials, so they have to be produced precisely. But believe it or not, the conductive coated plastic that we coat on is a pretty expensive component, and that will be the same, no matter what kind of  film you're working with, whether it's PDLC or SPD. So volumes, that can come down significantly, which is why Gauzy has been able to project out fairly substantial price reductions in the price of their film, based on volume. And for every square meter of film, you need 2 square meters of conductive coated plastic, one on each side of the emulsion, to activate the nano particles inside the film. Now you also mentioned, Gauzy might build another facility in South Korea, so it could be closer to... I was speculating that it might be in Asia, but they already have a very good one in Stuttgart. And the reason they put it there is it's 10 minutes away from Porsche, 20 minutes away from Mercedes, an hour and  minutes away from BMW and an hour and  minutes away from Audi. Audi, Mercedes, BMW, nothing was ever mentioned about any products being used there in those cars. Is that...\n Well, that's because they haven't gone into serial production with the product there. There's a story unrelated to the SPD glass that goes into that, and that's their business, and I know. Our next question comes from Alan Ginsberg, an investor. Yes, there's certainly that. If I took McLaren, for example, the take rates are so high, it could very well be a standard equipment if they want it, but the economics on how you sell cars and how you price it off. As long as the volumes are there, I'm happy. Well, I think that it's going to depend on how many of those cars are delivered in the -- between now and the end of the year and how many go into the next year. And our next question comes from John Stroble, an Investor. You said that in 3 years, architectural will be the main focus of SPD use. What I said is, in 3 years, it could be a very big part of our business. I think that like any market, it has to grow. It starts, people get used to it. I think by 3 years, it probably will be a much bigger market for us. And our next question is from Leonard Litzau, an investor. And now if you look at the size of the Cadillac, it's much bigger than that and the other cars coming out are much bigger than that. And yes, there are other areas of the car, which I'll talk a little bit about -- or I'll mention at least in my closing remarks. Our next question is from Thomas McCarthy, an investor. We use the tax code to actually promote certain social behavior that you want, like energy efficiency. And if you -- on your personal taxes, I'll ask you if you put in solar water heater or some other things, and they'll give you some credits for that. The Dynamic Glass Act potentially can be a major reduction in costs, based on the tax benefits. But I don't count anything as being done until it's done, especially in this environment of politics. When we started Research Frontiers and even into the year 2000, 2005, if you Google smart glass, you got 5 hits. Now, we are the industry. But I don't know if those are going to pass, just like I don't know if they're going to pass here. I mean, sometimes, you come in through a side door, not a back door in terms of energy-efficient improvements and things like that and are encouraged. They have what they call demand management programs, where -- because the marginal cost of a kilowatt of electricity is pretty high. They want you to, especially during peak times, dial it back. We just focus on having the best possible product, and our licensees focus on selling it. It's Seth here from Research Frontiers, but this is a clarification. Otherwise, I'd be accused of having a plant on the call, I guess. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just, I'm going to get a kick out of seeing it. I don't want to give the details, but we're talking about a retrofittable application that makes it easier. And just for people who live in New York or Boston or Chicago or places like that, you'll know what I'm talking about. Whenever you replace glass on a, let's say, an apartment building or an office building, that is scaffolding up so you don't drop the glass on people that are walking by them. And that's -- and if you live in those cities and you live in a co-op, you have to get co-op board approval, anytime you make a structural change to the outside of a building with a retrofit. It's a lot more like putting up new shades or blinds, where you don't need approval of the co-op board. So it could be a very significant benefit to people to be able to get smart windows in their homes or offices much easier, especially in large cities. And at this time, there are no further questions. I'm going to make a few closing remarks, and I thank everyone for their questions. If we haven't fully addressed your questions, as always, just feel free to e-mail us, we're here 24/7. Research Frontiers enters the second half of this year, very well positioned for success. And when you consider the fact that Research Frontiers as an asset-light intellectual property licensing company with very little expenses, inflation is not expected to have much an effect on the cost side for us. On the revenue side, because we get paid as a percentage of our licensee sales, with 10% in automotive and 15% in other markets, inflation, well, undesirable in general, could actually have a positive effect on our revenues. Our licensees have expanded their production capacity, major customers such as Hyundai have invested in them and our projected product pipeline for the next 6 to 18 months is quite strong. In fact, the number of new car models and new cars that are expected to come out with our SPD-SmartGlass technology over this 6- to 18-month period has never been higher. And we expect it, just in the initial period of these cars introduction, to at least double our best year in terms of SPD film usage. Our licensees that are closer to the frontline, have almost completed their steps to actually quintuple production capacity. And going back to the macroeconomic trends, electric vehicle adoption is accelerating at a much higher rate than any of us originally anticipated just 5 years ago. And even if they did put larger batteries or had better battery technology, we still would help them increase the driving range of their vehicles further because of the 18-degree Farenheit reduction in cabin temperature through use of our SPD-SmartGlass in just the sunroof. In some areas, we're also slated for other areas of the car as well. So during that time, we will also be helping internal combustion engine vehicles reduce CO2 emissions by as much as 4 grams per kilometer. Glass is a highly desirable building material, making homes and offices more functional and livable. With our technology, we also bring beneficial daylighting in when people want it, keep unwanted UV, heat, light and glare out and save energy in the process. In vehicles such as aircraft, trains and of course, cars, we get passengers a better connection with their outside world and block harmful UV heat and light and glare while enhancing security and privacy and road stability. And with no moving parts other than our highly efficient nanoparticles, we offer greater reliability than traditional shades or blinds recurrence and are much easier to clean and sanitize, thereby reducing germs and allergens. By eliminating weight in the roofs of cars, and Daimay estimates this to be about 13 pounds of weight savings and also that our SPD-SmartGlass allows them to remove 56 components from the car, and increasing the headroom without raising the center of gravity, we make vehicles more stable, whether they're cars, trucks, boats or trains. While my wife and children saw the hard work it took us to get the smart glass industry established, our 13, I'm happy to say, growing number of grandchildren, and now Peso has a new son, and many of your own children and grandchildren never lived in a world without our SPD-SmartGlass."
