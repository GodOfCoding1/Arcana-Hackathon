    "content": " Organic net sales were down 4% for the quarter, driven by the expected lapping of prior year retailer inventory replenishment, as well as constrained supply in the current quarter. Within ready-to-serve, Chunky had a very strong quarter, increasing consumption 8% and on top of 2% growth in the prior year quarter and grew share by 0.6 points versus prior year. Goldfish performed very well in the quarter, increasing share by 0.5 point and growing consumption high single digits versus prior year behind strong marketing activation, improved performance in multi-packs and continued successful limited edition flavor innovations resulting in improved base velocities and increased household penetration. For the first quarter, as we left 8% growth in the prior year, organic net sales declined 4% due to the anticipated cycling of year ago retailer inventory recovery and supply pressures. All said, this past quarter, our organic net sales on a comparable basis were 5% higher compared to 2 years ago or the first fiscal quarter of 2020. Organic net sales decreased 4% during the quarter, driven by a six point volume headwind, which reflects lapping of the prior year retailer inventory recovery and the beforementioned supply constraints. Within Snacks, organic net sales decreased 1% to $1 billion as favorable price and sales allowances were more than offset by volume declines and increased promotional spending compared to moderated levels in the prior year quarter."
