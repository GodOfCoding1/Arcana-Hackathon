    "content": " Chunky continued its positive momentum with dollar share up 1.6 points in the quarter coming from strong base velocities as we further recovered on shelf, and 13% dollar consumption growth versus the prior year. Closing out the slide, Pacific has returned to growth as a result of restored supply and innovation with dollar consumption of Pacific RTS soup up 21% versus prior year and share grew by 0.4 points in the quarter. Strong sales growth, a relatively flat gross profit margin as cost inflation and unfavorable volume and mix were mostly mitigated by pricing and productivity improvements combined with continued support of our brands and expected lower pension income resulted in a 15% increase in adjusted EBIT. Inflation and higher other supply chain costs had a negative impact of 1,260 basis points with the majority of the impact driven by continued cost inflation as overall input prices on a rate basis increased by approximately 18%, which were slightly higher than the fourth quarter of fiscal '22. Our Meals & Beverages division delivered a strong quarter with both reported and organic net sales increasing 15% versus prior year primarily due to increases in U.S. retail products, including soup and Prego pasta sauces as well as gains in our foodservice business. Your line is open. As you think about the next quarter, I think the two things you'll see that are going to be a little different than Q1 and is you won't have the inventory recovery opportunity, and you probably will see a little bit of modest increase in promotional spend and the continued kind of investment in the year, and that might be a little different than what you saw in Q1. Your line is open. Your line is open. Yes, not versus a year ago. Yes, not versus a year ago. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open."
