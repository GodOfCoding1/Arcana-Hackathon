    "content": " Total third-party net sales for the fourth quarter of 2022 were $228.2 million, a decrease of 12.4% on a reported basis and a decrease of 9.1% in constant currency. After adjusting for the revenue disruptions and one less selling day, fourth quarter third-party net sales declined 8.3% and 4.9% in reported and constant currency respectively. Q4 global dental third-party net sales were $115.8 million, representing a 7.6% decrease on a reported basis and a 2.9% decrease in constant currency when compared to the prior year period. Normalizing for one less selling day and the impact of China, the global dental business was approximately flat year-over-year in the fourth quarter on a constant currency basis. In the US, dental third-party net sales of $67.5 million decreased by 2.8%, hampered by the loss of one less selling day versus 2021. Outside of the US, dental third-party net sales of $48.3 million decreased by 13.6% on a reported basis and 2.9% in constant currency including an approximate 3.2 percentage point impact related to China. Q4 global spine third-party net sales were $112.3 million, a 16.9% decrease on a reported basis and a 14.8% decrease in constant currency when compared to the prior year period. Q4 2022 adjusted research and development expenses of $11.6 million or 5.1% as a percentage of third-party sales, a decrease of 40 basis points compared to the prior year period. Adjusted EBITDA in the fourth quarter 2022 of $28.1 million or 12.3% of third-party net sales, reflects an increase of 70 basis points from 11.6% in the prior year period. We expect 2023 net sales to be in the range of $825 million to $850 million, reflecting a 7.9% year-over-year reported net sales decline at the midpoint."
