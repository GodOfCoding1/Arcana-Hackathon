    "content": " Nonetheless, I am pleased to announce we recognized $233.4 million in total net sales for the second quarter, declining roughly 8% year-over-year on a constant currency basis, but offering the baseline against we are confident we can grow over time. Beginning with sales, total third-party net sales for the second quarter of 2022 were $233.4 million, a decrease of 11.5% on a reported basis and 8.3% in constant currency when compared to the prior year period. Shifting to our two segments, Global dental\u00e2\u0080\u0099s third-party net sales were $118.2 million representing a 1.8% decrease on a reported basis and a 2.9% increase in constant currency when compared to the prior year period, primarily driven by implants and digital dentistry net sales growth and an extra selling day in Q2 of 2022, offset by foreign currency exchange headwinds, mainly net sales denominated in euro. Global spine third-party net sales were $115.2 million in the second quarter of 2022, a 19.6% decrease on a reported basis and a 17.8% decrease in constant currency when compared to the prior year period. The decline versus prior year is primarily due to lower net sales, which drives higher excess and obsolete inventory in spine, partially offset by higher gross margins in our Dental segment due to a higher margin contribution from implant growth. Adjusted selling, general and administrative expenses of $124.5 million or 53.3% of third-party net sales reflects a reduction of $13.0 million over the prior year period. Inclusive of a greater-than-anticipated impact of foreign exchange headwinds, we are revising our full year 2022 net sales outlook to a range of $915 million to $930 million."
