Geographically, within dental, U.S. third-party net sales of $68.3 million increased by 8.2% and outside of the U.S. sales of $52.2 million increased by 4% and 10.5% on an as-reported and constant currency basis, respectively.

Adjusted selling, general and administrative expenses of $116.2 million or 49.5% of third-party sales reflects a reduction of $10.3 million or 190 basis points when compared to the prior year period due to lower variable selling expenses and timing delays of cost to incur standup activities for ZimVie as an independent public company."
