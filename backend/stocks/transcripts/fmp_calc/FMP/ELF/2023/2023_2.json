    "content": " We grew net sales by 33%, increased gross margin by 190 basis points and delivered $27 million in adjusted EBITDA, up 47%. With the combination of our topline momentum, and the ongoing strong ROI, we now expect marketing to be at the high end of our 17% to 19% range for fiscal 2023. our value proposition, innovation engine and ability to attract and engage consumers are helping us gain more retail space. Marketing and digital investment for the quarter was approximately 16% of net sales, in line versus a year ago and was lower than expected on a percentage basis given our significant top line outperformance. As Tarang mentioned, with the combination of our top line momentum and strong ROI, we now expect marketing and digital investment for the full year to be approximately 19% of net sales. Our outlook implies adjusted EBITDA growth of approximately 25% to 27% versus prior year, up from approximately 12% to 14% previously and on top of the strong 22% growth in fiscal 2022. As you mentioned, we're really pleased with our Q2 results, net sales up 33%, adjusted EBITDA, up 47%. So not only elfcosmetics.com where we're seeing good growth, but our retailer.com, ulta.com, target.com, I think they've made a number of investments to improve their digital business and Amazon continues to be quite strong for us and a great source of growth. So from an overall guidance standpoint, again, we feel great about our guidance thing, 22% to 24% on the topline 25%, 27% growth in adjusted EBITDA in this environment is really something that we're quite proud of."
