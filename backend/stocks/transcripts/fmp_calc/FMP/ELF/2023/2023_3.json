    "content": " We grew net sales by 49%, increased gross margin by 180 basis points and delivered $37 million in adjusted EBITDA, up 69%. Q3 adjusted EBITDA was $37 million, up 69% versus last year and adjusted EBITDA margin was approximately 25% of net sales. In Q4, our outlook implies approximately 42% to 46% net sales growth, reflecting the strong consumption trends we're seeing. It feels like they're kind of beginning to rise with the new buzzy generation and because of your price point and high level of innovation and you're always on trend, I think it seems like you guys make a great entry skincare or color cosmetics brands."
