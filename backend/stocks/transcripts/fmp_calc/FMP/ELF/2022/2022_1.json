    "content": " We delivered Q1 net sales growth of 50% versus prior year, driven by ongoing momentum across our brand portfolio, better fulfillment rates than we expected and benefits from stimulus related spending. And then, just to follow-up on Andrea's question, you know, the balance a year revenue guidance is, it's only about 3% to 4% of your midpoint, I guess if you add back the holiday program, it'd be more like mid-single-digits, but obviously, it's a pretty big slowdown from what we saw in fiscal Q1, as well as fiscal Q4, and even last year's full fiscal year during COVID. If you just think of the last couple of years, the amount of cost we're carrying between the 25% China tariffs, the transportation costs, we talked about FX turning against us, it's a pretty high level of costs and our ability to continue to deliver even in this year's guidance, 9% to 11% EBITDA growth. We're still in the exclusivity period with Ulta, and so, I think the focus for them was really making the most of Keys Soulcare in Ulta, but in the future, I'm quite hopeful that that becomes another area of opportunity, but you'll continue to see us expand the presence of Keys Soulcare, not only globally, but also eventually in the U.S.\n Great, thank you."
