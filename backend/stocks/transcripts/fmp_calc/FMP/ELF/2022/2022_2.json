    "content": " Q2 net sales of $92 million were up 27% versus year ago, marking our 11th consecutive quarter of net sales growth. We delivered Q2 net sales of $92 million, up 27% versus prior year, driven by broad-based strength in our national and international retailers. Q2 adjusted EBITDA was $18 million, up 29% versus last year, and adjusted EBITDA margin was approximately 20% of net sales. What I feel great about is that even with that amount of headwind, we're still delivering adjusted EBITDA up 9% to 11% expecting to deliver adjusted EBITDA of 9% to 11% for this year. If not, I guess I'd like to better understand why I assume that the growth momentum slows so materially in the second half of the fiscal year if you're seeing anything on the horizon, that that does give you pause, or it has become more challenging to get product from point A to point B."
