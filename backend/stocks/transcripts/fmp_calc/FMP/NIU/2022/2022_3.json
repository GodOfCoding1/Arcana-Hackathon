    "content": " Total sales volume, including China and overseas market for the third quarter was 321,000 units decreased by 19% compared to the same period of last year, as our overseas business continued to gain traction. And those premium models together accounted for 85% of the total sales volume in China market compared to 59% in the same period of 2021. International markets continued to see high-speed growth, thanks to kick-scooter sales ramp up. To break down the revenue by ranging, the e-scooter revenue from China market was RMB 859 million, decreased by 20%, and the ASP in China market reached to RMB 3,265, 19% higher on a year-over-year basis as product mix was more concentrated on premium autos as mentioned ahead. Out of the year-over-year 2.1 ppt increase, 2.5 ppt was due to better product mix in the China market, 1 ppt due to the increase in U.S. dollar exchange rate and minus 1.4 ppt due to the higher proportion of kick-scooter sales with lower gross margin. Total selling and marketing expenses were RMB 170 million  RMB 81 million higher year-over-year, including around RMB 54 million in marketing and promotions for kick-scooters and domestic new products and the rest is RMB 27 million in depreciation and amortization expenses of the new stores and stock-related costs. In light of the volatile domestic market and our strategy focused on the premium market, we expect the fourth quarter revenue to be in the range of RMB 789 million to RMB 986 million, no change to a decrease of 20% year-over-year."
