    "content": " Our revenue for the quarter was $41 million, a decrease of 3% year-over-year, and an increase of 6% quarter-over-quarter, bringing us back on the growth track after regulatory change in the K-12 acquisition sector in China. Total revenues were $41 million in the second quarter of 2022, a decrease of 3.2% year-over-year, and an increase of 6.2% quarter-over-quarter. In particular, revenues from US and in international markets grew 63.2% year-over-year and 13.4% quarter-over-quarter to $18.6 million in Q2, representing 45.4% of our total revenues. Non-GAAP R&D expenses were $27 million in Q2, up 30% year-over-year, as we continue to hire talented employees and strengthen our R&D team. Non-GAAP sales and marketing expenses were $10.9 million in Q2, up 16.8% year-over-year, mainly attributable to teams expansion and increased advertising and event expenses, as we continue to step up our go-to-market efforts globally. Non-GAAP G&A expenses were $7 million in Q2, up 23.1% year-over-year, mainly due to team expansion and expected credit loss provisions. Net cash outflow in the quarter was mainly due to free cash flow of negative $24.2 million deposit paid for land use right purchase of $34.2 million, cash paid for long-term investment of $4.2 million and share repurchase of $12.2 million."
