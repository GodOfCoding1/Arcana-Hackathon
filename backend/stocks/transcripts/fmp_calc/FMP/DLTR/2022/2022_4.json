    "content": " This year\u00e2\u0080\u0099s investments, which include the full year impact of investments made during fiscal 2022 are in several key areas in the following order of magnitude, labor and wages, including hourly wage rates and investments in field personnel, stores, through repairs and maintenance and improving store conditions, corporate, including technology and other initiatives. Inventory increased 24.8% and primarily from unit growth associated with early receipts of spring 2023 merchandise, Family Dollar combo expansion and new store unit growth and cost growth from product inflation, including freight, the expansion of the $1.25 and multi-price plus inventory. Second, we are cycling the outsized margin benefit for Dollar Tree\u00e2\u0080\u0099s initial transition to the $1.25 price point where last year, it produced a 39% margin rate in the first half of 2022 as we evolved our assortments to the new price point. Four, our outlook includes approximately $430 million or $1.45 per share in operating expenses across labor and wages, store repairs and maintenance and corporate as we accelerate our investments to transform this company. So, could you give at least a framework on what you expect the return on these investments to how you expect them to flow in terms of timing and the nature of how the return on investment is going to look, if it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just sales leverage, on the fixed cost, it may take quite a bit of time for the enterprise to get back to the operating margin level that it achieved historically."
