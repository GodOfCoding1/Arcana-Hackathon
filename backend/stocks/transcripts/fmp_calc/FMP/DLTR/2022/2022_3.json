    "content": " The Dollar Tree segment gross margin improved 520 basis points, primarily from higher initial mark on related to the move to $25 price point, lower freight costs and sales leverage, partially offset by greater penetration of lower margin consumable merchandise and product cost inflation. The line is open now. Once we move to the $1.25 throughout this year, our merchant teams have worked hard at bringing in that new assortment and we have absolutely changed that trend instead of declining business in consumables, it's now accelerating and leading the growth and I believe over time that will continue to drive traffic into our stores on Dollar Tree. On the $3 and $5 we're seeing a great response from our customer, especially on the seasonal side of the product, and that's where we think we can continue to refine and grow that business. The line is open now. And then on the Dollar Tree side just as I've shared, I like what I've seen in the last two quarters where one is up 9.5%, the other one is 8%, that's a great balance. And I think as we continue to provide that value on the consumables side, I think over time, we like when both are 50-50, 50% sale of discretionary, 50% consumables, and then as they grow over time, I think like Dollar Tree historically has always grown low single-digit comps with a combination of traffic and units in the basket. The line is open now. The line is open now. The line is open now. We're doing a number of things to continue to provide value to the customer and maintain that margin rate as best we can, recognizing right now that we're still under some level of product cost pressures, as well as from a freight component, but still being able to deliver, as you said, high -- mid-30s types of margin rates. The line is open now. The line is open now. The line is open now. The line is open now."
