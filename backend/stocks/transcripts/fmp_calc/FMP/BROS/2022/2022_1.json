    "content": " In the first quarter, we opened 34 new shops, 26% more total shops than a year ago and we entered 11 new markets. Our decision to be disciplined on the price we took, which we believe is less than half as much as many of our peers, faster inflation and cost of goods, especially in dairy, the pull-forward of deferred expenses related to the maintenance of shops and normal new store inefficiency amplified by the volume of new and ramping units in quarter one. Notably trends were stronger in the first half of the quarter before tempering in mid-March, which we believe were primarily driven by macroeconomic headwinds related to decrease in consumer discretionary income such as rapidly rising gas prices and the discontinuation of federal COVID stimulus checks and also greater sales transfer as more new shops in existing markets opened. Adjusted EBITDA is now estimated to be at least $90 million, reflecting near term margin pressure in our company-operated shops and our decision to take modest price increases during the year.

I know it's always hard to figure out causality (ph) when you have a big shift in your sales, like you had, but I guess I'm wondering are you seeing signs of the consumer trying to manage their check, which would kind of back up the idea that it's may be related to higher gas prices, and I ask because obviously, you have a suburban footprint and I'm wondering if the elevated return to work might also be an impact on your business more broadly.
