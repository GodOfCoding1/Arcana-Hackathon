    "content": " All statements made on this call today, other than statements of historical fact, are forward-looking statements, and include statements regarding our projected financial results, including net sales, gross profit, gross margin, adjusted gross profit, adjusted gross margin, and adjusted EBITDA, as well as our ability to increase our net sales from existing customers and acquire new customers, introduce new products, compete successfully in our industry, implement our growth strategy, and effectively expand our manufacturing and production capacity. Net sales increased 124% to $37.6 million, compared to $16.8 million in the first quarter last year. Sales growth in the first quarter was primarily due to strong growth in our core products, entrees and breakfasts, driven by strong growth in the club channel, greater demand from our existing retail customers, and new customers. Our first quarter gross profit was $4.2 million, reflecting a gross margin of 11.3% of net sales compared to gross profit of $4 million or a gross margin of 23.9% of net sales in the first quarter last year. Adjusted gross profit during the quarter was $6.5 million, reflecting adjusted gross margin of 17.2% of net sales, compared to $4.8 million or 28.4% of net sales in the first quarter last year. Adjusted gross margin of 17.2%, was generally in line with 4Q \u201821, as well as our expectations and guidance for the quarter, and reflects significantly higher labor and direct material costs, only partially offset by pricing and productivity measures."
