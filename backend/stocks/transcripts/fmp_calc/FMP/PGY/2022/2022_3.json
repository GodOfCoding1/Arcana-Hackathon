    "content": " This continues our track record of delivering topline growth every quarter since inception, reflecting ongoing expansion of existing partnerships and accelerated growth in our newer product, particularly credit card and auto. Today, our network sells 25 plus partners across more than 50 channels in five different products; personal loan, auto, credit card, point-of-sale and real estate. This quarter, we grew network volume by 26% and revenue from fees by 45% over the third quarter of 2021, primarily due to continued expansion of existing partnerships and faster growth in our newer products, particularly auto and credit card. Production costs rose from 5.4% of network volume in the third quarter of 2021 to 6.7% in the third quarter of 2022, primarily due to newer partner programs and growth in our newer products, particularly auto as we expand our dealership footprint through our partners. The other thing that you're finding is, we have a number of strategic capital partners and so in the real-time market that is really playing out favorably for us in the sense that across sovereign wealth funds, pension funds and large asset managers, we've built that track record where those investors know what they're getting and they've continued to participate. And so just think about that lead time as you think about the growth in our bank strategy as we begin to onboard more partners that fuels really the next leg up of our network volume growth as we move up from the $7 billion plus range that we have for this year into the coming 2023, 2024."
