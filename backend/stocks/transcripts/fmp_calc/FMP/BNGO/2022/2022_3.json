    "content": " Evidence for these views has been published 4 peer-reviewed studies in the third quarter from researchers at sites, including MD Anderson Cancer Center, Avesta University as well as a multisite study in Europe, all validated optical genome mapping ability to not only see what traditional methods see, but find additional pathogenic variants in MDS, acute myeloid leukemia, chronic lymphocytic leukemia as well as myeloid malignancies, suggesting that the identification of these previously undetected variants may impact prognosis and offer improved insight into the genomic architecture of heme malignancies and tumors in a way that would provide for better classification, risk stratification and therapy selection."
