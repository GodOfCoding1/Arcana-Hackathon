    "content": " It describes a study that was conducted by leading oncologists and gene pathologist in which they used Optical Genome Mapping and Next Generation Sequencing or NGS to determine the complete array of single nucleotide variants and structural variants for 101 subjects, that had been diagnosed with Myelodysplastic Syndrome or MDS, which is a hematologic malignancy that affects bones, blood cell production. This research demonstrates that, among the modalities tested Optical Genome Mapping and next generation sequencing taken together, provide the most comprehensive set of genome variants for MDS analysis in this study, and therefore suggest the potential for a new standard inside genetic and molecular analysis for malignancies altogether. The Optical Genome Mapping story is continuing to build, showing that not only can OGM be a powerful tool for identifying structural variants, but then when combined with next generation sequencing, the two methods have the potential to address a number of challenges that cytogenetic and molecular pathology labs have been facing from decades. Secondly, they are looking to see more peer reviewed publications on Optical Genome Mapping, which is why we are so excited about publications, like the one I talked about coming from MD Anderson and specifically they are looking for more publications that are coming from U.S. sites as well as additional adoption of Optical Genome Mapping. In addition to working on integrating Optical Genome Mapping within NxClinical, the software itself is a very powerful platform that can be used in a broad array of genomic applications, even if it doesn't involve Optical Genome Mapping, such as applications with microarrays or next generation sequencing."
