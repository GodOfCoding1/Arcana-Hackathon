    "content": " In a slowing or accelerating economy, we typically see the revenue impact first in this business due to the short duration of job assignments combined with the fact that many customers rely on PeopleReady as a variable supplement to their core workforce. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. And then you've got with the PeopleReady dynamic right now with the revenue in decline, our PeopleManagement business is taking up a larger proportion of the sales mix and that lower margin business is having a negative impact on gross margin of about 30 basis points to 40 basis points. Your line is now open. So when it comes to the differences between large customers and small customers, what we're seeing with our larger customers on our PeopleManagement business, our PeopleScout business, is more -- it's less about movements in their use of our services that's been holding pretty steady where we've been seeing more hesitation as new deals. Your line is now open."
