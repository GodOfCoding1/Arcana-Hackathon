    "year": 2022,
    "date": "2023-02-21 21:28:02",
    "content": " We have also added new content and IP to our existing functionally focused executive advisory programs, improvements in our existing programs along with new market intelligence programs, the launch of our new member, Hackett Connect, along with our aggressive sales hiring, should allow us to continue to grow our higher margin recurring revenues and related annual contract value during 2023. Revenues before reimbursements for our Oracle Solutions segment were $16.7 million, a decrease of 12% when compared to the same period in the prior year, as we continued to experience extended client decision-making during the quarter. Total company adjusted cost of sales, which exclude reimbursable expenses and non-cash stock-based compensation expense totaled $37.8 million or 54.9% of revenues before reimbursements in the fourth quarter of 2022 as compared to $40.8 million or 58.5% of revenues before reimbursements in the prior year. Total company adjusted gross margin on revenues before reimbursements, which excludes reimbursable expenses and non-cash stock-based compensation expense was 45.1% in the fourth quarter of 2022 as compared to 41.5% in a prior year period. Adjusted net income, which excludes non-cash stock-based compensation expense and intangible amortization for the fourth quarter of 2022 totaled $11.5 million or adjusted diluted net income per share of $0.36, which is above the high end of our earnings guidance range. Before I move to guides for the first quarter, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d like to remind everyone of the seasonality of our business relative to costs as we move sequentially from Q4 to Q1, specifically consistent with the first quarter guidance provided in previous years, our first quarter guidance for 2023 will reflect the sequential increase in U.S. payroll related taxes and the sequential buildup of our vacation accruals."
