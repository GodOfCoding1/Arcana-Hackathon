    "content": " At vanadium prices of $9 per pound for the May to December '22 time frame, we anticipate exiting the year with cash of approximately $104 million and that represents free cash flows of $20 million for fiscal 2022. At vanadium prices of $12 per pound for the same period, we would anticipate exiting the year with cash of approximately $325 million, and that represents free cash flows of $41 million for 2022. It seems okay to us that excluding even the, going back to our discussions around the EBITDA for the titanium business, but just for the vanadium business alone on a standalone basis, we think a very reasonable valuation would be probably in excess of $20 just for that business one -- per share. The second consideration is you put your five-year budget to a different discount model with reasonable assumptions in the space set of value of X. I've got to believe if there's a $4 million EBITDA number out now future in the next three years, the stock is very cheap so that test probably would be in favor to repurchase."
