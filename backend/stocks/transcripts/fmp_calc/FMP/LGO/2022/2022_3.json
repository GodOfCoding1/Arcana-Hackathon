    "content": " In Q3, we generated approximately $54 million in revenues from sales of 2,796 tonnes of V2O5 equivalent or $8.80 per pound. Revenues from Q3 2022 were largely in line with revenues of $53.9 million in Q3 2021, while revenues per pound sold decreased approximately 3% year-over-year. Operating costs increased 42% to approximately $46 million in Q3 2022, largely driven by increases in direct mine and production costs and product acquisition costs. With lower sales of our produced material, cash operating costs, excluding royalties, were $4.86 per pound in Q3 2022 compared with $3.53 for Q3 2021. Looking ahead, if we consider a vanadium price of $8 per pound, our sales and cost guidance, no LPV purchases of vanadium assets Brazilian to U.S. dollar exchange rate that averages approximately 5:1 as well as the latest debt facilities, we estimate exiting the year with a cash balance of approximately $75 million to $80 million. Vanadium prices also softened this quarter compared to the same period last year, with the average benchmark price per pound of V205 in Europe being $8.23 in Q3 as compared to $9.40 in Q3 2021."
