    "content": " The agenda for our call this morning is as follows: Paulo will provide an update on the company's second quarter progress; followed by Ernest, who will provide an overview of Largo's Q2 financial results; Paulo will close the call with an update on the company's sales and trading progress and on the vanadium market. It  equivalent production guidance is now 11,000 to 12,000 tonnes, down from 11,600 to 12,400 tonnes and cash operating costs, excluding guidance has increased to $4.10 to $4.50 per ton sold from $3.90 to $4.30. As previously announced in October last year, LTE was selected to receive $4.2 million in funding from the Department of Energy to scale up US based manufacturing of flow batteries and low duration energy storage system. As a result of stronger vanadium prices, we generated approximately $84 million in revenues from sales of 3,291 tonnes of V205 equivalents in Q2 or $11.69 per pound sold. Paulo briefly touched on this earlier, but we've also adjusted a portion of our 2022 CapEx guidance, including the lowering of the Ilmenite Concentration Plant CapEx to $19 million to $21 million, and that's from $29 million to $30 million previously, and the company's TiO2 processing plant CapEx from $2 million to $3 million that's from $9 million to $10 million previously. You revised the Ilmenite Concentration Plant downward to $19 million to $21 million, so down  10 million bucks, but I mean that's just delays in  timing."
