    "content": " Trade's first quarter of 2022 results lagged a strong '21 first quarter, but enabled us to accumulate grain ownership positions at good values. I think if we had to characterize what proportion is non-cash gains, I would say it's actually a pretty small amount, I would put it probably in the range of $5 million to $10 million because a lot of what we saw even as we talked about in the Renewables segment, is the reversal of previous noncash mark-to-market losses that have come through. So, we're kind of a little bit cautious about fourth quarter fertilizer I put that in the remained BC category to if we could match last year's really strong fourth quarter shipments of fertilizer, but we're still very positive coming off a great season. So Pat, the markets came back very nicely in the second quarter, a really nice basis appreciation, some reversals of MTMs, but I'm looking at your great inventories and it seems to me that your RMIs are still well over $1 billion and actually give you some really great visibility on your merchandising for your second half, maybe even into your first quarter of next year."
