    "content": " Both trade and renewables posted very solid improvements over last year, while plant nutrient results declined in their seasonally low quarter, our overall company performance was strong with trailing 12 months adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations totaling nearly $440 million. Renewables had EBITDA of $34 million in the third quarter of 2022, an increase of almost $15 million from the third quarter of last year. Don't expect to be able to match last year's outsize fourth quarter ethanol crush margins, but we'll continue to operate our plants efficiently and profitably as well as grow our third-party merchandising opportunities. But these recent ones in the case of Mote Farm Services, it's a Farm Service Center in our region, Indiana, Ohio, as well as Bridge Agri, which is in the pet food ingredients space that we really like these into what you'd call singles and doubles that are very attractive for our strategy and on point with where we're headed."
