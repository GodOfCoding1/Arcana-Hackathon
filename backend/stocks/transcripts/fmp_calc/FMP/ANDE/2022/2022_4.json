    "content": " Turning to slide 10, the Plant Nutrient business reported fourth quarter pretax income of $2 million, a decrease from the record of $16 million generated in tight fertilizer markets during the fourth quarter of 2021. And that's what's called a balanced mix, as Brian said, over the next couple of years, between our just growth that makes sense to our core businesses, as we're putting capital to strengthen our grain elevators and fertilizer plants and ethanol plants, as well as new geographies or new product lines for us. But we still feel this can be a good year, like I said back on the pace we said before we said $350 million, $375 million couple years ago, we thought that'd be a great number. But what people I think forget is that we're still going to generate, let's say, $120 of profit per acre, that's still mounds and steps above what average income is for us on the farm. Yes, I would say it continues with the balanced approach, I would say our first preference would be to invest in good solid growth projects and bolt-on acquisitions that will help us continue to make good progress toward that $475 million goal by \u00e2\u0080\u009825."
