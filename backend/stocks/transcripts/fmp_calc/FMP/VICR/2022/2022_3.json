    "quarter": 3,
    "year": 2022,
    "date": "2022-10-25 20:51:06",
    "content": " Except for historical information contained in this call, the matters discussed on this call, including statements regarding current and planned products, current and potential customers, potential market opportunities, expected events and announcements and our capacity expansion, as well as management's expectations for sales growth spending and profitability are forward-looking statements involving risks and uncertainties. As stated in today's press release, Vicor recorded total revenue for the third quarter of $103.1 million, approximately a 1% sequential increase from $102.2 million in the second quarter of 2022 and a 21.4% increase from the same quarter a year ago. And I'd like to suggest that, especially in this upcoming blackout period, I'll call it over the next four months before we talk again, that perhaps you schedule a meeting at the new facility like you did, probably 25 years ago when you brought in a lot of the area financial people to have a general discussion beyond what's just happens at the end of the quarter. During the quarter, there's just a lot of negativity, there's a lot of misunderstood information, one of your main competitors, that's been called just a production machine as far as efficiency and they're producing the lower end competition for you. What I said at the beginning and what the other guys said, and maybe it's not so much just talking to investors, but you guys get on the call every three months and you talk about your technology and I'm a big believer in the technology that it's better or I wouldn't be an investor in my fun."
