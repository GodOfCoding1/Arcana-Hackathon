    "content": " With a few current multiplier modules deployed laterally or preferably vertically, a Vicor power system can achieve higher density, lower noise, higher efficiency, and higher performance, and can be achieved with a multi-phased solution consisting of over 100 large, noisy, and heart components. As discussed in previous quarterly calls, the demand for high density power delivery solutions continues unabated across all of our target markets, with power systems engineers turning to Vicor's modular power solutions to solve their toughest design challenges. The other solutions which tend to be all grouped in the multi-phase bus converter and to be the bus architecture realm, they can be made to work, a lower current density's with modernized, with more challenges from an implementation perspective would grow in multiplicity of phases that there are there to make work reliably, and certainly customers and applications opt for those kinds of solutions if their requirements allow. With respect to getting variety parts that it being from time-to-time unavailable because of general supply train issues, we're very focused on that, I think I'm beginning to see, and I don't want to be too definitive with respect to this because it's still relatively preliminary, I'm beginning to see some easing and some increase availability coming online later this year."
