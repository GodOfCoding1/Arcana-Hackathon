    "content": " PagSeguro TPV reached BRL90.3 billion, growing 35% year-over-year and one more quarter outpacing by far the industry growth. PagSeguro's total revenue and income grew 49% year-over-year, reaching BRL3.7 billion, faster than TPV, thanks to the successful repricing process over the year that resulted in an increase of 24 basis points on PagSeguro's net take rate since Q1 \u00e2\u0080\u009822. On slide 11, we see how PagBank total revenue grew 31% year-over-year, ending the quarter at BRL339 million, stable versus Q2, mainly explained it by our focus on secured loans. Total payment volume reached BRL105 billion, growing 79% year-over-year, as Ricardo said higher than the acquiring TPV for the first time, reinforcing the increasing engagement of our customers on PagBank account, resulting on strong deposits growth and the use of other futures such as bill payments and marketplace. Net income non-GAAP achieved BRL411 million, and net income gap increased 18% year-over-year, reaching the highest level for third quarters in our history, totaling BRL380 million. Thank you very much. And then when we look at the fourth quarter, I know, we talked about net income and some of the same factors are going to obviously apply, but the total revenue and income growth, I think we got it at 23% to 26% for the fourth quarter, which is quite a bit below the run rate you guys have been doing this fiscal year. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you very much."
