    "content": " When we combine the full banking license and all the products that we have been rolling out, remember that the deposits that we are capturing here is a winning go-to-market strategy to keep attracting new clients with high AP wise \u2013 at the same time that we foster cheaper balancing accounts to help to diversify the cost of funding and the heat that we have been seeing in our profits in the short-term related to the interest rate hikes will not be as high as it was right now because in the next interest rate hike cycle, we do expect to have a larger deposit base which will be a natural hedge for the company to deliver much higher profits in the future since we have the full banking license and PagBank."
