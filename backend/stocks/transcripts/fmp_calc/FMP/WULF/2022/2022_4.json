    "content": " During what proved to be an increasingly volatile macro backdrop and a resultant turbulent market, TeraWulf successfully transitioned from development and construction to Bitcoin generation, by remaining steadfastly focused on achieving our goal of building a scalable, vertically integrated Bitcoin mining company that uses low-cost zero-carbon energy. At our jointly owned Nautilus facility in Pennsylvania, which sources 100% nuclear energy from the co-located 2.5 gigawatts Susquehanna nuke, we completed construction of two buildings and a lot of this facility is home to one of TeraWulf\u00e2\u0080\u0099s most valuable assets, 50 megawatts of mining capacity at a fixed power price of $0.02 per kilowatt hour for five years. Moving now to our GAAP operating results for calendar year 2022, TeraWulf generated revenue of $15 million mainly from Bitcoin mining operations, and we had a net loss before income tax and equity and net loss of investee of $70.5 million. These numbers do not recognize or reward WULF for one of the company's most valuable assets, the five year contract for 50 megawatts of $0.02 power at Nautilus, which had a recent mark-to-market value of approximately $40 million based on current power prices in the PJM West power market. Comparing these values and our anticipated annual EBITDA run rate at today's BTC prices, with our current market cap of approximately $200 million and $146 million of debt with approximately $13 million of cash as of March 30, 2023, we believe there is a significant disconnect in the valuation of our public equity versus our peers."
