    "content": " Our first quarter -- we saw strong demand across the commercial business and general aviation markets, led by meaningful order intake for our bearings, springs and seals contacts products. Our Engineered Products segment delivered outstanding results with year-over-year sales, adjusted EBITDA and margin growth in the first quarter, driven by our seals, springs and contacts products. Adjusted EBITDA in the first quarter was $12.2 million or a margin of 7.7%, compared to $23.6 million or a margin of 13.5% in the fourth quarter of 2021. Year-over-year results for this segment declined from an adjusted EBITDA of $14.1 million and margin of 23.3% in the first quarter of 2021, primarily due to lower K-MAX sales, unfavorable K-MAX blade exchanges and JPF sales mix. Year-over-year results declined from an adjusted EBITDA of $1.2 million and margin of 3%, mostly due to lower sales in our AH-1Z and composite blade programs. Our results for the first quarter were in line with our expectations with lower sales and margin for our K-MAX and JPF programs, partially offset with strong sales into medical and industrial end markets and improving aerospace demand."
