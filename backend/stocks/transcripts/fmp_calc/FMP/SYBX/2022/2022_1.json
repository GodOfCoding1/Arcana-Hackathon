    "content": " Given this, today's press release, updated time lines for our PKU program with Phase II data now expected in the second half of this year and Phase III initiation in the first half of 2023. Our interim Phase II proof-of-concept data last year showed a potential profile that is differentiated and well suited for the patients who need a new auction, a potentially efficacious, safe oral treatment that could be used as either monotherapy or as an adjunct to Kuvan or sapropterin. Based on that Phase I, we made the decision to add a second arm to our Phase II SYMPHONY-1 study to obtain data with SYNB 1934 in PKU patients. Meanwhile, at the same time, we announced our interim analysis of the Phase II SYMPHONY-1 study in patients with statistically significant and clinically meaningful reductions in plasma Phe for SYNB 1618. The remaining data from the Phase II study will indicate effects in PKU patients for the first time for both drug candidates and also provide data regarding use as both monotherapy and adjunctive treatment, an important step as we proceed to Phase III with the selected drug candidates. I think the intrinsic variability question you're getting to is around the PKU program and some - we saw some patients in the interim data set who had a really remarkable response in terms of Phe lowering and then other patients who had a less impressive response, so there was some variability there."
