    "content": " First, industry box office recovery; second, the impact of inflation as well as a potential recession on movie going; third, our ongoing Cinemark operating strategy this year, and finally, our near-term priorities to drive operating success and shareholder value going forward. Despite the largely fixed cost nature of our business model, year-to-date through the third quarter, with only 62% of 2019\u00e2\u0080\u0099s attendance, we generated $263 million of worldwide adjusted EBITDA with an adjusted EBITDA margin of 14.2% and we continue to expect to have positive free cash flow generation for the full year. Altogether, our Domestic segments total revenue was $511.7 million with adjusted EBITDA of $70.7 million and an adjusted EBITDA margin of 13.8%, still a healthy margin considering the reduction in quarterly attendance and therefore reduced operating leverage over our fixed-costs. As expected and discussed in our last earnings call, our free cash flow was negative $43 million for the quarter, given the dearth of content in August and September, the timing of our semi-annual interest payments and other working capital headwinds, including film rental payments made in Q3 related to June\u00e2\u0080\u0099s strong box office performance."
