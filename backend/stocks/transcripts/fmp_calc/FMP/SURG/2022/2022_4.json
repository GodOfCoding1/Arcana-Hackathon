    "content": " As previously discussed, due to us taking the foot off the gas to shift to buying devices direct, the fourth quarter clarifies that SurgePays generates a lot of cash when it doesn't have to expense customer acquisitions fully upfront, and much more of our revenue reached the bottom line with a net gain of $3 million. I have been providing prepaid telecom products to the underbanked community through convenience stores for 20 years, and I've never seen the response like what we're seeing in our beta testing for in-store ACP signups; not just from the customer's response inside of a store that sees a poster or sticker, but from the store owner's willingness to sign on with us, which gives us access to offer all of our FinTech and prepaid wireless products for the under bank through his store. So from a cash flow standpoint, we would hope you would start seeing a significant skew of our sales coming from the store because of the -- we're paying such a lower upfront cost for acquiring that customer because that store owner doesn't need the money to travel, pay hotels, pop up tents, and their livelihood is depending on that one commission. So it's a different dynamic and I feel it's a far better model for us to sustain long term and we're the only company, excuse me, we're the only ACP company that's able to do this through the stores because we're the only ACP company that owns a software platform that does FinTech transactions and convenience stores. Now we definitely know that there's millions of potential customers out there, and one of the things, without getting way off in the weeds, one of the things that I'm passionate about is using one of the -- using the ACP to get in the stores as we've talked about, but also keep in mind every one of these subscribers that we sign up is using talk text and data."
