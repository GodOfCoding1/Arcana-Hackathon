    "content": " More important to us given our focus on profitability, our operating income reached $220 million during the quarter, that's an increase of 116% over the prior year. So globally, to answer your question, I mean, us at TFI, we've got so much to do in improving our U.S. LTL network in the next year or 2 that even if there's -- because a lot of people are talking about this freight recession, but let me tell you that when I look at our results in April, we don't see a freight recession at all. 1,300 trucks that are dedicated, which is medium to long-term contract, which we've been working on, okay, because some of these contracts didn't make any sense, and that's why we were losing so much money with TForce freight which is the UPS Truckload division that we bought a year ago. It's slowly terminal by terminal, okay, looking at the footprint, looking at the ZIP code that you're servicing and trying to get more freight closer to your terminal versus running 75 miles away to deliver 2 skids of freight. But at the same time, okay, because Canada is reopening in Q4 and in Q1 and probably it's all complete in Q2 now, okay, is that we're getting more of our B2B because consumer, they like e-commerce, but now that they can go to the malls, some of our mall customers are getting busier."
