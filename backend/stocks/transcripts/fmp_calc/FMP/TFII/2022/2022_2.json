    "content": " For the second quarter of 2022, we reported 76% increase in our adjusted net income over the prior year and an 81% increase in our adjusted diluted EPS, along with more than $300 million in quarterly free cash flow for the first time in our company's history. It's important to note that in the year-ago quarter, we had a large bargain purchase price gain of $284 million, which impact the year-over-year comparison on a non-adjusted basis for our reported results, not only on a consolidated basis but for our LTL and Logistics segments, specifically. Our truckload operating income reached $127 million, more than doubling the prior year figure, and our operating margin was 22.9%, expanding nearly 10 points, driven by broad basis - based improvement in our specialized Canadian and U.S. truckload operation. Digging deeper within truckload, starting with our specialized business, which grew quarterly revenue before fuel surcharges are very healthy 18% over the past year to $273 million, as our improved diversity allowed us to benefit from strong strength in the industrial end markets. Our Canadian-based conventional truckload business generated a 43% jump in revenue before fuel surcharge to $88 million, along with an adjusted OR of 73.4%, once again, an improvement of well over 10 points compared to a year ago. Lastly, within our truckload, our U.S.-based conventional business had revenue before fuel surcharge reached $198 million, up 5% over the prior year. Because now specialty truckload is being, okay, we're the largest player by far in Canada, mostly on the eastern part of Canada on Torque Qu\u00c3\u00a9bec  and we're building also a quite solid specialty truckload in the U.S. under the leadership of Steve Brookshire and we reported a very improved OR there because don't forget, we made a lot of acquisition in that sector over the last 12 to 18 months, small tuck-ins here and there. Eric is now our leader in the dedicated networking with Steve's team in the U.S. And then just in the context of the earnings outlook, then I mean, is this kind of within a few points, the margin level you think with truckload going forward for the time being at least? But still, I don't see in the next, let's say, two quarters to - for the rest of the year, I don't see any pressure on the truckload U.S. truckload rates for us. But when you are a in Canada because if you compare the quality of revenue, okay, of a Canadian shipment same weight, same like the ball -- you compare that with the U.S. even better, to one of our peers in the U.S. that is running a 69 OR compared to the quality of revenue of a USD 69 OR with the quality of use you will say, wow, this is incredible because the Canadian market is such a market in terms of quality of revenue."
