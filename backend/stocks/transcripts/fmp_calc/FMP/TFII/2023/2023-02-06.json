    "content": " Now that's why I'm saying, if you look at our forecast part of our discussion in terms of guidance, we believe that we're going to get back on average, okay, in the latter part of the year, towards the 25,000 shipments, maybe 26,000 shipments, whereas right now, we sit at 23,000 shipments, okay. If you look at what we're doing in Canada, so let's say, on the Canadian LTL, our revenue is down, okay, but our OR is also down, right, because we're sharp. Hey, good afternoon, Alain. I think that with all the cars that we're going to be shedding, okay, will help us get closer to maybe a 87 in 2023, maybe an 88, all the admin cars that we have to get rid of because we have way too many cost right now because we're going to a transition agreement and all that. So now that we are running on TFI financial, now we are in a position to slowly implement that at the terminal level so that our guys could start managing the business the way it should be managed at the terminal, managing the cost and understanding what's going on, and understanding that your labor cost per shipment, your target is, let's say, $40, not $50, but $40, right. Hey, good afternoon, Alain. So I mean, you can't really \u00e2\u0080\u0093 when you have a customer that wants really a AAA kind of service, you can't take the risk of the rail because rail service is \u00e2\u0080\u0093 it seems okay, but even more so in the winter, there's always avalanche or things like that, or it's so cold that they have to reduce the speed."
