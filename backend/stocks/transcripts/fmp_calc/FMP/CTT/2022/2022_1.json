    "content": " We are now focused on owning prime timberlands entirely in leading U.S. South mill markets, where our delivered wood sales supplemented by opportunistic stumpage sales again generated superior pricing well above market averages and registering significant year-over-year increases. Taking into account first quarter results and by increasing sawtimber mix to meet market demand, we are now on track to register a full-year weighted average pricing increase of 15% to 20% for our blended harvest up from the previous expectations of 10% to 15%. The first quarter provides more evidence for how CatchMark simplified and more focused business strategies paying off and strong performance based on owning prime U.S. South timberlands, operating in the nation's leading mill markets, effectively using our delivered model supplemented by opportunistic stumpage sales and executing superior stewardship and managing our operations."
