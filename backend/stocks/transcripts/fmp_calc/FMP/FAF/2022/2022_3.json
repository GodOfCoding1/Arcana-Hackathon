    "content": " In our title segment, we delivered a pre-tax margin of 9.9% or 13%, excluding net investment losses Two key factors, along with our continued focus on expense management, favorably impacted our third quarter financial results. This quarter, investment income in our title segment increased to $105 million, up 114% compared to last year. ServiceMac, our mortgage sub-servicing business, is rapidly achieving scale, and we now expect ServiceMac will be profitable in the final quarter of the year, a significant improvement from the $11 million pre-tax losses booked in the second quarter. Three items contributed to our net investment losses this quarter: first, we incurred $126 million of unrealized losses related to our venture portfolio; second, we recognized $50 million of losses related to mark-to-market adjustments in our public equity portfolio. Investment income within the Title Insurance and Services segment was $105 million, a 114% increase relative to the prior year. Last quarter, we discussed three initiatives; ServiceMac, Endpoint and instant decisioning for purchase transactions, which together generated a pretax loss of $16 million this quarter, impacting our pretax title margin by 100 basis points. Turning to the Specialty Insurance segment, total revenue in our home warranty business totaled $105 million, down 3% compared with last year. Excluding net investment gains and losses, pre-tax income was $6 million, down from $9 million last year. Please proceed with your question. Please proceed with your question.
