    "content": " Investment income within the Title Insurance and Services segment was $53 million, a 23% increase relative to the prior year. On the last earnings call, we estimated based on current deposit balances that a 25 basis point increase in the federal funds rate would equate to a $15 million to $20 million increase to our annualized investment income in the Title segment. Based on the forward curve for the fed funds rate, we expect our investment income to grow by about $150 million on an annualized basis by the end of this year. Turning to the Specialty Insurance segment, operating revenue in our home warranty business totaled $104 million, up 5% compared with last year. As a result of recent acquisitions, we expect that our normalized effective tax rate will be 24.5% slightly higher than the 24% rate we've been using as a benchmark for the last several years since the larger portion of our pretax income is now coming from our non-insurance businesses and is subject to higher state income taxes. So our first quarter RSU expense was $12 million higher than last year, but that's an entry we do every first quarter is just higher this year. And one thing that we mentioned on the remarks that I'll just point out again, is that, as the fed raises rates, I mean, we're going to get $15 million to $20 million of annualized investment income. I mean, one thing that we feel good about is we did the debt deal last year, where we raised $650 million at 2.9% rate."
