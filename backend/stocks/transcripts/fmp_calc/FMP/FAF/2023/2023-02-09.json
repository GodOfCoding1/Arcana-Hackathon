    "content": " Due in part to these early expense management efforts, the benefit of growth in net investment income and a record-setting year in our commercial business, First American achieved a full year title segment pretax margin of 10%, or nearly 12% excluding net investment losses on total revenue, that declined 9% to $7.5 billion. In the quarter, we generated revenue of $1.7 billion and earnings per diluted share of $0.52 or $1.35 per share, excluding net investment losses. The Commercial revenue was $251 million, a 34% decline over last year. Investment income within the Title Insurance and Services segment was $132 million, a 169% increase relative to the prior year. Excluding acquisitions, our success ratio was 46%, meaning that our personnel and other operating expenses declined $232 million and our net operating revenue declined $503 million. Last quarter, we discussed three initiatives: ServiceMac, Endpoint and instant decisioning for purchase transactions, which together generated a pre-tax loss of $21 million this quarter, impacting our pre-tax title margin by 150 basis points. Total revenue in our home warranty business totaled $108 million, up 4% compared with last year. Excluding net investment gains and losses, pre-tax income was $21 million, up from $15 million last year. Excluding the impact of our net investment losses, our tax rate would have been 18.0%, less than our normalized tax rate of 24%, due primarily to a shift in the mix of earnings to insurance businesses, which generally premium tax and real estate income tax."
