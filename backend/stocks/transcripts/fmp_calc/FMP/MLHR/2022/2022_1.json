    "content": " As MillerKnoll we will be reporting results under four business segments; Global Retail, which reflects the legacy North America Retail segment, and now includes our International Retail business; Americas Contract, which reflects the legacy North America Contract segments combined with Latin America and the Design Within Reach Contract business; International Contract, which reflects contract business outside the Americas; and Knoll, as the acquired Knoll business will initially be reflected as a standalone segment. So here's what I would tell you is, I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we -- on the legacy Herman MillerKnoll -- Herman Miller side of the business implemented a price increase back in June. So if you look at the legacy Herman Miller side of the business, for the full quarter, order growth was on the order of 36% consolidated year-on-year with just the Herman Miller components across the three legacy segments. And also remember, we're going into this quarter with a really strong backlog and I would say material availability that\u2019s really more of a constrained than labor and we are starting to see -- and I'm not going to say like our labor challenges are not there, because they can go down macroeconomically."
