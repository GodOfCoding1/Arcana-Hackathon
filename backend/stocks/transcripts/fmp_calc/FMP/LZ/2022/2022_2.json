    "content": " As a reminder, we will be making forward-looking statements on today's call. These forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of words such as believe, expect, plan, anticipate, will, intend and similar expressions and are not and should not be relied upon as a guarantee of future performance or results. As we look ahead to a different macro environment, it's a clear reminder that products win markets, and our product is needed more now than ever before. In today's call, I'll outline how we are sharpening our focus, along with clear actions to adjust to a different environment. I want to be clear in today's earnings call that while the comparables caused by lapping COVID are difficult, I don't place blame on the macro for our performance,. Today I'll spend a bit more time talking about how we are adjusting to the current environment in the short-term, while also reiterating our opportunity in the long-term. Q2 revenue came in at $164 million, up 9% year-over-year, transaction revenue was down 9% in the period, while subscription revenue offset this weakness growing 32%. Our business formation declined 16% in the second quarter, while the U.S. Census Information Data was down 12%. During the quarter, we adjusted our marketing strategy, reverting to a more conservative lower funnel focused approach given the external environment. In post-tax season, we brought staffing levels down and going forward we're adjusting our mix of experts to a more variable cost structure that will align with demand. Given our confidence in the business, we are and intend to remain active in the back half of the year. During the quarter, we continue to make progress against our three growth factors; scaling the core business, building an SMB ecosystem, and integrating experts into the core experience. Although optimizing a new lineup will take some time, early results are promising, showing an increase in conversion rates, formation growth, and share gains. We're also seeing the mix shift in favor of subscription revenue, aligned with our long-term strategy of reducing both the upfront cost to form a business and our dependence on a transactional business model. myLZ is a newly created experience that will become the hub of SMB compliance, driving engagement and therefore retention, while also creating a channel to introduce new services when SMB's need them after an outside of the formation channel. In the second quarter, 98% of new formations customers created a myLZ account, up from 28% a year ago. And soon our customers will see a personalized site directly from their myLZ account without any effort leveraging the data, they provide information. We exited the second quarter with over 22,000 paying subscribers generating over $35 million of annualized recurring revenue. Having fully launched 12 months ago to our LLC base, there's a clear synergy between our core legal services and tax. We had just over 900,000 subscribers, we now have close to 1.4 million with subscription revenue 80% higher than it was in Q2 2019. Part of that is due to the launch of LZ Tax and the acquisition of Earth Class Mail, further building our ecosystem of services and incrementally reducing our dependence on the formation macro. While we continue to drive improvements in mix, roughly 60% of our total revenue is still a result of transaction volume and the news subscriptions attached to a formation. While we made progress, detaching our performance from the macro, we haven't made enough and our back half 2022 guidance will illustrate that. Additionally, as the economy contracts, we anticipate SMBs will spend less and scrutinize existing spend more, which affects are attaching renewal opportunities, particularly for our registered agents and compliance products. Given these adjustments, we are reducing full year revenue guidance by seven points from a midpoint of $655 million or 14% year-over-year growth to the midpoint of $614 million or 7% growth. As I mentioned, we are reducing CAM, we're limiting hiring to only the most critical roles, primarily in products, eliminating discretionary spend, and accelerating our platform investments that drive durable efficiencies. Despite our topline revision, we are increasing our full year adjusted EBITDA guidance to $55 million or 9% of revenue. For the rest of the year, our focus will be on product-driven share gains, more efficient growth with reduction in expenses, and lowering CAM, primarily in brands spend, allowing us to err on the side of being nimble and responsive to this environment. Given these changes, in 2023, we expect to grow share by 15% as a result of the new lineup, while also delivering an adjusted EBITDA margin of 15% as we begin to rely more on a product-led strategy to drive growth. We've seen the fear of the unknown due to COVID unlock into strong formations growth, small business innovation, and industry and sector rotations that continue to evolve with our understanding of and policies related to COVID. We've seen SMBs transform their businesses, filling in critical gaps in the economy, all while changing how they work. We're evolving our business model, innovating in new adjacent spaces, and doing it with a team that is adjusting how we work to evolve with the environment we're operating within. Total GAAP revenue in the period came in at $164 million, up 9% year-over-year at the top end of our guidance range. We completed 113,000 business formations in Q2, down 16% compared to the same period last year. Average order value came in at 296 in the second quarter, up sequentially from the first quarter and in line with typical seasonal patterns in the business. Going forward, we expect AOV to decline year-over-year in the second half, primarily driven by the phased rollout of our premium offering. As we've discussed, we expect introduction of truth yields to drive significant volume and share growth without cost of French transaction revenue. Subscription revenue continue to perform nicely in the second quarter coming in at $91 million, up 32% year-over-year. The primary driver is the impact of the slowing macro environment on our formation volumes, which in turn reduces the number of gross additions, particularly within our Registered Agent and compliance-related subscription offerings. We're also beginning to see pressure in our retention rates for these core products, which we believe as a result of increasing spend sensitivity among our SMB customers. ARPU was $252 in the second quarter, up 10% year-over-year. Gross margin came in at approximately 67% of revenue in the second quarter, down from 68% in Q2 of last year. Sales and marketing costs was $68 million in the second quarter, or 41% of revenue, up from 39% in Q2 of last year. Customer acquisition spend came in at $45 million, up 2% year-over-year, incurred approximately $6 million of accretive production costs in the periods that we do not expect to incur in the second half of the year. As Dan mentioned, efficiencies  were below expectations, largely due to inter-quarter stress and our spend allocation. We plan to reduce our media spend in the back half of the year, and pivot to lower funnel direct response channels, which we believe provides the greatest degree of flexibility to help us navigate uncertain operating environment. Technology and development spend were $11 million and general and administrative spend was $13 million, both kicked out in the second quarter on an absolute dollar basis. We're also limiting new hire activity to only the most critical roles, which we expect will largely fall in on the tech and dev lightning. Adjusted EBITDA was ahead of the top of our guidance range at $17 million for the quarter, compared to $22 million in the second quarter of 2021. In the second quarter, we continue to execute on our 150 million share repurchase authorization. As Dan hit on the key drivers of our revised guidance earlier in the call, I'll focus my comments down on the specifics of our guide to the third quarter and full year 2022. The third quarter of 2022, we expect total revenue of $149 million to $151 million, or 1% year-over-year growth at the midpoint. We expect subscription revenue growth to decelerate in Q3 driven by multiple quarters of declining formation volume, pressure and outdoor retention rates, and a slight impacts from LZ Tax seasonality. We expect adjusted EBITDA of $16 million to $18 million, or 11% of revenue at the midpoint. As Dan mentioned, we are pulling non-committed grand spend in the third quarter to allow for greater flexibility. We expect customer acquisition spends a declining review in the third quarter, but we'll continue to respond dynamically based on market conditions. For the full year 2022, we expect total revenue of $612 million to $616 million, or 7% growth at the midpoint. We expect adjusted EBITDA up $55 million, or 9% of revenue at the midpoint. As Dan mentioned, we expect to grow share by 15%, while also delivering an adjusted EBITDA margin of 15%. And with that, let's open the call for questions. Your line is open. Yes, on the first point, yes, there's two big goals we've put out for 2023. One is to demonstrate margin of 15%, which is just, it's the thing we can control, which is costs and ensuring that we're driving efficiencies as we scale this business. The share gain is an early reflection of what we see, when we innovate on our lineup, and we talked about this in the past, we've had a lineup that is a premium price, DIY solution. So, there's people who are seeking expertise -- legal expertise from an attorney, but they can't afford it and so we have a premium component to the lineup. So, early indication -- and again, we're we've been testing this and sequencing different variants in different states. We see customer growth, relative to the control, which is our existing lineup. We see a mix shift, going more aggressively towards a subscription model, versus today's transactional model. So, when you start to look at it, in some components of the test, like mobile, for instance, we see even a higher acceleration, which is giving us some indication of what we have to do to even see higher conversion rates than what we're seeing today. So, yes, it's a reflection of what we expect to see from a completely rebuilt lineup and a set of new offerings that are going to be in market next year. On the macro, that's a that's a question that I think is multi-layered. I mean, what we've done, as we go into this guide, is we've really been thoughtful about what we think is going to be happening in the back half. And there's different sets of data that we have, then maybe some of our peer group as well. And so we can see how businesses are not only forming, but we can also see failure rates. Dissolution from our data peaked at the end of last year, but you still have to work through that, because we have an annual subscription renewal process. And then I'd say the last piece as you think about how we're how we're considering our guidance, we are anticipating if we aren't already in one, that will be in a recession. And so that's just us being maybe a little bit conservative, but we want to see that completely stabilized before we turn the corner and have a little bit more of a bullish point of view about the macro. Just also note, and we've talked about being willing to trade off and the transaction revenue for the benefit of subscription. And this is an example where incremental customer growth, formations growth, there is a trade off with average order value, because we're offering a free SKU. And so it's really leveraging the benefit of the ecosystem that we've been building out in the subscription side to help drive long-term customer value, but at the trade-off of the upfront transactional revenue. Your line is open. Yes, on the macro, I mean, it may be slightly redundant with what I just answered, but we definitely saw the macro a little bit lighter than we had expected. We've also noted that there's month-to-month, there are anomalies in the reporting that we see from the census data. I think the thing that is probably, a little bit more of a unique data point that we see is we see the relationship between formations and dissolutions. And as I mentioned, dissolutions are a little bit of a foreshadowing for us around retention and renewal because we have some existing subscriptions that are annual subscribers and they're looking for compliance on their entity. We probably have a quarter or two, and we're starting to see some of that reversal already happening. And then separately, I think I mentioned it, we're just, we are a little bit conservative in how we're thinking about the back half of the year. And to Noel's point that he added on, some of our add-on subscriptions are very high ARPU. I mean, when we talk about our accounting subscription as an example, you're talking about $1,500 subscription. On the efficiency gains, that's something we've been working at diligently for a long time. That project has gone better than expected, and we continue to accelerate, not just the efficiency, but actually the customer experience because now orders are processed much faster than they used to be. But we also are recognizing that, there's areas where we can invest less and run a little bit leaner that are outside of that. And one additional point there is tax, which is we always mentioned in the first season, we were going to solve for the customer experience and not so much for efficiency. And Andrew, just to build on the marketing efficiencies question, we did experience some headwinds in efficiencies this quarter just as we -- historically, we've been shifting our spend more into our media mix modeling. In this quarter, just given the uncertainty, we actually started to shift back into performance channels, which did create some inefficiencies in the quarter. And we -- the reason we did that is just given the uncertain environment, we wanted more flexibility to be nimble and have performance-based marketing that can react quickly to changes in the macro and so we can respond dynamically. And actually thinking about what that means in the back half, it means really bringing down more of our brand spend very specifically. But as we have seen in media mix modeling before, actually, that was look like good returning spend, but media mix modeling is sort of looking back at history. And if you're heading into a new environment, we just want to be cautious in terms of that spend. One moment for our next question. Your line is open. I think in the prepared remarks, it was also cited that tax attrition was higher than expected. I mean, I think there's a couple of things that and I'll just replay it. We haven't talked about it before on the call, so it's probably worth unpacking. When the macro -- or when COVID hit, we actually saw formations accelerate in dissolutions almost go to 0% growth, which is really unique. As you got to the late stage of stimulus, they were both growing really fast, which is a little bit more of a healthy environment, but we also feel like propped up because of stimulus. As we got then to the end of last year, growth in formations was going down, but actually, the dissolutions was going up. And so that's kind of the worst environment, and that's what we're sort of building out of right now. We've talked about this, the 13-month retention rate has been going down, and it's been offset because of older cohorts, which are actually showing a better profile. The overall result actually was pretty much what we had expected, but we just got there a little bit differently. Because I believe even if we just took -- assumed no sequential subscription growth in the back half of the year, we would be decently ahead of 20% subscription revenue growth. I'm not sure we're going to break that out into the specifics, because there's a few drivers. But LZ Tax was a component of the drivers, just the fact that there is some revenue recognition timing that's tied to the timing of tax prep. But it's also a reflection of the slowing in our core business, what we talked to in our prepared remarks, is the slowing of business formations growth the last couple of quarters, and that flows into our kind of gross additions on our subscription side. One moment for our next question. Your line is open. It's really encouraging to see the focus on controlling costs, given the tougher environment. Just going back to that margin goal, the vast majority of it is really a combination of reductions through COGS and thinking about the efficiencies around it, also OpEx and reductions outside of tech. And a portion will also be non-media marketing spend, which I think -- that's an area where we can control it. And so when we think about the opportunity to drive more share, it's really completing the orders that are already going through our funnel by segmenting the offerings, so that it meets them exactly where they are. So if you're low cost, we want to get you started and into our ecosystem as easily as possible and will monetize them over time throughout their lifecycle. So I think, that's always been our plan is to sort of first couple of years is make sure we sort of develop the market. What I would say is, we definitely see lower tax rates, but we obviously see higher bookings, because we're driving significantly more conversion through it, when you're talking about subscriptions. And this, by the way, is without customizing any of the subscriptions to also reflect the fact that they're coming in as a free customer. Over time, you would start to think about how to use segments, your subscriptions. So you would have a lower end registered agent subscription, and you would have a premium registered agent subscription is really targeted off who's coming into the lineup. So there's -- the interesting thing here is, again, we're looking at a lot of early data, and we're encouraged. One moment for our next question. Your line is open. Yes, it's -- I think what's interesting is even starting in 2021 at the beginning of the year, given the fact that formations were starting to really take off. And actually, that's made our marketing spends a little bit tougher, right, because if you think about a lot of the e-commerce players, I mean, they were spending into this pretty aggressively. And a lot of what they were spending into was actually our keywords, because they market directly to businesses that are just forming. And then from a competitive standpoint, we haven't seen anybody do anything that we would say is terribly innovative, but they are competing on price, which is exactly why we're doing the freemium offering. I mean, we can be not only a little bit more aggressive, and also knowing that we're cash flow positive, and playing offense during a time like this and consolidating. And again that's why we're doing something like freemium, which may -- it may be a trade-off in the short-term to really drive lifetime value. And there are things that we're looking at to sort of think about how do we measure success, one is one year bookings, but one is also lifetime value. But also there are opportunities to accelerate our roadmap through talent acquisition, that I think are real opportunities, where it can both be something that we desire to integrate into our platform, but also just an awesome product team, because hiring over the last couple of years has been very difficult, specifically in tech. And we think in this environment, there's probably going to be heightened activity or opportunities on the M&A side. One moment for our next question. Your line is open. So on the subscription side, actually, it's been better than the expected growth for a while now. And they happen those -- as I mentioned before, they have been moving based off the growth rate information and that growth rate the dissolution. But I think that the disaggregation, that's maybe a little bit more helpful is there's our core subscriptions that are tied to entity compliance, and that's the registered agent and compliance subscription. And then there's the newer stuff, which is LZ tax and things like Earth Class Mail. Those two are untethered by the formations growth right now, because they're sort of in an early phase of being developed. And what that means is, we're seeing both the dissolution rate impact them, but also just flat acquisition. But there's a dynamic underneath it where the 13 month is impacted by dissolution, and the older cohorts are hardening better than we had expected. And that's in part due to the testing that we're doing on freemium -- with our freemium offering, and that free SKU obviously puts downward pressure on AOV. And then to the extent that LZ tax, and ECM, which are higher ARPU offerings, it continue to become a larger percentage of the mix, then that will continue to put -- provide some upward pressure on ARPU."
