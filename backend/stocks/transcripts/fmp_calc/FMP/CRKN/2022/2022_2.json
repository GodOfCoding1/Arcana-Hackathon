Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Crown\u2019s fiscal 2022 second quarter conference call. With us on today\u2019s call are Doug Croxall, Crown\u2019s Chief Executive Officer and Chairman; and Joel Krutz, Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that today\u2019s call contains certain forward-looking statements from our management made within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act with 1933 as amended and Section 21E of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 as amended. These statements are subject to numerous conditions, many of which are beyond the control of the company, including those set forth in the Risk Factor section of the company\u2019s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2021 filed with the SEC. I\u2019m going to start in get my report on the operational performance of the quarter, and then I\u2019m going to hand it over to Joel who\u2019s going to go through his report on our financial results. It\u2019s an affordable, solar powered insert, which does not require hard wiring and can be easily installed in the interior side of the existing window in commercial office. Crown\u2019s DynamicTint, which is our pigment based in film was initially developed by HP and is based on our proprietary and patent protected electro kinetic technology. Crown Smart Window Insert easily installs into a building\u2019s existing window frame, leaving the existing window intact. At this time, Crown\u2019s engaged with over two dozen REITs through an iterative customer discovery process. While previous technologies focused on smart glass market have been around for over two decades, these technologies have frankly fallen short of what the market demands and what the market can afford with legislative support and growing social awareness, building owners and tenants today are more aware of their surroundings and becoming more environmentally conscious in their decisions. Earlier this year, we launched our initial field test in May, June of the summer from the 22nd floor of the Los Angeles building, where our patented ink technology was partially rendered into a window insert and then placed over single pane windows. In August, we announced the preliminary results that suggest the Crown Smart Glass Insert can reduce the HVAC energy costs of buildings by approximately 26%. We\u2019ve continued to work closely with their executive, their ESG and their engineering teams to identify the most efficient and meaningful way, in which to migrate our DynamicTint technology into a product offering. With Hudson\u2019s lead, we are identifying two buildings in California to rollout our Smart Window Inserts with the potential third building in the Northwest. As you\u2019re also aware, we announced our first commercial agreement \u2013 MetroSpaces, a proptech-focused real estate holding company as our first customer. We\u2019ll install our Smart Window Inserts in their 70,000 square foot Houston office building. Since our last call, we\u2019ve made key new hires rapidly expanding our engineering, manufacturing, and marketing teams. And most notably, to help this growing team, we\u2019ve welcomed Mindy Hamlin as Vice President of Engineering. Looking ahead, we\u2019ll continue to add talent as part of our rollout for our commercialization strategy. Now, I\u2019ll pass the call on to Joel, who will review our financial results. Crown\u2019s net loss for the quarter ended September 30, 2021 was $5.7 million, which included $3.1 million of non-cash stock-based compensation expense. This facility would potentially provide Crown with access to additional financing for our operations, if required during the company\u2019s production ramp up phase for the next two years. And finally, to better align Crown\u2019s operational and financial calendars, we\u2019ll be changing our fiscal year end from March 31 to December 31 effective this year. This will mean, we close out the current fiscal for the nine months stub yet, and we\u2019ll begin our new fiscal year reporting from January 1, 2022. Now, we\u2019d like to open the call for questions. Please state your question. It doesn\u2019t sound exactly if the agreement is entirely formalized, but curious on that front, but two buildings to three buildings, what Hudson may be looking for and obviously they have 110 other buildings. And what we\u2019re trying to do is identify the first couple of buildings would make the most sense for us to rollout and for Hudson, a lot of their buildings are owned with other partners. And so one of those buildings that we\u2019re targeting, we want to get as much exposure as we can, not just the Hudson, but some of their other financial back. It\u2019s looking like, it\u2019ll be a building in the LA area, a building in the Bay Area, in a building in either Seattle or Vancouver. So, and it\u2019s not a trial, I mean, this is a real customer contract, where they\u2019re actually buying the product and we\u2019re building it and installing it. And there\u2019s a lot of decision-making that goes into, which buildings when you have 110. I suspect, I mean, in the press release, you highlight two buildings and then potentially third, but there\u2019s \u2013 it sounds as though there\u2019s also a discussion for additional buildings behind me as well. And then obviously, I know, you\u2019ve been speaking and meeting with a bunch of REITs and you mentioned it too doesn\u2019t REIT that you\u2019re in customer discovery process. And maybe could you provide some qualitative background as to, what you\u2019re discussing, what the feedback is, and this is obviously a customer funnel. And because this is our product kind of straddles operations, engineering, ESG, tenant relations, leasing, there\u2019s a lot of different parties that are interested in what we\u2019re doing within the REIT. So the first few meetings are literally explaining what a Smart Window Insert is, because one doesn\u2019t exist anywhere other than what we\u2019ve made. And so far, we\u2019ve been \u2013 I don\u2019t want to say bad in the film, but we\u2019ve not had any REIT say, we\u2019re not interested in moving forward. Most of what we hear is, when can we get a demo, when can we get a prototype sent to our facility and that\u2019s what we\u2019re quickly building and getting out to the market. So it\u2019s a bit of a process, but that process has been ongoing. And so we\u2019re kind of coming towards the end of the funnel, if you will. And final question as obvious, has to deal with manufacturing capacity sort of, that\u2019s obviously the next step in the process. How\u2019s that coming along and maybe address the buildup positioning and if you\u2019re having supply chain issues that you\u2019re hearing, like, acknowledge them across a lot of conference calls, if you\u2019re having any issues on that front as well. I know that a lot of companies are, we have not \u2013 doesn\u2019t mean that we won\u2019t in the future, but we have it. So if we do, that\u2019s obviously a risk that we would publish in our Q\u2019s and K\u2019s and let the market know. But so far, we haven\u2019t seen anything, where that does not mean that we won\u2019t. As a matter of fact, my office overlooks Santa Monica Bay, and every day, there\u2019s more and more cargo ships that are lining up on the horizon. So I know it\u2019s a problem, but it hasn\u2019t reached us yet. As far as manufacturing capabilities, we\u2019re able to make our own film right now. And we\u2019re also looking at how to expand and when to expand, so that we can meet what we think is a growing demand from our current and prospective customers. So it didn\u2019t cover the mulling, the mulling is the frame. And so we redesigned \u2013 and frankly, the gasket didn\u2019t look like it fit in the building. And so the second go around with the new framing design is more insulative, because it\u2019s covering the mulling and therefore protecting a lot of that heat from radiating into the office. And the perspective customers that we\u2019ve demonstrated the new framing system for, frankly, couldn\u2019t tell the difference, is matter of fact, many of them said, this looks exactly like it was a part of the building when the building was built, 30 years ago. So \u2013 and then as far as how that relates to their field test, Jeffrey, is that we\u2019re trying to get a number of days, where the weather \u2013 now matches the weather pattern that we used \u2013 that we experience, I should say, over the summer for the first field test. We have a pretty good dataset, but we want to have a pretty robust data set, because it\u2019s an important number. So we\u2019re going to \u2013 we\u2019re continuing to test, hopefully in another three or four weeks, we have enough meaningful data in our data set to draw that comparison. And the way I would categorize it is that they\u2019re very good assets for Crown to own, because there are some claims in the portfolio that cover areas of technology that we very well may see our product and technology move towards. So we want to have ownership in that area so that we can make use or sell a product without worrying about infringing, somebody else\u2019s patents. I\u2019ve been really quite impressed by Crown\u2019s comprehensive preparation for product rollout, such as, the proper packaging for transport that you should maybe when we did a virtual visit. Now I say that, in two hours, I\u2019ll get a phone call from Corvallis and they\u2019ll say, oh, there\u2019s something we don\u2019t know. And it\u2019s really just \u2013 right now, it\u2019s a process of getting the tools built, getting the lines assembled and getting the lines running. And frankly, when you look at the roster of employees that we have working on this, I\u2019m blown away by the quality and integrity of our workforce. Please state your question. So oftentimes, it\u2019s can we see the demo and I\u2019ve been little travel recently, but we\u2019re going to be back at it. And the nice thing about this insert, it\u2019s not the same as buying a window. If you\u2019re buying a window for a building, that means you\u2019re removing a window. It\u2019s a much more complicated and inconvenient process than a window insert where yes, I\u2019ll buy a 1,000 inserts and put them in a building and see how it goes. I mean if they don\u2019t like it, they can always remove it. And you can\u2019t \u2013 it\u2019s not like three years ago, we sat down and we decided, okay, when we get this technology working, let\u2019s productize it into an insert because at late 2021, there\u2019s going to be a lot of momentum for building owners to do something to reduce their carbon footprint. So the iterative process is really understanding where our inserts can get, which buildings need them, what\u2019s easy for us to deliver in order to satisfy the demand that we\u2019re seeing from some of the REITs. So we\u2019re in that \u2013 look, we\u2019re in a really unique place right now for five years, the core team of engineers have been at trying to develop this technology. It\u2019s an incredibly satisfying journey, and it\u2019s a really \u2013 it\u2019s an awesome place to be. So right now, it\u2019s just about getting out meeting with that we\u2019ve been talking to and starting getting them to sign purchase orders delivered. And then they look at their portfolio of buildings and say, let\u2019s start with this one or someone like Hudson a couple of trying to understand what \u2013 how do you think that they would roll out or with if you having success in Hudson, would people be more aggressive and say, okay, let\u2019s take bigger bites at the apple. And some are like we\u2019ll try with a couple of buildings and see how it goes for six months, and then maybe we\u2019ll expand. Also a good problem to have, but we\u2019re moving in that direction right now. So to answer your question, Shawn, it\u2019s a little bit of both. So the way that will do our installation and we\u2019ve done an installation already, we did it in our office in Los Angeles. It\u2019s not hard, but it is a manual process. So we\u2019ll likely have \u2013 we\u2019ll start off with pure Crown employees doing all the installation, because we want to understand the best, fastest, most efficient way to do it with the least amount of inconvenience to our customers. But over time, it\u2019ll likely look like a crew leader from Crown employees with a team of laborers that are probably locally sourced that are handling the installation in buildings. And so we\u2019re thinking through those problems and those processes right now, we think we have a pretty good plan for it. Please state your question. When we look at IT, we look at where the \u2013 what the IT claims to have invented, and we look to see if that\u2019s something that we need for our current product or potentially for our future plans. We also look to see if potentially it\u2019s a claim, a patented claim that could be used by a competitive technology out in the marketplace. So all of those factors kind of come to bear when we make a purchase decision and it\u2019s not so much led by the manufacturing process right now is the actual product or what the product might be or a product that\u2019s being used, sold, or manufactured by a competitor. And it doesn\u2019t mean we won\u2019t look for manufacturing process type intellectual property, we certainly will. And we\u2019ve actually designed shipping containers, not the containers that go on a semi truck, but our own containers that hold our inserts in a way that allows us if we have to store it in a building over long periods of time. We think that once the inserts arrived there\u2019ll be installed, because they\u2019re installed pretty easily on the inside of the office. At this time, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Mr. Doug Croxall, CEO and Chairman for closing remarks. Sometimes it felt like we\u2019d take three steps forward and 16 steps backward, but we\u2019re finally getting to that point where we can see all of the efforts that we put into this start to bear fruit. And I want to thank everyone who participated in that process, and I\u2019m really excited about what we have in store, not only for our shareholders and not only for our customers, but for the world moving ahead."
