Compared to 2021's $37.2 million net loss, this was $22.8 million lower, driven by stock-based compensation reducing $9.8 million and other income expenses down year-on-year by $15.8 million, which stemmed from the balance sheet restructure we effected in early 2021. Total operating expenses for the year ended 2022 were $15.1 million, which consisted of $2.4 million of non-cash stock-based comp, $7 million of payroll and related expense, $2.6 million in consulting and professional fees, and $3.1 million of operating overheads. For the year ended December 31, 2022, net cash decreased $5.3 million with the company deploying $11.1 million of cash for operations and $0.8 million to investments. As Doug mentioned, subsequent to December 31, there have been a number of Q1 liquidity events worth highlighting was notably Crown raising $7.1 million of fresh capital and securing $100 million line of credit, which will support the customer expansion in our new fiber optics business."
