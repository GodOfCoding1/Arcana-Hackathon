    "content": " We recently announced the results of our initial field test, which was conducted from our offices on the 22nd floor of a Los Angeles office building where Crown\u2019s patented EK Technology was rendered into window inserts and then placed over a single pane windows by blocking out a significant amount of the heat generated by sunlight the simulation data indicated that an office building could reduce the operating costs of an HVAC system. While other smart glass solutions might be able to reduce energy costs and carbon emissions for new buildings, Crown\u2019s Insert can do so at an affordable price for all buildings. One of the questions we ask all of our perspective customers, what is the payback period has to be to implement technologies like ours, and we\u2019re within, the target payback period and ROI, which is comforting for us to know frankly, and that\u2019s it at \u2013 had a percent that we think will we will, improve upon with new design and new materials in our next generation insert first."
