    "content": "  Good afternoon, and welcome to the Journey Medical's Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2022 Financial Results and Corporate Update Conference Call. Looking back on 2022, Journey reported record revenues for the fiscal year of $73.7 million, which is a 17% increase from the revenue reported for the prior year of $63.1 million. In addition to the macroeconomic challenges faced by our sector, which limited our growth throughout 2022, Targadox revenue for the year declined by $14.4 million when compared against the full year 2021, reflecting the continued impact of generic competition for the brand. Once approved and launched, we believe DFD-29 will be able to achieve net sales in excess of $100 million annually, which to put in context, would exceed Journeys' total revenue of $73.7 million in fiscal year 2022. Increase is mainly due to revenue growth from our newly acquired products, ACCUTANE and QBREXZA, which were acquired and launched in the first and second quarters of 2021, respectively, an incremental net revenue from AMZEEQ and ZILXI acquired in January 2022. Net loss to common shareholders was $10.6 million or $0.60 per share basic and diluted for the fourth quarter of 2022, compared to a net loss to common shareholders of $21.8 million or $1.64 per share basic and diluted for the fourth quarter of 2021. Our strategy with our product portfolio expansion was designed to pivot during the life cycle challenges like we have faced over this past year with Targadox, which declined in revenue by $14.4 million in 2022. Finally, we expect our SG&A expense for 2023 to be reduced by $5 million to $7 million, targeting a range between $52 million to $54 million for the full fiscal year."
