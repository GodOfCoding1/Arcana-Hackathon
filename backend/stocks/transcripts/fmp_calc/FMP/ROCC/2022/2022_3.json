    "content": " Since the fourth quarter of last year Ranger has more than doubled operating cash flow per share, reduced leverage by nearly 45% and increased production per debt adjusted share at a 20% compound annual growth rate. The $139 million in bolt-ons we've closed this year provide a solid runway, adding 2,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day of loaded climb production, along with 20,000 net acres in over 60 estimated gross high return drilling locations. So focusing first on the midpoint of our guidance for fourth quarter CapEx is $160 million, and about $30 million of that is associated with the addition of the third rig, and an incremental $25 million is associated with additional working interest that we've acquired here in the fourth quarter as well as some non-activity that's taking place with a large, high-quality operator just off our lease lines. I appreciate Slide 7, I think it illustrates the benefit of share repurchase very clearly, where we've seen operating cash flow increase on a per share basis despite the commodity actually going down the third quarter."
