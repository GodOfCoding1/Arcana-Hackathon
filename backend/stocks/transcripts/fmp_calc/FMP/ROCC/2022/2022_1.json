    "content": " This strategy was designed to provide flexibility to deliver results for our shareholders through multiple vehicles, including disciplined capital investments and a strong balance sheet, operational expertise that allows for a robust through the cycle returns, a solid framework for returning cash to our shareholders and timely acquisitions at the right valuation. 10:13 Relative to inflation, we felt like we're seeing a 20% to 25% increase year-over-year, but with our efficiencies that we've been able to implement, including things like drilling longer laterals and switching to six-inch pipe, which we'll do later this year, which will allow us to lengthen out our stage spacing and become more efficient in our completion design being able to pop higher rates and things of that nature. 13:20 Yes, I think that from a lower Eagle Ford perspective, that's a good synopsis of how we think of the acreage today, like we do with all the acreage just like with Lonestar, we bring it into the portfolio and we start tearing it apart technically. And our goal is to focus on the Eagle Ford and we intend to look at all those opportunities it -- relative to having 20 years of inventory, when we look at purchasing something just like these bolt-ons, we are able to buy them at a discount to PDP, PV-10. It's very accretive for our shareholders and we love transactions like that and we'll think there'll be -- we definitely think there'll be more opportunities similar going forward, both small ones like we're seeing here and large material ones and they just have to make sense relative to our inventory."
