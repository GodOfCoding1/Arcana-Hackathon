    "content": " Looking at the drivers of The North Face success over the past few years, we\u2019d point to 3 main strategic pillars: first, an elevated product focus with an emphasis on launching several proprietary technologies, such as FUTURELIGHT, Advanced Mountain Kit and VECTIV, which underpin our leadership position in the outdoors; second, our integrated marketplace strategy, which has enabled us to develop specific product and marketing programs for specific consumer groups and distribution channels; and third, an enhanced consumer engagement initiative based on knowing our consumer better and targeting specific points of brand engagement to ensure we\u2019re showing up in the way our most loyal brand followers expect and want us to."
