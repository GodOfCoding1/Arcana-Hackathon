    "content": " Rental revenue was $22 million for the quarter, up 16% versus the fourth quarter of 2021, driving an increase in gross margins of 820 basis points sequentially, due primarily to lower depreciation as a percentage of revenue. GAAP net income was $27 million in Q1 2022 versus $20 million during the fourth quarter of 2021, with the increase driven by higher operating income and a lower income tax expense. So the fact that we've been able to maintain a market share north of 40% given that privates account for well over 60% of the active rigs is, I think, supportive of our claim that we've done much better with privates today than we ever have before. First of all, you know that there's -- there'll never be a customer that comes up that says, Cactus, you can raise your price by X percent because your competitors just came in here and demanded a price increase of Y. I think that in general, our larger competitors are being more responsible in terms of cost recovery."
