    "content": " Rental revenues were $24 million for the quarter, up 6% versus the first quarter, driving an increase in gross margins of 280 basis points sequentially due to reduced equipment repair costs and lower depreciation as a percentage of revenue. And we have pretty good visibility for Q3 and Q4, is that we expect to gain market share with privates in the third quarter, and then we expect that to flip towards our large publicly traded customers in the fourth quarter and into the first quarter of next year. I mean, Connor, we kind of said in the script that we expect margins on the product side to remain strong through the end of the year as we run off this inventory, and we just aren't in the habit of providing guidance beyond the next quarter just given all the ins and outs and puts and takes of customer activity and material costs."
