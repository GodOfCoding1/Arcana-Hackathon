    "content": " We recorded a provision of 515.8 million for the quarter, reflecting not only crazy portfolio balances, mainly in consumer loans, and slight deterioration in the long-term outlook of certain forecasted microeconomic variables. Loan portfolio balances other than PPP loans, grew by the 112 million when compared to second quarter, primarily driven by increases in consumer and some commercial loans, partially offset by a decrease in residential market. In the case of consumer loans, interest income grew 4 million, but was mostly related to increase on average balance as the portfolio on average grew 126 million in the quarter. The allowance on just loans and finance leases was 258 million, which is 6 million higher than last quarter, reflecting the movement in the portfolio and again, the deterioration on the long-term outlook of the economic variables. Alex, your line is now open. Kelly, your line is now open. Alex, your line is now open. Kelly, your line is now open."
