    "content": " I'm excited to report that our teams continue to execute and to deliver KIMMTRAK to patients in the United States, Germany and France, with impressive site expansion and seamless reimbursement, all while continuing to manage our global early access programs. I'm thankful for the seamless execution from our commercial and clinical teams, who have enabled us to bring KIMMTRAK to patients so quickly, both with our global early access program and now commercialization in a disease with such a significant unmet need. At ASCO, 2 months ago, we presented a survival update on our study of KIMMTRAK plus an anti-PD(L)1 in metastatic cutaneous melanoma patients, who progress on a prior anti-PD1. On the commercial front, although it's early in the launch in U.S. and Europe, do you expect a steady continuous growth in the following quarters beyond just EAP people that have come on, both from new patients coming on, but also -- do you get the sense early on that people are staying on duration of therapy beyond just 5 months based on your experience and what you're seeing in the commercial setting? Can I just clarify the KIMMTRAK comment, is that 40% of the new patients that you're picking up are first line, or 40% of the overall U.S. patients now on KIMMTRAK are first line? So for the first question, the historical 1-year survival is mostly in patients who progressed on prior PD1 and (technical difficulty) also even seen for in patients who progressed on prior PD1."
