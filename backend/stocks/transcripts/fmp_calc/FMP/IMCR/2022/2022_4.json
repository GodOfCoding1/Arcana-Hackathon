    "content": " Our teams have executed flawlessly launching KIMMTRAK just days after approval, achieving reimbursement in the U.S., Germany and France, transitioning all EAP patients to commercial supply within weeks and importantly, establishing KIMMTRAK as the most prescribed medicine for HLA-A02:01 positive metastatic tubulomynoloma patients across all countries that we've launched in. I'm excited to report that our teams continue to execute and to deliver KIMMTRAK to patients in the United States, Germany and France, with the impressive site expansion and seamless reimbursement while continuing to expand our global early access program in new countries currently treating nearly 200 patients. In Europe, a key dynamic will be formal reimbursement agreement in Germany and France as well as the expected launch of commercial KIMMTRAK in one additional major European country by midyear, and we expected 5 additional new countries by year-end. And as we mentioned, as we have saturated or have now penetrated most of the academic centers, and we're moving in community growth, you should expect growth to be slower in 2023 in the U.S. And of course, we're studying patients now who've also failed on checkpoints."
