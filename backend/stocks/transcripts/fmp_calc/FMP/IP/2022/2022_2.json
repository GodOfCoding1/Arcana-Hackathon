    "content": " As Mark mentioned, we generated strong earnings growth in the second quarter in the prior quarter and prior year, driven by strong price realization and execution of our Building a Better IP initiatives. Input costs were about $100 million, or $0.20 per share in second quarter, driven by higher energy, chemicals and distribution costs, in large part because of higher diesel fuel prices. Our mills continue to run well, ops and costs are better in the quarter as the business benefited from one-time items I mentioned earlier by approximately $20 million. Operations and costs are expected to decrease earnings by $30 million, due to non-repeat favorable one-time items in the second quarter and timing of spending. I want to just turn to cellulose specialties for a minute and try and unpack getting the cost of capital there because it sounds like first of all, if you're outed essentially kind of a three quarter price lag, what we saw in the second quarter is probably more indicative of what we would have seen last year in the third quarter, in terms of kind of net price."
