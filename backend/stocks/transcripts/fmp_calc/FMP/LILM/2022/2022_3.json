    "content": " In 2023, we will be working full steam towards signing binding agreements with deposits, securing government loans and subsidies, starting assembly of our type-conforming aircraft, building and testing our first battery packs, further flight testing with both technology demonstrators, receiving the Design Organization Approval, agreeing to full certification plan and Means of Compliance with EASA and last, preparing the manned first flight in 2024 of our Type-conforming aircraft. Please ask your question. And so as we progress all service through our own program in engineering and the confidence by which we can really provide everything we need to put into an agreement, which is performance-related and warranties and as we're also progressing with our supply chain, we were absolutely able to transform all of the work we've done this year with the first phase segment, which is really right now the General and Business Aviation segment into a contract with deposits having binding terms on both end. We will take our next question. Please ask your question. Great, thanks very much. We will take our next question. Please ask your question. We will take our next question. Please ask your question.
