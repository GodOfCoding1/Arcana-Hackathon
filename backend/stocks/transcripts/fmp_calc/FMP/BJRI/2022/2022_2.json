    "content": " In summary, we are focused on a comprehensive set of initiatives aimed at significantly increasing our average weekly sales, growing our restaurant margins and continuing our national expansion with a controlled pace in top quality sites with the goal of growing BJ sales to $2 billion and beyond and delivering meaningful earnings growth and shareholder return. We're not all of a sudden telling our servers and our restaurants that we're going to eliminate certain positions or do things like that, that we've heard other restaurants to do because we understand that people come to us for a social dining experience and the service and hospitality from our team members drives top line sales. Just wondering if there's any baseline metric we could assume as to what a new market sales and margins are relative to maybe what an existing market is, just so we have a frame of reference when we think about new versus existing markets and those new openings for next year. And as we try to allude to on today's call, even what we're seeing in July right now, when we look at our labor efficiency model -- and we have a model based on what we call items per labor hour, so how many labor hours do we need to basically cook an item, serve it to our guests and so forth -- those numbers have dramatically improved here in July as we got back to saying, here's our labor standards."
