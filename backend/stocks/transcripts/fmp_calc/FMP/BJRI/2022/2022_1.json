At this time, I\u2019d like to turn the conference over to Greg Levin, Chief Executive Officer. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to BJ\u2019s Restaurants fiscal 2022 first quarter investor conference call and webcast. I\u2019m Greg Levin, BJ\u2019s Chief Executive Officer and President. Our agenda today, we\u2019ll start with Rana Schirmer, our Director of SEC Reporting, providing our standard cautionary disclosure with respect to forward-looking statements. Our forward-looking statements speak only as of today\u2019s date, April 21, 2022. BJ\u2019s generated record Q1 revenue, beating our previous high set in 2019, even with the significant industry-wide impact from the Omicron surge in January. Compared to 2019, our comparable restaurant sales increased from negative 6.4% in January to negative 0.6% in February, and then to a positive 1.2% in March. Our solid performance continues in April with period-to-date weekly restaurant sales averaging $118,000, which equates to positive mid-single-digit comparable restaurant sales growth from the same period in 2019. Staffing continues to be a key driver of sales, and we added hourly team members and further reduced the number of understaffed restaurants throughout the quarter. Finally, our net promoter scores rose in the first quarter and our guests scored us higher in Q1 than at any point over the past year and well ahead of our pre-COVID measure in each metric including overall recommend, value, food and hospitality. To mitigate some of the recent inflation impact, we implemented around a menu pricing of 1.8% in February, and we\u2019ll take another additional 1.4% in June. While sales are improving with guest demand, we still have excess capacity at lunch and other day parts that we can drive guests into our restaurants to leverage the fixed cost in our business to improve margins. After seven months as BJ\u2019s CEO, I am confident as ever in BJ\u2019s ability to deliver industry leading results. Every BJ\u2019s team member from our restaurants to the restaurant support center is committed to growing sales, since driving incremental sales is the best way for BJ\u2019s to deliver profitable growth. They are: serve memorable brewhouse experiences; craft the people first hospitality culture; build a large, profitable best-in-class off-premise experience; accelerate restaurant growth and new sales channels; and build a better guest and team member experience through the joy of technology. First in regards to serving memorable brewhouse experiences, BJ\u2019s offers a social dining experience in what we refer to as the polished casual space. Guests come to us not only for a meal occasion, but for the full BJ\u2019s hospitality experience, which is not available anywhere else. That is why every new BJ\u2019s team member across our organization receives a craft card, outlining our brand\u2019s core values around connection, respect, advancement, fun, and trust. To help ensure our new hourly team members learn the BJ\u2019s way, we are developing new training programs that provide improved tools to deliver on our high standards of service and hospitality from the very first day. In 2021, our average weekly off-premise sales approximately doubled from pre-pandemic levels to more than $20,000 per restaurant, which is where it remains today. Data continues to confirm that BJ\u2019s unique concept can leverage and untapped and underdeveloped markets across the country to support at least 425 BJ\u2019s restaurants nationwide, or approximately twice the number of locations we have today. In closing, I would like to express our appreciation and gratitude for each and every one of our team members who remain committed to making BJ\u2019s the gold standard in the casual dining industry. Our sales increased approximately 34% versus Q1 of 2021 and 3% versus Q1 of 2019, which makes it our highest Q1 sales ever. On a comparable restaurant basis, sales increased by 34% compared to Q1 2021 and declined by 1.5% compared to Q1 2019. As Greg mentioned, our comparable restaurant sales improved through the quarter and finished with positive comparable restaurant sales in March versus 2019. Deleveraging from early in the quarter -- early quarter Omicron sales impact and continued inflationary pressures resulted in restaurant margins of 9.8%, which was in line with our expectations. Adjusted EBITDA was $13.2 million and 4.4% of sales in our first quarter, beating Q1 of 2021 EBITDA but behind Q1 2019 EBITDA. The quarter started with January weekly sales per restaurant averaging $96,000 in comparable sales of 6.4% behind January 2019 levels as the Omicron wave was surging across the country. We increased our weekly sales to $110,000 in February, which was within 0.6% of 2019 levels on a comparable restaurant basis. Our sales trends further improved in March with the weekly sales average reaching $118,000, which was 1.2% above 2019 levels. Our cost of sales in the quarter was 27.3% of sales, which was a 10 basis-point improvement from last quarter, but unfavorable to the prior year and to our first quarter of 2019. Also, our training and overtime hours remained elevated in the quarter due to strong hiring and the impacted labor as a percentage of sales by an additional 60 basis points compared to Q1 2019. We believe the investment we have made in both, managers and hourly two members are now driving meaningful sales growth in incremental profit as more guests come to dine at BJ\u2019s. Occupancy and operating expenses at 24.0% of sales in the quarter were favorable to the prior year, but unfavorable to our first quarter of 2019. Due to the Omicron impact in January, we reduced our marketing spend in the quarter to 1.5% of sales, which remained below pre-COVID levels. We still expect to ramp up G&A spending as the year progresses and conditions improve, including investments that enable us to increase new restaurant openings and build upon our operating and talent capabilities, like resuming in-person operations development meetings, including our career development conference and leadership development conference. We are very pleased with the strength of our balance sheet and will remain consistent in our approach of prioritizing growth-driving investments to build new restaurants, improve our existing restaurants and fund sales driving initiatives. Weekly sales have remained in the $118,000 area and we remain -- and we continue to add hourly team members to our restaurants to unlock even more sales. The second quarter is typically our highest sales quarter, which has the benefit from spring break and big sales weekends for Mother\u2019s Day, Father\u2019s Day, as well as large parties during graduation season. Finally, I would like to provide an update on the three elements that impacted recent sales, but that we expect to benefit future periods: restaurant staffing, challenged dayparts and media spend. In the first quarter, restaurants consistent with pre-COVID staffing levels generated at 2.2% of comparable sales versus 2019, which was more than 10 percentage points better than restaurants still in the process of rebuilding their teams. In early Q2, both dayparts are delivering encouraging top-line trends with lunch returning to approximately flat and late night now with positive comparable restaurant sales versus 2019. Our new lunch value menu continues to add weekday traffic and late night has benefited from us adding back more late night hours, starting in March as our staffing levels have improved. In Q1 2019, we spent 40% more in media dollars, promoting BJ\u2019s brand across channels, including television, when comparing to our Q1 2022 spend levels. Making the conservative assumption that our media investment just broke -- breakeven, the incremental media spend in our 2029 base sales translated to more than 80 basis points of three-year comp headwind in the first quarter. We are targeting investing approximately 2% of sales in the second quarter to increase brand awareness and drive additional traffic to our restaurants, which is incorporated in the Q2 margin expectations I provided earlier. We expect each of these factors to contribute to tailwinds in the second quarter and beyond and help drive incremental sales, and higher sales lead to higher restaurant margins. We have seen new challenges emerge throughout the pandemic, and we continue to meet the challenges head on, manage our business for both near and long-term objectives and remain steadfast in our focus on providing our guests with the best experience which will allow us to continue delivering outsized growth in the years to come. Thank you for your time today, and we\u2019ll now open the call to your questions. When we look at the numbers and what we\u2019re talking about here in that $118,000 we\u2019re in kind of the mid-single-digit comps, we\u2019re still comparing it to 2019 being kind of the last time to compare it to. But, I think what we\u2019re seeing is, and we mentioned a little bit on the formal remarks, and that is our lunch specials are working really well with our guests, and that is the value play there. The ability to get full service sit-down chicken parm for $10 and here in California for $11 in a higher cost area tends to be a great value, and we\u2019re seeing that improvement in that lunch daypart. It\u2019s still a softer daypart for us though, overall, and that\u2019s where I think we can continue to lean into that and drive the excess capacity in that business. I would say the -- in terms of the overall business, it\u2019s great to have the everyday value across our menu, but we also have very sharp price points at Happy Hour and daily Brewhouse specials. And in terms of pricing, we -- when we go through these pricing rounds, we\u2019ll measure to see what the flow-through is and if we\u2019ve seen any trade between products. And really, we haven\u2019t seen any shift there as well. So, we haven\u2019t seen anything of concern. The second part of that question is really -- or part of that question comes down to is where you, from a modeling or even us internally start thinking about where our sales trends go, because we\u2019re still not fully back to where we want to be in the dining room. As we just put up this quarter here, we still saw cost of sales in the 27% range. And then, over time, we\u2019ll also start to leverage more on the labor. So, when I think about that business, or I think about the margins, I should say, I don\u2019t see any reason why, over time, our margins don\u2019t continue to accelerate back into the mid-teens and get back to historic numbers over time. This year, I think, it\u2019s still going to be, as Tom was touching upon, still going to be some training as much as it comes out in the second half of the year. And we\u2019re purposely underpricing maybe compared to our peers, only taking 1.8 and coming up here at 1.4. And I\u2019d rather use that, get the guests in and drive leverage over those fixed costs versus trying to just completely lean into pricing. So, there\u2019s still a meaningful amount of dining of traffic capacity in our restaurants that we can add back. The sales levels that we talked about, I mean, the benefit of the off-premise being double where we were, it\u2019s great because that pushes us to the comp positive position. But as we really see the opportunity of getting more staffing in our restaurants and being able to serve more guests, there\u2019s a big opportunity to grow that traffic back over time. So, as that additional pricing over time comes in, that\u2019s going to be part of it. And then just the fact that we do have the strong off-premise sales and holding on to that off-premise sales, you don\u2019t really need to get all that dine-in traffic back to start to move your margins closer to maybe some historical run rates. I\u2019ll give you a top level, and Tom, chime in here. I would still tend to say that the Bay Area is still softer, but it\u2019s moving in the right direction, which obviously we like. So, when you look at the business overall, and you look at both geography and dayparts, they\u2019re moving in the right direction. But I think as Tom just said there -- and I\u2019ve emphasized as well, there\u2019s still a lot of opportunity to drive this dine-in traffic, and frankly, still to drive off-premise. That\u2019s helpful, particularly, in terms of the daypart piece. So, the two that we\u2019ve opened, we -- there\u2019s a model of our restaurants that\u2019s about somewhere in the quarter to a third of our restaurants that had some unused space that we can rebuild and turn into three large booths. And when we look at where we have the most capacity constraints or we run weights at dinner time, the extra sales that we\u2019re driving, again, early data here, but we\u2019re seeing up to 1,000 or 2,000 more of sales per week. So, the early data that we\u2019re seeing out of these restaurants is encouraging. So, early days of the remodel initiative, but from -- again, very early results here, we\u2019re encouraged by what we see and definitely think that when we pencil out what the cost is versus what the upside could be. So, we\u2019re excited about what this could look like. I don\u2019t have it specifically here, but we generally roll out our menus in kind of January, June, kind of September, October. But I tend to -- even as we look at that, the inflation really that everybody\u2019s experience started pretty heavy in Q3 and 4 of last year, and obviously, into Q1 that everybody is currently facing. So, as we started to face this inflection of higher pricing, I think that\u2019s where we\u2019ve kind of taking our pedal off the gas a little bit on overall pricing as we continue to build the business forward. But, I want to say, we\u2019re all in looking at back to the Q1 and 2 of last year, it\u2019s probably around 5% or so. So, when you layer on the incremental 1.5% to 2%, does that get you meaningfully into that mid-single-digit -- mid- to high-single-digit range of pricing perspective, or as we take in those pieces that roll off on a year-over-year basis, does that keep you more or less in that mid-single-digit range? As we roll over from a year ago, we\u2019ll actually be maybe even a little bit less on pricing, because I think maybe Q1, Q2 might be a little bit more 2021. It sounds as though things have gotten much better of late that has helped drive the recent sales recovery, but also that you\u2019re still adding employees even now. The other thing that plays into this as well is your staffing levels might feel pretty good when we look at them on a piece of paper, but we still end up with callouts and other issues, just whether it\u2019s COVID or something else that plays into it. But, if I had to think about looking back on the last year plus, 15 months or so, we\u2019re in a much healthier place today than where we\u2019ve been over that time frame. I\u2019m going to hold off on the color there because, frankly, we\u2019re testing a bunch of different things, and we don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to work or not work. So, we\u2019re not looking and saying, okay, maybe we eliminate server assistance, and therefore, we don\u2019t have that position or we take servers to 7 or 8 tables. What we wanted to continue to do is look at areas in regards to consumables, some of the operating expenditure costs and see if there\u2019s other things that we can do that will help reduce costs or -- and continue to keep the kind of the uniqueness in the posh casual look that we have at BJ\u2019s. When those work, and we don\u2019t see any pushback from our guests and it continues to make BJ\u2019s stand out and be differentiated, we\u2019ll discuss those. The thing that I\u2019m trying to make sure we at BJ\u2019s, and we talked about this as our executive team, we are not going to get succumbed by the term skimpflation out there. And so, things we\u2019ve done already this year, like we\u2019ve increased our chicken sandwich from a 4-ounce to a 6-ounce chicken breast. And while that might make us feel good for a quarter, it\u2019s not how you build the business for the long term. And so, everything we want to look at comes to the point that we\u2019re still giving the guest a unique and better dining experience than our peers. So, I\u2019m just wondering if you can give a little more color on that. So, there\u2019s never been a concern that a portfolio of classes didn\u2019t work or markets didn\u2019t work for us from that perspective. So, as I\u2019ve taken on this role and seeing just a history of good restaurants that continue to work for BJ\u2019s, I thought it was important that we get consistent in regards to our cadence of growing our business. And you did make the right comment that we\u2019ve always used, and that is it\u2019s going to be quality over quantity. So, even as we look out and trying to get it above 5% to 6% and 7%, we want to make sure that we\u2019re doing it at the point that we can execute with really, really good quality. So, we\u2019re going to always continue to make sure that it\u2019s done at the right cadence that we can execute and not get ahead of our ski tips. And I do feel good that as we build this year, back those regional training teams that need to be built, we need to rebuild our supply chain team, which is more difficult today than any time in the past because opening up a new restaurant takes a little bit of a different supply chain skill. And then, as Greg Lynds, who\u2019s here with me, continues to build out his team in regards to being able to open restaurants consistently that we do that this year, and that\u2019s part of that G&A investment that will allow us to accelerate restaurant growth next year. I think we can do that at BJ\u2019s in the 5%, 6%, 7% range. In regards to locations, and I\u2019ll let Greg Lynds, he\u2019s the expert to talk to it. With only 213 restaurants today in 29 states, you think about Olive Garden with 800-plus, Texas Roadhouse with 600-plus, we have plenty of room within our 29 states or adjacent states to really keep our expansion within our existing markets and where we can leverage our supply chain, our supervision, our brand awareness. But we\u2019re excited about the opportunity to not only expand in our existing markets, but also take on a few new markets as we grow in the coming years. And then, just following up, Greg, you mentioned longer-term targets that sales $2 billion plus, which accumulated the 400 units of the volumes you\u2019re doing. Jeff, we\u2019re still working through some of the details there and want to plan to present that to the investment community in the near future here. Generally speaking, from a very simple cadence, we\u2019ve talked about this before, and that is getting that unit growth up to 5-plus-percent, driving mid-single-digit comp sales starts to get your revenue getting close to kind of 10% range. And again, it all starts with driving the weekly sales average because that\u2019s going to allow us to continue to leverage the middle of the P&L to get that earnings above. And look, between all of us on the call, we hope to get to $2 billion in sales with less than 425 restaurants. And I think we still have a good opportunity in the dining room because even what we\u2019re doing today, as Tom mentioned earlier, we\u2019re still seeing negative traffic in the dining room. And also, to just confirm, I know you said 13.5% to 14% in the second quarter, and that was a good run rate for the back half of the year. Like, what visibility do you have on either those, or what\u2019s the assumption baked into that 13.5% to 14%? So, in terms of the commodity inflation, it\u2019s similar to what we\u2019re seeing right now. We\u2019re seeing, versus last year, up kind of in the high single digits. So, that\u2019s baked into the margin assumptions that we provided. First, if we look back, I think, $118,000 a week in April, if you look back to -- I\u2019m just wondering typical seasonality in this quarter because you do have big events coming up with Mother\u2019s Day, Father\u2019s Day graduation. So April, it\u2019s about -- it was slightly less than in May and June. So, it\u2019s a little less than May and June, but not much, but you do see some pickup into May and June, and that\u2019s really driven by those big weekends, really that Mother\u2019s Day and Father\u2019s Day weekend as we see those big increases. It\u2019s surprisingly consistent, Todd, which I know it sounds -- it doesn\u2019t, in one sense -- makes sense, I guess. You get a Father\u2019s Day, that drives that number up a lot and then some graduations here or there. So, it\u2019s kind of peaks and valleys, but it\u2019s surprising. And we were able to do it on Valentine\u2019s Day in February, which is a tough day in of itself. And then, we\u2019ve seen it on a couple of other days as well where we\u2019ve broken some sales records here in Q1. And thankfully, we\u2019ve got great managers in our restaurants that get prepared for that. But we\u2019re always thinking about our staffing levels and making sure we have the right team members in our restaurants that can deliver gracious hospitality, take care of our guests and make sure our managers take care of our team members. Because ultimately, if we had that right culture in the restaurant, we\u2019ll have the great staffing, and we\u2019ll be able to take care of our guests come these bigger celebratory events. Did March margins kind of match up with that 13.5%, 14% restaurant level that you\u2019re guiding to? So, we\u2019ll see a little bit of that benefit in the back end of the quarter in Q2. But yes, for the most part, you\u2019re thinking about it right. And the final one for me, this is just a follow-up from David\u2019s question earlier. No, I don\u2019t see any reason why we wouldn\u2019t get our dining room back. And I know everybody wanted it to happen yesterday and so forth, but as we look at our business and people get more comfortable going out, we, all of a sudden, see late night now in a positive comparable restaurant perspective. I still think, as Tom mentioned a little bit earlier, and we\u2019re getting there and you talked to it as well, Todd, it is about making sure you\u2019ve got the staffing to be able to handle it. And while staffing is not like it\u2019s been in the past, the more people we have and the better people we have, the more people we can take into our restaurants, so we want to continue working on that staffing. While we didn\u2019t talk about it specifically, and I forget the exact amount, but things like mobile pay, or using the QR to pay, like, those are turning out to be fairly sticky in our restaurants. They\u2019re not at the levels they were in the pandemic when everything was touchless per se, but there\u2019s little things like that that can make it faster on the guests to make it better on the guests from an experience standpoint and make it easier for us from a team member perspective and be able to therefore turn those tables quicker. So, we want to continue working on those areas at the -- kind of at the shoulders of the guest dining experience to be faster and more productive in our restaurants. But getting back to your original question, I don\u2019t see any reason why our traffic patterns wouldn\u2019t return to where they were pre-COVID. So, if we think about year-over-year inflation, we\u2019ll see high single digits or we\u2019re expecting high single digits for the next quarter. And then, frankly, we look across the board at where we\u2019re priced in certain category items and make sure that we\u2019re competitive or that maybe we\u2019re below them. So, it\u2019s a little bit of everything. There\u2019s also, as we\u2019ve done a lot of consumer research over the last year, we know the reason that guests come to BJ\u2019s and where they are from a price sensitivity. I can\u2019t specifically -- I\u2019m going to your other part of your question, I can\u2019t specifically say if I have seen skimpflation in any of our peer restaurant companies. I know restaurant companies that have talked about it, whether it\u2019s less wings being offered or something else on their appetizer. I thought in The Great Recession, a lot of companies try to do less for less and it didn\u2019t work in that regard because guests are used to getting a certain amount for a certain price point. I know when I travel and you think about going into hotels and used to having service and so forth, you don\u2019t have any work to pay for a higher price. I get all of that that\u2019s going on out there, and that\u2019s where I see this skimpflation. As we mentioned, we do have 1.4 coming here in June, and we\u2019ll continue to evaluate that and where commodities go, but we want to make sure that we\u2019re providing what I call price affordability on our menu, not just what people want to consider value being everything, but I want to make sure that there\u2019s price affordability in that value equation as well. I\u2019ll let Greg Lynds handle this, but the one thing I would say, and I kind of tried to stay in this a little bit earlier as well is, we\u2019ve always opened up really good sites. So, I\u2019ve always felt comfortable and confident in our ability to pick great sites and build BJ\u2019s Restaurants. I mean, over the years, really -- and I\u2019ve said this before on these calls is that the AAA sites, there\u2019s always a lot of demand for those sites. But in terms of just overall site availability for BJ\u2019s, I would say we\u2019re pretty consistent with where we were, maybe even in 2019. No, it\u2019s -- I don\u2019t have this in front of me, but if I think if you go back to \u201819, hourly wages are up in the 20%, 25% range. And some of that is the fact that we\u2019re in California, and California had a $1 step up every single year until this last year. But I want to say it\u2019s in the 20%, 25% range if you compare to \u201819. And in terms of hourly labor, we were in the mid-10s at the beginning of 2019, and now we\u2019re in the 13 area. So, it\u2019s yes, 25%-or-so just in terms of dollar per hour. First, just to clarify, did you guys say that you\u2019re comfortable with the 13.5% to 14% margin range in Q3 and Q4? So, I\u2019d expect the margins to work similarly with a little deleverage and then a little more leverage, so there will be some. So, that was purely about Q2, but if we -- if sales are still in the same, say, comp versus \u201819 level, it should dip a little bit into Q3, but we\u2019ll see at the end of -- when we talk next to where we are in terms of sales, and we\u2019ll give more guidance then. Because I mean, that\u2019s trailing a little bit, right, the peer set. Hey Nick, believe it or not, without us getting into all the specifics, we\u2019re able to pull over Black Box dine-in traffic trends and sales trends. And we, because of our large sales and where our off-premise is, that\u2019s why I think there\u2019s an ability to still grow off-premise more. If you pull that out and just look at dine-in, we\u2019re actually, in the last two periods, beating Black Box sales on a dine-in basis. So, we -- so I think what\u2019s happening in the industry right now, and I think this is good for the industry, by the way, people get the off-premise sales, which helps grow their -- obviously, their comps. As with the 100,000 WSA to begin with, when we get a 10,000 increase in our off-premise and somebody else gets 6,000 or 7,000 increase in off-premise, it doesn\u2019t have the same type of impact because we\u2019re starting to just add a higher sales number. So, I think, the entire industry is still saying, I guess, I\u2019m getting at softness in the dining room, even though it\u2019s slowly coming back. So, it\u2019s a little bit still in that lunch time frame. Frankly, as strong as dinner is, I think there\u2019s an opportunity to drive more traffic at the dinner side. I think where we\u2019ve got pretty well-known brand awareness, we\u2019re driving better sales from that perspective versus maybe some of the other smaller markets. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference."
