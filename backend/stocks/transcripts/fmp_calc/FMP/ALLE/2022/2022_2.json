    "content": " Breaking down that impact further, the Access Technology\u00e2\u0080\u0099s business is expected to deliver $0.20 per share of operational earnings offset by non-cash intangible asset amortization of negative $0.13 per share and increased interest expense related to financing the deal is expected to drive a negative $0.17 per share impact. The negative volume was driven by the Allegion America's residential business, which was comparing against a robust to Q2 2021 growth rate associated with prior year catch up on COVID related backlog. Investment spending had a $0.05 per share drag on earnings as we continue to invest in the business to fuel long-term growth, expand our electronic capabilities, and drive our seamless access strategy. This results in an adjusted second quarter 2022 earnings per share of $1.37, an increase of $0.05 or 3.8% compared to the prior year. As noted previously, we expect the newly acquired Access Technologies business to deliver approximately 9% growth for the full-year reported Americas revenue. Please go ahead, sir. Please go ahead, sir. Please go ahead, sir."
