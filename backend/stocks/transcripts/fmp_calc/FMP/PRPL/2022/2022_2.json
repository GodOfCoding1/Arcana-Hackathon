    "content": " We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen estimates that domestic mattress volumes are down 20% to 25% year-to-date, Purple has experienced a similar pullback over the first six months of the year, in addition to a shift in spending habits from online, a position of strength for Purple, to in-store where we are still in early stages of developing our capabilities. For the three months ended June 30, 2022, net revenue was $144.1 million, down 21.1% compared to the $182.6 million in the prior year period. This decrease was due to a number of factors, including a challenging comparison to a stimulus assisted second quarter of 2021 coupled with changing demand for home-related products, inflationary pressure on consumer wallets and our intentional decrease in advertising spend, which was down 56% compared with a year ago. By channel versus prior year, wholesale net revenue declined 5.9%, primarily driven by lower door productivity that was partially offset by opening approximately 1,000 net new doors. Gross profit dollars were $48.8 million during the second quarter of 2022, compared to $81.7 million during the same period last year, with gross margin at $33.9% versus 44.7% in the second quarter of 2021. The decrease in operating expenses as a percent of net revenue compared with the prior year period was driven primarily by our intentional reduction in advertising spend to improve marketing efficiency and stabilized profitability in the current environment, and the restructuring of the marketing organization that happened at the beginning of the second quarter of this year. On an adjusted basis, net loss in the second quarter of 2022 was $8.5 million or $0.11 per diluted share based on an adjusted weighted average diluted share count of 83.2 million compared to an adjusted debt income of $3.6 million or $0.05 per diluted share based on an adjusted weighted average diluted share account of 67.3 million in the prior year period. Adjusted EBITDA, which excludes certain non-cash and other items we do not consider in the evaluation of our ongoing performance and as detailed in today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s earnings release, was negative $0.3 million compared with positive adjusted EBITDA of $11 million a year ago, and negative adjusted EBITDA of $9.6 million in the first quarter of 2022. We now expect net revenue to be in the range of $570 million to $590 million, compared to our prior range of $650 million to $690 million with the change, primarily reflecting a reduction in projected wholesale volume to reflect the aforementioned change in industry trends."
