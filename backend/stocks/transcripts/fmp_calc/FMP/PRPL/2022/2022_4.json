    "content": " Intellibed's portfolio of higher priced mattresses compared to our legacy offerings provided a natural extension of Purple's product line, this accelerated Purple's product development schedule by several years and immediately placed us in the $5,000 and up segment of the mattress market. Driven by the new product launch in May, a stronger presence throughout our wholesale channel and new marketing programs we are projecting quarterly results to improve sequentially throughout the year with Q2 revenue up nicely from quarter one and similar to the second quarter of 2022, before returning to year-over-year growth in the second half to reach our full-year targets. While we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re excited about our new product lineup and believe this reinvigoration of our innovation engine positions us for growth later in the year, it is putting pressure on first quarter results as Bennett it outlined.
