    "content": " For the three months ended March 31, 2022, net revenue was $143.2 million, down 23.2% compared to the $186.4 million in the prior year period. Gross profit dollars were $51.6 million during the first quarter of 2022, compared to $87.5 million during the same period last year with gross margin at 36.1% versus 46.9% in the first quarter of 2021. On an adjusted basis, net loss in the first quarter of 2022 was $16.5 million or negative $0.214 per diluted share based on an adjusted weighted share -- diluted share count of $67.5 million compared to adjusted net income of $12.0 million or $0.17 per diluted share based on an adjusted weighted average diluted share count of $68.6 million in the prior year period. This compares to our guidance for adjusted EBITDA in the range of negative $26 million to $20 million, primarily as higher than expected revenues and lower marketing expenses resulted in a better-than-expected bottom-line performance. We now expect net revenue to be in the range of $650 million to $690 million, compared to our prior range of $790 million to $830 million with the change primarily reflecting a reduction in e-commerce volumes as we now better understand the after effects of COVID's impact on the industry. The stores we've opened over the last two years are performing in line with our target unit economics of $2 million in annual sales with about an 18-month payback on roughly $700,000 initial capital investment.
