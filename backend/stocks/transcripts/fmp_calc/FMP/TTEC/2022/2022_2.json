    "content": " We are pleased with our second quarter performance achieving many of our key metrics closing on a meaningful strategic asset acquisition, surpassing $600 million in revenue in the second quarter for the first time, representing double-digit top line growth of 10.8% over the same period last year on a constant currency basis. On a consolidated basis in the second quarter of 2022, revenue was $604.3 million, an increase of 8.9% and 12% on a like-for-like basis, excluding the impact of pandemic-related volumes. First, late in the second quarter of many new and existing clients delayed purchasing decisions; second, while our health care, public sector and automotive and other verticals continue to perform well, our comms, media and entertainment clients and early-stage venture-backed hypergrowth clients became more cautious about their demand in the second half, as a result, moderated their volume forecast for the second half of 2022. We expect our revenue growth for the full year of 2022 to be 6.2% down from our prior guidance, driven primarily by FX and previously mentioned impacts within our hypergrowth and comms, media and entertainment verticals. Turning to the midpoint of our 2022 guidance, including Faneuil assets as outlined in greater detail in our second quarter earnings press release, we expect GAAP revenue of $2.414 billion, an increase over the prior year of 6.2% and 7.7% on a constant currency basis."
