So if you think about the puts and takes, our interest rate swap revenue fell this quarter, fixed income actually fell only about $1 million, but I would expect fixed income to be more challenging as the Fed continues to raise rates and that short-term rates and long-term rates all end up about the same. So just to kind of sum up all of that, so with the next several quarters until the Fed stops raising rates, we would expect our non-interest income to average assets to be between 0.6% and 0.7%. If the Fed stops raising rates when we get into more normal environment sometime in '23, we'd expect the NII to average assets to get back to 0.7% to 0.8% and kind of act as the hedge as we talked about to net interest income. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. So if you just run the math and say, based on history, our deposit beta is going to be 24% in the entire cycle versus where we are, that's really what's driving the -- we've picked up a lot of asset sensitivity from here. Your line is now open. And that's -- if you kind of run that out, that's probably an 80% loan to deposit ratio at the end of '23 and roughly around 2.5%, 3% of assets in cash, if we do what we just spoke about. Your line is now open. Your line is now open."
