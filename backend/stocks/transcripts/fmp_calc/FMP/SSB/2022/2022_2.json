    "content": " The quarter's net interest income of $314 million was a record with our NIM expanding by 35 basis points from Q1, reaching 3.12%. Our $1.45 billion in loan growth equated to a 22% annualized growth rate, which brings the last 4 quarters' loan growth to 12.3%. With approximately 70% of our investment portfolio of classified as AFS, the move in rates in the second quarter caused an additional decrease in AOCI, dropping our TCE ratio to 6.8%, and our TBV per share to $39.47. I know pull-through rates have been pretty strong this quarter and maybe pipelines aren't as full as they were, but there's -- I think what I've heard from others is there's an expectation that those will rebuild as we move into year-end. As we think about the next couple of quarters and just -- particularly with our interest rate sensitivity businesses like correspondent and mortgage, we think that's probably going to be on the lower end of the range between that 70 and 80 basis points for the next quarter or 2 and then kind of rebound in the middle of the range in 2023."
