    "content": " Turning to the fourth quarter, CME generated more than $1.2 billion in revenue with average daily volume up nearly 6.5% compared to the same period last year. CME had an adjusted effective tax rate of 22.8%, which resulted in adjusted net income attributable to CME Group of $698 million, up 15% from the fourth quarter last year and an adjusted EPS attributable to common shareholders of $1.92. And I think that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s because of what was setting up whether it was geopolitically and just other fundamental factors in the market, whether it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the price of rates at a given time, price of certain products, you could see that the market was setting up for what I thought was going to be a pretty exclusive year. So, market data certainly was \u00e2\u0080\u0093 had a very strong quarter again in the fourth quarter, we were up another 8% year-on-year and the increases is due primarily to both the value of our data, the new products that we are introducing and also the fee adjustments that we made back in January of 2022. We actually are seeing \u00e2\u0080\u0093 when we looked at last year, the full year, our Henry Hub volume was down a couple of percent, 2%, 3%, something like I think \u00e2\u0080\u0093 I saw something a little bit of a larger magnitude and the downdraft."
