    "content": " In fiscal Q1, despite the ongoing macroeconomic headwinds and short-term challenges impacting the semiconductor industry, we delivered revenues of $9.5 billion and non-GAAP earnings of $2.37 per share, including year-over-year growth in QCT Automotive in IoT. So, the way, Stacy, we are thinking about kind of how things play out is the short-term headwinds, cyclical headwinds that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re seeing that uncertainty remains, and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re seeing that in handsets and IoT, so both from a demand perspective and inventory drawdown. So, this is Alex. On your second question on the lag, I think that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s already embedded in the way we provided our view into the future, which is -- as we expect inventory drawdowns to happen through the March quarter then going into the June quarter, but as we go into the second half of the calendar year, as demand comes back and normalizes, we have the ability to benefit from it. So, this is Alex."
