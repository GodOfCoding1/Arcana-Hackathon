    "content": " QCT recorded revenues of $9.4 billion and EBT margin of 32%, both at the midpoint of our guidance and reflecting revenue growth of 45% and EBT dollar growth of 67% versus the year-ago quarter. Handset revenues of $6.1 billion increased 59% year-over-year, driven by the strength of our Snapdragon product portfolio, especially in the premium and high tiers. Consistent with our guidance, RF front-end revenues of $1 billion, grew 9% versus the year-ago quarter on increased adoption of our broad product portfolio. We delivered another record quarter in automotive with revenues of $350 million with year-over-year growth of 38%, driven by launches with our digital cockpit products. Maybe as a follow-up there, Akash, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been ordinarily kind enough to give us some out quarter views on prior calls and with all the movement in the end market and the fact that you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re lowering the forecast for the full calendar year on handsets, if you have any color that you could give us directionally into the December quarter, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099d be really grateful."
