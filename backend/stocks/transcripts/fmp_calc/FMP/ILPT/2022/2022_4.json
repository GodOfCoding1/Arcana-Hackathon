    "content": " ILPT's consolidated portfolio includes 413 warehouse and distribution properties in 39 states, totaling 60 million square feet with a weighted average remaining lease term of approximately nine years. For the full year, we achieved record annual leasing activity of 7.8 million square feet at weighted average rental rates that were 47.3% higher than prior rental rates for the same space. During the fourth quarter, we entered 17 new in renewal leases and one rent reset for a total of 1.4 million square feet at a weighted average lease term of eight years. Starting with our consolidated financial results for the fourth quarter of 2022, normalized funds from operations were $5.4 million or $0.08 per share, a decline of $26.3 million compared to the prior year quarter. The major drivers impacting normalized FFO over the prior year quarter was higher interest expense, partially offset by a $40 million increase in NOI. Before we turn the call over to Q&A, I'd like to point out that we've included additional disclosures in our supplemental operating and financial data package this quarter that provides additional details and insight into the different components of our portfolio, as well as our joint ventures that we believe may be helpful to stakeholders."
