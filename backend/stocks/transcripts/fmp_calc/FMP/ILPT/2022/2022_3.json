    "content": " As of September 30, 2022, ILPT's consolidated portfolio included 413 warehouse and distribution properties in 39 states, totaling approximately 60 million square feet with a weighted average remaining lease term of approximately nine years. During the third quarter, we entered new and renewal leases for approximately 1.7 million square feet at weighted average rental rates that were nearly 77.5% higher than prior rental rates for the same space, reflecting record quarterly leasing spreads. As Brian will discuss later in the call, we recorded a bad debt reserve of $1.2 million this quarter related to one tenant, which leaves three parcels within our  portfolio in Hawaii. Renewal activity was also strong with nine executed leases for approximately 1.1 million square feet, primarily on the Mainland and an average roll up in rent of 26.1% with a weighted average lease term of 3.7 years. The major drivers impacting normalized FFO over the prior year quarter was higher interest expense, partially offset by a $38 million increase in NOI, primarily from the Monmouth portfolio. Interest expense increased $80.7 million over the prior year quarter, including a $45.6 million increase in cash interest expense and a $35.5 million of non-cash amortization of financing fees, of which $31.4 million was related to the bridge loan facility that we paid off at the end of the quarter. Assuming short-term interest rates continue to rise and our caps remain in the money, our current quarterly cash interest expense run rate is approximately $59 million."
