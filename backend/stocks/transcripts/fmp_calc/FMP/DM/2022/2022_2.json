    "content": " Consolidated revenue for the second quarter 2022 was $57.7 million, representing strong year-over-year growth of over 200% and sequential growth of 32% from the first quarter 2022. On the next slide, non-GAAP operating expenses were $46.1 million for the second quarter of 2022, representing 80% as a percentage of revenue, which is a significant improvement versus 162% in the second quarter of 2021. As we expected, adjusted EBITDA significantly improved sequentially by $14.1 million, or 34%, from the first quarter of 2022 through a combination of revenue growth and a focus on improving our expense spend. As we continue proactive efforts to optimize our expense structure while maintaining revenue growth at scale, we expect to see significant improvement in adjusted EBITDA through the end of the year to achieve our adjusted EBITDA commitments for 2022 on our way to exiting 2023 breakeven on an adjusted EBITDA basis. And we announced a specific focused strategic initiative that will continue this progress, including $20 million in cost savings in the second half of 2022 and over $100 million over the next 24 months."
