    "content": " Software integrity at a very good start to the year crossing the $400 million trailing 12-month revenue special, with strong growth across product groups consulting and geographies. We delivered a very strong start to the year with significant revenue growth across all product groups and geographies, expanded --expanding non GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP earnings at the high end of our target range and solid operating cash flow. When we look at your segment results, if we strip out from the IP and Systems Integration segment, what we think your hardware business may have been, it looks like your annualized run-rate for IP in Q1 was well north of $1.5 billion as compared to the $1.1 billion-$1.2 billion coming out of Q4."
