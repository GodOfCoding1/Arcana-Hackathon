Also, as announced in February, I am very pleased to highlight that we have entered into a second agreement with Nippon Shinyaku for the distribution rights to CAP-1002 for Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy in Japan, pursuant to which we expect to receive a $12 million upfront payment and will potentially receive additional milestone payments of up to approximately $89 million and a meaningful double digit share of net product revenue."
