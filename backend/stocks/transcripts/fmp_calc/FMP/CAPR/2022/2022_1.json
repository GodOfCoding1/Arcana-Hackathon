In the first quarter of 2022, our net cash provided by operating activities was approximately $24 million, driven by the $30 million upfront payment from Nippon Shinyaku. For the first quarter of 2022, excluding stock-based compensation, our research and development expense was approximately $4.9 million compared to approximately $3.2 million in Q1 2021."
