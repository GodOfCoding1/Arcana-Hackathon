    "content": " As Hessam stated, revenue for the fourth quarter was $262 million, compared to last year's record quarter of $495 million. Real estate brokerage revenue for the fourth quarter was $236 million, or 90% of total revenue, a similar percentage to historical levels. Within brokerage, our core private client market segment in the fourth quarter accounted for 61.7% of brokerage revenue, or $146 million. Our middle market and larger transaction segments together contributed revenue of $85 million or 36.1% of total brokerage revenue for the quarter compared to $199 million last year, as many institutional buyers remained on the sidelines in Q4, waiting for more clarity on interest rates and pricing before reentering the market. For the full year, revenue from our Private Client market segment of $682 million was down 2% and the combined revenue of $463 million from middle market and larger transactions was up 4%. Turning to our financing division MMCC, revenue came in at $22 million in the fourth quarter compared to $34 million in the prior year. Other revenue comprised primarily of consulting and advisory fees, along with referral fees was $5 million for the quarter, consistent with the fourth quarter last year. Total operating expense for the fourth quarter was $257 million, compared to $413 million a year ago, a decrease of 38%. Cost of services for the fourth quarter was $181 million or 68.9% of revenue, an increase of 160 basis points year-over-year. SG&A during the fourth quarter was $73 million, a decrease of 5.7% year-over-year, primarily due to lower employee compensation expense tied to company performance, partially offset by higher sales support costs. For the full year, SG&A was up 17.6% to $300 million, which as a percentage of revenue was an increase of 330 basis points over the prior year to 23%."
