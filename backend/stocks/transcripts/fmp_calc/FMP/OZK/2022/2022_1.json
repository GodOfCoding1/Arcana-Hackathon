    "content": " More and more of these loans are going to get off their floors and become actively variable in their pricing in the quarters ahead, it would seem, assuming the Fed goes through with its plan to raise rates, that\u2019s going to become a much more significant percentage of them that will be actively variable much sooner. Our GGL business, government-guaranteed lending business which primarily SBA has been diverted, as we mentioned, for their attention for the last couple of years with getting all the PPP loans booked for our customers to help our customers and then getting all those PPP loans paid off, and we are getting towards the end of that, and that\u2019s letting us get those guys refocused on their bread and butter day-to-day mission of originating more 7A and 504 loans in our community banking markets in Arkansas, Texas, Florida, Georgia and North Carolina."
