    "content": " We would expect and Cindy referenced that lag in her comments, we would expect to most likely continue to see loan yields outrun deposit costs early in the cycle and then late in the cycle when the loan pricing changes are pretty much all priced and the Fed's about to stop or has stopped deposit cost as CDs roll over, we'll tend to catch up. And that really wasn't because we needed those deposits, but our wholesale funding guys were monitoring the market, and they got an opportunity to add several hundred million dollars at -- have some term to them and that had relatively favorable rates, and they looked at it and thought it was an opportunistic time to take advantage, capitalize on an opportunity there in the market. And so as we move through the next couple of months as the baseline changes -- as the baseline perhaps kind of moves a little bit closer to the adverse or worsens a little bit, is it -- does that mean there's less risk for you to have a larger CECL reserve build because you've already got so much weighted towards an adverse scenario that likely won't change."
