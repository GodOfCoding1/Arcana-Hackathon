    "content": " Given our increased visibility, we are now narrowing our full year 2022 revenue guidance to $81 million to $82 million which will represent 40% revenue growth from 2021 to 2022 at the midpoint. Third quarter revenues were $18.8 million, a 29% increase over the $14.5 million in the third quarter of 2021. We also saw growth in adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter which was $3.1 million, a 37% increase from the $2.2 million in the third quarter of 2021. That said, operating expenses for the third quarter were offset by contingent consideration adjustment, a reduction of approximately $5.4 million related to the potential earn-out payments associated with Forensic Logic acquisition which have been reduced for 2022 and 2023 due to a delay in some expected contracts from Forensic Logic. This compares to a loss of $940,000  or a loss of $0.08 per share based on 11.7 million basic and diluted weighted average shares outstanding for the prior year period. Our adjusted net income for the third quarter was a loss of $1.4 million or a loss of $0.11 per share based on 12.2 million and 12.4 million basic and diluted weighted average shares outstanding, respectively. This compares to a loss of $940,000  or a loss of $0.08 per share based on 11.7 million basic and diluted weighted average shares outstanding for the prior year period. For 2023, we expect revenues of $94 million to $96 million, representing an increase of 17% at the midpoint compared to the midpoint of the 2022 guidance range. Sure, this is Alan. Yes, this is Alan. Yes, this is Alan. Sure, this is Alan. Sure, this is Alan."
