    "content": " We reported record revenues of $21.2 million, up 41% from Q1 of 2021, and had a quarterly adjusted EBITDA of $4.5 million, up 35% year-over-year. We're maintaining our previous full year 2022 revenue guidance of $81 million to $83 million, representing 41% revenue growth from 2021 to 2022 while increasing our adjusted EBITDA margin expectation from 15% to 20% to 19% to 21%. First quarter revenues were ahead of expectations at $21.2 million, an impressive 41% increase over the $15 million in the first quarter of 2021. We also saw impressive growth in adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter, which is $4.5 million, a 35% increase from the $3.3 million in the first quarter of 2021. Our adjusted net income for the first quarter was $488,000 or $0.04 per share based on 12.2 million basic and 12.3 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding. Deferred revenue at the end of the quarter increased to $35.5 million from $26.7 million at the end of fourth quarter 2021, and the increase was primarily related to our growth in revenues and the addition of Forensic Logic deferred revenue. We are maintaining our full year revenue guidance at $81 million to $83 million, and we are increasing our expected adjusted EBITDA margin from 15% to 20% to 19% to 21% of revenues. Yes, this is Alan. Although that's appearing to look very strong for us in 2022, we're going to expect to see more contribution of revenue coming from opportunities outside of domestic ShotSpotter Respond. Yes, this is Alan. So there's definitely nominal growth, but I would expect it to grow at a slower rate than top line revenue because I think we're at a fairly normalized place right now with the headcount that we've added both in marketing as well as sales to basically drive a much more robust solution set."
