    "content": " Alan will go through the numbers in more detail but looking forward, we are maintaining our full year revenue guidance for 2022 at $81 million to $83 million, which is 41% year-over-year growth at the midpoint. Second quarter revenues were slightly ahead of expectations at $20 million, a 37% increase over the $14.6 million in the second quarter of 2021. Gross profit for the second quarter of 2022 was $11.6 million or 58% of revenue versus $8.3 million or 57% of revenue for the prior year period. We also saw impressive growth in adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter, which was $4.1 million, a 39% increase from the $2.9 million in the second quarter of 2021. That said operating expenses for the second quarter were offset by a contingent consideration adjustment, a reduction of approximately $3.4 million related to the potential earn-out payments associated with our Forensic Logic acquisition, which have been reduced for 2022 but increased for 2023 due to a delay in some expected contracts. Breaking down our expenses, sales and marketing expense for the second quarter was $5.8 million or 29% of total revenue versus $3.9 million or 27% of total revenue for the prior year period. Our R&D expenses for the second quarter were $2.5 million or 13% of total revenue, compared to $1.7 million or 12% of total revenue for the prior year period. G&A expenses for the quarter were approximately $100,000 or less than 1% of total revenue, compared to $2.8 million or 19% of total revenue for the prior year period. Our GAAP net income was $3 million or $0.25 per basic share and $0.24 per diluted share for the quarter based on 12.1 and $12.3 million basic and diluted weighted average shares outstanding, respectively. This compares to a loss of $250,000 or a loss of $0.02 per share based on $11.6 million basic and diluted weighted average shares outstanding for the prior year period. Our adjusted net income for the second quarter was a loss of $427,000 or a loss of $0.04 per share based on 12.1 million basic and diluted weighted average shares outstanding. This compares to a loss of $244,000 or a loss of $0.02 per share based on 11.6 million basic and diluted weighted average shares outstanding for the prior year period. During the second quarter we also repurchased 49,369 of our shares at an average price of $29.35 or approximately $1.45 million."
