    "content": "   Company Representatives: Jimmy Levin - Chief Investment Officer, Chief Executive Officer Wayne Cohen - President, Chief Operating Officer Dava Ritchea - Chief Financial Officer Ellen Conti - Head of Corporate Strategy\n Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Sculpture Capital\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Third Quarter of 2022 Earnings Conference Call. Our real estate funds, obviously in the private markets things moved more slowly, but the hallmark of our real estate business since its inception has been a differentiated approach and that the vast majority of the capital we deploy is into what we call niche asset classes; gaming, ski resorts, cell towers, special types of housing assets. So while relative outperformance sets us up well for the future, obviously we still generated negative P&L in the quarter, but this is what happens in markets like these and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what allows us to demonstrate our skill set, largely protect capital and set up the opportunity sets of the future. Having that balance sheet that we have today, in times like this we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re remembering why we spent years and years building that balance sheet back up, because it is allowing us to again play defense to weather what are very tough market conditions, and still allow us to do opportunistic things like continue a buyback program at levels that we think are very attractive long term."
