    "content": " And that's been driven by a material rise in rates, a material widening in spreads, and then maybe what is harder to detect from looking at general information, a pretty significant widening in the illiquidity or complexity premium over rates and spreads, which oftentimes is where we focus our investments, both in our credit funds, our real estate funds, our multi-strategy funds, really across the board. And as we enter a world where things like recession, inflation, rising rates continue to remain at the forefront the need for capital from corporates, from real estate owners from assets in general tends to be quite acute, and that's great for capital providers like us who can be flexible and dynamic in the face of some of those difficulties. And we view 75 as a reasonable upper bound guidance because we want to be able to continue to retain earnings so that we have the ability to play offense, whether that means seeding new businesses, creating new products or as we're doing now, if there's great times to be repurchasing our stock, then we want to have that capital available as well. It's very hard to pinpoint a specific thing or a specific timing, which is why we generally try to highlight, and I think we did this in the prior quarter, look at a 5- or 6- or 7- or 8-year analysis of what those gross and net flows looked like, then look at what they started to look like in 2021 once we had accomplished those various items I just laid out, and then look at how that continues into 2022."
