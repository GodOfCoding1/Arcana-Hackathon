    "content": " In the first quarter, Neustar generated $150 million of revenue, up 9% in total, with another quarter of double-digit growth in marketing and at a margin of nearly 25%. We expect the business to deliver low double-digit revenue growth beginning in '23 and beyond, and we're expecting roughly $160 million of adjusted EBITDA in '22, which would imply a 25% margin. And based on the existing momentum in the business and the ongoing integration, Sontiq is currently trending ahead of the plan, and we expect mid-teens revenue growth for 2022, excluding integration costs, at a nearly 40% margin. So full year revenue excluding mortgage on an organic constant currency basis is expected to increase 10% to 12%, a 100 basis point increase over the guidance that we provided during our February earnings call driven by the first quarter outperformance and our improving full year outlook. Neustar and Verisk Financial Services currently carry a significantly lower margin profile than TransUnion, where Sontiq primarily does have a margin similar to TransUnion's, but right now, it's being weighed down by normal integration costs to make Sontiq part of the business as it continues to grow. And we -- as that business continues to grow, which it did grow 9% in the quarter and we're expecting it to grow high single digits, there's a nice flow-through there, but don't forget also about the cost synergies that we committed to, which are $70 million, which we believe by the end of 2023, we will secure roughly about 80% or so of those synergies. But I think what's most important to take away from the materials today is that, yes, margin was lower in Q1, but what we've committed to for the full year is to get the margin back to 37.4% before the Verisk Financial Services acquisition is included."
