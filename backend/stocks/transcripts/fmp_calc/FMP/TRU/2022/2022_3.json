    "content": " To wrap up, Neustar's adjusted EBITDA margins margin was about 29% in the third quarter, driven by revenue growth and our cost reduction initiatives. Our adjusted EBITDA margin was 36.3%, down 430 basis points compared to the year ago quarter, driven primarily by Neustar's lower margin profile. Excluding the Neustar, Sontiq, and Argus acquisitions, the margin would've been 38.6%, down about 200 basis points compared to the year ago third quarter. Excluding mortgage, organic constant currency revenue growth was 9%, despite 31% growth in the third quarter of 2021, implying a 20% two-year growth CAGR. Looking at the individual end markets, consumer lending continues to be strong as high levels of activity persisted throughout the quarter, leading to 10% growth on top of almost 60% in the year ago quarter. Insurance delivered another good quarter with mid single digit growth, despite the slowdown in marketing, Chris described and building on a very strong year ago quarter when revenue was up more than 20%."
