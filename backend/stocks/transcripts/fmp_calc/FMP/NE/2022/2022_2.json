    "content": " Here in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, there were approximately 2 rig years contracted during the quarter, mostly comprised of options and extensions for follow-on work and the region continues to produce leading-edge rates with UDW rates now in the range of $400,000 per day. Speaking more specifically about the Noble fleet in the Gulf of Mexico, the Noble Faye Kozack was awarded a 1-well contract by LLOG at a rate of $420,000 per day, which includes managed pressure drilling services and approximates $400,000 per day on a clean basis. One is, does location matter in terms of thinking about whether there is going to be I think you mentioned whitespace in between contracts starting up, i.e., is it hey, we should be thinking about a 30 to 60-day kind of air pocket or are we now in a market that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tight enough where we should be thinking more about that more of a bull market continuation of rig utilization?"
