    "content": " We remain confident that we are in the early stages of a multi-year upturn in offshore drilling and with deepwater day rates already well into low to mid $400,000 per day and with limited inventory of stacked rigs that can come back into the market. Next, the drillship Noble Voyager had a six month option taken up by Shell with the base operating day rate increasing from $295,000 on the current contract up to $422,000 starting in April, 2023 with a drilling program in Mexico. Among our deepwater semis, the Noble Developer was awarded a one well contract with Shell in Brazil at $411,000 per day, including mobilization, which commits that rig into the middle of next year."
