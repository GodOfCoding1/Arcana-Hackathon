    "content": " While we expect the peak number of 10-year SPSs drive CapEx in 2024 to a level somewhat higher than 2023 with our schedule currently showing 10 major projects in 2024, our plan is to achieve five-year average annual CapEx in the $275 million area between 2023 and 2027 as the 10-year surveys taper off after 2024. And so, as we said \u00e2\u0080\u0093 I didn't repeat it in the script today, but we have said previous and we do hold to the idea that, where we sit in 2023, in the bids that we're considering, we would be looking to get a significant portion of that $100 million upfront, so that we can maintain our cash flow story, which I think is unique to Noble. But I think there's very much a path where we could see a fixture this year that's above $500,000 and even more confident in that if you include kind of a total contract value analysis of what an operator ultimately is going to need to pay for a rig this year. And so, therefore, I think you should expect in a rising rig demand market, essentially, the inflationary pressures that we're seeing in that high single digit type area to continue both \u00e2\u0080\u0093 obviously, in 2023, but also through 2024 as well."
