We're very encouraged by the progress we're making in the other side of our digital business, the Interactive, or iGaming part, Interactive revenue grew 24% on a functional currency basis in Q4 compared to Q4 of 2021, this growth comes with Inspired still not live yet, as Lorne mentioned, with FanDuel, who are approximately 20% of the U.S. iGaming market. Yes, I mean it's a great question, and honestly, the content teams, if you had seen what we've done at ICE, really across the whole business, they really are kind of hitting on all cylinders, but at some point, we're going to run into -- particularly if we gain some momentum in the iLottery content space, where we're probably going to have to add capacity in terms of content."
