    "content": " At a high level, Q3 was overall very similar to Q2 with strong performance in new logos and new product attach activities tempered by growth of user from existing customers that further healthy was below our long-term historical average. First of all, everything that is related to direct transactions with customers, whether it's new logos or new products, all of that is actually working great, but the demand we can see there is as strong as we've seen it. We see -- we have -- we mentioned earlier, thousands of customers will not give the products, the customer business is growing fast, the revenue is growing fast, but it's not like growth for grow in the end, typically this product is very fast. And the one we actually get also is -- it's tougher to grow customers very fast when they're growing with us a lot over the past few years when customers have grown in the 80% year-over-year, 30% year-over-year through all these years, they may go away before after that. One moment for the next question. One moment for the next question. One moment for the next question. One moment for the next question. One moment for the next question."
