    "content": " Before we go inside to hear prepared remarks, I'll share a few details about today's webcast. Geoff and Karen will provide comments on the results of our fourth quarter and fiscal year 2022, which ended on April 29, 2022, and our outlook for fiscal year \u201823. After our prepared remarks, our portfolio executive VPs will join us and we'll take questions from the sell side analysts that cover the company. During today's program, many of the statements we make may be considered forward-looking statements and actual results may differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements. And revenue comparisons are made on an organic basis, which this quarter includes only adjustments for foreign currency as there were no acquisitions or divestitures made in the last four quarters that had a significant impact on total company or individual segment quarterly revenue growth. And all references to share gains or losses refer to revenue share in the first calendar quarter of 2022 compared to the first calendar quarter of 2021, unless otherwise stated. And finally, our EPS guidance does not include any charges or gains that would be reported as non-GAAP adjustments to earnings during the fiscal year. With that, let's head into this studio and get started. Now there were parts of the quarter that played out as anticipated, and there were also some unexpected challenges more than I would have liked, which caused us to come up short of our expectations. However, we faced challenges related to supply chain in China that impacted some of our businesses, and were the largest contributors to our shortfall. Now, I\u2019ll get into more detail on these challenges shortly, but you should take away that we understand the root causes, and we are well down the path to addressing them. And to be prudent however, we've assumed that these challenges will persist for the next quarter or two in the guidance of Karen is going to walk you through shortly. China, where the extended COVID lockdowns affected our results in the quarter, particularly in April, and global supply chain challenges. However, this quarter one of our largest businesses, Surgical Innovations, was adversely affected by certain raw material shortages. Several of our other businesses also face supply challenges in the quarter, but to a lesser extent. And we're leveraging the expertise that Greg Smith, our new Global Ops and Supply Chain leader brings from the retail consumer product and automotive industries. Greg and his team are making progress addressing the areas where we can improve, including the management and resiliency of our critical suppliers and manufacturing network. We have a new global structure in place that consolidates operations and supply chain functions, which were previously fragmented throughout the organization. While some of our Q4 challenges will persist in the near term, we expect strong improvement in the back half of our fiscal year. We're committed to creating strong returns for our shareholders, and we're making progress with our enhanced portfolio management and our capital allocation processes. We're investing in future growth drivers, while at the same time returning capital primarily through our meaningful and growing dividend, which we just increased again today by 8%. Regarding portfolio management, we are continuing to advance the robust process we began talking about earlier this year. And within that, and as a smaller initial step, we're pleased to announce that we've reached an agreement where we will contribute our Renal Care Solutions business into a new company, which we will jointly own with DaVita. The new company is going to develop a broad suite of novel kidney care solutions, including home-based products. First, this business is going to have the focus that it needs. Second, DaVita is a global leader in kidney care and will be a great partner to commercialize and scale this innovative technology. And finally, both Medtronic and DaVita will participate in the expected upside. Now turning to market share, product availability affected our performance in the quarter with our overall company share down about a half a point. On the bright side, even with our challenges, half of our businesses held or gain share. And as you know, market share is an important metric for us at Medtronic as it is a driver of our annual variable compensation, along with revenue growth, profit, and free cash flow. Well, I won't go through market share business by business in the interest of time, we'll be happy to take questions in Q&A. Now, let's cover our product pipeline, where we're advancing several meaningful technologies that can create new markets, disrupt existing ones, and accelerate the growth profile of Medtronic. We make great strides with organic pipeline in fiscal \u201822, conducting over 300 clinical trials and receiving over 200 regulatory approvals in the U.S., Europe, Japan and China. And as we look ahead, we have increasing visibility to upcoming catalysts in the back half of the calendar year that we expect will help accelerate our growth as we go through fiscal \u201823 and beyond. Starting with our Cardiovascular Portfolio and Cardiac Rhythm Management, recently launched Leadless Pacemakers, including our Micra AV in Japan and Micra VR in China led to above-market growth again this quarter. In ICDs, we're preparing to disrupt the single-chamber market with our Aurora extravascular ICD. In Cardiac Ablation Solutions, we've been assembling a number of technologies to increase our impact in the $8 billion EP ablation market, building on our leadership in cryoablation. In renal denervation, data from our SPYRAL HTN-ON MED pilot study were presented last month at ACC and simultaneously published in the Lancet. And last week, additional data were presented at EuroPCR which showed those receiving already and spend significantly more time in target blood pressure range, adding to our robust body of evidence. In Q4, we also announced that we completed enrollment in the full cohort of patients in the ON MED study, which we expect to complete the six-month follow-up in the second half of this calendar year. In Structural Heart, differentiated durability data for our TAVR valves were presented as a late breaker at ACC last month. Additionally, durability data were presented from a separate UK registry, the first to look at TAVR data past 10 years. And data at EuroPCR last week reinforced our excellent clinical outcomes with our cusp overlap implant technique, including one-day hospital discharge, single-digit pacemaker rates and the absence of moderate or severe PBL. In the quarter, we also continued to launch Evolut PRO+ in Europe and began the launch of Evolut Pro in China, our first entry into this large and underpenetrated market. In the U.S., we're planning to start the limited market release of our next-generation TAVR valve, Evolut FX here in our first fiscal quarter and move into full market release later in the fiscal year. We had first enrollment earlier this month in our EXPAND TAVR 2 pivotal trial, evaluating our TAVR platform in patients with moderate symptomatic aortic stenosis. Overall, TAVR represents a large growth driver for Medtronic as we expect this roughly $5.5 billion market to exceed $7 billion within the next three years and reach $10 billion in the next five years. Moving to our MedSurg portfolio and Surgical Robotics, we remain focused on the limited market release of our Hugo robot while we scale production. In our Patient Monitoring business, - we just received FDA clearance earlier this month for our next-generation Nellcor OxySoft pulse ox sensor. In Neuromodulation, we're building our commercial teams and have started the initial launch of our Intellis and Vanta spinal cord stimulators to treat diabetic peripheral neuropathy. We believe DPN is one of the largest opportunities in medtech, and we expect the market to reach $300 million by FY '26, with an annual total addressable market of up to $2 billion. And we're also excited about our Inceptiv ECAP\u2019s closed loop spinal cord stimulator, which we submitted to the FDA late last calendar year. In Brain Modulation, our ongoing launch of the Percept PC neurostimulator and SenSight directional leads is driving new implant share in both Europe and the U.S. And this is the only system that can stimulate and sense brain signals. In Pelvic Health, we received FDA approval of our next-gen InterStim recharge-free device, InterStim X, and that was happened in the fourth quarter. In Diabetes, our MiniMed 780G insulin pump, combined with our Guardian 4 sensor continues to be extremely well received in markets where it's available. Very strong data on 780G and Guardian 4 were presented at ATTD last month, showing improved time and range with less user interaction. And we also announced that Germany and France began reimbursement of our system in the quarter, which helped drive high-teens sequential international growth in diabetes. In our CGM pipeline, we expect to submit our next generation sensor, Simplera, for CE Mark and FDA approval this summer. In addition, we're advancing multiple next gen sensor and pump programs, including patch pumps. And with that, I'll turn it over to Karen to discuss our fourth quarter financial performance, and our new guidance for the next fiscal year. Our fourth quarter organic revenue increased 1.4%, below our guidance and consensus. Compared to consensus, about 15% of the difference can be attributed to China, given recent COVID shutdowns and slowing distributor purchases in spine ahead of a potential national volume based tender. Despite revenue coming in roughly $350 million less than we expected, we reduced the impact that this would have had on our bottom line, resulting in EPS of $1.52, $0.04 below our guidance range. From a geographic perspective, our U.S. revenue declined 2%. Within emerging markets, China declined 10%, given the impact of the COVID lockdowns. But we had very strong growth in many other emerging markets, including high-teens growth in Eastern Europe, low-20s growth in Latin America, low-30s growth in the Middle East and Africa, and mid-30s growth in South Asia. Turning to our margins, our fourth quarter adjusted gross margin improved by 30 basis points year-over-year, driven by product mix with lower sales of ventilators and higher sales of products like Micra. While we were impacted by inflation with increased freight expense, it's worth noting that the full impact from inflation on raw material and direct labor costs will be realized over the next couple of quarters as our inventory rolls off our balance sheet, negatively affecting our gross margin. Moving down the P&L, we also drove additional and continued improvement in our adjusted operating margin, which increased by 40 basis points, excluding the benefit from currency. We also ended the year with free cash flow at $6 billion, representing year-over-year growth of 22% and meeting our goal of 80% conversion from adjusted net income. Our balance sheet remains strong, and we continue to allocate our capital to investments that we expect will generate solid future growth and shareholder returns. We're investing heavily in R&D, with programs especially targeted for faster growing medtech markets or where we have an opportunity to create new markets. We're also using our balance sheet to complement our innovation-driven growth strategy with tuck-in M&A, utilizing our very active capital committee process that was developed as part of our new operating model. In fiscal '22, we announced four acquisitions totaling over $2.1 billion in total consideration. As Geoff mentioned, we closed our acquisition of Intersect ENT earlier this month, and also announced our intent to acquire a left heart access portfolio last month. At the same time, we're investing in promising early stage ventures to keep our fingers on the pulse of new products and technologies, incubated by companies that one day could become future acquisitions. We're also actively providing strong return to our shareholders, returning $5.5 billion in fiscal '22 through our dividend and net share repurchase. And this morning, we announced that we're increasing our dividend by 8%, reflecting the confidence we and our board have in our financial strength and future earnings power. We are an S&P Dividend Aristocrat, having increased our dividend for 45 years now. This past year, we paid $3.4 billion in dividends and we're supplementing that through opportunistic share repurchase, particularly in periods where we see share price dislocation. In fact, we repurchased over 2.5 billion of our stock in fiscal '22, including 1.4 billion in the fourth quarter. While the impact of currency is fluid, if recent exchange rates hold, foreign currency would have a negative impact on full year revenue of $1 billion to $1.1 billion. By segment, we expect Cardiovascular to grow 5.5% to 6.5%; Medical Surgical to grow 3.5% to 4.5%; Neuroscience to grow 5% to 6%; and Diabetes to decline 6% to 7%, all on an organic basis. While we are hopeful that we can receive approval for 780G and Guardian 4 Sensor in the United States, we've elected not to include it in our guidance. In the first quarter, we would have you model organic revenue to decline in the range of 4.5% to 5.5%, which conservatively assumes no near term improvement in our supply chain and no major change to underlying fundamentals. Assuming recent exchange rates hold, the first quarter would have a currency headwind between $350 million and $400 million. By segment, we expect Cardiovascular to decline 1% to 2%; Medical Surgical to decline 7.5% to 8.5%; Neuroscience to be down 5% to 6%; and Diabetes down 8% to 10%, all on an organic basis. Moving down the P&L, I provided early color for fiscal '23 on the last quarterly earnings call, where I talked about the expected impact of inflation, wages, acquisition dilution and foreign exchange headwinds. These still hold, but we've also seen environmental changes since late-February. Inflation and foreign exchange rates have become larger headwinds, and we're now factoring in continued supply chain challenges early in the year. Inflation and FX pressures also create near-term challenges on our margins, although we continue to look for opportunities to offset them. At the same time, we continue to prioritize our long-term investments in organic R&D, with a focus on large opportunities in future growth markets, like renal denervation, robotics, diabetic peripheral neuropathy and transcatheter mitral valves. Taking this all into account on the bottom line, we expect non-GAAP diluted EPS in the range of $5.53 to $5.65 in fiscal '23, which includes an unfavorable impact of $0.20 to $0.25 from currency at recent rates, for the first quarter, we expect EPS of $1.10 to $1.14, including an FX headwind of about $0.05 at current rates. Before I send it back to Geoff, I want to thank our employees around the globe who are working hard to overcome the macro challenges we face. While we spent a lot of time covering the fourth quarter, it's worth briefly reflecting on what we've accomplished in fiscal '22. It's certainly been a difficult environment, and our organization has enacted big changes in such a short period of time and under unique circumstances to better position the company. It was our first full year in the new operating model, and with our enhanced Medtronic mindset of acting boldly, competing to win, moving with speed and decisiveness, fostering, belonging and delivering results the right way. Even with that, we're committed to improving through innovative programs to attract, develop and retain top talent from all gender and ethnic backgrounds. Along those lines, we've made notable hires in fiscal '22, recruiting great talent from healthcare technology industry and beyond. While we've implemented a number of changes, this past year has been choppier than I would have liked with some of our growth drivers being pushed out and the impact from the pandemic, quality challenges and supply chain affecting our results. But we have a clear direction, a clear direction where we're headed as we transform the company. You're seeing our efforts to enhance our future growth through greater investment in organic R&D, as well as portfolio moves. We've already spoken of the organic growth catalysts in front of us, many coming later this fiscal year. We're also executing a healthy cadence of tuck-in acquisitions in faster-growing markets, and we're focused on reducing our footprint in lower growth and lower-margin businesses. We continue to work on additional portfolio moves with the goal of creating a portfolio where we have distinct expertise, synergies across the company and ultimately, higher growth and higher margins. And to aid this effort, we've assembled a dedicated team that is 100% focused on our integrations and divestitures. At the same time, we have the opportunity to improve our global supply chain and operations by centralizing these activities, allowing us to leverage our scale, invest in new technology and ensure we have world-class supply chain experts responsible for our global operations. Although recent challenges have given us a greater sense of urgency, we've been on this journey for over a year. And while it will take time, I fully expect our efforts to drive lower cost and lead to consistent and reliable quality along with greater product availability, all on a sustainable basis. Now well beyond healthcare, our world is facing a lot of economic uncertainty with questions around inflation, global supply chain challenges and continued impacts from the pandemic and a potential recession. But our business, the business of health care and the delivery of essential lifesaving technology is something that continues in good times and uncertain times like these. When you look at healthcare technology, Medtronic is uniquely situated, particularly in these uncertain times, given our diversified businesses with leading market positions in growth markets, a robust product pipeline, solid free cash flow, strong balance sheet, and a very attractive and growing dividend to add to our return to shareholders. We are fully focused on continuing on our transformation journey and making our opportunities a reality as we alleviate pain, restore health and extend life for millions of people around the world. I also want to thank our partners in health care, the frontline workers who are at that final step in ensuring patients get our therapies and are dedicating their lives day in and day out. We're going to try to get as many analysts as possible, so we ask that you limit yourself to just one question and only if needed, a related follow-up. For today's session, Jeff, Karen and Ryan are joined by Sean Salmon, EVP and President of the Cardiovascular portfolio and former Head of the Diabetes operating unit; Bob White, EVP and President of the Medical Surgical portfolio; and Brett Wall, EVP and President of the neuroscience portfolio. Geoff and Karen, maybe I had a two part question. When I look at the 4 to 5 organic guide for fiscal '23, perhaps it came in slightly better than expected. Can you talk about some specific assumptions around even -- you noted supply chain, there were some back orders. And Geoff, related to that, I think if I take a step back, the Medtronic pieces of mid-singles up high singles earnings. Well, let me -- thanks for the question, Vijay. Maybe, I\u2019ll take the second part of that question, and then Karen can take the first part of the details behind the 4% to 5% for FY '23. So first of all, just over the next -- Karen can detail this, but over the next year, you'll see the acute back order issues that we faced in Q4. Those abate over the next quarter or so, and we can get into the details of that. In addition, we're definitely anniversarying a lot of things that hurt us in FY '22, like exiting the LVAD business, the Navion recall, some tough comps on our ventilator business during the height of the pandemic. So these things abate over -- these things go away over the course of the fiscal year and you're starting now, actually. And then finally, we've got a lot of growth catalysts. I went through a lot of it in the commentary, but it's much broader than like the Hugo or our soft tissue robot, and already there's some big ones, but there's a whole lot of other ones as well. And then -- so that -- those things kick in, in the second half of this year and then get even bigger in FY '24. And then finally, we've got some portfolio moves that over the next year or so, I think we'll -- that will add to this. So that's how we get from where we are to back to that, the numbers that you quoted. And we've been working hard over the last couple of years to double down on our innovation, putting more into R&D, the new operating model that we have the 20 operating units, we have a clear visibility into their end markets, their competition. People are getting evaluated on their pipeline, and we're putting more into R&D and as well as some meaningful tuck-in acquisitions, like we just mentioned Intersect ENT closing and in the cardiac ablation solutions space or the AFib space, the AFFERA acquisition. Brought in Greg Smith, as we mentioned in the commentary over a year ago and really already centralized our supply chain. So the combination of the innovation, plus some portfolio moves and just a more resilient global option supply chain. That's how we're confident that we get to the long range forecast that we talked about of consistent mid-single digits, that 5% plus, including the plus and the high-single digit EPS when you add in the dividend gets you a double-digit return. But in terms of the FY '23 guide and the details below that, I'll turn that over to Karen. Thanks, Vijay, for the question, and I'd love to take this in pieces because I want to walk you through Q1 and then also talk about the full year because we expect improvement each quarter as we move through the year. So just starting with Q1, given our recent challenges, we've elected to take a conservative approach with our Q1 guide. We're assuming underlying fundamentals are pretty similar to last quarter to Q4, and we've built in some conservatism in the supply chain. If you look at the year-over-year view, it's influenced by COVID. And so to remove that noise, I think it's really good to look at it on a COVID comp-adjusted basis. And when you do that, our guide really just implies a slight deceleration from Q4 to Q1. And again, I would just emphasize that we've included conservatism due to the supply chain. Some puts and takes that we've got in Q1, in addition to the supply chain impact that we factored in, we've also assumed some incremental pressure in spine in China ahead of a potential national volume-based purchasing tender. And Geoff already mentioned on the plus side, we anniversary some of our headwinds like the Navion recall and the LVAD shutdown. If I move beyond Q1 and then into the full year guide of the 4.5%, I mentioned we do expect improvement as we progress through the quarters with our back half much better than our first half. But for conservatism, we've elected not to assume the approval of the 780G in this guidance. And also, it's manageable, but we've got volume-based pricing in China that we believe will have a bigger impact in this fiscal year, primarily in Spine. And at the same time, Geoff talked about it, and we have a number of positives as we think about FY '23. First, we've got headwinds that are going to go away, the LVAD business, the Navion recall, the reduced ventilator sales that Geoff mentioned. Second, we expect these supply chain challenges to improve as starting in Q2 and obviously continuing to improve from there. And then thirdly, our year-over-year comps get easier, particularly in the back half. And then lastly, we've got a number of really important product launches throughout the year. And just to name a few of them, we've got Evolut FX, we've got ECAPs, we've got diabetic painful neuropathy. Thanks for taking the question. Curious how May is shaping up versus April kind of around the world, both in the U.S. and China as well. I don't know if things got a lot worse in April, or there was something specific with surgical innovations. I just want to make sure we have the confidence that, that's going to start to improve here in the next quarter or two. The supply chain issues, yeah, they did -- look, they did -- no one's more disappointed about our Q4 miss than I am. And I'd say that 75% of the miss is due to -- of the $340 million, $350 million miss is due to supply chain. 15 -- and I'll get into that in a second, maybe about 15% is due to the China lockdown and then maybe another 10% is FX getting worse, and Karen can talk about that. But in the miss, the supply chain miss, it hit us across a number of businesses, but it was definitely the most pronounced in our Surgical Innovations business. It was semiconductors, which is affecting everybody that affected a number of businesses, but particularly in our SI business. We see this getting better over the next -- the SI one is -- overall for the company, we see the supply chain issues getting abating over the next quarter or two. The SI issues probably it will take more than a quarter or so, put it on the first half of the year to get through those issues. So other than China, our emerging markets, as Karen mentioned in the commentary, grew 20%. And so these -- like I said, these acute issues, I mentioned in the commentary and one of my answers were well down the path of remaking our global ops and supply chain to provide that resiliency that we just haven't had. And we started that over a year ago, centralizing the function and bringing in some -- building a very strong leadership team under Greg, bringing in new people from different industries, investing in all kinds of whether it be tools and technology and operating mechanisms for this. So just in terms of the month of May, it's still early. So the numbers are a little cloudy, but when we look at our operating units that are not impacted by supply issues, just through the first three weeks of May, we're trending largely in-line with where we were first quarter last year. Thanks for taking the question. And Bob, maybe on Hugo, just help us understand what the expectations are for fiscal '23, the status of the supply constraints and the preop setup error, and when you expect to start the U.S. pivotal trial. Thanks for the question. On the Renal Care Solutions joint venture with DaVita, this is what I'd characterize as a smaller initial step in terms of our portfolio management work. That work continues, and we do anticipate that there could be more portfolio moves over the course of FY '22. This technology that we've been working on for years, I think DaVita, this joint venture will bring more focus to that finishing up the development. And then I think, obviously, DaVita as a leader in kidney care and will be a great partner as we commercialize and scale this innovative technology. But as we move forward, I don't know that I'm not -- the other portfolio moves would be JVs or anything like that. Our North Star is durable growth, durable growth without taking a step back on margins and free cash flow. Thanks for the question. And now we've done procedures across urology, gynecology and general surgery, including our first bariatric case, which was a nice milestone. But I'll start, maybe there was a couple of -- there's on a list there, so maybe Karen can help me out. We haven't quoted Hugo numbers for FY '23, but I'll just say we expect a strong ramp. You heard Bob just give an update about all the countries we've got approvals in and the different type of procedures that we're now doing, various type of procedures, including general surgery procedures. So we really gained a lot of confidence that we have something in Hugo, and we see a nice ramp in FY '23. In terms of the capital environment, capital for us in Q4 was a bright spot. And we're really excited as we place those or we sell those -- that capital equipment, that's just further building out our ecosystem, which is our differentiating strength in the Spine business and portrays optimism for the future of that business. The other two, you had a question on portfolio management, which I know Geoff shared when he answered Larry's question. So we've been through stents already, and some of our other industry players have gone through large joints. And we see two more potential tenders on that list where we've got exposure, spine and surgical stapling. Just to remind you, though, our gross exposure for both spine and stapling in China somewhere between 1% to 1.5% of our total company revenue. And based on what we experienced with the coronary tender, we do believe there could be offsets to the ultimate net impact number because we have pull-through of other product lines, and we'll be working on those. Thanks for taking the questions. But just with the further deceleration in fiscal 4Q, I was hoping you could share some insights in terms of why you think that's occurring. Thanks for taking the questions. I'm going to turn it over to Sean here in a second, although he has officially moved on from that role to focus exclusively on our Cardiology portfolio. She joined the company here a couple of weeks ago and has taken over our diabetes business unit, and we couldn't be really excited about having Que. She's already diving right in, she's already at ATTD, and she'll be in some other upcoming diabetes meetings that you'll get to see her. And she'll be on our next earnings call to fuel these questions, and she's getting settled in now and is moving her family out to our Northridge, California site and really excited you'll get a chance to hear from her shortly. We grew sequentially quarter-on-quarter in EMEA by 20%, high-20s. And that's really based on the strong demand for that combination of 780 and the Guardian 4 sensor, which is now in 40 different countries. So everywhere we go, it's really picked up a lot of steam this past quarter that was driven by favorable reimbursement. So within the U.S., the dynamic is obviously people waiting for the new technology to come before prescribing it for new patients or some patients not wanting to wait for it and moving on to competitive therapies. With regard to the warning letter progression, it's really -- as Karen said, we did conservatively lead that out of the guidance. But the most important thing we have to do is to improve and sustainably improve the quality system, which was outlined in those items that were in the 43 and the subsequent warning letter. And we don't want to get ahead of the FDA on timing or predictions, and that's really the reason for the conservatism, but suffice it to say, there's a huge interest from patients. And you just see the numbers going up for both revenue, as well as the data we shared, the recent ATDD meeting, the coming up ADA. It's really a robust solution, a unique solution, where we're getting kids to time and range that has never been seen before. And of course, it's worked for adults too at the highest time in range debt reported. So we're very confident that when we get the solution out, we'll turn the boat around. So when I take a look at your guidance, you've got what, in your words are or is a pretty conservative first quarter, and then it ramps pretty aggressively throughout the remainder of the year. I know you don't like to give quarterly guidance, but just to sort of level set us so that we're not resetting the quarters as we go along. And if you can just sort of give a classic like X percent in the first quarter, Y in the second quarter, et cetera, that would be really helpful. And then obviously, we expect our biggest supply challenges this quarter and starting to improve in second quarter. And by the time you get to the back half, our year-over-year comps obviously get easier. And particularly in the fourth quarter, particularly in MedSurg, given the fourth quarter that we had. So think of strongest growth, obviously, in the fourth quarter as you ramp. We've got some product launches that are helping us earlier in the year, and then more that will ramp as we go through the year. And then for my second question, renal denervation you've completed the enrollment of the last piece of the puzzle. This question is sort of pretty hard to answer, but I'll ask it anyway. But at this stage, we've built our view of it into the guidance for the first quarter, and we do believe it's a transient issue getting better after the first quarter. I mean look, I think we both -- the transaction revolves around a big piece of the value creation will be us bringing some innovative home dialysis technologies to the market that the inherent in that technology is some something that we picked up from other businesses in Medtronic and the IP around it and the know-how. It drives up access, it lowers costs and there's a better patient experience. And so DaVita brings one, that channel that access to these customers, and they have a lot of -- obviously, they're a leader in kidney care, so they bring a lot of clinical expertise as well. In terms of the other question the organic -- \n It's about the growth in renal care, Pito, and it was low-single digits for us last fiscal year. It is a lower growth, lower margin business for us. Well, thanks for the questions, everyone. And look, I realize there's a lot to sort through here, including the macro issues of supply chain and China that surprises this quarter. It gets back to the some of the questions earlier like Vijay posed, in terms of us getting to that mid-single digit, 5% plus and the double-digit shareholder returns on a consistent basis. The things that we're doing, the new operating model that's driving the more innovation-driven growth the capital allocation and portfolio management to reposition our portfolio for higher growth. And finally, the global operations and supply chain changes that we\u2019ve working on to provide that resiliency and provide that consistency that we need -- these are the right things to do. I'm confident -- I mean the macro environment has made it choppier to execute on these things, but we're heading in the right direction. So we're looking forward to update you on the progress in our Q1 earnings program, which we anticipate owning on August 23."
