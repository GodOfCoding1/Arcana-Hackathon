    "content": " We\u2019re getting good evidence around that this is working in terms of the pace of our product launches and some of these product launches coming much faster than we anticipated, like we talked about \u2013 and I talked about in the commentary like in our Pain Stim market with DPN, diabetic peripheral neuropathy approval or \u2013 and I can go off a couple of other lists, our ECAP submission for pain. Thank you so much. But the few hundred basis point impact on EPS, you mentioned from FX and some other items, dilution from Affera, just to put a finer point on it, that\u2019s inclusive of the Diabetes impact And also just to make sure we have the math right, that\u2019s somewhere in the range of $0.15, $0.15 to $0.20 or something like that of a headwind from those items? Thank you so much. Thank you so much. Thank you so much. Thank you so much."
