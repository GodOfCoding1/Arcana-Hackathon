    "content": " But if we have a look at the, first of all, the shipments, start with the steel shipments, we can see that the first half of the year, yes, it was strong, stable demand, volumes still growing and then we can see the lower demand on the second half of the year and mainly in the European market, as Martin already indicated, U.S. holding up better and emerging markets as well. The weak market we expect to see and see is construction, of course, both dependent on seasonality, but also on higher interest rates and much lower construction activity, especially in the Nordics, but I would say, even in Poland and other parts where we are present with Ruukki Construction. And what we are doing also within Special Steels we are moving the mix, and we have some products that are profitable, and we have some products that are extremely profitable and we are, I mean, launching now new products like Hardox HiTuf, Hardox 500 and they are starting to ramp up and we are introducing \u00e2\u0080\u0093 I mean, what was 10 years ago niche products, 400 Brinell or Hardox 400 is now, I would say, a commodity and we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really produce that anymore. But as I have said, the good thing is that we have already delivered 500 tons of fossil-free steel, and we start to see now the first applications also out in the market being used, not just as demonstrations and examples, but actually being used in production and being \u00e2\u0080\u0093 so that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s very positive."
