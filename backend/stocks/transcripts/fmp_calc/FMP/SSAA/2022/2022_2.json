    "content": " And with us today is our President and CEO, Martin Lindqvist; and our CFO, Leena Craelius. And if we look at the agenda, Martin will start going through the quarter in brief, then Leena will explain more details on the financials and then Martin comes back with the outlook and summary. And then at the end, we will have good time for questions. So by that, please, Martin, go ahead. Thank you, Per and good morning. We had a combination of high realized prices, I would say, solid, decent internal performance and good cost control. And we had an operating profit for the first time exceeding SEK10 billion in the quarter, SEK10.4 billion and that is 29% EBIT margin. We reached almost 400,000 tonnes in a single quarter and we have been growing now Special Steels volumes with 8% per year since 2015. And if we look year-to-date, we are at 1.1, including contractors which is, I would say, in the steel industry, a very good performance, not where we would like to be. If we look into the divisions, we have record results for all divisions during Q2. In SSAB Europe, we did just north of SEK4 billion, meaning an EBIT margin of 28% which is very strong. And then of course, Americas with SEK3.5 billion and an EBIT margin of 40%. If we look at other important achievements during the second quarter, we continue to build up our unique value chain for fossil-free steelmaking. We continue to deliver volumes, pilot volumes to customers and partners. We are now manning up the project office, hiring project leaders and so on and so far, in line with internal expectations and plans. We saw during the second quarter, also the first construction machine built by using fossil-free steel from SSAB and that one was delivered by Volvo to the construction company NCC during the second quarter. The outcome of Q2 being 1,711 kilotonnes. Improvement versus Q1 of 3%, while being 8% lower than last year. The main reason for this deviation, it is linked to this incident we had during Q1 that we told about related to Raahe blast furnace and chilled hearth being idled most of the Q1, the start-up took place in March and then Q2 was still the ramp-up phase. The transportation and logistics challenges that we've been reporting, there was a slight improvement during Q2, not fully resolved yet but the situation at the end of Q2 was slightly better than end of Q1. Then also to repeat what Martin already showed in the previous slides, the Special Steels had the record shipments, almost 400 kilotonnes. The revenues, SEK35.5 billion, improvement from Q1 of 12% which is then the sales going up 12% and shipments 3%, that's telling the story of the improved sales prices. EBITDA per tonne delivered steel, improved during Q2 compared to Q1. And maybe if we just summarize once again the strong performance, it is with more stable production, continued good cost control and the higher prices, all leading up to the EBITDA total of SEK11.2 billion and EBITDA margin then almost 32%. And here, we are comparing the operating profit outcome of SEK10.4 billion this year versus last year, SEK4 billion, biggest positive impact definitely with the sales prices. With Special Steel division, we are talking about 55% higher price level; with Europe division, 64%; and Americas 67%. Then if we look at the variable cost, the variable costs had a negative impact. Alloys, scrap energy and logistics costs were higher compared to last year, while the iron ore was relatively flat. Fixed cost, they were higher this year. We also took this full profit sharing for 2022 at the end of Q2, in line with the good result. And then, we had some higher repair and maintenance work done during this year. And then if we look at the comparison versus Q1, prices developed still positively. Special Steels and Europe division, around 10% increase in prices; Americas, 4%. Volumes, already mentioned, the 3% increase and the increase coming mainly from Americas and Special Steels. Fixed cost, having negative impact. This month is -- or this quarter being the summer quarter with higher level of summer workers, temporary personnel. FX deviation, the same as versus last year. And the capacity utilization -- in this comparison, it is positive and that's also related to this ramp-up of Raahe blast furnace. Good earnings, partially offset with the negative impact from working capital. We were securing during Q2, the safety stock for raw materials to secure the production for coming months. The net operating working capital over net sales ratio is still on a lower level than last year, end of Q2 being on a level of 18.7%, last year was 20%. Taxes on a high level, as we have been indicating. So far, we have paid almost SEK3 billion in taxes. And as said, that's related to previous year result. Also to mention, in April, we did the payout of the dividend, SEK5.4 billion. But when we compare the cash flow from current operations this year versus last year, we were doing a better result. We still see that the cash need for business for this year is SEK8.5 billion, with the SEK5 billion related to strategic investments, including Oxel\u00c3\u00b6sund conversion and the expansion of this QL line  in Mobile. And also, the taxes will be higher, that already discussed in the previous slide. That development, unfortunately, will continue also for Q3. As in the bridge, we also refer to the deviation from last year being relatively flat. So the prices during Q2 will have an impact in Q3 of consumption cost and we are talking around 30%, 35% even increase quarter-on-quarter with the coal cost. So, definitely having impact to our margins. But on the other hand, the scrap spot prices developing downwards. Before I let Martin continue with the outlook details, a reminder that Q3 is the quarter of maintenance outage. Here, the table illustrating that during Q3, we start the maintenance. In Special Steel division, we have maintenance ongoing in Europe and Americas. And compared to last report, we have shifted the outage in Americas from October to September, that's shown in the different quarter here. But then, I'll let Martin continue to tell details about the outlook. So if we then look at the market segments for third quarter, we start with heavy transport, I would say that the market is, on average, fairly neutral. There are, of course, risks for further production stops in the heavy duty trucks due to shortages. But on the other hand, we see good activity in railcars and marine in the U.S. So I would say, overall neutral. Automotive; yes, also neutral. Construction Machinery, a bit more uncertain with weakness in China but I would say, on average, between neutral and weak. And Material Handling, we continue to see good demand from especially the mining segments. And Energy, very strong and solid demand from wind power, transmission poles and so on; so that is definitely green. Then, of course, construction. We are, as everyone else, expecting a slowdown in construction activity due to rising inflation, rising interest rates and so on. And then the big swing factor, as always, Service Centers. And when we look at the service center segments which we are most dependent on in U.S., we see low inventory levels, lower than normal. On the other hand, Service Centers are speculating on lower plate prices going forward. And then as always, we expect a seasonal slowdown in Europe, in the Nordics in July, as always and then in the rest of Europe in August. So for Special Steels, we expect stable prices. For SSAB Europe, we expect significantly lower prices due to the development of the spot prices in Q2. And then in Americas, we expect lower prices. On top of this, we expect to see continue over time, a stronger and stronger development of the product mix. And if we look at shipments, in Special Steels, somewhat lower due to the outage in Europe, lower due to outage. And then in Americas, significantly lower because of the outage in September that was moved from October. When we met the last time we said October, now we do it in September in order to keep the equipment up and running and better safe than sorry to do it slightly earlier. So all in all, Q3 will be a maintenance quarter for us. And then, of course, things can happen. So if we sum it up, I would say that good earnings at record levels in all divisions and for the group in total. Some uncertainty in the market outlook but we have structurally, the last couple of years, improved our ability to manage any downturn whenever it comes and we are ready and prepared for that. We have, as said, start continued with pilot shipments to partners and customers and we are on plan. And this transition, of course, requires sufficient availability of fossil-free electricity in time. But if that is sold, we are in a very good position to deliver on our targets and our plan. Thank you, Martin and Leena and we are now moving to the Q&A. So by that, please, operator, present the instructions. Martin, my first question is for you. And even if your profits moderate, this would continue to some extent. Right now, we are investing in QL6, of course and we will continue to build out capabilities within Special Steels and the new quenching capacity of 100,000 tonnes will come on stream as we speak which is much needed for the market. But apart from that, we will do maintenance investments. And I would say, over time fairly, in relative terms, lower maintenance investments because we are planning for the mini mills. And we need to, in some way or form in the future, also handle that. But currently, we don't have any mandate for doing anything. If I start with iron ore related to Russia, we actually did find some replacement for Russian iron ore which was more expensive and that will be taken in use in Q3 and that will have an impact in the Europe division cost base. Otherwise, iron ore expected to be relatively flat quarter-on-quarter. With coking coal, as already illustrated, the prices have gone up and that will, of course, have an impact in the cost base, around 30% higher cost. I just got two, please. First, on the Americas. One, it looks like some peers are trying to push price hikes through again. And two, normally, I would have -- I think you said before, even though the U.S. is very spot based, there is normally a sort of one quarter lag and we've only really seen plate prices come off through early June. And then maybe just on... No, I mean, as I showed on the graph, prices have come down a bit, a little, from very high levels and that is what we expect to see in the contract prices and the invoicing prices for Q3. And then maybe, Leena, one for you just on the sort of net cash position that was sort of helped out by SEK2 billion of FX and derivative revaluations. Definitely, the impact of this revaluation of derivatives which is then related to financial assets liabilities in foreign currencies, that has been reevaluated over quarters. This year, it has been positive. But as a risk-wise, we don't consider that as a risk. In the past, you emphasized the relative stability of Special Steel prices versus the more commodity-grade products. I mean, overtime, Special Steel prices and especially margins are much more stable. Now we are taking more production capacity on stream as we speak, 100,000 yearly tonnes in our investment in Mobile in Alabama. But that was mainly, I would say, due to that the demand was so much bigger than our capacity. But this is also, I mean, a mix shift within Special Steels. So Special Steels, I mean, is Q&T but there are different grades of Q&T as well. And we have now launched very high grades of Hardox, Hardox 600 and so on and they start to get traction. We also expect, going forward, not maybe visible from quarter-to-quarter but more and more protection steel being produced and those are typically the volumes and the products where we have the best margins. So there are, call it, mix differences in margins and prices within Special Steels as well. But we -- as I said in the beginning, we have been growing now Special Steels volume-wise with average 7.7% per year since 2015 and we expect that journey to continue. Just one follow-up and a second question, please. That differs, of course, over time but it is 100,000 tonnes yearly volumes. Actually, I have a follow-up to Seth's question around special steels but actually more on the order book. If we look at the order book for Special Steels, I would say that it is what we guide for. And you need to remember that, I mean, what we do is we produce sponge iron and they are iron units. So it is really a virgin material, the fossil-fuel virgin material, that we then melt in electric arc furnaces. So, I mean we have the same quality and the same properties as we have on our normal steel which is received very positively from our customers. And then last, just a clarification one for me for Leena. The next question is from Patrick Mann with Bank of America. And -- yes, that's the first question, I've got one another follow-up. We have that gas in use in H\u00c3\u00a4meenlinna and also, to some extent, in Raahe. The exposure, if you are now referring, the risk related to natural gas, we have done some good work securing the sources for natural gas in H\u00c3\u00a4meenlinna. We are buying from Baltic region, let's call it that way. And then in Raahe, we are also able to switch to propane if needed. And then I have a follow-up question, I think from Tom asked, the SEK2.1 billion adjustment to the cash balance. In Sweden, we have an agreement expiring, I think it is end of March next year. In Finland, we also have an agreement. I don't really, from the top of my head, know, I think it is a yearly agreement which expires next year but I'm not sure. And then in U.S., we are -- I mean -- we are nonunionized plants, so we have these local agreements with all our employees. And the difference between our European operations and our U.S. operation is that we have in U.S. mainly -- we have a completely different pay structures, we pay for prime tonnes, so prime yield. So when we produce a lot like we're doing now, salaries are definitely much higher. And then if we have a standstill or an outage or something else, we pay less. So a much more flexible solution with a fairly, I would say, limited increase in base pay but big flexibility. So times like this, salaries are really good in U.S. -- in our U.S. operation. But in Sweden, I think we have a three year contract that expires end of March next year. And then just on working capital, can you -- obviously, a sizable build and you talked through some of the moving parts on building inventories of raw materials. I mean, typically, before a maintenance quarter, we build up inventories in volume. We have also been building up, as Leena said, raw material inventories in volumes to secure that we have enough raw material to keep production running for this year. So -- and given the uncertainty with raw materials and so on that occurred together with the invasion of Ukraine, we have been building up safety stocks and other stocks. But the biggest part of it is, of course, inflation or prices and we have also been building working capital in accounts receivable. So I mean if prices are moving down, when they are moving down, you should expect us to release working capital. But in volume, we mainly build up for the summer outage and safety stocks. And then, of course, we have also some buildups in volumes in finished goods due to transportation issues, problems to get hold on boats, trucks, railway wagons and so on. So on the margin, that has also affected it. And that is, of course, a backlog from Q2 moving into Q3. I don't know, Leena, if you have an answer on that but I wouldn't expect a massive buildup of working capital in Q3 and as Leena said, we measure, of course, in absolute terms, in relative terms. And the only thing we know is when the business cycle turns, typically, we release working capital. It's on the sort of negative adjustment on EBITDA, it was relatively low this quarter compared to last year. You mean -- Grant, you mean on the other line in the... Yes, the line that we saw -- was a bit negative. Sorry, I don't follow the question. Sorry, I didn't mean to be pedantic. But I think in the first half, I'm just going through the results now. And then I think it's somewhere around 300, if my memory serves correct. In the other, we had -- during Q1, we had the provision for Oxel\u00c3\u00b6sund Hamn and... The one is, again, on natural gas. I wouldn't consider that in the Nordics, there is any comparable mechanism as like in Germany, where utilities could shift from contractors port at any time if needed. And we have also in -- especially in Sweden, we have been taking extra cost to make sure that we don't have any Russian molecules in the natural gas. And from that, we use all the gases. So natural gas is not a big cost in relative terms for SSAB but the cost inflation that has been on natural gas, has already been seen in the P&L to a large extent. Then, of course, it depends where it moves from here. Short-term, not really; midterm to long-term, yes, definitely. But short-term, not really. We are working a lot with looking into -- I mean, electric heating or reheating furnaces and so on. But on the margin, we are looking at other alternatives but it's not so easy to have these big reheating furnaces heated by electricity but we are looking into hydrogens on and other solutions. But short-term, of course, over quarter, no difference. On the auto outlook, I guess, what you're saying, Martin, is not necessarily sounding like you're warming up to the demand perspective for auto. To be honest, no clear view. And when we look at our automotive volumes compared to the general market of automotive, we have been better than index, so to say. And then, of course, we know what -- we have a couple of new platforms and a couple of new cars that we are now starting to deliver and we typically have that every year. And then, of course, it depends on the development of those volumes. But what we clearly see is a very strong interest for fossil-free steel in the future and we start to ramp up volumes according to that, not only to have 0 until 2026 and then something. So we start to ramp up, we start to do prototypes, we start to work with partners and so on and see a huge interest. So overall, I would say that we will follow the overall automotive trend with the exception that we only produce advanced high-strength steel. And then, we will ramp up volumes in advance of 2026 when we can start to produce fossil-free steel in larger scale for the automotive sector. Maybe -- I mean not a clear answer but that's how we see it and that's what we see, so to say. No, no, I think that's fine. I mean, I think one of your competitors in Europe has sold its DRI facility to a competitor, that obviously made it out of losses, so technically...\n  in U.S. I think for them, it must have been a strategic decision if they want to produce that in U.S. and using it in Europe. But so far, we have managed to overcome the problems we have had. And at the end, it's up to the customers and to  if the quality is good enough and if we are doing the right thing. And so far, it has been a very positive response. We are producing one tonne per hour, so fairly small volumes. So we are -- I mean, following our internal plan and so far, it looks very promising and it continues to look promising. I only have two quick questions left, please. Regarding the tax rate, I'm looking at it now, Per, it's around 20%. Is there going to be a large  is it going to be more like balanced in  2022...\n Hopefully, we will pay a lot of taxes in '23 as well because that means that we will earn a lot of money in '22. I would say, Bastian, you typically see this delay that you earn it in the year and then you pay a lot of taxes in the beginning then on next year. So if you use 20% as a proxy and then you hope that we make a lot of money, then we'll pay a lot of taxes beginning of '23 which will be very positive in that aspect, not paying taxes as such but having a strong result. So we are now in the phase of finalizing the feasibility study and we'll take the decision, I guess, during the fall. But the technique is developed by ourselves and then we will build equipment and buy components and build it together with our partners in HYBRIT, LKAB and Vattenfall. And as I said, so far, the result has been very good and very promising, not only according to us but also according to the users. And that's why I mentioned why this -- we continue with this, we call it pilot shipments then because they come from the pilot plant towards these strategic partners we have chosen. And then, we will see what the end user thinks about that dump truck or dumper body or dump truck. But so far, so good and it's not just buying any DRI plant -- off-the-shelf DRI plant and then use hydrogen instead of natural gas. So basically, you're not relying on like a single plant engineering partner here, i.e., Primetals or Autonova, whoever that may be? But we do, as we usually do. It will be, call it, a pilot plant but in bigger scale, taking into account all the lessons we have learned by running a pilot plant because the pilot plant is really a pilot plant and it is part of the R&D research and development project. Just if you could walk us through your CapEx scenario for first Oxel\u00c3\u00b6sund, I think the large  was here in 2022 but also 2023. So of course, there is always a risk of continued inflation and we see inflation when it comes to investments. We have, I would say, to a large extent, taking that into account when we have given you the figures or the guidance. So I would say, up until now, at least, no big deviations. And all -- and I guess the same then for the coming investment phase in the -- call it, European restructuring or the investments in the European operations. But that's in line with the figures we have given externally because there is, of course, as always, some headroom in those figures as well. So, so far in line. And then what will happen in the future, hard to tell. But of course, we have both contingencies and some other -- which you typically have when you give a figure in an early stage, contingencies and other, call it, risk factors. So up until now, we don't see any reason to change those figures. At least on the screens, it seems like the European prices have sort of stabilized. First of all, there is -- I wouldn't say no but very limited structural overcapacity left in Europe. And that is, of course, helped by the current cost of emitting carbon dioxide. And if the cost of emission rights are \u00e2\u0082\u00ac90 or something around \u00e2\u0082\u00ac90, the marginal cost is close to \u00e2\u0082\u00ac200 per tonne for a European steel player. We are in that aspect in relative terms, a bit more, I would say, lucky because we only emit 1.6-or-something tonne carbon dioxide per tonne of steel and that gives us more free allocations due to the benchmark system. And then we have, as we have discussed before, since 2018, also been buying emission rights because we took a decision. So we said, let's buy every month. But in relative terms, we are quite okay. But this cost of carbon dioxide emissions would prevent the European steel players to hunt for marginal volume, so to say. And then, of course, we have seen this much less or the import from Russia has gone away and from Belarus but mainly from Russia which was a big supplier to the European steel markets. I would say that even though, of course, the innovation of Ukraine is a big catastrophe and not good at all, it has, I mean, had effects on supply and demand. So I would say the European market is not as it was a couple of years ago, four, five years ago, structurally oversupplied and the part or a big part of the import has gone for the time being. And now we start to see discipline, we see discipline in the market. And one explanation to that is, of course, the marginal cost of producing steel. But the reason why we move, one would claim that it would be better to have the outage from a market perspective in Q4 than in Q3. We are moving the outage one month, from October to September. In a perfect world, we would have kept it in Q4 but now we moved it four weeks to make sure that we don't have any production disruption. And then, of course, that's the main reason why we guide for the volumes because we will have this outage which we typically have every 18 to 24 months in U.S. instead of every year. So would you agree that the other way to look at it is that because the market in the U.S., the plate market has been strong and you had to prepone it the outage without much of the kind of advanced notice and hence, you couldn't stock it up? You mean we haven't...\n No, no but we have been -- we have some backlog but we have been delivering everything we have been producing with the exception then of supply chain issues, lack of transport and so on. And -- I mean, we have not been building volumes overall and we should not be building volumes but we should be developing the mix. If you take Special Steels, as I said, we have grown that since 2015 with 7.7% or 7.8% a year. We have been selling, call it, nonstrategic low-performing businesses. And we have been acquiring businesses within downstream SSAB services within Tibnor, within Ruukki Construction. And there, we see much better stability in earnings. So what we are really working hard with is to increase flexibility, of course and then also take up the earnings in the bottom of the cycle because that is, as I see it, the most important part. So -- and that is structural work in Swedish, we say  everyday work, look at the structure, do structural changes become slightly better and we call that system internally SSAB 1 and that's what we are doing. So I mean if you do -- I did that with some of your back-of-the-envelope calculation and looked at what have we achieved compared to using 2015 as a proxy, it is quite a lot of money that we structurally have improved SSAB with. I don't really know, of course. And then, of course, on top of that, we have decent strength in our balance sheet. So we don't have to take any decisions in order to solve that, so to say. And I would also claim that going a couple of years in the future, we will be even better and that's what we are focusing on, the things we can influence ourselves and take up trough profitability. The next question is from Patrick Mann with Bank of America. In U.S., we felt we had to do it in Q3. In Raahe, we felt that given the strong plate market, we could delay it a month or two, given the status of the equipment and call it, the risk assessment. Thank you, Leena and Martin. And by this, we conclude today's conference and wish you a nice weekend."
