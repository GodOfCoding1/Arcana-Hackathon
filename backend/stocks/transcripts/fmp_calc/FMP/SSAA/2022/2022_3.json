    "content": " If we then move into the third quarter, it was I would say given the circumstances a decent quarter with good profitability in SSAB Americas and in Special Steels that compensated for a weaker market and a weaker outcome in the European business SSAB Europe Tibnor and Ruukki Construction. EBIT reduction from previous quarter but still the SEK per tonne EBIT higher level than last year and also visible in this graph, we are SEK1 billion higher than last year Q3. Coal prices also depending on the mix, 10% to 40% higher and the PCI is still twice as expensive compared to previous quarter. Energy, we see improved activity in oil and gas which is important for us in U.S. and also good demand in renewables and then construction of course, slow in Europe slow in the Nordics and service centers on the sideline with low inventory levels in U.S. and more normal or slightly high inventories in Europe. If we then look at prices and shipments, we have talked about the weak European market the stable heavy plate market in North America and also decent underlying demand in Special Steels. As Leena said, we were -- we took decisions this spring to build working capital for raw material and we also during Q3 seasonally build working capital and you should expect us to release working capital in Q4. We have I would say on the margin too high slab stocks and that's why we also took the decision to take this outage in Q4 and to consume the slab stock and we can -- if the market improves, we can improve slab production in Oxelosund and Lulea to some extent to mitigate that."
