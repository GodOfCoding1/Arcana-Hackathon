    "content": " Our total commercial orders opened were $724 per day, down 29% from the fourth quarter of 2021, and for January were 736 per day, lower by 30% versus the prior year. Total revenue, excluding recognized gains and losses, was $1.8 billion, a 42% decrease compared with the fourth quarter of 2021. Since the merger of over two years ago, F&G has far exceeded our original expectation for growth and contributed approximately $1.1 billion of adjusted net earnings over the last 10 quarters on a cumulative basis. F&G's Board of Directors has approved initiation of a dividend program at an initial aggregate amount of approximately $100 million per year, commencing in 2023, and FNF will receive approximately 85% of F&G's quarterly cash dividend in proportion to our majority ownership. Total revenue, excluding gains and losses, was $13 billion in full year 2022 despite the decline in title order volumes and reflects a 15% decrease from the record set in full year 2021. Our Title segment generated $1.8 billion in total revenue in the fourth quarter, excluding net recognized gains of $29 million, compared with $3.2 billion in the fourth quarter of 2021. Interest and investment income in the Title and Corporate segments of $100 million increased $74 million as compared with the prior year quarter, primarily due to increases in income from our 1031 exchange business and short-term investments. FNF's consolidated debt was $3.2 billion on December 31, up approximately $550 million from the preceding quarter due to F&G's draw on its new third-party senior unsecured revolving credit facility that closed in November. On a pro forma basis, including F&G's new notes and a $35 million partial paydown on its revolver in January 2023, FNF's debt-to-capitalization ratio, excluding AOCI, is estimated at approximately 29.5%."
