    "content": " Non-GAAP operating profit was 112 million, which was at the high-end of our guidance for the first quarter and was down 6% year-over-year, primarily due to the impact to gross profit from revenue decline in a legacy OpenStack and mature manage hosting. The second quarter will be impacted by 15 million to 20 million of investments that we're making to support growth, acceleration in cloud services and the startup of a BT partnership. But also keep in mind, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, within our second quarter, we do have growth investments of about 15 million to 20 million that impacts operating margins by about 200 basis points, which implies that our operating margin excluding these investments will be approximately about 14%."
