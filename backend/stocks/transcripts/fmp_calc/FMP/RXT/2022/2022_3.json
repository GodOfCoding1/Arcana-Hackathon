    "content": " This was down 36% year-over-year, primarily due to reduced gross profit from the ongoing revenue decline in our legacy OpenStack and managed hosting private cloud businesses. We estimate that over 60% of workloads are still in customer data centers and many will move to either public cloud or hosted private cloud over the next few years due to cost advantages, reduced operational complexity and fewer resource constraints among many other factors. So our focus is on growing the services booking space more quickly and on the private cloud side, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll give some color there, we had a strong \u00e2\u0080\u0093 very strong bookings quarter, which was largely driven by this large private cloud deal, and I will talk a little bit more about it, but we continue to gain traction and build pipeline in private cloud as we improve our focus there. So, we took a revenue haircut primarily in services and also a bit in the usage-based volumes that come to our managed public cloud business, mainly due to macro outlook, okay. And so as we turn the business around, as we stabilize the private cloud business, start growing the services component of our public cloud, we will see improvements in our mix that will drive gross margin accretion."
