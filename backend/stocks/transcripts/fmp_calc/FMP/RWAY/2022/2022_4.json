Runway completed 12 investments in new and existing portfolio companies in the fourth quarter, representing $327 million in new commitments, which included $233 million in funded loans. At the end of the fourth quarter, our total investment portfolio, excluding U.S. treasury bills, had a fair value of approximately $1.1 billion, compared to $910.2 million at the end of the third quarter and $684.5 million for the comparable prior year period. In the fourth quarter, we generated total investment income of $36.8 million and net investment income of $18.4 million, compared to $17.6 million and $10.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2021, driven by our growing portfolio and rising interest rates. For the fourth quarter, total operating expenses were $18.4 million, increasing from $6.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2021, driven by an increase in interest expense and management and incentive fees. Our base management fee was $3.4 million, up from $2.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2021 due to the increase in the average size of our portfolio during the year. Finally, on February 23, 2023, our Board declared a base dividend distribution for the first quarter of $0.40 per share, an 11% increase from our fourth quarter dividend of $0.36 per share and our fifth consecutive quarterly dividend increase."
