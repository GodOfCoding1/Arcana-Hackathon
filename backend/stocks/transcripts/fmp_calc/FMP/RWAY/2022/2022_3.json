    "content": " Over the last year, Runway Growth has delivered gross fundings of $585 million, resulting in 55% net portfolio growth; expanded ROE 130 basis points to 10.1%, nearly quadrupled our leverage ratio to 0.6 times; strengthened our balance sheet with diversified capital sources; recorded zero realized credit losses; and increased our dividend per share for four consecutive quarters from $0.25 to $0.36 per share. Net assets were $574 million at the end of the third quarter, up 14% from $504 million in the prior year period. Runway Growth completed nine investments in new and existing portfolio companies in the third quarter representing $216 million in new commitments, which included $161 million in funded loans. At the end of the third quarter, our total investment portfolio, excluding U.S. treasury bills, had a fair value of approximately $910.2 million, compared to $807.7 million at the end of second quarter and $586.4 million for the comparable prior year period. As of September 30, 2022, Runway Growth had net assets of $573.7 million, decreasing slightly from $579.4 million at the end of the second quarter. In the third quarter, we generated total investment income of $27.3 million and net investment income of $14.5 million compared to $18.6 million and $10.7 million in the third quarter of 2021, driven by an increase in the size of our portfolio. For the third quarter, total operating expenses were $12.8 million, increasing from $7.9 million for the third quarter of 2021, driven by an increase in management fees, incentive fees, interest expense as well as expenses related to being a public company. Our base management fee was $3.1 million, up from $2.3 million in the third quarter of 2021 due to the increase in the average size of our portfolio. We recorded net unrealized depreciation of $3.2 million in the third quarter, largely due to the decline in fair value of our loan to Pivot3 and public equity holdings in FiscalNote. During the third quarter, we strengthened our liquidity position by upsizing our KeyBank credit facility to $425 million from $280 million to fund portfolio growth with cost-effective debt capital. Well, the portfolio is still floating rate, but now we've added during the second -- during the third quarter, $100 million in fixed rate notes."
