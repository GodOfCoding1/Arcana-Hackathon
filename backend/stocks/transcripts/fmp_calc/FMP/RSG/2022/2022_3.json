    "content": " During the third quarter, we delivered revenue growth of 23%, including over 12% from acquisitions; generated adjusted earnings per share of $1.34, which is a 20% increase over the prior year; and produced more than $1.6 billion of adjusted free cash flow on a year-to-date basis, a 23% increase over the prior year. Next, turning to our Environmental Solutions business, third quarter Environmental Solutions revenue increased $343 million over the prior year, which primarily relates to the acquisition of US Ecology. So that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s why when you look at the sensitivity now, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the $10 change is $10 million to both revenue and EBITDA because just isolating the commodity impact, the service fee that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re charging to either actually the process the material or to collect that material is going to stay unchanged regardless of what the commodity price is. Look, if you \u00e2\u0080\u0093 just from an interest expense perspective, if you take a look at year-over-year, and if this is assuming a 125 basis-point hike in the fourth quarter, that would be about a $70 million increase to interest expense year-over-year, which, in isolation, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s about a 100 basis-point headwind to free cash flow conversion. But as we just kind of talked about with Michael, we still think the outcome is going to be very strong, especially in the context when you look at an average growth rate and revenue, EBITDA, free cash flow, free cash flow conversion."
