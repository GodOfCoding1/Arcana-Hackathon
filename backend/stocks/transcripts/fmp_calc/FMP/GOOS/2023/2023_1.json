    "content": " Although we expect lower SG&A growth in the full fiscal year, quarter two, 2023 SG&A is expected to be approximately 20% higher than the comparative quarter, largely due to cost of the new stores overhead support for Japan, volume-related logistics costs, including e-commerce growth as well as more headcount globally to support the strategic initiatives and expanded regional operations. I think we're very confident with China for a number of reasons, and we've built a strong business there to date, and we continue to see strong demand for our Chinese consumers there who continue to love our products and the strong demand there. And we have a very loyal customer base there, and that's why we're opening more stores there this year, and we feel very strongly about the importance of China and our overall business going forward. So I think if we just talk a little bit about the parkas business in China last year, we had mostly a very strong the quarter three which obviously is when they -- it's one of the two peak shopping quarters."
