    "content": " Our original idea was and our approach remains to identify tumor neoantigens and build vaccines containing these antigens, and then deliver them to patients alongside checkpoint inhibitors to induce strong new antigen specific PDA T cells, also known as cytotoxic T cells. Underlining the notion that stimulation of tumor antigen specific T cells is likely always a good thing, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve recently begun a clinical collaboration with Dr. Steve Rosenberg at the National Cancer Institute, combining his mutant KRAS specific cell therapy with our mutant KRAS specific vaccine. So again, this iterative loop, and I think, long-term, if you want to deliver good new antigen on cancer, tumor antigen vaccines to large numbers of patients cheaply, the off the shelf product, obviously, is where we need to end up."
