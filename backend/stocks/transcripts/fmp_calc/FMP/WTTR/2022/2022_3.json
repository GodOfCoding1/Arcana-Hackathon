    "content": " On a full year 2022 combined basis, the acquired operations from Breakwater and Cypress are expected to generate approximately $110 million to $115 million of revenue and more than $30 million of adjusted EBITDA. These factors, along with our capital light business model and growing portfolio of contracted infrastructure and production related revenue streams enable us to return capital to our shareholders while maintaining a disciplined capital structure to support the growth of our business and continued expansion of our water recycling and infrastructure initiatives. While we were already well on pace this year to exceed our 2022 target of 31 million barrels of recycled produced water through our six facilities, the Breakwater acquisition with its current 600,000 barrel per day recycling capacity provides strong additional momentum in this area and puts us well on our way to meeting our 50 million barrel future annual commitment. Water Infrastructure saw the most significant revenue gains in the third quarter, growing by 23% sequentially to $74 million in the third quarter. While the latest acquisitions will require some additional near-term integration efforts for certain back office functions, generating positive free cash flow through improved working capital management is a core priority, driven primarily by our continued meaningful revenue growth, net working capital increased by $54 million during the third quarter, resulting in free cash flow of negative $10.7 million in Q3."
