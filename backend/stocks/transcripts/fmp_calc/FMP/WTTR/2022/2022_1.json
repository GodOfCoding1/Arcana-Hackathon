    "content": " Free cash flow of negative $20.5 million reflected a substantial working capital build of $44.9 million during the quarter due to increasing revenue and acquisitions, most notably Nuverra which closed in late February. Other significant uses of cash included $18.8 million for the retirement of Nuverra's debt obligations, $16.4 million for open market share repurchases, $5.6 million in total deal cost from expenses related to our acquisitions, as well as the closing of our sustainability-linked asset-backed lending facility, $3.5 million of partnership investments and net CapEx of just $3.4 million. With about $15 million of gross CapEx during the first quarter, we continued to invest in new recycling facilities and gathering pipelines, among other core business assets that are identifying and liquidating substantial redundant or underutilized equipment and real estate to do so. Looking at the segments individually, the Water Services segment grew its revenues by 16% in the first quarter to $164 million, while advancing gross margins to just over 16%. However, the full quarter contribution of Nuverra assets coupled with the return to service to some upgraded facilities should increase the segment's revenues in the second quarter by 5% to 10% with increased gross margins in the mid-to-high 20% range. While our pipeline of high-return investment opportunities remains robust, the speed and success with which we have monetized acquired or redundant assets to date at attractive valuations, while increasing our revenues and margins enables us to lower our 2022 net CapEx guidance from $50 million to $70 million to $45 million to $60 million."
