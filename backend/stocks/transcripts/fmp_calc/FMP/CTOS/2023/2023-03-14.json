    "content": " Our TES business continues to see very strong demand with backlog growing to a record of $754 million, more than 83% higher than a year ago. As Fred and Ryan have indicated Q4 was a record recorded, despite the supply chain challenges, we continued to face total revenue of $487 million was up 37% compared to Q4 2021 and 30 -- 36% versus the prior quarter. Gross profit excluding rental depreciation was $169 million, representing an adjusted gross margin for the quarter of 34.7% down marginally from 35.1% for Q4 2021 and down from 36.6% last quarter both solely as a result of mix. ERS and TES segments both experienced significant improvement in adjusted gross margin versus last year, driven primarily by our strategic focus on pricing across all of our operating segment, SG&A was $59 million for Q4 or 12% of revenues, which is down from almost 14% in Q3. Reflecting our comments from last quarter regarding strong demand for rental asset purchases, ERS equipment sales for the quarter were a record $78 million up more than 120% versus Q4 2021 and up more than 110% from Q3. For TES, we achieved a quarterly record with revenues of $247 million, which were up more than 42% sequentially from $174 million in Q3, as this segment benefited from record backlog, continued strong inventory flows in near record levels of production. So I think part partly is just a function of, of what the combined fleet looked like and then to your point, because residual values have stayed strong and continue to stay strong for our used equipment, it's, it's been a good time to dispose of assets plus the fact that now that supply chain is improving, we have more new equipment available to continue to replace and then to grow the rental fleet also."
