    "content": " Q2 revenue was down $13 million versus Q2 of 2021, highlighting the impact of continuing supply chain issues, particularly on new equipment sales. Gross profit, excluding rental depreciation was $126 million, representing an adjusted gross profit margin for the quarter of 34.8% up from 28.7% for Q2 2021 and down marginally from Q1. ERS gross profit, excluding rental depreciation was $87 million for Q2, down from Q1 as a result of lower ERS equipment sales, but overall adjusted gross margin improved to 59.9% as a result of revenue mix. As supply chain constraints remain the primary impediment to our ability to deliver new vehicles to TES customers, we are reducing our full-year TES revenue outlook to $800 million to $850 million and our total revenue outlook to $1.54 billion to $1.65 billion. We'll obviously provide formal guidance here in the coming quarters, but we think it's a growth here in the way we see it setting up from a supply chain and from an availability of equipment standpoint. And you can see in our ported gross margin that we've been able to hold or increase gross margin where the market obviously allows, but we've always said, we'll be fair and reasonable with our customers and that's been the approach both on the rental side when we have to go back and talk to customers about rate increases and also on the sales side when we're receiving surcharges and have to go back to our customers to talk about the surcharges that we've received. And so, I think when we saw inventory build in Q2 and it's that $70 million number we talked about, we start to feel confident in our ability to put more gross CapEx into the rental fleet and to also see an increase in sales, which you can see from the segment reporting that we've provided."
