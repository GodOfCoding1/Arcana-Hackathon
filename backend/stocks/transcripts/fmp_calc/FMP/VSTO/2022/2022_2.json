    "content": " We reached the new high-water mark for quarterly sales which grew 35% from last year to $778 million and set new records for EBIT and EBITDA margins, as well as EPS, marking our fifth straight quarter of record financial performance. First, demand for our iconic ammunition brands is driven in-part by approximately 12 million diverse new entrants into the market, including people, color and women who are contributing to high participation rates at shooting ranges, as well as increased sales of hunting licenses and shooting accessories. Turning to outdoor products one page 18, Q2 sales grew 9% to $212 million on top of a strong comp last year, driven by continued demand for our strong brand, led by the growth at CamelBak and QuietKat, which is outperforming our expectations. EBITDA margin of 24% to 24.5% as compared to 15.5% in fiscal \u201921; earnings per share of $7.70 to $8, an increase of over 110% from last year; and free cash flow for the fiscal year 2022 is anticipated to be between $275 million to $325 million. Last, but not the least, as we focus beyond physical \u201922, we continue to see strong demand across our portfolio of leading brands, including recent acquisitions within our outdoor products segment."
