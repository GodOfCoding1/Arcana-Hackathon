    "content": " Within Outdoor Products as mentioned we posted a record sales of $353 million an increase of 5% driven by acquired businesses and golf partially offset by declines in other organic businesses, primarily due to reduced purchasing from international, big box and other wholesale channels. Gross profit decreased 2% to $102 million, driven primarily by organic business volume declines, increased amortization cost from acquired businesses, unfavorable mix and higher promotional activity in Outdoor Products associated with holiday season, partially offset by volumes from acquired businesses."
