    "content": " We estimate that we have absorbed $90 million in higher supply chain, freight, tariff and other input costs in the first two quarters of FY2023 as compared to the same period last year. Gross profit decreased 11% to $266 million, and gross margin contracted 438 basis points to 34% driven by higher commodity freight and other input costs, which were partially offset by price increases. Within Outdoor Products, sales increased 6% year-over-year to $349 million, driven by acquisitions of Foresight Sports, Fiber Energy, Stone Glacier, Fox Racing and Simms Fishing. In comparison, outdoor Products second quarter sales were up 15% compared to quarter two fiscal year 2021 and up 49% compared to quarter two fiscal year 2020. Gross profit increased 11% to $107 million, driven by accretive acquisitions, which were partially offset by higher input and freight costs, gross margin expanded 123 basis points to 30.6%. Sales were $432 million, down 4%, in line with our previous guidance and driven primarily by low finished goods inventory exiting quarter one. Looking to the second half of this year, we expect sporting products sales to be around $400 million each quarter and Auto products sales to be slightly better than quarter two. For our fiscal year 2023 guidance, we expect sales of $3.1 billion and EBITDA of $620 million at the midpoint, and our net debt leverage ratio at the end of quarter two was 1.7x. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open."
