    "content": " Revenue of $5.1 billion adjusted EBITDA of $1.8 billion, and AFFO of $1.1 billion, representing growth of 14% 12% and 10%, respectively. On a reported basis, revenue of $1.28 billion grew 10.3% year-on-year or 14.2% excluding the effects of the stronger U.S. dollar. Adjusted EBITDA increased 12% year-on-year to $1.827 billion, an increase of $192 million year-on-year, exceeding the projections given on our last call. In the fourth quarter, our Global RIM business delivered revenue of $1.08 billion, an increase of $61 million from last year or 6% on a reported basis. We expect total revenue to be within the range of $5.5 billion to $5.6 billion, which represents between 8% and 10% growth year-on-year. We expect adjusted EBITDA to be within the range of $1.94 billion to $1.975 billion, which represents 7% year-on-year growth at the midpoint. We expect AFFO to be within the range of $1.15 billion to $1.175 billion, which represents 5% year-on-year growth at the midpoint. And turning to the first quarter, we expect revenue in excess of $1.3 billion, adjusted EBITDA of approximately $460 million, AFFO of approximately $270 million, and AFFO per share of approximately $0.92. So I think we'll probably have something like $30-plus million, maybe even more than that of a revenue headwind from FX in the first quarter just based on where rates are now versus last year."
