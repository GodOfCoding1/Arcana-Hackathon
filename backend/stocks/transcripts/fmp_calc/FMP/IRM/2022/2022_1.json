    "content": " We achieved our highest ever quarterly revenue of $1.25 billion, exceeding our expectations of $1.2 billion, yielding 10% or total organic revenue growth and an all-time record EBITDA of $431 million. As pricing and positive volume trends continue to benefit us, we delivered organic storage rental revenue growth of 6.8% in the first quarter. In the first quarter, our Global RIM business delivered revenue of $1.04 billion, an increase of $76 million from last year or 8% on a reported basis. Constant currency storage rental revenue growth of 6.4% or 4.6% on an organic basis reflects our focus on revenue management, and solid volume trends which exceeded our expectations for the quarter. With the strength of our performance in the first quarter, we now project full year data center revenue growth of at least 20% year-on-year, with even higher rates of growth for storage."
