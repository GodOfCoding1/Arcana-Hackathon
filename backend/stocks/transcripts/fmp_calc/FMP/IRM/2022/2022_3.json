    "content": " Since last year, the U.S. dollar has strengthened significantly, and excluding its impact on a like-for-like basis, this quarter our revenue was approximately $1.33 billion and EBITDA was $484 million, representing growth of 18% and 16% respectively. Now turning to segment performance, in the third quarter our global RIM business delivered revenue of $1.1 billion, an increase of $93 million from last year or 9% on a reported basis. With the FX rates that we used at the time of our August earnings release, our projections for the fourth quarter would be revenue in excess of $1.32 billion, EBITDA of approximately $480 million, AFFO of approximately $290 million, and AFFO per share of approximately $0.97. We feel really good, as you would have noted, that over the last number of quarters, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been consistently showing north of 20% growth both on our IT disposal business - you know, the traditional part or the organic portion of our asset life cycle management business has consistently been 20% or better, and our digital service business continues to go from strength to strength again, north of 20%."
