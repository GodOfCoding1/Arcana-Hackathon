    "content": " The $185 million of total cash increased $12 million versus the end of the year, reflecting $8.5 million in net cash received for the debt refinancing and cash from operations of $9.9 million driven by positive earnings at the ship level, significant guest payments for upcoming voyages and deposits for future travel, partially offset by increased operating cash usage as we prepared additional shifts for sailing and increased marketing spend to drive future bookings. Sales and marketing costs increased $9.8 million versus the first quarter a year ago due to higher commissions related to the increase in revenue and from increased marketing spend to drive future bookings focusing on search, rich media, video, social advertising and direct mail as well as increased outreach through trade advertising and travel advisers. G&A spending increased $6.8 million, excluding stock-based compensation and onetime items versus the first quarter a year ago, primarily due to higher personnel costs as we ramp operations and increased credit card commissions related to final payments for upcoming itineraries and higher deposits on new reservations for future travel. The $8.5 million decline reflects the ramp in operations and $11.6 million in other income due to the utilization of the remainder of the CERTS grant, which were more than offset by investments in future growth, $10.9 million of costs related to the debt refinancing, $3 million of additional interest expense associated with increased borrowings, mostly related to the delivery of the National Geographic resolution as well as higher rates and a $3 million increase in depreciation related primarily to the launch of the National Geographic Resolution in September of 2021, along with accelerated depreciation on the National Geographic Islander, which is being replaced later this year."
