    "content": " At the Lindblad segment, revenue of $83.7 million increased $50.6 million year-on-year and $7.2 million or 9% versus the third quarter of 2019, primarily due to the ramp in operations, which included additional available guest nights from new capacity and higher pricing across the fleet. Looking at the cost side of the business, operating expenses before depreciation and amortization, interest and taxes increased $55.1 million or 71% versus the third quarter a year ago, led by a $42 million increase in cost of tours versus the same period a year ago, primarily related to the ramp and ship expeditions, which included higher fuel costs as well as from expenses related to operating additional land-based trips. G&A spending increased $7.3 million, excluding stock-based compensation and one-time items versus the third quarter a year ago, primarily due to higher personnel costs as we ramp operations and increased credit card commissions related to final payments for upcoming itineraries and higher deposits on new reservations for future travel."
