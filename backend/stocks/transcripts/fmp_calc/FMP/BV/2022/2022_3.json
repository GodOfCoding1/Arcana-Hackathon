Excluding this incremental fuel headwind, our adjusted EBITDA would have been $101 million or up about 8% prior to relative to the prior year, above the high end of our guidance range. Our strong organic growth performance over the last five quarters was powered by significant growth in net new sales, as our sales force continued to attract new and larger customers. We delivered strong organic growth in our Maintenance and Development businesses, and our team navigated through a challenging environment and managed through rapidly evolving external headwinds, including most notably the continued rise in fuel costs. The increase was driven by a combination of strong organic growth of 14%, and M&A contributions of approximately $15 million. Total adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter was $94.3 million, up 0.7% compared to the prior year. Excluding the net impact of fuel, maintenance adjusted EBITDA margin for the third quarter would have been approximately 17%, roughly flat with the prior year. Net capital expenditures totaled $21 million for the third quarter or 2.8% of revenue, compared to $13 million or 1.9% of revenue in the prior year. Please go ahead, your line is now open.
