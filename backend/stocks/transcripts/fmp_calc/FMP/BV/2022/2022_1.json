    "content": " As we move forward, and as we mentioned in our last call, the development team is shortening the expiration date for the bid price window to 15 days including more specific cost escalation, language and bids to provide protection against potential continued inflationary dynamics, shifting from a just in time buyer to an advanced purchaser of materials within 15 days of the contract award to reduce the risks associated with future procurement and increasing collaboration with vendors to better anticipate material costs, trends and expectations."
