    "content": " In fiscal 2023, we will continue to execute on our M&A strategy in line with long-term plans to drive at least 2% growth, which would imply $20 million of incremental M&A driven revenue as a result of in-year transactions. Moving to Slide 12 total revenue for the fourth quarter increased by 7.4%, reflecting a, 3.4% total organic growth, maintenance revenues increased by 4.8%, driven by 2.2% land organic growth and M&A contributions of $14 million. Moving to Slide 16 to review free cash flow, the strength of our business fundamentals gives us the confidence to anticipate free cash flow improvement in fiscal '23 despite a $58 million interest headwind. Ultimately, despite all the external headwinds our business is facing, if snow normalizes, we expect fiscal '23 adjusted EBITDA margin to improve by approximately 10 to 20 basis points compared to the prior year. Please go ahead, your line is now open. Please go ahead, your line is now open. Please go ahead, your line is now open."
