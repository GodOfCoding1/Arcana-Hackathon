    "content": " Second, adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $60 million, which was at the high end of our guidance range and benefited from strength in our top line growth and exceptional labor cost management. Our organic snow revenue of $196 million was down 13% or $30 million on an organic basis, offset by $12 million of acquired snow revenue during the quarter. As a result, the impact of lower snow revenue led to approximately a $10 million year-over-year headwind to adjusted EBITDA for the quarter and approximately $18 million for the first half. Turning to the details on Slide 12, total adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter was $60 million, down $7 million or 11% compared to the prior year. The decline in our adjusted EBITDA was driven by lower snowfall, which was a $10 million headwind and higher fuel prices, which was approximately a $4 million headwind. Excluding the snowfall and fuel headwind, our adjusted EBITDA would have been $74 million, up $7 million or 10% relative to the prior year. Looking at our results by segment, maintenance adjusted EBITDA was $63 million or down 13% compared to the prior year and reflects an adjusted EBITDA margin of 11.4% compared to 13.5% in the prior year."
