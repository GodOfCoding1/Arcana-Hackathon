    "content": " So total cloud services and license support revenues for the quarter were $7.6 billion, up 6% in constant currency and accounted for 73% of total company revenue. And I think the number would be approaching $20 billion in cloud ERP, where the majority of those customers are not people who are migrating, our customers that are migrating from Oracle's on-prem business, but they're migrating from other people's on-prem business. Whether it's a small company like Infor or a large company like SAP or a variety of other companies, the vast majority of our cloud ERP customers are not coming from our installed base, they are coming from someone else's installed base. But based on growth rates and the size of our current business, we expect to have about 30,000, five years now, 30,000 Fusion customers plus 100,000 NetSuite customers bringing in $20 billion at 85% margins. We deliver a new version of Oracle Cloud ERP to 100% of our customers, all 8,500 customers for Fusion every three months."
