    "content": " Total revenue for the first quarter grew to a record $219.6 million, an increase of 107% versus the prior year period. Marketing expense declined versus last year by $3.4 million to $11.9 million due to our transition to brand marketing in the first quarter of 2021, which resulted in overlapping marketing expense. Adjusted GPU is expected to be in the range of 1,800 to 2,000, and adjusted EBITDA loss for the quarter is expected to be in the range of $37 million to $39 million or 16.5% of revenue at the midpoint. Revenue in the range of $1 billion to $1.1 billion, retail units for the full year in the range of 34,000 to 38,000 adjusted GPU ahead of our 2021 GPU of $2,126 and we expect adjusted EBITDA loss margin to be in the range of 12% to 15%. So I mean, you saw our kind of midterm plan and long-term plan and we need to get marketing down every year to achieve those numbers and to get to profitability, which is very much the focus at that kind of in 2024, 2025, the market numbers are still higher than I think would be ideal because we want to make sure that we can sustain growth in the future."
