    "content": " Secondly, we see a massive opportunity to leverage Shift's proprietary inventory acquisition engine, as well as our self-service online checkout at CarLotz stores to drive cost efficiencies at our at-home delivery offering and make them significant profit centers, as we are building out our dealer marketplace as a potential to leverage CarLotz geographic presence to quickly scale this business to the East Coast. As I outlined in the standalone plan, we feel like it's important to really focus our energy by simplifying our geographic footprint to the West Coast by focusing on value and increasing our mix to value, and then by focusing on really optimizing unit economics and the selling and fulfillment for our online checkout business. So first, Shift standalone, we started with the macroeconomic environment that George outlined, and we built a plan that would allow us to achieve profitability at a much smaller scale and with much less capital investment to the tune of $75 million."
