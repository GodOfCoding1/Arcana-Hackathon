Thank you, Jessie, and welcome, everyone, to our full year 2022 earnings call. Today, Fernando and I will take you through our full year and fourth quarter operating highlights and provide you with an update on the progress we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve made in executing our strategic priorities. For the full year, our top line grew by 11.2%, with volumes increasing by 2.3%, reaching a new all-time high. Revenue per hectoliter increased by 8.6% accelerating in the second half of the year, driven by revenue management initiatives and continued premiumization. Driven by the consistent execution of our strategy and top line growth across all operating regions, our reported revenue is now $5.5 billion above full year \u00e2\u0080\u009819 pre-pandemic levels, with our volumes 5.8% ahead. EBITDA increased by 7.2%, at the upper end of our medium-term growth ambition and 2022 outlook. Underlying EPS was $3.03, a 5.2% increase versus last year. As a result of our performance and strong free cash flow generation, gross debt decreased by $8.9 billion this year, leading to a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 3.51 times. Following our deleveraging progress, the Board has proposed a full year dividend of \u00e2\u0082\u00ac0.75 per share, a 50% increase versus 2021. In the fourth quarter, we delivered top line growth of 10.2%, with accelerated revenue per hectoliter growth of 11.2%, driven by the implementation of price actions, ongoing premiumization and other revenue management initiatives. Our volumes declined by 0.6%, driven primarily by the significant impact of COVID restrictions in China and a softer industry in the U.S. which was impacted by the phasing of price increases and abnormally cool weather in December. We delivered an EBITDA growth of 7.6% and underlying EPS of $0.86, a $0.12 increase versus quarter four \u00e2\u0080\u009821. Our diverse geographic footprint provides a unique combination of growth and reliable cash flow generation, positions us well to deliver superior value creation. In 2022, we delivered broad-based growth with a top line increase in all five of our regions and volume growth in over 60% of our markets. Now, let me take you through the operational highlights for the year from our key regions, starting with North America. Our business delivered another year of top line growth and stable EBITDA, despite the elevated cost environment. While industry volumes in the fourth quarter were soft, we are seeing improved performance to start 2023, with year-to-date beer industry volumes down 1%, and U.S. dollar sales up 5% through the 12th of February, according to IRI. In Mexico, we delivered another year of double-digit top and bottom line growth, with record high volumes continue to outperform the industry. In the fourth quarter, we completed our Oxxo channel expansion with our portfolio now available in approximately 20,000 Oxxo stores nationwide. Looking ahead, we are focused on continuing to build the partnership and we are excited by the opportunity to activate our brands and gain our fair share across the network. In Colombia, our business delivered double-digit top and high single-digit bottom line growth, led by the consistent implementation of our category expansion levels. The beer category continued to grow, gaining 80 basis points share of total alcohol this year and with 2022 marking the highest beer per capita consumption in over 25 years. In South Africa, we delivered record high volumes this year, growing both top and bottom line by double digits, despite capacity constraints in the fourth quarter. In China, both the industry and our business were impacted by significant COVID-19 restrictions throughout the year, leading to a total revenue decline of 4.2% and EBITDA decline of 10.8%. While 2022 was a disrupted year, underlying demand outside of COVID-19 restrictions remained strong. As restrictions have eased and infection rates declined, we are optimistic about the industry recovery and returning to growth as channel traffic and mobility normalizes in China. Now, I would like to share with you a few highlights of the progress across our sustainability priorities. With these priorities embedded into our commercial strategy, we can create value and share prosperity for our business, our communities and our planet. Highlights include: investing over $700 million since 2016 in social norms market campaigns, promoting Smart Drinking and Moderation, reducing Scope 1 and 2 absolute emissions by 39% and improving water efficiency by 14% versus our 2017 baseline. Additionally, we progressed our circular packaging goal, with 77% of our products now in packaging that is returnable or made from majority recycled content; kicked off Cohort of our 100+ Accelerator, program that continues to densify breakthrough sustainable and innovative solutions; increased representation of women in the top 5 leadership levels of our business from 19% in 2017 to 28% today. This year, our volume reached all-time high with growth across more than 50% of our markets. This is a direct result of our commitment to lead and grow the category by investing in our brands, innovation and category expansion levers. Our above core beer brands have led the growth, increasing almost 17% versus 2019; with Corona, the star performer, growing volumes by 42% outside of Mexico. Despite the challenge of COVID-19, we invested an average of $7 billion per year over the last four years. On a currency-neutral comparable basis, in 2022, we invested more than $400 million in sales and marketing versus 2019. In 2022, we are named Creative Marketer of the Year by Cannes, the Most Effective Marketer Worldwide at the Effie Awards, and the number one advertiser in the Creative 100 by the WARC Advertisement Research Center. We are making the category more inclusive, offering superior core propositions, developing consumption occasions, and expanding our premium and Beyond Beer portfolios. The combined revenues of Corona, Stella Artois and Budweiser, grew by 8.9% outside of the brand\u00e2\u0080\u0099s home market, led by Corona, which grew by 18.6%. Budweiser growth of 2.5% outside of the U.S. was significantly impacted by COVID-19 restrictions in China, the brand\u00e2\u0080\u0099s largest market. Excluding China, the brand grew revenue by 12.6% in 2022. From expanding our non-alcohol beer portfolio by launching Corona Cero in 11 countries to growing our Beyond Beer portfolio by scaling Cutwater and N\u00c3\u009cTRL within the U.S., our focus remains on driving sustainable long-term growth. This continues to accelerate, usage and reach, capturing $32 billion in GMV this year, a 60% increase year-over-year, reaching 3.1 million monthly active users. Since BEES began its rollout in 2019, our initial focus market have strengthened customer engagement with the weighted average Net Promoter Score improving to positive 56 as of year-end 2022. In 15 of the 20 markets where BEES is live, our customers are also able to purchase third-party products to BEES Marketplace. In 2022, BEES Marketplace generated approximately $850 million in revenue. As an example of how BEES is improving our business and enabling us to be a better partner to our customers, let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s take a look at one of our countries, Brazil. Since the rollout of BEES in 2019, we have expanded our customer base in Brazil by over 250,000 plus,  increased the total number of annual delivers by 3 million deliveries and broadened the availability of our portfolio. Since 2019, the beer category has gained share of total alcohol with beer market share expanded and our beer volume grew by 17%. Our digital D2C products, Z\u00c3\u00a9 Delivery, TaDa and PerfectDraft are now available in 17 markets and generated over $450 million in revenue and 69 million orders this year. Our D2C activation yielded impressive results, increasing daily average orders during FIFA World Cup and attracting nearly 0.5 million new consumers to our platform. We aim to maximize value by focusing on three areas: one, optimizing resource allocation; two, robust risk management; and three, efficient capital structure. With respect to capital allocation, we are focused on maximizing long-term value creation by dynamically balancing our priorities. We continue to invest in organic growth to support our strategy to lead and grow the category, and digitize and monetize our ecosystem. Investing in the organic growth of our business is our number one priority, and we have no shortage of investment opportunities. In addition to sales and marketing, which, as Michel mentioned earlier, has averaged around $7 billion per year since 2019, we also continue to invest in our facilities and capabilities, allocating $4.8 billion in net CapEx in 2022. Over 50% of our CapEx spend is to support capacity expansions, new capabilities, digital transformation and other growth initiatives. In 2022, we invested a combined $11.7 billion in sales and marketing and net CapEx. And since 2019, we have invested over $45 billion to full growth. As you can see on slide 33, 2 times net debt-to-EBITDA remains the point at which we maximize value, though approximately 90% of the benefits from deleveraging can be captured as we approach 3 times net debt-to-EBITDA. This year, we continued to deliver strong free cash flow generating approximately $8.5 billion. As a result, we have made significant progress on our deleveraging journey with our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio reaching 3.51 times. If you look at our debt maturity profile, we have $3 billion worth of bonds maturing through 2025 and more than sufficient liquidity today to redeem all of these bonds. In 2022, we grew underlying EPS by 5.2% versus last year, delivering $3.03 per share. This increase was primarily driven by nominal EBITDA growth, which accounted for a $0.29 per share increase. We continue to optimize our business, reducing net interest and income taxes expenses, mostly offsetting headwinds in other line items. To simplify our disclosure, as from January 1, 2023, mark-to-market on derivatives related to the hedging of our share-based payment programs will be reported in the non-underlying net finance line. As we continue to optimize our business and bring our dynamic capital allocation priority to action, in 2022, we invested $11.7 billion in sales and marketing and net CapEx to drive organic growth. As a result of our continued momentum and consistent deleveraging progress, the Board has proposed an increase of the full year dividend by 50% versus 2021 to \u00e2\u0082\u00ac0.75 per share. Driven by the increased strength of our brand portfolio, we delivered all-time high volume and gained share across key markets. We made important strategic choices in revenue management, driving accelerated net revenue per hectoliter growth of 11.2% in the fourth quarter. As a result, the ABI Board has proposed a full year dividend of \u00e2\u0082\u00ac0.75 per share. Looking ahead to 2023, we are focused on the relentless execution of our strategy and driving the momentum of our business. We have an industry-leading portfolio of brands across all price points, an advantaged geographic footprint and superior digital products that are bringing us closer than ever to our customers and consumers. Clearly, Q4 volumes were a little bit weaker than the market expected, maybe a little bit slower than we saw through the first nine months of the year. But perhaps more importantly, could you talk about what -- how you see that market developing as we head into 2023 and you get the full benefit of the Oxxo rollout into the North. Michel, clearly you referenced sort of volumes running down about 1% for the industry year-to-date. But starting with Mexico, I think we had a great year in Mexico. Volumes positive, share positive, top and bottom line double digits. And the reality is that this expanded to Mexico as well, even though we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been talking a little bit less about that, but it was extremely cold, including some of the Caribbean countries where we do have operations. We think that as we look at this year, things are more normal, and we expect to see how the quarter one is going to be, and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll talk more as we announce results for quarter one, later. Oxxo, we completed the last wave of our expansion, and we could not be more excited now with the opportunities to activate our brands across Oxxo, premiumize the portfolio and get our share -- fair share across the network. So I think that continues to be a great opportunity as Mexico is a relevant country, Oxxo expands and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to be expanding our portfolio together with them. In the U.S., I think that we saw this one-off complicated quarter on quarter four. Many things there from phasing of price increase, the effect of the two price increases of the year in one quarter and a really, really complicated weather at the back end of the quarter. As we are now with couple of weeks under the belt into January and February, the published numbers that are there, IRI numbers, they point out for volumes, give or take, 1% down, revenues close to 5% up. Of course, there is phasing of Super Bowl, which is an important part of the industry in the first quarter of the year, but working well so far. What we see is consumers changing a little bit channels and changing a little bit package, so people buying more in larger formats, both in terms of the chains, supermarkets and the packs and people staying more at home. So penetration and consumption at home is being bigger, which in a way is very good for beer because beer has higher share of throat in home than out of home. And I think at the Q3 stage, that was 15%, so a pretty big uplift. And you are right, like BEES is the -- China is one of the markets where BEES was being built for a different role to market. Because we are integrating very well QR codes the wholesalers and BEES as a tool, we are doing a lot of geolocation, we are getting an unbelievable array of visibility through the network. So, I think that BEES will continue to scale very fast in China. And more specifically, innovations in more traditional beer like Brahma Duplo Malte have been successful, which we can see in the innovation contribution. But expansion in Beyond Beer has proven, I think, a bit harder with the Company being at the strategy of innovating and extending for a period of time. So, I think that we need to be able to invest in the core and renovate, create excitement around our core brands. If you think about Cass in Korea, incredible results, Victoria and Modelo in Mexico doing extremely well. We need to continue to innovate in this Beyond Beer space that offers us incredible opportunities for growth, especially with female consumers and sources a lot from liquor and from wine. One of the key learnings, I can talk about this for a long time, but I -- I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll try to get to you the biggest learning that we had so far because of the timing the other questions that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099d like to talk about is really that when we create new brands that are catered to this consumer and to the occasions that we want to gain share, they work better in the long term. They start -- is lower than when you extend brands from our core brands, but they build a much more sustainable model. And the learnings that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been having on that -- they go from Brutal Fruit in Africa to BEES in Brazil to what we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been seeing with Cutwater and N\u00c3\u009cTRL in North America from Canada and the U.S. And those brands, they are champions of the future that we are investing consistently to build. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s aggressive because they go outside of our core and they interact with new consumers, but is much more sustainable. And we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been doing things both ways, when we need to do something fast, using our core brands, extension lines, but we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been doing also creating new-to-the-world brands, and they are doing very well. The first one, Michel, you highlighted that volumes are up almost 6% compared to 2019. I think by my calculations, revenues are up 24%, but margins are down -- EBITDA margin is down about 600 bps. And the second one is that our margins, they exist for structural reasons, the power of brands that we have, premium brands that they command higher margins, the strength of positions that we have in key markets and the way that we operate our business in a very efficient way. I think that we all saw a huge dislocation in terms of costs because of supply disruptions, because the way that things happen, but also because of inflation, that got worse with the situation last year in Europe and commodities going even higher. And we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been balancing as much as we can, our ability to price correctly and having the category penetration and the growth of the category being prioritized. As we look at 2023, with the visibility that we have today, the cost escalation is big but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s smaller than what we saw in 2022. So, what we did in the quarter four was a very important wave of prices and revenue management that will yield for us good benefits this year. I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t precisely tell you when and how much in a time frame, but we are very focused in continuing to drive the powerful brands, charge the premium price that they deserve and be efficient in the way that we do actives in the Company. And hi Trevor, on your second question on dividends, on EPS and capital structure, I always like to take one step back and look at our business. Having said that, we need -- once we have the excess cash for the business and just to quote a number, the free cash flow for 2022 was $8.5 billion. We know that deleveraging creates value, and we know that 90% of the value of deleveraging happens when you get towards 3 times. Now, we are at 3.5%, we continue to use most of our resources towards deleveraging. You see how much our gross debt was reduced in the year 2022, but we already are dynamic allocating and increasing dividend. On the first one, you know that we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t give guidance by line, and we showed during the webcast here that we continue to invest, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s close to $7 billion across all years since 2019. We achieved last year, all-time high power of our portfolio, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the measurement that we have for favorite preference, whatever different companies call, we call power. And in this journey from inorganic to organic, growth will be achieved by the quality of the sustainable growth of our brands. And as we expand our digital products, both this and the DTC, we have this unique opportunity to combine data to do all to all, to activate campaigns in large scale as we did, for example, during FIFA World Cup in a very effective way. So, we are not only growing the amount of dollars that we are investing in the brands, but we are sweating these dollars much better than before with higher ROIs. And on the second question, I think that this is easy from our side to answer. And in a nutshell, China was incredibly disrupted last year by series of lockdowns, open, close and people really losing opportunities to be social and to use our products. I think that the market that we are more excited for 2023 is getting China to its full potential and giving our premium presence, the relevance of our brands there and how sizable China is, that can be a nice add-on to build on the momentum that we have across the globe. And we had beer -- beer total, not only BI behind but lagging behind inflation throughout most of the year, but catching up towards the end of the year. So I think that perhaps more interesting is to think about the positive carryover that this price will have for 2023, while 8%, give or take, during 2022 was above 11% in the quarter four. And we know that inflation is pointing down across most of the markets, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s still on a high level. We see majority of the markets holding well, and we know that beer is a resilient category, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not immune to inflation and everything that happens, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s very resilient. I think that throughout the year, as you see salaries increasing and each and every country has a different agenda for that, right, from March, April, May, in some of the Latin American countries to more middle of the year in North America, in China, we will see their purchasing power coming back. And in this very high inflation, high input costs the relativity tends to be good across the markets. We monitor this, of course, because we have to balance the prices that we have, the penetration of our brands and how the category is responding on a market to market. As you get to three turns and head towards, I think, the long-term goal of two turns, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s striking to me that where the stock is valued today is on a multiple that is well below kind of transactions that everybody has done in the beer industry for the slowest growing businesses. And if you even put a multiple on your consensus estimates for EBITDA for \u00e2\u0080\u009824 at the lowest valued kind of international transactions, you get a stock price of $100 or more. And that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s something you haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t historically done, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a new world, and love to get your thoughts on that. You are going to -- of course, you have your model to see the value of ABI share. And we are going to look at every moment in time, which composition is the one that maximizes value for ABI. So, I think -- I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have much more to share because I cannot give any guidance, but you can be assured that in any given moment in time, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to be assessing all the different alternatives and seek the ones that maximize value. First, if go back to the U.S., ABI is losing share within beer, but beer as a category is actually losing share against spirits, and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been the trend for some time. And second question, just on -- Fernando, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve given guidance for the increase in accretion expense this year. But regarding your other financial results, they have increased by 50% to $1 billion. If you look, I think that -- the best part of my answer is going to be, if you look at the last few weeks and what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s happening in the U.S. is beer responding much better, the biggest loser is wine, spirits continue to do well, but the majority of the growth is in ready-to-drinks. And in ready-to-drinks, actually, we are leading the pack, and we are much better positioned to grow the ready-to-drinks based on the footprint that we have, the network that we have. So, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s why it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s so important for us to get premium correct, to get Michelob ULTRA to continue to expand and having N\u00c3\u009cTRL Cutwater and the other ready-to-drinks propositions that we have to grow. I think that when you think about the main causes for spirits to be performing well in the U.S., has a lot to do with availability. So, several propositions in states, things that increase the availability and for some people questioning how big this can be and all the availability that was created, this it is the correct thing. And the second point, we see throughout the years, more on the affordable cheap side when you compare the spirits prices in the U.S. versus any other market globally, which is something that is interesting, not to say anything different. But it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s good to see that in the last weeks and when you look one through three years compounded, beer is performing better than was performing before, year-to-date is gaining share of value and gaining share of throat. And I think that innovation, quality of the products and the right alignment with the consumer long trend are the answer, yet a lot of work to be done. But if you look at our major exposures, which we have available on our financial statements, and if you understand the carry cost differential, then you can make an educated guess, but acknowledging that interest rates may flow throughout the year and the number may be somewhat different. And then, secondly, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen a decline in a number of your input costs, and I understand you hedged generally on a 12-month basis. If you were to look at the current spot rates of those input costs, would they be below the current hedge rate for your 2023 COGS, i.e., would you expect 2024 input cost to be below the current level of 2023 hedges? I think that you are not hearing me talk too much about that because it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s still depressing, Brazil lost. The interest for the sport, all-time high and huge excitement building up now for the next event that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to be Canada, U.S. and Mexico. So, there was an interesting way of seeing the power of integration of brand campaigns and our digital products, and we had a great volume of Budweiser in quarter four. The exception was China once again because of the lockdowns, very relevant Budweiser market for the -- for Budweiser. And Laurence, on your question on input costs, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s too early for us to start looking at this metric. Probably more as the year goes by, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to have a more relevant information that is more useful for us to start thinking about. And we will get back, talk to you as we close quarter one."
