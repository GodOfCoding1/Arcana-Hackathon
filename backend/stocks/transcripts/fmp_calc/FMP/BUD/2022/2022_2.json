    "content": " We delivered top line growth of 11.3%, with 3.4% volume and 7.5% revenue per hectoliter growth, driven by the expansion of the beer category, ongoing premiumization supported by increased investments in our brands and revenue management initiatives across our markets. This quarter, our above core portfolio grew revenue by approximately 12%, led by continued double-digit growth of Michelob ULTRA in the U.S. and Mexico and the expansion of Spartan in Brazil. So as we do all of that and invest behind the right brands, the outcome is the portfolio rebalancing, and that's why we are now 7 quarters in a row growing top line in the U.S. And this growth is coming with all this cost input inflation with a flat EBITDA, which is an improvement for our business in US. I think that the key core things that we are moving is this idea of reimagining what a beer company can be, much more effectiveness reason, leading and growing the category, digitizing the assets that we have and finding ways to monetize everything that we built over the years and continue to optimize the business."
