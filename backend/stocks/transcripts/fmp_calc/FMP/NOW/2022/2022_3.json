    "content": " That diversification showcases the breadth of our product portfolio and increasing customer awareness of ServiceNow's capabilities as a platform, which includes 11 organic businesses with over $200 million in ACV. We're revising our subscription revenues range to between $6.865 billion and $6.870 billion, representing a raise to our year-over-year constant currency growth outlook to 28.5% excluding a 550 basis point FX headwind. For  Q4, we expect subscription revenues between $1.834 billion and $1.839 billion, representing 26% to 27% year-over-year growth on a constant currency basis, excluding a 600 basis point FX headwind. What we're responding to is the agility of the supply chain and how you can reorient it in record speed because that's what this world order is asking for, how you can rethink suppliers to manage different labor issues, whether it's in arbitrage or just buying from the people you should be based on your ESG efforts, or your MWBE spend and many other things that many customers care a lot about."
