    "content": " Moving down the income statement, our fourth quarter gross profits decreased by $14 million or 4% comparing favorably with our 9% decline in unit sales. An increase in new product sales contributed $10 million to gross profits, and value-added sales increased to 68% of total sales this year from 65% last year. By segment, retail's gross profit decreased by $5 million compared to last year, primarily due to a drop-in unit sale combined with unfavorable cost variances. Packaging's gross profit increased by $7 million, primarily due to a value-based -- our value-based selling initiative and favorable changes in product mix, including new products. Our net cash flows from operations for the year with $832 million and consisted of net earnings and non-cash expenses with totaling $844 million compared to $655 million last year, and a $12 million increase in networking capital since the end of 2021 compared to $143 million increase last year. With respect to our capital structure and resources, at the end of December, we had $281 million in net cash surplus compared to $51 million in net debt last year, and our total liquidity was $1.8 billion consisting of surplus cash of $559 million and availability of $741 million under our revolving credit facility and $535 million under a shelf agreement with certain lenders. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. But I would say, again, we can't predict what's going to happen going forward, but if the current trends and the outlook continues, I think it'll still be a very stable good year with retail, and we should perform better than we did a year ago simply because of better execution and better structure, and not the roller coaster of the lumber market. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open."
