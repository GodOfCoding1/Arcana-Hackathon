    "content": " For the third quarter, Teleflex revenues were $686.8 million, a year-over-year decline of 1.9% on a reported basis and an increase of 2.4% on a constant currency basis. Compared to the prior year period, revenue under the manufacturing and supply transition agreement associated with our prior divestiture of the Respiratory assets negatively impacted growth by 1.3% in the quarter, implying underlying constant currency growth of 3.7%. Conversely, Interventional Urology continues to be impacted by patient business to urologists that remain down year-over-year and staffing shortages, with third quarter revenues modestly missing internal objectives. In our Surgical business; revenue was $93.1 million, representing another solid performance with 6.2% growth year-over-year. Third quarter, other revenue declined 9.9% to $69.9 million year-over-year. The 160-basis point year-over-year decline was the result of the lower gross margin, deleverage across our expense base from lower revenue year-over-year, inflation in our expense base such as wages and planned investment in the business for our growth drivers, partially offset by disciplined expense management of nonrevenue-generating expense. At the bottom line, third quarter adjusted earnings per share was $3.27, a decrease of 6.8% versus prior year. When excluding the impact of the Respiratory divestiture and normalizing for the one life shipping day, the underlying growth projection for the business remains over 5% year-over-year when considering the midpoint of our 2022 constant currency revenue growth guidance. Normalizing for incremental inflation, foreign exchange, the Respiratory divestiture and dilution from the Standard Bariatrics acquisition implies underlying adjusted earnings per share growth at the midpoint of guidance in the high single-digit range year-over-year in 2022 and reflects the benefits of our diverse growth drivers and ability to grow earnings in a period of significant macro challenges."
