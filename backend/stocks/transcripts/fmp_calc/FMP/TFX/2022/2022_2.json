    "content": " For the second quarter, Teleflex revenues were $704.5 million, a year-over-year decline of 1.3% on a reported basis and an increase of 2.3% on a constant-currency basis. Excluding UroLift, constant-currency growth in the quarter was 4% year-over-year as the remainder of the business collectively outperformed our forecast for the quarter, albeit with some pluses and minuses across the portfolio as we navigated a dynamic environment. Although UroLift declined 13% year-over-year in the second quarter, the remainder of products in the high-growth portfolio increased in excess of 20%. Americas revenues were $412.7 million, which represents a 0.3% decline year-over-year against nearly 32% growth in the year-ago period, but reflecting improving growth trends on both a 2-year and 3-year basis in the quarter. Revenue was $114.4 million, up 5.3% year-over-year against a tough comparison of 31% growth in the second quarter a year ago. In our Surgical business, revenue was $99.6 million, representing 5.9% growth year-over-year after a 39% constant-currency comp last year. For Interventional Urology, revenue was $79.8 million, representing a quarter-over-quarter increase of 6.9% but a decrease of 13.2% year-over-year and below our internal expectations. At the bottom line, second quarter adjusted earnings per share was $3.39 or an increase of 1.2% versus prior year. When including the impact of the Respiratory divestiture and normalizing for 1 less trading day, the underlying growth projection of the business remains over 5% year-over-year when considering the midpoint of our 2022 constant-currency revenue growth guidance. For the year, the expected impact of foreign exchange is now a revenue headwind of approximately 3.7% or $100 million versus 1.7% and $45 million previously. Given the first half results and our expectation for sequential revenue increase in the second half of the year, we are now assuming that 2022 UroLift revenue will be down slightly year-over-year or approximately $335 million versus the prior guidance for 15% growth. Of note, our current UroLift revenue outlook for 2022 assumes growth in the second half with a sequential revenue increase in the third quarter and a further sequential increase in the fourth quarter. We are reducing our adjusted earnings per share guidance for 2022 to $13 to $13.40 from a previous range of $13.70 to $14.30, which amounts to a 2.5% decline at the low end and a 0.5 point increase year-over-year at the high end. In bridging from our previous adjusted EPS guidance, we note a $0.50 reduction associated with our revised outlook for UroLift, foreign exchange is now a headwind of $0.46 versus prior assumption of $0.20 and incremental inflation is now a headwind of $0.47 versus $0.33 previously due to the increased raw material costs. Normalizing for incremental inflation, foreign exchange and the Respiratory divestiture, implied underlying adjusted EPS growth at the midpoint of guidance is a high single-digit range year-over-year for 2022 and reflects the benefits of our diverse growth drivers and ability to grow earnings in a period of significant macro challenges. And really looking to just get a bit more color in terms of how you're thinking about the back half, the revised guidance, but either contributions from backlog coming back in, either ramping volumes under your prior high-volume utilizers, DTC, just kind of a balance of how you're thinking about the environment and then really also just your longer-term view on that 15% growth for the overall business, how you're thinking about potential backlog recapture in '22 and beyond. If you don't mind, Tom. Some of the things that impacted the first quarter and first half will also play out in the full year as to why it isn't as strong as last year: so an incremental tax payment this year that's actually recouped over the next 2 years, it's pretty significant; and also some of the changes in working capital where we've taken up inventories to make certain we've got adequate supply to provide a buffer against supply chain disruptions. If you don't mind, Tom."
