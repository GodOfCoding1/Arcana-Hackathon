We think we have a very powerful return story and while it's nice that the stock is up today, it continues to puzzle us why the stock has not traded better given the strong predictable earnings that we're continuing to demonstrate and I think that ROE north of 11% on an ongoing basis, hopefully will address that. So again, I think it's \u00e2\u0080\u0093 I think we've said it probably 3x today, but all the earnings and the significant earnings performance that we generated in the fourth quarter and that we expect it to continue to generate the first quarter is without barely any benefit from repayments whatsoever. Please proceed with your question."
