    "content": " Our net investment income was $0.31 per share, in line with our previously declared first quarter dividend. This was our third consecutive quarter of covering our dividend, but it was a notable one, because we were able to generate $0.31 per share of NII despite very little repayment income, primarily due to a seasonally quieter M&A environment in the first quarter. Our net investment income was $0.31 per share, in line with our previously declared first quarter dividend. Your line is open. I don't see spreads contracting I'm hopeful they will widen, but I don't think that they will contract because in a period of volatility in the public markets, particularly with larger deals coming into the direct lending market, we think that's a time to push for a premium on spreads. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open."
