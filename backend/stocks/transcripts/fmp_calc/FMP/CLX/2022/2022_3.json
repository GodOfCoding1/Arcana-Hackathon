    "content": " As we look at what we expect to see beyond that, it\u2019s \u2013 I think it\u2019s going to depend on what we see for energy for the remainder of the year, what we see in commodities, but we feel like we have taken the right amount of pricing based on what we are announcing in July in order to deal with the environment that we are seeing right now. But what\u2019s offsetting that is two items: first is on admin, you\u2019ll see an increased spending in admin in Q4, I suspect we will be somewhere in the 15% to 16% of sales, and that\u2019s really the timing on the investments we\u2019re making in our digital transformation efforts; they really start to ramp up in the fourth quarter. We have seen, over the last quarter, a marginal improvement in private label share, pretty minimal and we think that\u2019s mainly related to getting distribution back in line to pre-pandemic levels, but no meaningful share gains and still lower than pre-pandemic."
