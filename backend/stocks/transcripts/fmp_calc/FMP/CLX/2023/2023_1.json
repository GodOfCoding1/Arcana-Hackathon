    "content": " We would expect, although we will lead in many of these price increases that, that would continue, that would our price gaps would largely be in line, but that is something that we are looking at with eyes wide open on our plan that we might have to make adjustments if that is not the case coming out of the fourth round of pricing in December. Just given that, it sounded like the overall cost inflation outlook for the year was around about the same, especially on commodities and in the first quarter gross margin if you take out the recall impact came in a couple of hundred basis points above your original outlook. And at this point, we are going to continue to take pricing over the course of this long-range plan till we get to the place where we have margins, and that will be a combination of cost savings and pricing and supply chain optimization, and of course, hopefully, seeing some of these commodities roll over in the out years."
