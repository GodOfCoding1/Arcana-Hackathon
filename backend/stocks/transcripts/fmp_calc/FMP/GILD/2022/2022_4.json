    "content": " Turning to HCV on Slide 10, sales for the fourth quarter were $439 million up 12% year-over-year, reflecting timing of Department of Corrections or DOC purchases, and favorable pricing dynamics in the U.S. Quarter-over-quarter HCV sales were down 16% primarily due to resolution of a rebate claim in Europe in the third quarter of 2022 that did not repeat, as well as other pricing dynamics in the U.S. offset in part by timing of DOC purchases. Sales were down 4% year-over-year and down 3% sequentially, primarily due to lower than ready demand and pricing dynamics outside of the U.S. Moving to Veklury on slide 12, sales the fourth quarter $1 billion with a full year totaling $3.9 billion."
