    "content": " Part of the reason that this program was delayed, we were expecting the decision already last September was part of the problem that this is a big group and there are multiple brands and being a company with so many car companies -- so many cars and designs, and each one has its own constraints, required a lot of iterations of design, working with the team, trying to help them in finding the right fit eventually in order to kick off the program, because they didn't want to delay the launch of those cars that are targeting to be launched earlier, the nomination was made today, but there are discussions yet, with the other brands to be included and we didn't count them in, into our order book, but once that decision will be done later, we will update the market."
