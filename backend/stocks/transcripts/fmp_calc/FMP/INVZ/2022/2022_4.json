    "content": " This has been a fast-moving quarter with our steady march towards 2023 production, new additions to our pipeline, expanding our order book with existing customers, and something I am particularly excited about is our special guest today, Steven Schondorf, the former Chief Engineer of ADAS systems at Ford who has recently joined us as a senior strategic advisor to the company. As we said earlier in the call, and as we hope to prove by expanding our relationships with Volkswagen, we believe that winning a new OEM gives us a foothold for a relationship that we can expand with a customer for years to come as LiDAR-based Level 2+ and Level 3 and eventually even Level 4 become increasingly common. Having this we are now still one importing one programs, that NREs become very meaningful and as you can imagine $20 million to $40 million report those, I would say the target from those $10 million to $15 million could be eventually on a recurrent year-over-year, could be a very meaningful base to our funding."
