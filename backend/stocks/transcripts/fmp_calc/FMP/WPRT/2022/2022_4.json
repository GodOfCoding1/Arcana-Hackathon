    "content": " This decrease is due to a combination of translating our financial statements to U.S. dollars, resulting in lower revenue and a reduction in the gross margin dollars, a reduction in our gross margin percentage from the impact of increasing material, manufacturing and labor costs because of global inflation, a loss of 33 million of equity income from the termination and sale of the CWI joint venture, which was partially offset by a gain of $19.1 million recognized on the sale, and an $8.4 million year-over-year swing in foreign exchange, which is a loss of $6.4 million FY22 compared to a gain of $2 million in FY21."
