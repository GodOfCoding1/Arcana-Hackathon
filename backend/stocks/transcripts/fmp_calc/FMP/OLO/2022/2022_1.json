    "content": " In a recently released testimonial, WaBa Grill, a fast casual restaurant highlighted Olo Pay's ability to reduce friction for their business and guests alike, mainly through PCI compliance, decreasing credit card fraud, and allowing operators to view daily orders chargebacks, failure of payment, and reconciliation, while also creating a seamless experience for their guests that enables credit card, Apple Pay, Google Pay, and more payment options. As a reminder, borderless payments capabilities, which we plan to introduce later this year, will allow guests to securely speed through checkout at any participating restaurant within the Olo Pay network with a single tap quickly and seamlessly connecting 82,000 restaurant locations, 600 brands, and 85 million guests. Platform revenue in the first quarter was $41.5 million, an increase of 19% year-over-year, driven by an increase in active locations coming on to the platform, further multi-product and multi-partner adoption and the durability of digital ordering. Gross profit for the first quarter was $32.4 million, compared to $30 million in the prior year period, driven by the revenue growth previously mentioned, partially offset by higher platform and professional service and other compensation costs to support the growth and transactions and active locations coming onto the platform, as well as the near term impacts due to our recent Wisely and Omnivore acquisitions. So amazing when we see brands that are already up, I think you noted in your piece Wingstop now at 62.3% digital, sweetgreen at 66% digital, but these brands have the ambition of being 100% digital, and as part of that you're seeing a broad interest in how do we use tools to really get great at digital marketing, to learn from all of this information that we're gathering and drive customer lifetime value of our guests?"
