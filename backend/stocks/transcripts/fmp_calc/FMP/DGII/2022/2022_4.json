    "content": " We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got several initiatives underway, both on the process and the systems side, but also, to your point, on the incentive side to ensure from management down to the individual salesperson that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re leading and highlighting the complete solution and really backing out if that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not appropriate for the customer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s application. We do think EBITDA, adjusted EBIT will progress throughout the year, but we are tempering that a bit by making some really targeted investments in our sales and marketing team as well as our R&D team, in particular, on the software side to make sure that we are really pacing with the opportunity in front of us."
