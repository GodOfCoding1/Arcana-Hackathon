    "content": " We had the highest revenue for any quarter in the company's history of nearly $95 million, an increase of 23% from last year. Our confidence is growing to reach our targets of $100 million in quarterly revenue, $100 million in annualized recurring revenue and $100 million in annualized adjusted EBITDA. Our new model has pushed our annualized recurring revenue to nearly $90 million as of the end of the quarter, which is up nearly 165% year-over-year. Our recurring revenue during the quarter accounted for nearly 25% of Digi\u2019s total quarterly revenue as we delivered $94.7 million in total revenue, which is up 23% year-over-year. IoT products and services revenue increased 9% year-over-year in the second fiscal quarter of 2022 to $71.4 million, and gross margins increased 140 basis points to 53.9%. Operating income increased $4.5 million year-over-year to $9 million for the second fiscal quarter, primarily driven by the revenue growth from the console server business. On slide eight you\u2019ll see IoT solutions revenue increased 100% year-over-year in the second fiscal quarter of 2022 to $23.3 million and gross margins increased nearly 650 basis points to 57.9%. Operating income decreased $300,000 year-over-year to a $1.5 million loss for the second fiscal quarter, driven by the installation of large projects in the prior year that are not repeating this year. We had another record in bookings, which increased our backlog and that's a good sign having that book to ship ratio be over one, and there is at least $10 million, probably closer to $20 million of revenue we were not able to ship last quarter that got deferred into future quarters."
