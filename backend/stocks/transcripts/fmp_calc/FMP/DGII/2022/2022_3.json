    "content": " We have got some exciting trials and proof of concepts, and we think that will add and in particular, to our ARR, and we will take opportunities in our cellular solutions group that maybe traditionally went to another competitor or was in expressing the term of one-time revenue, and you are going to see that really start to contribute to ARR, probably in FY \u00e2\u0080\u009823. We are working hard to get towards the upper end of the range, especially with continued growth on solutions as well as, I think accelerating growth on the product and services side where we have got some real opportunity to provide more value to our customers."
