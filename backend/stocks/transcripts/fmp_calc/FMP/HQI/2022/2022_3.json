And I would hope and expect that to be the future, which is part of going back to one of the earlier questions as far as even offering like niche products is that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s obviously easier for a franchisee, let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s say, it would be far easier for our franchisee in \u00e2\u0080\u0093 again in Colorado Springs to where we only have a HireQuest Direct."
