    "content": " We delivered strong top line growth in the fourth quarter, driven primarily by our franchise royalties, which increased by 26.4% to $7.7 million. Adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter was $4.4 million, compared to $3.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2021, showcasing our ability to drive sustained profitability across our business. For the full year, we saw an increase in franchise royalties of 35.6% to $28.9 million, compared to $21.3 million in 2021. Our net income from continuing operations increased modestly to $12 million or $0.87 per basic and diluted share compared to $11.8 million or $0.88 a share per basic and $0.87 per diluted share in 2021, primarily related to acquisition costs that we incurred throughout 2022. However, adjusting for these acquisition-related charges and other non-cash expenses that we expect to recoup as we integrate and scale our acquisitions, we actually saw an increase in adjusted EBITDA of 78.9% to $22 million compared to $12.3 million in 2021. At the risk of repeating some of the numbers Rick mentioned, let's start with total revenue which for the fourth quarter of 2022 was $8 million compared to $6.5 million for the same quarter in 2021, an increase of 23.1%. For continuing operations, franchise royalties for the quarter were $7.7 million compared to $6.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2021, an increase of 26.4%. For the full year 2022, royalties were $28.9 million compared to $21.3 million in the full year 2021, an increase of 35.6%. System-wide sales for the full year 2022 were $472.2 million compared to $354.5 million in the full year 2021, an increase of 33.2% primarily related to acquisitions completed in 2022 and organic growth related to the rebound from the economic downturn lingering in 2021 due to COVID-19. Income from operations which is total revenue less SG&A, depreciation and amortization was $16 million in 2022 versus $7.7 million in 2021, an increase of 109.6%. All in net income for the quarter was $2.7 million or $0.20 per diluted share compared to net income of $2.2 million, or $0.16 per diluted share in the fourth quarter last year. And I'm just making sure that the business -- because there's going to be some messiness just so I understand, I've always thought, that that's like 3.5% to 4% net margins on that $470 or so? And is that the right -- is that gets the depending on what your system-wide revenue is like 4%, it's like around $1.25 kind of earnings power is how I personally have thought about it. And just say on the $470 -- and I would say on the $470 is that clearly, now mind you that $470 million includes two weeks' worth of -- it does include two weeks of MRI. Just I mean, looking at the press release it said, you put Dental Power business as listed for sale and total revenue would have been $9.4 million without that which \u00e2\u0080\u0093 yeah so that's \u00e2\u0080\u0093 I mean, that's over 40% growth to last year on a normalized. Right is that if we had $22 million of EBITDA -- adjusted EBITDA compared to $31 million worth of revenues, you sit there sales you're pushing -- saying you're pushing 65%, 70%. And you sit there and say \"Well, okay now we get $4 million for what was roughly let's just say $11 million of revenues."
