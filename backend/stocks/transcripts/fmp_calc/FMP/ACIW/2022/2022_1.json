    "content": " Maybank partners with ACI worldwide to drive and transform the bank's increasing real-time transactions for its digital channels; we will modernize Taiwan's NCCC, the national switch, representing 23 members; KNET, Kuwait's leading payment gateway for online transactions, will modernize its electronic banking services using ACI; Redbanc, Colombia's leading payments network, will use ACI issuing to expand services to local and regional banks. First quarter revenue totaled $323 million, up 13% or 14% on a constant currency basis from Q1 last year. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $68 million, up 50% or 49% on a constant currency basis from Q1 2021. Bank segment revenue grew 38% or 40% on a constant currency basis to $132 million, and segment adjusted EBITDA increased 74% on both a reported and a constant currency basis versus Q1 2021. Merchant segment revenue increased 6% or 8% on a constant currency basis, while Merchant segment adjusted EBITDA was flat or down 3% on a constant currency basis versus Q1 last year. Biller's segment revenue was flat with last year on a reported and a constant currency basis, and the Biller segment adjusted EBITDA decreased 23% and or 22% on a constant currency basis versus Q1 2021. When you talk about Merchants, you can see that in Merchants, we are going back to 8% constant currency basis, we believe that this segment can give double-digit growth, around 10%, low teens, I would say. So -- but I think if you look at combined Q1, Q2, first half year-over-year, that would imply -- at the low end of the range would imply a 10% revenue growth and EBITDA growth in the mid-teens."
