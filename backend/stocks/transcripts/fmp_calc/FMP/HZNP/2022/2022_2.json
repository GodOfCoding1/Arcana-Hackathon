    "content": " As for TEPEZZA, we are continuing to enroll patients in our Phase 4 randomized controlled trial in TED patients with a low clinical activity score, otherwise referred to as our chronic TED trial, with top line data expected in the first half of 2023. So, with our expanded sales force, we'll have more time to focus on selling not only in that initial core oncoplastic specialist group, but also being able to get into those broader ophthalmologist and endocrinologist offices and allow our combined patient access and reimbursement access group to have a single point of contact with key offices to really help pulling those patients through to get their infusions."
