    "content": " We estimate there are more than 100,000 addressable TED patients in the U.S., where we expect peak annual net sales of more than $3 billion.With our increased expectations outside the U.S., we now expect TEPEZZA global peak annual net sales to exceed $4 billion. We delivered another strong quarter, generating net sales of $44 million with $41 million in the U.S. Our team remains focused on disease education and drove a record number of peer-to-peer programs in the third quarter, increasing activity by more than 50% compared to the second quarter. During the third quarter, we announced several important R&D milestones, including positive Phase II results from our Dazodalibep trial in Sjogren's syndrome, enrollment completion in our TEPEZZA chronic or low CAS TED trial, and a new collaboration and option agreement with Q32 Bio. Importantly, in our pipeline, we completed enrollment in our TEPEZZA chronic low-CAS TED trial and announced positive top line results from our Phase II trial evaluating dazodalibep in patients with Sj\u00c3\u00b6gren\u00e2\u0080\u0099s syndrome.
