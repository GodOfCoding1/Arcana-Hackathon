Quarter-over-quarter, average non-interest-bearing demand deposits increased 8% and linked quarter annualized and totaled 44% of average deposits for the second quarter.

Importantly, we saw quarter-over-quarter growth in average demand deposits, which made up 44% of our average deposits in the second quarter compared with 43% in the first quarter and 39% in the year ago quarter. We started the rising interest rate cycle from a position of strength with historically high levels of demand deposits for East West Bank, strong liquidity and an average loan-to-deposit ratio of 82% in the second quarter. Second quarter non-interest expense was $197 million, excluding amortization of tax credits and other investments and core deposit intangible amortization, adjusted non-interest expense was $181 million in the second quarter, up $6 million or 4% sequentially from a seasonally lower first quarter."
