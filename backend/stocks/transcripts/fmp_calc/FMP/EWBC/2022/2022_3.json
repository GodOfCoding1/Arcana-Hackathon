    "content": " Strong revenue growth and improved efficiency drove third quarter 2022, adjusted pretax pre-provision income growth of 66% linked quarter annualized. During the third quarter, we booked net charge-offs of $7 million or a low 6 basis points of average loans annualized as compared with net recoveries of 6 basis points annualized in the second quarter. Third quarter 2022 net interest income of $552 million was the highest quarterly net interest income in the history of East West, growing 66% linked quarter annualized. Customer-driven fee income and net gains on sales of loans were $69 million, up 7% or 26% annualized from the second quarter and up 10% year-over-year. Excluding amortization of tax credits and other investments and core deposit intangible amortization, adjusted non-interest expense was $196 million in the third quarter up $14 million or 8% sequentially driven by higher compensation and employee benefits expense. For the full year 2022 compared to our full year 2021 results, we currently expect year-over-year loan growth, excluding PPP, to approximately 16% to 18%, unchanged from our prior outlook; year-over-year net interest income growth, excluding PPP, of approximately 35%."
