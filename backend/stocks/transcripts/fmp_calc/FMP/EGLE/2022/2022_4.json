    "content": " For Q4, we achieved a net TCE of $22,062, which represents a decrease of 21% quarter-on-quarter on a headline basis, but a meaningful increase in relative outperformance versus the benchmark BSI Index, equating to roughly 53% or $7,689 per ship, per day. With a modern fleet of 55 predominately scrubber-fitted vessels and roughly $290 million of liquidity at year-end, Eagle\u00e2\u0080\u0099s in a unique leadership position and we are looking forward to continuing to deliver superior results for our stakeholders at large. In terms of growth, our ownership days increased by just over 1,000 days from end 2021 to end 2022 from $18,000 to $19,200 and then you are going to see them increase now because of the net three ships that we acquired, takeaway Jaeger, but the four ships less the Jaeger, another three ships, so another 1,000 days."
