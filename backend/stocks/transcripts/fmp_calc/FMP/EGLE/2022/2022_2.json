    "content": " For Q2, we were able to capitalize on the market volatility, and due to the efforts of our team, we're able to achieve our best-ever quarterly results, with net income coming in at $94.5 million, or $7.27 per share basic. As we look forward to the third quarter, we fixed approximately 72% of our owned available days for the third quarter at a net TCE of $29,024, indicating a significant outperformance against the BSI. As you can denote from yesterday's press release, as of June 30, we've sold BSI FFAs for the fourth quarter, totaling almost 40% of our owned available days at an average level of $22,322. Given the inherent high operating leverage in our business, robust revenue in Q2 led to record operating performance with adjusted EBITDA coming in at $102.6 million after adjusting for the unrealized P&L impact of our hedges and certain other noncash items included in G&A. The significant increase in the company's Q2 cash balance was driven by our strong operating results, offset in part by repayments of $12.5 million of debt, vessel improvements and the Q1 dividend. Cash interest expense came in at $754 per ship per day in Q2, $51 lower than prior quarter as we realized an increase in interest income due to rising interest rates and our increasing cash balance. Given our outlook, the strong results to date and consistent with our stated capital allocation strategy, Eagle's Board of Directors declared a second quarter cash dividend of $2.20 per share, equating to just over 30% of net income."
