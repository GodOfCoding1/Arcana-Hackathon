    "content": " While we typically would expect to see deposit outflows in the first half of the calendar year, we've actually seen modest net deposit growth versus the prior quarter and year-end. Nonetheless, we remain confident in our most recent full year non-interest expense guidance -- non-interest income guidance and continue to expect total noninterest income of between $290 and $300 million in 2022. Our ACLL at June 30 was flat from the prior quarter at $318 million, with additions for loan growth and economic factors fully offset by releases from declining NPAs and other credit improvements totaling approximately $14 million.

So, while we'd like to stay at the 95% and below range, we also think the deposit initiatives which we've been working on for quite some time will continue to kick in in the fourth quarter, in the first quarter, in the second quarter of next year as loan growth, I'd say, dampens. Please proceed with your question. Please proceed with your question. What I would say though, when we look at fourth quarter what we'll try to do is, we'll position ourselves as we've said we do every single year to acknowledge that there is a change in the industry, there is a change in the marketplace and we will try to make strategic cuts to redeploy that expense back into the business. Please proceed with your question."
