    "content": " We've added over $1 billion in high quality auto loans under our prime, super prime strategy and we have consistent growth in our new asset based lending and equipment finance verticals, giving us additional leverage to drive balanced loan growth. Residential mortgage led the way as we retain more loans on balance sheet in the rising rate environment, but we also posted significant growth in several buckets within our core CRE, consumer and commercial lines of business. With respect to core commercial, the growth of our RM base normalization of line utilization trends and strong loan demand have combined to more than offset the moderation we expected from PPP and mortgage warehouse throughout the year, allowing us to surpass our year-end target by September. While we've technically already achieved our $1.7 billion in total commercial loan growth target for 2022, pipelines remain healthy and we expect to see continued growth between now and year end. Your line is now live. Your line is now live. Your line is now live. Your line is now live. Your line is now live."
