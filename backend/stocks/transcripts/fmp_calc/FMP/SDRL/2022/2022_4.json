    "content": " But I don't think they're going to make as important a contribution to the supply demand balance in the near term as the movement of some of those units to other countries like Australia, Canada, Namibia, I think, that's the most sort of powerful near-term impact or catalyst on the development of that market from what has been a little bit of a stale and sort of depressed outlook. And then realizing, again, it has been a week, so you probably haven't even started realizing synergies from the Aquadrill acquisition, but with that transaction closed, how are you thinking about positioning the company around potential additional opportunities for rig growth, whether that's on the more traditional M&A side or it looks like there are still maybe one or two stranded newbuilds at the shipyards and maybe a couple more that I'm not thinking about the right way, and/or is there potential for Seadrill to potentially manage maybe some of those rigs that are currently looking to come out of those shipyards? But I think as we get into the capital budgeting season in the next quarter and we start to see that tightening of supply in terms of the units that are stranded in the shipyards disappearing, then I think you're going to end up with two camps there that can be those who have a certain capacity that they can't get to work because they're facing long and expensive reactivations, and then there are going to be those with rigs on the water. And I think the way that the market has developed in the last 12 months, looking forward the next 12 months, I think that there's a case to say that there's no room for a little bit more aggressive behavior if you're at the fully contracted end of the spectrum, which we clearly are in terms of not having too much residual stack capacity waiting to come back to work."
