    "content": " Cash flow continued to be strong in the first quarter as we generated $146 million of operating cash flow and $130 million of adjusted free cash flow, a year-over-year increase of 20% for both metrics. Turning to slide nine, we further strengthened our balance sheet with a $70 million reduction in our term loan during the first quarter building upon the $400 million reduction during 2021 and improving our debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio to 1.4 times as of March 31, compared to 1.6 times at the end of 2021. Yes, Curt, I would just add on the needle coke side as well, as you think about what we're seeing in the market today from a pricing perspective, versus what we talked about in Q1 or in our conference call earlier in the first quarter for Q4. I think the overall expectation for EV demand on needle coke over the next couple of years could come in line or parallel what graphite electrode demand is, so somewhere in that 700,000 to 750,000 ton range, so we still think there's a pretty substantial amount of opportunity out there from a needle coke perspective in terms of EV demand. That being said, we continue to evaluate what's the best use of our capital again, that being the mix of internal spending on operational projects and CapEx as well as returning capital to stockholders as we did in the first quarter with the $30 million of buyback that we did, so we'll continue to evaluate it."
