    "content": " Third, unless Monterrey reopens, our business performance will be significantly impacted for the first 2 quarters of 2023 with a reduction in sales volume of 50% or more before recovering in the back half of the year. For next year, if Monterrey remains suspended, sales volume will be reduced by 50% or more in the first half of 2023 compared to the first half of 2022 but will recover after that. Adjusted EBITDA was $129 million, a decrease of 25% compared to the third quarter of 2021, reflecting the lower sales volume and higher year-over-year costs. For 2023, if Monterrey will remain suspended, we anticipate further significant cost increases for at least the first half of the year, primarily reflecting cost to execute the previously discussed mitigation strategy related to producing pin stock, as well as incremental absorption of certain fixed costs due to the anticipated decline in 2023 sales volume."
