    "content": " We recognized then and it's still true, the need to focus on digesting the $2.2 billion of assets we acquired last year, about half of which was acquired in the fourth quarter so that we're able to fully recognize the embedded growth inherent in those assets. Same-store occupancy averaged 94.7% during the quarter, an increase of 250 basis points compared to last year. Regarding OpEx, same-store growth came in better than expected due primarily to a 50 basis point decrease in payroll, a 2.1% decrease in marketing costs and just 3% growth in property taxes compared to first quarter 2021. Taking all of this into consideration, we update full-year 2022 guidance with key highlights as follows: core FFO per share of $2.80 to $2.85, which at the midpoint represents a 4% increase from our previous guidance and 25% growth over prior year. The 95.1% end-of-month occupancy that Dave gave earlier for April, that's a 40 basis point spread positive over prior year. And so if you think about it in those 2 terms, our markets would see less new supply and the length of time of that new supply that's now filled up is really not the pressures that we would have seen a few years ago and even last year. We did give the end of April month of 95.1%, which I kind of followed up and said that's a 40 basis point year-over-year positive spread."
