    "content": " On the topline, constant currency net revenue of $266 million met our expectations and marked a new milestone as the highest third quarter revenue in the company's history. In addition to these strong results, we ended third quarter with our highest cash balance of $456 million, which provides us with great financial flexibility as we continue to invest in our diversification strategy, including the development of our digital assets. Consultant productivity of $2.2 million was below last year, but remains strong and is beginning to reflect the new normal we are seeing in our business where we expect this metric to settle in around $2 million over time, which is below the unsustainable post pandemic rate of $2.6 million and above pre-pandemic levels of $1.7 million in 2019. We continue to believe the true value of On-Demand Talent would be missed if one were to apply an EBITDA or PE multiples to today's results, given the nascent of this business with trailing 12-month revenue of $93 million. I think we on a constant currency basis, we would have done $222 million versus $222 million last year's third quarter."
