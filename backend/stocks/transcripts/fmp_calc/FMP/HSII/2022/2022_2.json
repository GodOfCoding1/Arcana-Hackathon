    "content": " Today, we announced consolidated net revenue of $299 million, growing 15% over last year and marking a new milestone as the highest quarter of revenue in the Company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s history. The energy and power of our One Heidrick approach with cross collaboration between Executive Search, Heidrick Consulting and On-Demand Talent was palpable as we shared the latest developments across these businesses related to our data-driven tech-enabled solutions, previewed some of our digital leadership capabilities under development and build deeper into how we can further serve our clients around the globe. In fact, you will see that our third quarter guidance, which I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll discuss in a moment, reflects moderation, driven more by our high-growth revenue levels of nearly $300 million in the quarter as opposed to any recessionary indications at this time. At an annualized revenue rate of approximately $94 million, On-Demand Talent segment is rapidly growing, and we are reinvesting to fuel future growth, given the accelerating market opportunities we are seeing. We saw an increase to $17.4 million in the second quarter compared to $14.7 million last year, mostly due to our On-Demand Talent business and an increase in the volume of consultant engagements that require additional independent talent to deliver those tailored projects. While the revenue is coming off last quarter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s historical revenue highs of nearly $300 million, please keep in mind that our guidance range is still at an annualized revenue rate of nearly $1.1 billion, thus demonstrating the continued high performance of our business."
