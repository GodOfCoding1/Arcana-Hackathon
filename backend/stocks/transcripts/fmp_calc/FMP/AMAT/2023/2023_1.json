    "content": " Before we begin, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d like to remind you that today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s call contains forward-looking statements which are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ. Reconciliations to GAAP measures are found in today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s earnings press release and in our quarterly earnings materials, which are available on the IR page of our website at appliedmaterials.com. Applied Materials executed well in our first fiscal quarter, delivering results towards the high end of our guidance range. Going forward, we expect backlog to start declining as we move through 2023. Overall, we are making good progress closing our supply-versus-demand gap. However, very recently, one of our major suppliers encountered a disruption that will impact our second quarter shipments. In my prepared remarks, I will cover three main topics: Our current outlook for 2023; our longer-term growth thesis for the industry, and how Applied is positioned to grow faster than our markets overall; and finally, a brief overview of the investments we are making to productively scale the company and accelerate our customers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 roadmaps. In this environment of mixed macroeconomic signals, our customers are facing a variety of demand dynamics. Consumer-driven markets, including PCs and smartphones are clearly weaker, while inflection-driven markets remain more resilient, especially high-performance computing and AI, automotive, industrial automation, and clean energy. In terms of wafer fab equipment investments, 2023 will be a down year for memory spending as customers rebalance inventories and defer capacity additions in both NAND and DRAM. We expect DRAM to pick up ahead of NAND, potentially beginning to recover later this calendar year. While near-term demand headwinds are causing customers to trim capacity additions, they remain firmly committed to strategic investments in advanced nodes to win the battle for next-generation technology leadership. Our view of ICAPS, chips for IoT, Communications, Auto, Power and Sensor applications, is incrementally more positive than it was last quarter, and we now see spending being up year-on-year. In addition, there is strong government support around the world to build resilient, regionalized ICAPS supply. Based on what we are seeing in our business and hearing from our customers, we believe Applied Materials is well positioned to outperform the market in 2023. The resilience in our business is driven by several contributing factors: First, our balanced market exposure which allows us to perform well in a variety of spending mix environments. Second, our position with technology leaders who remain focused on investing in their long-term strategies. We have strong positions at all the key technology inflections in advanced foundry-logic, ICAPS, DRAM, and advanced packaging. Third, our record backlog, of which a significant percentage is made up of our most differentiated products including metal deposition that is uniquely enabling for critical next-generation wiring resistance improvements. And finally, our service business which is on track to grow in 2023, even after the impact of current U.S. export control regulations. While we are cognizant of near-term volatility in our markets and ready to respond to both upside or downside, our long-term outlook remains highly positive. Around the world, governments are incentivizing the industry to build regional manufacturing capacity and accelerate investments in strategic next-generation technologies. Technology complexity of chips is increasing significantly as traditional 2D Moore\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Law scaling slows and the industry transitions to a new PPACt playbook to drive improved performance, power, area-cost and time-to-market. In addition, as 2D Moore\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Law decelerates, we are seeing average die sizes in advanced foundry-logic grow. Beyond advanced packaging, major technology inflections in transistor, wiring, and patterning are also enabled by new materials and materials engineering. As we have been investing in these inflections for multiple years, we are now well positioned to capture a larger share of our available market. We have a deep pipeline of solutions to enable new wiring innovations, Gate-All-Around transistors, backside power delivery, heterogeneous integration and hybrid bonding. Our broad portfolio of products enables us to offer customers traditional unit process equipment all the way to integrated materials solutions, or IMS, that combine multiple process technologies with on-board metrology and advanced data analytics in a single platform. To support this growth, we are making strategic investments in new manufacturing, logistics and R&D infrastructure. Beyond simply expanding capacity, we see these infrastructure investments as a catalyst to change the way we collaborate with customers, suppliers and research partners. For example, in the coming months, we expect to break ground on our next-generation R&D center in Silicon Valley. As the industry and Applied Materials scale, we need to do so productively and efficiently. This is a major strategic theme for us and, across the Company, we are focused on driving up productivity and implementing new ways to work that are better and faster. While the economy and semiconductor industry are facing challenges in 2023, we remain confident that Applied is well positioned to outperform our markets this year. Our resilience is underpinned by our large backlog of differentiated products, growing service business, and strong positions with leading customers at key technology inflections. In line with this view, we are making strategic investments in R&D and infrastructure, while driving improvements in productivity and speed across the organization. Before going into the near term, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d like to discuss the broader context for the industry and the Company. Over the past few cycles, the semiconductor industry has become significantly larger and more diverse. In Semiconductor Systems, more than half our revenue comes from leadership businesses where our market segment share is near or well above 50%. These factors strengthen our confidence in our ability to invest, generate high returns, and return capital to shareholders. In fact, from fiscal 2013 through 2022, we have grown Applied\u00e2\u0080\u0099s free cash flow at a compound annual rate of 30% and increased our return on invested capital to over 35%. The first is funding future growth and returns, and the second is maintaining a strong balance sheet so we can fund R&D through market cycles. Accordingly, even though the semiconductor market is weaker this year, we are investing to scale the Company to support our customers in what we believe will be a trillion-dollar semiconductor market. We are increasing our manufacturing and logistics capacity, and we are making significant investments in our R&D infrastructure to collaborate more closely and productively with our customers and industry partners to help solve their highest-value problems. We have committed to return 80 to 100% of free cash flow, and actual returns for the past 10 years have been 106%. As the business has become larger and more diverse, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve also increased the dividend. In fact, operating income from our services business alone more than covers a growing dividend. Finally, I want our investors to know that we are increasingly focused on improving our productivity. R&D is our largest expense, and we are making portfolio decisions to ensure we generate the highest possible returns from our investments. We also see opportunities to make our manufacturing more predictable and efficient, and have formed new teams to drive our operational goals. Moving now to our Q1 financials, we delivered net sales of nearly $6.74 billion and non-GAAP EPS of $2.03. Non-GAAP gross margin increased 80 basis points sequentially to 46.8%, primarily driven by improved manufacturing and logistics costs along with pricing adjustments. Non-GAAP OpEx was nearly $1.17 billion, with about two-thirds of the sequential increase from R&D. Turning to the segments, Semi Systems revenue grew by 13% year-over-year to $5.16 billion. In Display, revenue declined to $167 million, and segment non-GAAP operating margin was 4.8%. Turning to our cash flows, we generated $2.27 billion in operating cash flow during the quarter, which was 34% of revenue. We expect revenue to be nearly $6.4 billion, plus or minus $400 million, or up over 2% year-over-year. Based on our current assessment of the situation, we expect to recover all of this revenue, and the majority of it in Q3. We expect Semi Systems revenue to be about $4.84 billion, which is up over 8% year-over-year. We expect AGS revenue to be about $1.34 billion, which is down around 3% year-over-year including the negative impact of recent U.S. trade regulations. We expect Applied\u00e2\u0080\u0099s non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 46.5% which is lower quarter-over-quarter primarily driven by lower volumes and higher near-term supply chain logistics costs, and we expect non-GAAP operating expenses to be around $1.16 billion. Our business model is highly efficient, with low capital intensity and a high return on invested capital, driven primarily by R&D spending deployed in close collaboration with our customers. In fact, over the past five fiscal years, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve increased non-GAAP net income by 87%, generated $18.7 billion in free cash flow, and returned 118% of free cash flow to investors. Looking forward, we believe the growing complexity of the semiconductor roadmap and our ability to deliver the innovations required by our customers will enable us to grow faster than the industry. Finally, we will focus on increasing our productivity and maintaining our efficient spending model. To help us reach as many people as we can, please ask just one question on today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s call. If you have another question, please requeue and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll do our best to come back to you later in the session. So on our backlog, just taking a step back, we did see a lot of activity with movement in orders during the quarter. As we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve described before, we go through our orders each quarter, work with the customers to update them. We do see the weakness in the market that everybody else sees in the leading edge, logic and in memory. But as Gary pointed out, we did have strong bookings in the quarter and our backlog actually grew. And as Gary also pointed out, we expect that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll begin to work that down toward a more normal level as we start to improve supply chain and be able to ship the demand that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re still shipping from last year, really, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re still working in some of our business units to cover the demand that we had last year. So, it has been a little bit of a buffer, the strong backlog against the weakness in the market for us, and we think it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to take the rest of the year, probably 1 to 4 quarters, depending on the business unit, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re thinking about to work through to normalize the lead times and recover the backlog that we need to ship against. C.J., one other thing I would add is that the largest part of our backlog is with our leadership products, especially MDP and implants. And C.J., we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not giving the guidance for the second half, but we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll just say that as I highlighted, more than half of that backlog is in the year, so it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s definitely helping the year. And we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll probably talk more about this, but we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll highlight that the ICAPS markets are very strong. First of all, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s broad-based, I guess, would be my first answer on the ICAPS. We had significant growth last year that we highlighted when we did our year-end call, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s actually accelerating into this year. As we think about ICAPS and we think about that broad-based strength, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re probably aware or certainly aware that many of the companies that we know are leading ICAPS manufacturers have announced that they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re adding capacity, and the capital intensity for those companies is increasing. And so, as companies need to add capacity to serve this market, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re having to make the new investments. We do think it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s being driven by, in some cases, are being supported in some cases by government incentives. So, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re also fairly confident in the underlying demand, things like electrification, electric vehicles, sustainable power. So we just -- we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re seeing an acceleration in that area for our business, and we think it will continue. Stacy, the one thing I would add too is if you remember, several years ago, you had a lot of used equipment as the foundry business model was emerging. Because it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just that when I look at your outlook, right, it seems to be very different than what we have seen from your other U.S. peers who are down 20%, 30% sequentially in their calendar Q1. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve definitely seen -- as I highlighted in our booking activity, we definitely have seen significant cancellations and pushouts from memory customers. And then, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve looked at the leading indicators on the memory side. So, we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s turning yet, at least from our perspective, but we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re confident we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re current with the customers, Vivek. I notice you did not quantify WFE for this year, and I understand you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re probably better than the industry because of the ICAPS strength. So yes, we didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t provide a WFE because we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re really just trying to focus on sharing what we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re seeing, all the signals that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re getting in the market because we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re a little bit abstracted from it. As you pointed out, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got the strength and acceleration in ICAPS that may make us a little bit different. So for us, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re catching up to demand, especially in some of the key differentiated business units that existed before the year. As we talked about in our last call, because we were supply constrained, our OpEx growth, that was our plan, was a little bit ahead of our revenue growth. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve moved to strategic hiring only, and we do have initiatives focused on improving our productivity on spending. Of course, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a balancing act, Krish, through this year because we think the industry is growing. We have flexibility, if the environment deteriorates for us, then we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll make more appropriate changes to spending. So, Brice, it does sound like ICAPS is the driver for your outperformance at least in the near term versus the peers. And historically, in your Master Classes, you have talked about ICAPS being around 25% of your silicon portfolio. Memory is a little slower this year, so that mix is changing a little bit. So, ICAPS relative to market share is similar for us with leading foundry logic. So, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve grown share in ICAPS a significant amount over the last few years. Four years ago, I think we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve talked about this, we formed the ICAPS IoT, communication, auto power, sensors, organization because we could see these markets were going to grow at a significant pace. If you look at all of the technologies, whether it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s in -- again, any of those different segments within ICAPS, we have significant strength. So again, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s something that we saw several years ago and made investments. But in that particular area, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve introduced 10 new products focused on ICAPS in the last five years. And just in that one area, again, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been very supply constrained, we expect that we can double our ICAPS revenue in \u00e2\u0080\u009823 versus \u00e2\u0080\u009822. So again, just really across the board we have very, very strong positions. And pulling that organization together four years ago, really put us in a good position for what we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re seeing today. Gary, you just mentioned that you expect your ICAPS revenue to double in \u00e2\u0080\u009823 versus \u00e2\u0080\u009822. And then my question, Gary, in your prepared remarks, you talked about your DRAM business potentially recovering by the end of the year, which to me is a little surprising, just given how weak the trends are in that marketplace today and the inventory situation. I think in the DRAM and NAND, we have seen the weakening in memory. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think, Toshiya, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to give an exact moment when the market will turn. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve looked at the pricing of memory, and it looks like it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s either declining or declining -- or slightly flattening. So I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think at this point that we can say, call the point in time where memory starts to grow. Brice, I had a question on backlog. It seems like backlog is sort of skewing your numbers a bit higher than your peers, given how long your lead times began or got to during the upturn. So, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m wondering if you can give us maybe a few more breadcrumbs on the backlog. I think you said last quarter, SSG backlog was $12.7 billion. And if so, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s kind of like 2.5 quarters of backlog for SSG. And when I think of a normal, you always used to run more like a quarter-and-a-half worth of SSG backlog. I think -- thanks, Tim, for the question. So color on it, I would say we did see weakness in leading logic and memory as we described. So, a lot of the strength that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re seeing comes back to this acceleration on the ICAPS side. So from a mix perspective, I think that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s where a lot of strength in the orders is coming from. So certainly not -- the growth of total ICAPS is not 100%, but it is very meaningful to us for the year, obviously, enough in Q1 to offset weakness in memory and leading logic. And what I would say is, yes, it does tie back to the long lead times in the areas of the business that are highly differentiated equipment, where we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re still working off that backlog. And we think it will take us -- I guess what I would say is -- last quarter, we highlighted that a normal backlog would probably be in the $12 billion or $13 billion range. We expect to work back in that direction as supply improves, and we can start catching up to the demand we had from last year. So I guess, Brice, just to confirm, so the SSG backlog did go up from $12.7 billion? Yes, maybe one thing I would add that just kind of gets back to a lot of the questions. We talked in the Master Classes about inflections gate all around, wiring, memory with capacitor formation or new materials, PDC strength. When you look at the composition of the backlog, just again, wiring alone, we have one inflection that enables a 50% reduction in resistance. So, those areas are also helping us in relative performance. They\u00e2\u0080\u0099re taking drastic actions to rein in supply, even going so far as to push out their technology migration road maps. Typically in downturns, we wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t see your customers pulling back on tech migrations, capacity add, yes, but not tech migration. And just as importantly, does this mean the potential for a sharper spending recovery as memory fundamentals start to normalize because all of your memory customers are going to try to aggressively get realigned on their tech migration road maps. I think that will be driven by their opportunity to take leadership positions and improve the cost of the bits and improve the product performance, et cetera. So, what does happen is they may have more equipment that they can reuse into their road map depending on what demand is. So, I think -- I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not aware of companies for -- that are connecting the technology ramp decision with the current inventory situation and business situation. Harlan, I would say that your view of memory strengthening, we said DRAM potentially by the end of the calendar year and memory strengthening into \u00e2\u0080\u009824, we would share that perspective. It was in this kind of two-thirds, one-third mix between foundry logic and memory. And especially with government incentives, you see a lot of government incentives certainly in the U.S., in Europe, Japan, a number of different areas, potentially in India. And again, the profile of higher foundry logic versus memory, we think that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to sustain for a number of years going into the future. But let me start with working down the backlog, Joe. So I guess the way we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re thinking about it, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hard to estimate the order flow coming in and estimate the exact backlog number. So we think as supply has improved, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll begin to ship back against last year\u00e2\u0080\u0099s orders and recover to a normal position. And the quickest business unit, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll probably do that in the next quarter. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know -- go ahead and -- Joe, can you say the second part of your question, again. Like I said, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re current in the environment. And so, as we think towards next year, we expect \u00e2\u0080\u009824 to be a better year across the whole industry, memory, leading logic, et cetera. But as we head towards \u00e2\u0080\u009824, we think there\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be firmer footing. So, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen pushouts or cancellations of some tools related to those customers. And then, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think we typically comment on the timing of the other nodes. What I would say is that from what we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re hearing from customers, the demand for 3-nanometer is very strong. And again, for us, the positions there, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve covered that in a lot of the Master Classes, we expect our share of gate-all-around to rise versus FinFET, about 5 points. And again, what we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re hearing from customers is significant demand for 3-nanometer and then the timing, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll let them comment on the timing. Obviously, it sounds like the ICAPS business is very strong in 2023. But when I look at your China revenue, it looks like it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s down 40% over the past year from about $2 billion to $1.15 billion. So, it is growing worldwide, but China is the largest country, and most of the demand that we see in China is really ICAPS-related because the memory investments and leading logic investments are essentially zero or close to zero. I would say that relative to ICAPS profile in \u00e2\u0080\u009823, China is remaining at a similar level. So, I think your assumption is pretty close to what we see. So, we do expect -- none of that demand is perishable. So yes, in your model, I would take that $250 million and add it to whatever you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re modeling for Q3. We don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know if we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll get exactly all in Q3, but we think we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll get it most in Q3 based on our current assumptions. And then, to the extent that there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s weakness in the second half, if there is, then it would offset that to a degree, just like you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re describing. Mehdi, relative to ion implant \n Yes, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m just trying to understand how big is ion implant within ICAPS. So, relative to implant ICAPS, we haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t quantified the amount -- the size of that business. And we -- and as I said earlier, that we believe that we can double that, roughly double that implant ICAPS revenue from \u00e2\u0080\u009822 to \u00e2\u0080\u009823. As you know, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not really shrink-driven, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s more materials and structures-driven market. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re the leader in that market, and we expect that will remain strong in \u00e2\u0080\u009823 and going forward. This is really I guess, the main reason why your revenue is as resilient in terms of near-term shipments, kind of the net product is just beneficial. But to your point, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re seeing significant strength accelerating demand from our ICAPS customers that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s filling in blanks that we get on the memory or leading logic side. And so to the extent that that -- our backlog represents the orders that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re shipping, I think it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fair to say that there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a significant amount of ICAPS strengths across that backlog. And just going back to those end markets, we do think it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sustainable. This is just growth that, as Gary said, that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen coming for a while and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s starting to build out, and you might have seen some of the big -- larger companies in the ICAPS space talking about these investments. Blayne, I think slightly weaker, we won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t give an exact number. But, when we look -- when we think about the big customers in foundry logic, that everybody knows, they have had reductions in our capital plans. When we look at leading foundry logic, when we look at utilization, it is low at this period of time. So their customers, our customers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 customers are working through inventories at this point in time. But when you start to turn the page, the leading logic is going to invest in the next nodes and put that capacity in place. And so, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll -- when we get past this year, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll expect to see strength in foundry logic again. Going back on the backlog again, I think you mentioned your backlog is current. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know if -- first of all, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s current. The macroeconomic factors are also important if there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s -- some people think there will be a recession, some people don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t. We don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re missing signals in the market, and we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s impending changes. And then on the China side, it is down 14% sequentially, and it looks like probably the third quarter was still going down. We won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t call it exact trough, but I think it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a fair thought because we expect over time display will grow. And certainly, China is mostly an ICAPS businesses at this point, and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re expecting strong growth there. So, I won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t call a trough, but if you ask, are the effects of the trade rules, have we absorbed those effects, I think the answer is yes. So today, we emphasized that our backlog of enabling products, our ICAPS growth and our strength in services are helping us to be resilient in this market. We look forward to seeing many of you at our offices this quarter, and I look forward to attending the Morgan Stanley conference in a few weeks. And I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d like to add my own closing message, which is please do join us on February 28th for our Patterning Product Launch webcast. You can find a registration link on the Events page of our IR website, where we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll also post a replay of today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s call by 5 o\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock Pacific Time today."
