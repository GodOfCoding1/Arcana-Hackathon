    "content": " Our Veradigm business is uniquely positioned in today's healthcare IT landscape as one of the only companies generating meaningful top line growth, 25% plus EBITDA margins and mid-teens free cash flow yield. Following Rick's earlier comments, we are maintaining our outlook and expect the following; Veradigm revenue to grow 6% to 7% Europe, Veradigm adjusted EBITDA to grow 10% to 15% year-over-year and our consolidated free cash flow from continuing operations to be between $102 million and $120 million. We can look to potentially augment that in the future, if we think it makes sense, but I think just getting a sense that roughly half of it is turning around in year one and the balance you can estimate the contracts tend to run any from when it's a multiyear contract that will run anywhere from maybe three to five years, you could get a pretty good swag on it. We are getting some scale and that's why we signaled in our guidance back, even back as far as March that we expected gross margins and EBITDA margins to increase this year as we got our top line growth, that's still our outlook."
