We'll go through some testing to make sure everything's working as planned, but over -- by the end of Q2, that facility will be humming along and that bring -- basically, we look at this 20 satellites a month is what we're able to produce, give or take. So, right now, now, generically speaking, I'm looking at a CapEx profile that's anywhere from plus or minus $15 million, maybe less, maybe more depending on how accelerated we are on bringing on this additional facility in Irvine, as well as how we think about the equipment that we're adding and testing capabilities. When you're building million dollar satellites and low earth orbit, they become -- business applications become economically viable, whether it's 5G, internet of things, all sorts of other things. The -- it's a little bit difficult to say, in addition to not providing guidance, but I can point to the history -- the near term history that we could see swings particularly in working capital that impact our liquidity or at least our free cash flow to the tune as much as $25 million to $30 million in any one quarter."
