    "content": " Carglumic acid is a lower cost alternative to CARBAGLU and with the cost of CARBAGLU exceeding $1 million annually for some patients, prescribers have been very excited that we brought a lower cost alternative to market, while still offering the patient support services that they have grown accustomed to for rare disease products. Carglumic acid tablets have now been commercially available for three full quarters, and we believe we remain on track to capture approximately 25% to 35% market share of the estimated $50 million plus market. I'm pleased to report that the product was launched in October, which triggered the second milestone payment of $5 million, which will be recorded as revenue in our fourth quarter results. Total company net loss was $3.0 million for the third quarter, compared to a net loss of $6.1 million in the prior year period."
