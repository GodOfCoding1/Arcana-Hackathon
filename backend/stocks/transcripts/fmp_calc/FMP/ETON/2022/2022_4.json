    "content": " Due to the significant growth in the product since we entered the agreement and our strong forecast for 2023, our projected sales commission at Tolmar for this year was going to be roughly the same amount as it would cost us to expand our own sales force. The new sales force will be solely focused on Eton's products and it will allow us to exercise much greater control over sales force strategies, incentive plan structure and personnel decisions. In addition, our new sales force is also promoting Carglumic Acid and soon Betaine, which should both boost both of these products revenues. A few closing points, Carglumic Acid, ALKINDI SPRINKLE, were already on pace to deliver massive growth this year and now we have put the full power of an in-house sales force behind them to supercharge this growth. Despite the expansion of our internal sales force, we expect only a minor increase in SG&A expense for 2023 and expect full year SG&A expenses to remain below $20 million. The increased costs related to the sales force are being partially offset by lower legal costs, reduced marketing spend from some initial launch related expenses that will not repeat in 2023, the elimination of the copromotion commission paid to our marketing partner and the elimination of expenses that were associated with supporting products that were divested in 2022."
