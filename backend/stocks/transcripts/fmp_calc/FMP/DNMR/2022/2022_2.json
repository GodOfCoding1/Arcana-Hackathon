    "content": " We closed out the second quarter with sales of $12.7 million compared to $14.5 million in the prior year second quarter, driven primarily by lower PLA sales and also lower R&D revenue. For the second quarter 2022, R&D and SG&A expenses, excluding depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, rent, and one-time items were $12.2 million compared to $6.7 million in the prior year quarter, mainly attributable to an increase in headcount and salaries to support R&D efforts, and our future expansion plans, as well as increases in costs associated with having a larger asset base, such as property and liability insurance. Adjusted EBITDA was a loss for the second quarter of $12.9 million compared to a loss of $2.7 million in a prior year quarter, primarily due to the factors I discussed in our gross profit, SG&A, and R&D results."
