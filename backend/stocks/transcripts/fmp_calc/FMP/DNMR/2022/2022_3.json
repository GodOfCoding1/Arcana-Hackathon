    "content": " With additional capacity available to us from the expansion of our Kentucky facility during the second quarter, we believe we are extremely well-positioned for several significant expected customer product launches in the months ahead. For the third quarter 2022, R&D and SG&A expenses, excluding depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, rent and one-time items were $11.2 million compared to $9.2 million in the prior year quarter, mainly attributable to an increase in headcount and salaries to support R&D efforts and our future expansion plans as well as increases in costs associated with having a larger asset base, such as property and liability insurance. Adjusted EBITDA was a loss for the third quarter of $12.9 million, compared to a loss of $7.4 million in the prior year quarter, primarily due to the factors I discussed in our gross profit, SG&A and R&D results."
