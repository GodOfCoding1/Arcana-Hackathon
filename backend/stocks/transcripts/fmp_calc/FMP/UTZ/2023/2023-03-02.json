    "content": " For perspective on this year-over-year comparison On The Border tortilla chips, sales grew nearly 20% in mass in the fourth quarter of 2021 and nearly 30% in the first quarter of 2022. Our results improved throughout the year as we expected as our revenue management activities combined with our productivity programs began to fully offset gross input cost inflation, all while we continue to make critical investments in our growth. Moving down the P&L, we expect our full year 2023 adjusted effective tax rate to be approximately 20% to 22% and interest expense of approximately $55 million, which reflects the higher interest rate environment. From an innovation perspective in 2023 we'll continue to support the launch of our Zapp's Sinfully-Seasoned Pretzel Stix, which has higher than expected repeat while also introducing an exciting slate of new products across key power brands and subcategories."
