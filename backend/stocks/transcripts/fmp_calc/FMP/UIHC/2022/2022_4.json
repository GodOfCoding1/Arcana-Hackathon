    "content": " But commercial lines did incur approximately $16 million of net losses related to current accident year catastrophes as well as about $8 million worth of reserve strengthening for non-cat losses, but despite that it was still profitable as Dan mentioned. After increasing American Coastal's Ian loss for our Commercial Lines segment to $680 million during the quarter, American Coastal still had over $500 million of limit remaining from the Florida Hurricane Catastrophe Fund placed at 90%. This means that American Coastal has exposure to a 10% co-participation on future adverse development until the Florida hurricane catastrophe fund limit is exhausted, but we believe it's more likely that American Coastal's Ian loss will actually come in under $680 million resulting in favorable development and reducing net losses incurred in future periods. As a result of the events occurring after year end, UIHC also incurred several nonrecurring charges in the fourth quarter including a $23 million impairment loss related to United PNC's investment portfolio, a $20 million write-down of deferred acquisition costs related to United PNC's unearned premium that will not be earned in future periods as well as the disposal of approximately $3 million of intangible assets that no longer held any value at year end."
