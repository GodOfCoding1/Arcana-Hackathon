    "content": " Highlights for the quarter ended June 30, 2022 included a GAAP net loss of $69 million or $1.60 per share compared to a net loss of $23.5 million or $0.55 a share last year and a core loss of $64.3 million or $1.49 per share compared to a core loss of $24.6 million or $0.57 a share a year ago. On Page 4 of our investor presentation highlights that our core loss included $20.6 million of net retained catastrophe losses or approximately $0.38 a share after tax, $7.8 million of prior year reserve development, approximately $0.14 per share after tax and the $43.7 million noncash valuation allowance charge, which was slightly over $1 per share. Gross premium written for the quarter of $360.1 million declined $66.3 million or approximately 16%, and gross premiums earned of $305.8 million decreased about 14%, consistent with our expectations of less exposure, offset by higher rates on our personal lines portfolio. Ceded earned premiums were $194.4 million, which compared favorably to $211 million in the same period a year ago due to our lower exposure base as well as the reduction of our quota share cession rate from 23% to 18% at June 1. Other items included in total revenue during the current quarter were $6.4 million of fee income that increased $2.4 million year-over-year due primarily to the renewal rights sale of our federal flood book of business; net investment income of $3.1 million, which declined year-over-year due to lower invested assets; and net unrealized losses from equity securities of $5.1 million, which were $7.5 million lower than the prior year. UPC's second quarter net loss and loss adjustment expense was $90.1 million, a decrease of $28 million or approximately 24% year-over-year."
