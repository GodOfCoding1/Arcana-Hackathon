    "content": " These results have driven the write-down of our DTA, large valuation allowance in the second quarter and in the third quarter, we wrote down approximately $13.6 million with goodwill against our personal lines operations. In commercial lines written in American Coastal Insurance Company, our business continues to grow with net premium earned larger than the personal lines net earned premium $59.5 million. Core income of $1.8 million for the third quarter and $32 million year-to-date demonstrate the earnings power of the commercial lines book. We also experienced favorable prior year development of $1.8 million in the third quarter and $5.5 million year-to-date for our commercial lives business. Given the loss of the Demotech Financial Stability Rating and UPC Insurance Company, and the very different outcomes between our personal lines and commercial lines businesses, in the third quarter, we decided to put our core personal lines businesses into runoff. A disappointing core loss for the quarter is due to poor performance in our personal lines business reflecting loss of UPC Insurance Company's financial stability ratings, increased reinsurance spend, significant prior year development, and a write off of goodwill in our personal lines company. Highlights for the quarter ending September 30th, 2022 included a GAAP net loss of $70.9 million or $1.65 a share compared to a net loss of $14.3 million or $0.33 a share last year. On page four of our investor presentation highlights that our core loss included $37.4 million of net retained cat losses in the current accident year and $44.6 million of prior year reserve development. Our cat losses were driven by Hurricane Ian, which included a $16.4 million net retention by American Coastal and United Property & Casualty plus a $20.1 million loss incurred by our captive EPC REIT. The additional retention by our captive was due to UPC REIT replacing one reinsure on a $25 million excess of $20 million layer of the core cat program, who elected determinate their participation upon UPC's downgrade by Demotech during the third quarter. The $20.1 million retained loss excludes the return on reinsurance premium of roughly $15 million, so the net economic impact between losses and seeded premiums was around $5 million related to the captive's participation. Seeded earned premiums were $185.7 million comparing favorably to $200.2 million last year, due to our lower exposure base and the reduction of our quota share sessions session rates from 23% to 18% at June 1st. Other items included in total revenues during the current quarter were net investment income of $4.3 million, which increased approximately 23% due to higher yields and net unrealized losses from equity securities of $2.5 million which were about $775,000 lower than the prior year. UPC's third quarter net loss and loss adjustment expense was $117.2 million, an increase of $14.5 million or 14% year-over-year. Our underlying loss and LAE was $35.2 million, down $28.6 million or 45% year over year, due in large part to the reallocation of IBNR to prior accident years. This produced an underlying net loss ratio of 30.3%, which improved over 11 points compared to the third quarter last year. Page five of our investor presentation summarizes our results by line of business and as Dan mentioned, continues to show profitable results for commercial lines inclusive of the significant loss related to Hurricane Ian, and is exactly why we're determined to focus exclusively on the segment going forward. Here you will see red dotted lines showing where Hurricane Ian is estimated to be in the Florida hurricane catastrophe funds specific to each American Coastal and United Property & Casualty, as well as the utilization of private open market limit shared by and allocated to American Coastal and United P&C. Our personal lines loss is estimated near the top of the United P&Cs program, leaving only $63.4 million of limit from the Florida hurricane catastrophe fund. After reinstatement premiums of $15.4 million, we have approximately $1.4 billion of aggregate limit remaining after Hurricane Ian, but the majority of that protection is specific to American Coastal's Florida Hurricane Catastrophe Fund. Given our  participation on the underlying $25 million in excess of $20 million layer, our expected retention now from a second event is estimated at $31.8 million for the group. UPC's operating expenses were $75 million, a decrease of $1.3 million or 2% year over year. However, this was offset in the G&A expense line due to the amortization of the $13.6 million goodwill charge related to impairment of goodwill on our personal lines segment. -- $64.8 million, which impacted the value per share by approximately $1.50 per share. And finally, statutory policyholder surplus for the group at the end of the third quarter is currently estimated to be approximately $170 million."
