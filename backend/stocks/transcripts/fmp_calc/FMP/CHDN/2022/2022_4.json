    "content": " We are well positioned for ongoing growth in the coming years fueled by our acquisition of the P2E assets and by the organic investments that we are making in our iconic asset, Churchill Downs Racetrack, our HRM projects in numerous states and our Terra Haute project in Indiana, all of which collectively will drive a material increase in adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow in 2023, 2024 and beyond. The acquisition of six new HRM properties and Colonial Downs Racetrack in Virginia, the Del Lago gaming property in New York and the Hard Rock Iowa gaming property contributed $109 million of net revenue and $48 million of adjusted EBITDA in the fourth quarter. We also expect to layer on growth from the addition of our Turfway Park HRM property that we opened in September, the addition of the Derby City Gaming downtown property in the City of Louisville, and longer-term from our Ellis Park and Owensboro, Kentucky HRM properties as well as our Chasers, HRM and table game facility in Salem, New Hampshire. Based on the addition of the first turn experience and expected growth in sponsorships and other Derby Week economics, we expect 2023 adjusted EBITDA for Churchill Downs Racetrack overall to grow $10 million to $15 million. The increase in maintenance capital for 2023 is driven by the addition of our Virginia, New York, Iowa and Ellis Park properties, maintenance projects anticipated at Churchill Downs Racetrack in preparation for the 150th Kentucky Derby and incremental maintenance projects at our regional gaming facilities."
