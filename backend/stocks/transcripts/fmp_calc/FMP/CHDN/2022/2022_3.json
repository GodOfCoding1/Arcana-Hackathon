    "content": " Regarding our equity investments, Rivers Des Plaines delivered record revenue and record adjusted EBITDA in the third quarter, reflecting the benefit of the property's gaming floor expansion during the first half of this year. First, if you exclude the two businesses that we have exited, Arlington and our online sports and casino business our net revenue would have been up $15 million or 4% higher for the third quarter compared to the prior year quarter. We had strong growth in net revenue in third quarter from our Oak Grove and Newport, HRM facilities, our Churchill Downs Racetrack, and our Calder Fair Grounds, and Ocean Downs Gaming properties, as well as for our TwinSpires horseracing business. Our three existing HRM properties in Kentucky excluding Turfway Park, delivered another strong quarter with combined revenue up 14% and adjusted EBITDA up 15% compared to the prior year quarter. Newport Gaming continues to benefit from the expansion and redesign of the gaming floor, delivering over a 60% increase in net revenue and more than doubling its adjusted EBITDA for the quarter compared to the prior year quarter. And last, regarding our third quarter results for our wholly owned gaming properties, our gaming margin of 36% for our wholly owned properties excluding our racetracks, was up 30 basis points compared to the prior year quarter and up 7.8 points compared to the third quarter of 2019."
