    "content": " We're also pleased to announce that we've recently been able to close new patient screening in our Phase II study of NYX-458 in cognitive impairment associated with Parkinson's disease and we therefore, expect to complete enrollment in the next few weeks. As enrollment nears completion, it's not clear, that the majority of patients in the study will have a diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment or dementia associated with Parkinson's disease and there will be relatively fewer patients with dementia with Lewy body. While this current study focuses on Parkinson's disease, we believe that positive data would unlock the opportunity to further develop NYX-458 across other cognitive impairment conditions. Despite an increase in clinical development activity in PTSD across the industry, which has increased competition for sites and patients, we've seen steady progress over the past few months and we remain on track to report data from the study in the second half of 2023. Well so for 783 in terms of exclusion criteria variance, I think in general terms there's \u00e2\u0080\u0093 as there was in the last study, obviously we're looking for a certain extent of symptom severity."
