    "content": " Unfortunately, we don't see a broad improvement in supply constraints throughout 2022, given the disconnect between current demand and our ability to fulfill it coupled with the expected continued strength in new bookings, our operations teams have been strategically building inventory as it becomes available. Semi-Cap revenues were up 12% sequentially and 62% year-over-year, demand levels throughout 2022 remain high for our complex precision machining and large electromechanical assembly services, which are primarily related to front-end wafer fab equipment. Industrials revenue for the first quarter were up 10% sequentially and 44% year-over-year from demand improvements from oil and gas, building infrastructure and lidar applications. In the telco sector, revenues were down 2% sequentially, but up 12% year-over-year, primarily from demand improvement for satellite programs and new broadband ramps. With this as the backdrop and in consideration of our March quarter performance and our June quarter outlook, we expect 2022 revenue growth to be above our midterm model at 10% or better, depending on our ability to close supply. And in terms of decommits, I mean, we kind of hoped, maybe naively in the second quarter of last year that, hey, by first quarter of 2022, we would be flushing parts and it's just been \u2013 it's been a challenging environment and I think Q1 wasn't any really significantly better than the back end of 2021."
