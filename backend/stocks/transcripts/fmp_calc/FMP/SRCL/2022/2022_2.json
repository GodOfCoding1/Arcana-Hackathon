    "content": " The $17.5 million decline was principally from higher supply chain, wage adjustments and other inflationary costs of approximately $15 million, higher headcount, overtime and onboarding costs of $10 million, higher bad debt expense of $9.8 million due to normalizing bad debt as well as continued North America Secure Information Destruction billing and collection efforts related to the ERP deployment and higher adjusted litigation settlements and regulatory compliance expenses of $7.3 million. The year-over-year decline of $168.2 million was mainly driven by the expected FCPA settlement payments in the quarter of $75.8 million, other timing changes in net working capital of $54.6 million, mainly driven by accounts receivable reflecting the continued North America Secure Information Destruction billing and collection efforts related to the ERP deployment and lower cash generated from income from operations of $37.8 million, as shown on Slide 9."
