    "content": " In North America, Secure Information Destruction organic revenues increased $57.3 million or 36.1% compared to the third quarter of 2021, when we deployed the ERP, which impacted both our volume and normal pricing actions. The $101.2 million increase was principally due to the FCPA litigation settlement accrual recorded in the third quarter of 2021 of $61 million, 2022 commercial pricing levers and incremental volume as previously discussed, resulting in revenue flow-through of $34.6 million, nonrecurring typical ERP start-up challenges in the third quarter of 2021 of an estimated $13.2 million, divestiture losses in the third quarter of 2021 of $10.9 million, and lower annual incentive compensation expense in 2022 of $3.6 million."
