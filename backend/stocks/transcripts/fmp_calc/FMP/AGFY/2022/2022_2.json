    "content": " For the second quarter, we ended up generating $19.3 million in revenue, which equates to a 63.5% increase from the period \u00e2\u0080\u0093 from the prior year period. The increase in our second quarter 2022 revenue was solely attributable to the incremental revenue generated by our extraction division of approximately $10 million, which was partially offset by a decline in our design and build revenue of approximately $1.7 million and cultivation equipment revenue up 759,000. Total gross profit in the associated gross profit margin in the second quarter of 2022 was $1.6 million or roughly 8% of total revenue compared to gross profit of 527,000 or 5% of total revenue in the year ago quarter. Extraction related revenues achieve a gross margin of approximately 23% in the second quarter of 2022 with cultivation associated revenue including TTK-related revenues, which in the current quarter consisted primarily of design build revenue, contributing a negative gross profit margin of approximately 7%. The comparative increase in G&A expenses in 2022 is largely attributable to an $8.6 million increase in bad debt reserves associated with trade and loans receivable and $800,000  approval in accordance with tentative agreements to settle one of the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s legal disputes and increases in G&A expenses related to the incremental G&A assumed in connection with our recent acquisitions. As it relates to our second quarter 2022 increase in bad debt reserves, approximately $7.1 million of the current quarter reserve is specifically related to Greenstone Holdings. Sales and marketing expenses totaled $2.3 million in the second quarter of 2022, compared to 782,000 in the second quarter of 2021. The comparative increase in second quarter 2022 sales and marketing expenses is also directly related to the company increasing the scale of its business and strategically focusing on investments in sales and marketing activities, such as headcount trade shows and marketing programs, each of these necessary to drive rapid growth. During the three month period ended June 30 2022, the company identified a potential impairment triggering event related to both a sustained decline in our stock price and our associated market capitalization, as well as a second quarter slowdown in the cannabis industry as a whole. Operating expenses in the second quarter of 2022 also includes the $907,000 reduction in operating expenses, which is primarily attributable to a change in our fair value estimates of the contingent consideration associated with the currently active Lab Society earn-out. Lightly touching upon other income expenses, the company is reporting total interest expense of $1.9 million during the second quarter of 2022, compared to interest income of $55,000 in the second quarter of 2021. Finally, the net results of the previously discussed changes in revenue, gross margin and operating expenses resulted in a net loss of $93.4 million or $3.51 per diluted share during the second quarter of 2022, compared to a loss of $5.6 million or $0.28 per diluted share in the year ago quarter. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re finalizing all these economics with our test customers at this point, but it will be a very different unit economics, with the RPD program that, I think will be a lot more universally adaptable and, very different from our TTK, our TTK obviously is, where we have to make substantial investments, on our front, we need to make sure that we get the proper return on investments, but with the RPD program, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to be very universally adaptable, because like I said, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, 350  plus pounds of production, it gets you up and running in less than $1.5 million. So, you look at what we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve done for cash burn, Q1, Q2, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been in ballpark $30 million each quarter, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m going to round a lot of that money has obviously been spent two fund of the construction aspect of TTK, as well as build inventory."
