    "content": " The comparative change in year-over-year, third quarter gross loss and gross margin primarily reflects the deferral of the previously discussed $5.3 million in third quarter 2022 design and build revenue offset by the incremental gross profit and gross profit margin contributions from our extraction related product sales. The comparative increase in G&A expenses in 2022 is largely attributable to a $15 million increase in bad debt reserves, primarily associated with our decision to place a full reserve against all of the outstanding receivable balances under the Bud & Mary\u00e2\u0080\u0099s TTK solution project., Approximately 1.1 million in severance related charges as the company has begun to streamline operations in response to the current industry headwinds in a comparative 500,000 increase in quarterly stock-based compensation as a result of equity awards issued to employees during the third quarter of 2022. Finally, the net results of the previously discussed changes in revenue, gross margin and operating expenses resulted in a reported net loss of $46.3 million or $17.33 per diluted share during the third quarter of 2022 compared to a loss of $9.8 million or $4.68 per diluted share in the year ago quarter."
