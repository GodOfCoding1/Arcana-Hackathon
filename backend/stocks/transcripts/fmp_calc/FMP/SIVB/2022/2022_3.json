    "content": " So, while we are still getting some benefit from a net interest income sensitivity perspective, that shift in mix to higher levels of interest bearing in this environment while we're seeing higher cash burn, and slower deployment, in the venture space is driving weaker net interest income on a quarter-to-quarter basis. Yes, in this environment, we clearly see some reduction in the overall size of the balance sheet, growth in the Tier 1 leverage ratio is now close to 8% at the bank as we think about next year, slowing cash burn, potentially seeing venture investments start to pick up, you could very quickly start to be in a spot where you need that capital to be able to support growth on a go forward basis."
