If you look at the private markets, we're down roughly 20% on a quarterly basis and I think that's fairly consistent with what we're seeing with investments in venture. So when I look at those factors on a go forward basis, we're -- for the guidance effectively looking at anywhere between $3 billion to $5 billion on a sequential quarter basis of a deposit decline, assuming that public markets effectively stay shut, assuming that we see sequential decline of 20% in Q3 of public market investment and as well as in Q4 and that effectively burn rate slow slightly, but stay at elevated levels. So if we look at the $137 million of investment losses, which are detailed on Page seven, that declines a bit more than we've seen in other periods, right, is over 8%, typically you're like 2% to 3%. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. So I think if just start there, I would say when you look at -- when we've done our analysis, we can go up by compared to a year ago or two years ago, you're looking at more than 50% growth in capacity from where we were and selectively even higher than that for the highest quality firms. There's also so many positives that have gone on the last few quarters such as the core fee, income growth and new client acquisition and having this strong loan pipeline, the team enhancements across all four businesses and even the support and infrastructure that again, we look around the table and just feel really, really good about what's being built."
