I think towards the end of this year, my sense is like, we're going to get more to what I'll call more of a normal cash balance level, because you're going to see the cash burn rates are still be elevated from the first half, they're going to be reducing, but they'll still be higher. I tried to kind of give a little bit of color in my opening comments, but the way to think about it is that we still expect in the first half of '23, that you're going to see kind of a 10% to 20%, roughly decline in venture capital. But what we do see in Q3 and Q4, with the guidance that we're going to see the slowdown in the decline in non-interest bearing deposits, plus the securities pay down each quarter that you kind of -- you get to a normalization of net interest income and margin, right around the midpoint of the year, And then can start to see some growth into the fourth quarter, just with those factors alone. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. I think as long as it's clear, we're going to continue to invest here, even in a more challenged 2023, across the elements that Greg mentioned that's key, I think, for us to emphasize, we're able to optimize that spend also, as we're looking at changing the mix between professional services, and cheaper, full-time employees."
