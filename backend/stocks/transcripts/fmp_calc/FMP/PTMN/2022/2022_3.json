    "content": " Our total investment income, core investment income and net investment income for the third quarter of 2022, all increased in comparison to the second quarter of 2022 as we started to see the impact that rising rates had in generating incremental revenues from our investments. Between the reduced cost of capital from our amended and extended credit facility with JPMorgan Chase, and the continued benefit of rising rates, we expect this quarter strong performance will continue going forward in future quarters, allowing us to increase our quarterly dividend by 6% to $0.67 per share. While our liability costs would also rise relative to their Q3 levels, we still expect a net positive benefit of approximately $0.08 per share, assuming all of our assets and liabilities are utilizing the same three month benchmark rates for the entirety of the quarter. Our debt securities portfolio at the end of the third quarter remained highly diversified with investments spread across 32 different industries, and 117 different entities, all while maintaining an average par balance per entity of approximately $3.4 million. This compares to total investment income for the second quarter 2020 of $15 million and overall increase of $3.6 million quarter-over-quarter due to the impact of rising rates, generating incremental revenue on our investment portfolio. I just want to make sure that I heard that correctly, that $2.2 million or so of JV income this quarter, should we kind of expect to run through going forward or we should be looking at that potentially a little bit lower?"
