    "content": " Investment activity was strong and although originations are still lower than the second half of 2021, during the second quarter, we deployed approximately $57.6 million of available cash in new investments net of refinancing existing borrowers and had an additional $20.6 million of new investments that closed in July. As Slide 9 of our earnings presentation shows, we anticipate normalized quarterly activity to result in NII per share that is greater than $0.70 with the majority of that increase relative to our second quarter NII per share, driven by new investments that have already closed. Our net asset value per share for the second quarter of 2022 was $27.26 per share as compared to $28.76 at March 31, 2022 with the decline associated with mark-to-market declines on both debt securities and our CLO equity portfolio. Total investment income for the second quarter was $15 million of which $11.9 million was attributable to interest income from our debt securities portfolio, inclusive of PIK income. Excluding the impact of purchase price accounting, our core investment income for the second quarter 2022 was $13.7 million. Our net investment income for the second quarter was $5.5 million or $0.57 per share, which was down due to timing associated with the closing of certain Q2 investments, reduced income from paydowns, lower CLO and accretion income recorded for the quarter in combination of higher interest expense on our variable debt. Due to the higher interest rate environment we are currently experiencing, we expect our investment income for future periods to be positively affected as the rates on our floating rate investments reset beyond certain rate floors embedded in our asset portfolio and we experienced the nearly complete quarter benefit of rate reset timing among many of our investments."
