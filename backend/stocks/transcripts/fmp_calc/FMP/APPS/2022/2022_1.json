    "content": " Our On-Device Media business set all time revenue records in the June quarter and generated over $120 million in revenue, which is 93% organic growth year-over-year, driving the strong organic growth with strong performance across the board in our Content Media, App Media and SingleTap business. As it was widely anticipated, we began to see some impact of Apple's IDFA changes late in the June quarter, as AdColony\u2019s less strategic performance business, which is less than 20% of total revenues declined year-over-year. On-Device Media revenue, which represents existing revenue derived from the company's application media inclusive of SingleTap, DSP and Content-Media, and platform products increased 93% year-over-year to $120.3 million. Yeah, so specifically on Samsung, I think it's important to highlight to investors we have all these new products, we've got our on-device products, whether it's our new Dynamic Installs, App Wizard that people are familiar with, but now we're talking about things like SingleTap or content media products, things that we now have as part of our acquisitions from Fyber and AdColony. Yeah, one of the things on that Tony is, we continue to say there's a lot of opportunity for revenue per device, we've been asked this for many years and it continues to go up into the right, I think we've seen both in our international business and our domestic business, as we've seen revenue per device in the June quarter go up 60% year-over-year which we're pretty excited about, it's north of $4 here in the United States."
