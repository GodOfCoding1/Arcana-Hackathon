    "content": " We've also prioritized resourcing our alternative App Store or hub business versus things like our prepaid content media business, which is less than 10% of our revenues and underperforming versus our expectations. For our on-device business, while our overall devices were up 10% year-over-year, the sale of new devices in the United States was the lowest we have seen in any one quarter since fiscal 2019 despite it being the holiday season. The alternative app stores will also help us further leverage our ad tech assets with applications supported by in-app advertising revenue, but the app stores will also help us with our first foray into the in-app purchasing market which is a $100 billion global addressable market today. As we consider the ongoing uncertainties in the macro environment, we currently expect revenue for full year fiscal 2023 to be between $660 million and $670 million and adjusted EBITDA to be between $165 million and $170 million and non-GAAP adjusted net income per diluted share to be between $1.15 and $1.20 based on approximately 104 million diluted shares outstanding and an effective tax rate of 25%."
