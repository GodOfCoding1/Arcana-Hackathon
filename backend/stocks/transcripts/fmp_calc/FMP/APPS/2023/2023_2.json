    "content": " As we discussed on our last earnings call, we have been focused on improving the overall quality of our product for advertisers while also prioritizing growth and our postpaid content, media business activities, as we believe that longer term growth is going to come from the postpaid market that has approximately 300 million subscribers here in the U.S., compared to approximately 75 million for prepaid. While our strategic shift to prioritizing growth from the postpaid content media business has resulted in short-term headwinds on prepaid daily active users, our other On-Device businesses would have experienced modest growth year-over-year. Our ODS segment was down 16% over prior year, largely driven by the near-term headwinds Bill discussed as we evolve our content media products, which were partially offset by the modest growth experienced on our app media products as North America RPD yields continue to expand. Our adjusted EBITDA 48.2 million in the quarter increased 1% over prior and our EBITDA margin expanded to 27.6, up approximately 200 basis points over the prior year. We currently expect revenue for Q3 to be between 180 million and 190 million, and adjusted EBITDA to be between 53 million and 57 million, and non-GAAP adjusted net income per diluted share to be between $0.36 and $0.39, based on approximately 104 million diluted shares outstanding and an effective tax rate of 25%. In that fourth part of it, I really just view this very similar to we started the dynamic install business many, many years ago, where you start with one material player, you get going, then that player wants to expand to do more and more, whether that's in you know, more geographies, or more ad types, or whatever it happens to be in this case, and then continue to expand it to other providers, but you go deeper with the ones you've got, you go broader with new ones."
