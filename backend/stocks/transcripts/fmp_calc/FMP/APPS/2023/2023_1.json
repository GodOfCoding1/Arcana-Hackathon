    "content": " As we turn towards the future, I want to highlight our top 3 priorities, which are: first, focusing on the fundamentals of our business and executing on the $300 billion total addressable market; secondly, integrating our companies into one; and third, making the right strategic moves so the company is, as Wayne Gretzky famously said, skating where the puck is going, not where it's been. Our adjusted EBITDA of $51.9 million in the quarter increased 30% over prior year, and our EBITDA margin expanded to 28%, up approximately 300 basis points over the prior year. I'm proud that our operating leverage and consistent EBITDA growth is being achieved even as we continue to make a number of focused near-term investments, primarily within our sales force and technology teams to support new partners and products to drive future incremental revenues on the platform. As we consider the ongoing macro environment, we currently expect revenue for Q2 to be between $170 million and $180 million; and adjusted EBITDA to be between $46 million and $50 million; and non-GAAP adjusted net income per diluted share to be between $0.32 and $0.34 based on approximately 104 million diluted shares outstanding, with an effective tax rate of 25% on our non-GAAP adjusted net income."
