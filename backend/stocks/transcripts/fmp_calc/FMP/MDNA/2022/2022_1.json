    "content": " Before we begin, I would like to remind you that certain statements and information shared during this call constitute forward-looking information within the meaning of applicable securities laws and relate to the future operations of the company and other statements that are not historical facts; including statements related to the clinical potential and development of the MDNA11, MDNA55 in BiSKITs program; the potential of the SuperKine platform; partnering activities; cash runway; and the presentation of additional data. We\u2019ll also be looking at the peripheral biomarkers and immune cells markers to see signs of anti-cancer immune cell activation, a lack of activation of key rights and pro-inflammatory and sensitive tumor microenvironment, which would confirmed that MDNA11 is making the tumor microenvironment more immunogenic, which in turn would bode well for subsequent data readouts. But what we have achieved with MDNA11 is that by virtue of us fusing our molecule to argument, there is considerable amount of data to also support the fact that molecules like MDNA11, that have an argument domain can to passively accumulate in the tumor itself, as well as the know from data that they accumulate in tumor draining lymph nodes, both of those accumulations of our IL-2 are crucial because they provide, we believe a much better safety profile, but also localized stimulation of the immune cells."
