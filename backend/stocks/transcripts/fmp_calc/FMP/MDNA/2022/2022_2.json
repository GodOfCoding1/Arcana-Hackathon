The increase in R&D expenses in the current year's quarter is primarily attributable to higher CMC costs associated with GLP and GMP manufacturing of MDNA11 which is now predominantly complete, increased preclinical expenses associated with GLP compliant MDNA11 IND enabling studies, which are also now predominantly complete, as well as discovery work on the BiSKITs platform, and higher salary and benefit costs associated with a larger headcount necessary to support increased activities.
