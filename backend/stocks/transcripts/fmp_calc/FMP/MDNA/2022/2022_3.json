    "content": " Before we begin, I would like to remind you that certain statements and information shared during this call constitute forward-looking information within the meaning of applicable securities laws and relate to the future operations of the company, and other statements that are not historical facts, including statements related to, the clinical potential and development of the MDNA11, including expected milestones, MDNA55, and BiSKITs programs, the potential of the Superkine platform, partnering activities, cash runway, and the presentation of additional data. I have discussed this dataset extensively on past earnings calls, so I won't go through it in detail today, but will say that MDNA11\u2019s preclinical data indicate that the long-acting superkine, may overcome the safety and TK challenges of the FDA-approved IL-2 drug Proleukin, and suggest that we may have superior efficacy compared to competing not-alpha IL-2 variants. We are collecting those data, but the early indications have been pretty much driven by the fact that we've seen the stimulation of lymphocytes, the CD8 T-cells, the NK cells, at much, much lower doses based on IL-2 content in MDNA11, when you compare with three or four other companies that are ahead of us, and have presented or published the data with respect to the same parameters that we are measuring."
