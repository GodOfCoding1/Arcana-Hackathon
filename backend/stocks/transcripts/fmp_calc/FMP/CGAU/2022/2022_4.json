    "content": " There were 189,000 ounces of payable gold and 74 million pounds of copper produced by Mount Milligan in 2022 and 55,000 ounces of gold produced and sold by the \u00c3\u0096ks\u00c3\u00bct Mine in Q1 2022 prior to the shutdown of operations on March 18, 2022. In January, we announced Mount Milligan's guidance for the year which includes gold production of 160,000 to 170,000 ounces, copper production of 60 million to 70 million pounds, gold production costs of $900 to $950 an ounce and all-in sustaining costs on a byproduct basis of $1,075 to $1,125 an ounce. Mount Milligan's gold production for 2023 of 160,000 to 170,000 ounces and copper production of 60 million to 70 million pounds is expected to be weighted higher in the second half of the year with approximately 30% to 35% of the concentrate sales expected to occur in the fourth quarter. In October 2022, we released a new reserve estimate and life-of-mine plan showing an increase of 1.1 million contained ounces of gold and 260 million pounds of contained copper which extended the mine life by 4 years to 2023 -- 2033. As of year-end 2022, the estimated proven and probable gold mineral reserves at Mount Milligan totaled 2.6 million ounces of contained gold. At the \u00c3\u0096ks\u00c3\u00bct Mine, proven and probable reserves totaled an estimated 0.9 million ounces of contained gold as of December 31, 2022, compared to the estimated 1.1 million ounces of contained gold as of year-end 2021. The earnings in the quarter attributable to operations were $30 million contributed from the Mount Milligan Mine, a $3.4 million loss on the \u00c3\u0096ks\u00c3\u00bct Mine and a $5 million loss from the Molybdenum Business Unit."
