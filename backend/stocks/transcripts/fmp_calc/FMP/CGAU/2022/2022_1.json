    "content": " And again in parenthesis, you can see the individual contributions at the individual mine site; Mount Milligan producing its gold as low as $15 per ounce and \u00d6ks\u00fct producing its gold as low as $451 per ounce in terms of the all-in sustaining cost metric. The first bullet point, as I mentioned earlier, Mount Milligan had a very good quarter with regards to metal output, especially so in terms of copper production, which was fortuitous, just given the strong prevailing copper price environment. Free cash flow from continuing operations for the quarter was 9.1 million, once again impacted by the timing of the Mount Milligan fourth shipment cash receipt, together with the negative free cash flow of 20.1 million from the Molybdenum business unit. The earnings in the quarter attributable to operations were 45.6 million contributed from the Mount Milligan mine, 67.4 million contributed from the \u00d6ks\u00fct mine and $6.4 million loss from the Molybdenum business unit. The Mount Milligan guidance remains unchanged at $575 to $625 per ounce for the year, with a targeted gold production of between 190,000 to 210,000 ounces of gold, and 70 million to 80 million pounds of copper.
