These include statements about our future plans and expectations, clinical results, regulatory, and other developments, and time lines related to our product candidates, including our plans to continue working with the FDA as they review our BLA resubmission, and continuing efforts towards securing a potential FDA approval for and commercialization of teplizumab for an at-risk indication, as well as the planned delivery of significant catalysts over the next 24 months. As Thierry will explain, our cash-based operating expenses were well within guidance and we closed the quarter with a cash balance in excess of $113 million, efficient to take us beyond potential teplizumab launch and into next year, despite the worldwide macroeconomic challenges we're all witnessing. The decrease in net loss compared to the first quarter of 2021, is attributable to a $7.1 million income tax benefit the company recognized during the period and a $2.3 million decrease in research and development costs primarily driven by decreased costs for the protect trial as target enrollment was reached in August 2021 as well as lower-cost for the manufacturing and regulatory activities with teplizumab compared to the prior year. Thanks for the question, Tom. Thanks for the question, Tom."
