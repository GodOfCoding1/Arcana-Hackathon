    "content": " In summary, we achieved another quarter of sales growth and grew backlog to record levels once again, showing the strength in end market demand, and the desire our customers have, for our high value products and services. Due to strong end market demand, we once again reached record backlog levels, increasing 98.4% to $834.7 million at quarter end, driven by both material solutions and infrastructure solutions orders, which were up 90.7% and 103.3%, respectively. First quarter adjusted EBITDA decreased 10% to $18.8 million, compared to the prior year period, as cost inflation was slightly ahead of favorable volume price and mix, and Omicron related manufacturing challenges we incurred early in the quarter. Turning to Slide 13, our material solution sales increased 13% to $93.7 million, compared to the same period a year ago, driven by increased demand across product lines and regions, with domestic sales up 11.9% and international sales up 16.1% versus the first quarter of 2021. Material solutions backlog at the end of the quarter increased 90.7% to $317 million, driven by continued dealer restocking and strong market activity. But we feel good that maybe that part of the variances are behind us, in regards to the COVID-related absenteeism, and now we can simply just focus on supply chain and logistics issues, which ultimately narrow our really our biggest constraint for us to continue to grow our volumes and reduce that backlog, and deliver product to our customers, as they continue to have a high demand for everything that we provide really across the board, Steve."
