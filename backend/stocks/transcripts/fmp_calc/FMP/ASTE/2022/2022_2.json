Segment gross profit was essentially flat at $38.4 million and gross margin decreased 330 basis points to 18.3% driven by the negative impact of inflation, supply chain and logistics challenges and manufacturing efficiencies. Segment gross profit decreased 19.8% to $21.9 million and gross margin decreased 750 basis points to 20.4% due to the combination of a strong comparison in Q2 of 2021, cost inflation and manufacturing inefficiencies."
