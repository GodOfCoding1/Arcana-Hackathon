    "content": " So as we move forward into through the rest of 2022 to 2023, we'll continue to look at pricing to take actions there appropriately in order to make sure that we're positioned appropriately in the marketplace to really deliver the value and get the value that we're providing to our customers. Now when I talk to customers, yes, they're experiencing some inflationary type impact, but they've also got great pricing capability that they'll be able to take advantage of and we'll continue to take advantage of as we move forward in time. We had $40 million to $50 million as the range and we've dropped that to $35 million to $45 million, and it's really timing on when we're receiving the goods that are on order and when they'll go into actually usage."
