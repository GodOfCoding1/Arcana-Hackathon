One of the things that we did in this year\u00e2\u0080\u0099s budget is really focus our investments for those three strategic initiatives that we talked about around solidifying our leadership in Workforce Identity, capturing more of the market in Customer Identity, and then obviously, the scale and automation I just talked about. We still got 11 months left in the year, and we want to make sure that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re just being thoughtful about all those factors, given...\n Are you seeing any specific things that worry you like, hey, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s reasons to believe that new customers are going to further deteriorate relative to what we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re seeing, which I think I heard, sales pipelines look okay? On the workforce side, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s -- like I mentioned, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s -- are we going to use the cloud for identity and security and there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lots of forces, whether it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s great solutions like Okta, whether it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just legacy maintenance contracts expiring. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re too weighted towards upsells, and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s something we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re focused on, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s -- and it could be -- it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s definitely like a factor of the macro, but we got to get better at doing new business in the future."
