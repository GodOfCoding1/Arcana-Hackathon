    "content": " The decrease in revenues was primarily due to the manufacturing hold and recall of SYMJEPI in 2022 offset by the product launch sales of ZIMHI Selling general and administrative expenses for the first six months ending June 30, 2022 and 2021 were approximately $7.6 million and $8.5 million respectively. We also expect to receive additional proceeds during the second half of 2022, which could range from collections of approximately $2 million to $3.5 million, pursuant to our sale of certain USC assets to Fagron in 2021 and from the disposition of remaining USC assets."
