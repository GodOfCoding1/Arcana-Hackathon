According to data reported by the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers, CAAM, in the second half 2022, commercial vehicle unit sales, excluding sales of gasoline-powered and electric-powered vehicles, decreased by 26.3% compared to the second half of 2021, as sales of trucks and buses declined by 27.5% and 18.4%, respectively, reflecting weak demand in these market segments. Research and development, R&D, expenses decreased by 19.7% to RMB428 million or US$61.4 million compared with RMB533.1 million in the second half of 2021 due to lower R&D expenses incurred in commercial vehicle engines that were partially offset by higher R&D expenses incurred in marine engines and power generation engines and new energy products. Total R&D expenditures, including capitalized costs, were RMB540.8 million, or US$77.6 million, representing 7.3% of revenue in second half 2022 as compared to RMB712.2 million, representing 8.3% of revenue in second half 2021.
