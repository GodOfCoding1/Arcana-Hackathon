And since we closed the CBS Radio merger 5 years ago, the company has steadily driven higher levels of productivity and these efforts have enabled us to reduce our full-time and our part-time workforce based on full-time equivalents by over one-third, while investing strongly in building our national sales team, our digital organization and our technology team among other organizational capabilities. Our fourth quarter cash flow benefited from strong political revenues, $40 million of proceeds from the sale of land and property in Las Vegas in November, a significant reduction in our investment in working capital, which is the fruit of a collaborative effort by many people across our organization, and a two-thirds reduction in our capital expenditures, which came in at $8 million for the fourth quarter versus an average of $24 million per quarter, September year to date.
