So we see accelerated streaming growth as a very, very attractive source of accretion to the overall operating margin of Audacy over time that we also believe, like we've taken \u00e2\u0080\u0093 our podcast business has been rough because we've had a number of large clients that we acquired as part of Cadence13 that have exited over the years because we really could meet their expectations for added revenue share. And so look, I think when we get to better economic conditions that we're going to see sustained recovery in spot radio, we believe we're positioned to participate more fully in the digital audio advertising marketplace, and that's going to show up in revenue growth, that's going to show up in our expanding EBITDA margin and improved free cash flow."
