Sports betting, which in the first quarter was our second largest spot advertising category, was up over 50% year-over-year and is currently pacing up even stronger in the second quarter. Our total operating expenses for the first quarter came in at $266.8 million, and excluding onetime and unusual items and adjusting out noncash costs, our total cash operating expenses were $249.3 million or up 8% year-over-year. And if you think about all the pieces that we've been building in terms of our -- the strength of our broadcast business and our differentiated content there, our strong podcast platform, our streaming audio and now what we expect will be an acceleration of the growth of our supply on our digital platform, as Rich alluded to, because of the investments we're making there and the releases that are coming up."
