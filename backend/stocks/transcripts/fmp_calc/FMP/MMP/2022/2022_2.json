    "content": " Operating expenses for the crude oil segment increased slightly primarily due to the higher integrity and maintenance spending, in particular, on the splitter, which has -- which had a turnaround this quarter, partially offset by lower power costs as a result both of lower Longhorn volumes and our ongoing optimization efforts. If you look right now what's happening, I wouldn't say that we're seeing dramatic improvements today in that differential, what we can earn today versus what we could earn yesterday, but directionally speaking, the forward curves pricing and wider differentials, so we would expect those to improve from here. This is a good example of that where we had -- if we had losses in the first quarter, let's say, on some hedges, and they affected first quarter net income, but we bring that into a reconciliation for this quarter's DCF because when we settled the trades in this quarter, we said, okay, that prior period income hit, we're bringing into this period and now reducing EBITDA for those. So I don't know if there's really -- there's not really more precision I can put on that right now, saying next year's CapEx is going to be Y, therefore, we're only going to buy back Z working units or have a certain amount of free cash flow."
