So we're going to get higher utilization essentially committed over roughly a six year period versus if you hadn't gotten it, that weighted average term would have gone down probably by about a year just because of the years passed since we last talked about it. And as an MLP, depending on where you're at in your own individual tax status and you start taxing some of those yields, and I think that's an additional benefit to investors in our units our ability to defer a lot of that yield for some period of time, again, depending on when they've come in and where they're at. We're going to continue to -- we understand that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an important part of our value proposition, and at the same time on unit buybacks, it's going to remain subject to our views of value, and timing, and so I don't think that changes that a great deal for us."
