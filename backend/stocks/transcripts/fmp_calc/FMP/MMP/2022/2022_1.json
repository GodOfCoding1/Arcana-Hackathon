    "quarter": 1,
    "year": 2022,
    "date": "2022-05-05 16:16:07",
    "content": " Adjusted earnings per unit for the quarter, which excludes the impact of mark-to-market adjustments, was $1.10, exceeding our guidance for the quarter of $1.02 primarily due to the impact of higher commodity prices and our tender revenue and product gains as well as higher-than-expected refined product shipments. Operating expenses for the refined products segment decreased slightly between periods, a benefit from more favorable product overages, which reduced operating expenses, more than offset other expense increases we experienced this quarter, including higher power costs, which were higher primarily due to the benefit in the prior year from gains on power hedges, again in connection with the winter storms I already mentioned. BridgeTex volumes were approximately 285,000 barrels per day in the first quarter of '22, down from nearly 300,000 barrels per day in 2021 partially due to the timing of when our committed shippers have elected to move volumes under their commitments, while Saddlehorn volumes increased to more than 220,000 barrels per day compared to approximately 180,000 barrels per day the year before primarily driven by the ramp-up of new commitments associated with the pipeline's expansion."
