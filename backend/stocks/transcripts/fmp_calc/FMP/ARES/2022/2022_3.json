    "content": " Yes, I think the good news is, the market is still fairly fragmented, but in my opinion beginning to consolidate, and it's consolidating with managers like Ares who have a couple of things going for them; one, a broad and diverse set of products that's attractive to the financial advisor and retail community; two, strong performance in those products; three, a commitment to distribution in education in that channel as evidenced by the 130 plus people that we have in and around our Wealth Management Solutions business; and four is a deep and long-standing relationship with the street and the wire platforms having raised and manage things like ARCC and ACRE and all work institutional funds that already sit in the hands of a lot of high-net worth clients."
