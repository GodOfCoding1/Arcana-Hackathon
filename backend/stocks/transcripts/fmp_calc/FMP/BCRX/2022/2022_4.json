    "content": " We ended 2022 with a total number of patients on ORLADEYO that we expected and the patient growth trends we see in the U.S. and around the world give us confidence not only in our 2023 trajectory, but also that ORLADEYO peak revenue will reach $1 billion. So I think as far as clarify, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re just continuing the messages that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been delivering about how well ORLADEYO is working in patients particularly over the long-term, you look at our long-term data or 96-week data where patients were getting down to 16 out of 17 months attack-free what we will see at Quad AI is more data of the same coming out from our clinical trials that confirm that. And so it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u0093 it will take a little time to get that fully enrolled until we get to the \u00e2\u0080\u0093 but what we are seeing and one thing that we are present this week at Quad AI is just the overall burden of treatment and of HAE identified by both caregivers, parents and patients. So, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s factored in, the way to think about OpEx for the year, so flat year-over-year, but what we have said is that commercial expenditure is going to increase based on the additions that Charlie has talked about predominantly here in the U.S. as well as expansion from a global perspective, given that we are now in 15 countries and we will be doing the business in more. Absolutely, so when we talk about the $1 billion, we still see about 20% of that is coming from Europe and the rest of the world and all the trends in those \u00e2\u0080\u0093 in the 15 countries where we have launched so far, give us confidence that we will get to that 20%...\n And then with regard to the competitors, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a pretty crowded space, but with regard to oral specifically, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been challenging for some to advance their programs."
