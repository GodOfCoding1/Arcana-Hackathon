    "content": " Overall, the goals of this program are twofold; one, to quickly bring a first molecule to market, putting BioCryst in a position to deliver the first safe and effective oral monotherapy Factor D inhibitor to patients across multiple complement-mediated diseases. This steady growth, driven by the consistency of new starts and stabilizing DC rates, coupled with continued global expansion, gives us confidence that Q4 will deliver double-digit percentage growth over Q3, and as Charlie said, we are forecasting revenue for full year 2022 at $255 million. And you saw that this year with Anthony's guidance, I mean, we're a little more than what, $100 million apart for the year in terms of revenue and expense. And so we think we're the most accurate guider and we believe we're telling you right now that we believe we'll finish the year at $255 million and that's a spectacular outcome given that we blew away the first year with $122 million, so more than doubling. And then on the Inflation Reduction Act, I think there's a lot of implementation, a lot of unknowns yet that have to occur before we can draw any conclusions and maybe we are different than others, but we're not going to say we're not going to bring a molecule forward in a bunch of other indications when patients are in need, and we think that we can create real value for shareholders. So Gena, the one-year retention overall, yes, in the mid-60 percentage -- and then what we're really seeing is -- and we've talked about this before, is where we lose the majority of patients is in the first few months and up to six months. So, Tazeen, I think looking forward into the new year, I think we'll see the same kind of seasonality that we saw last year kind of going into Q1 as we talked about, that's always a time when the majority or a good portion of the patients have to go through prior authorization."
