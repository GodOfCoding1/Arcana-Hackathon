    "content": " With nearly $50 million in net revenue in the first quarter of this year, ORLADEYO quarterly sales continue to provide us with real world evidence and confidence quarter-after-quarter that we remain on track for no less than $250 million in net revenue this year, a $1billion in global peak sales. This improved access is important not only because more patients are receiving paid therapy, but also because they -- we are seeing that 70% of patients who reach paid therapy continue on ORLADEYO for at least 12 months compared to 60% retention for patients who remain on long-term free product. That's just 25% to 30% share out of the 7,500 diagnosed and treated patients and would generate up to $800 million in annual sales from the U.S alone. A favorable reception that ORLADEYO is getting from regulators, payers, physicians and patients across countries and regions bodes well strategy to bring ORLADEYO to patients around the world on our way to $1 billion in peak global sales. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. So, what we're really pleased about is how well we're getting patients onto reimbursement and what that's leading to is, launched to date, about two-thirds of the patients who started on ORLADEYO are still on ORLADEYO, and we're building this really stable base of patients who are doing great. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. Because it seems like without 100% relief of attacks in a clinical trial, not  realize the patients who stay on, but in the clinical trial there's still room to have an even better molecule. Your line is now open."
