    "content": " In the quarter, we delivered 16% core organic growth, $1.68 billion of COVID-19 testing revenue, $7.25 for adjusted earnings per share, and $1.6 billion of free cash flow. Revenue in Q1 was just over $1 billion higher than we'd incorporated in our previous 2022 guidance, with $700 million driven by a very strong start of the year for the core business and just under $400 million from testing. Core organic revenue growth in the quarter was 16% and as I mentioned, we delivered $1.68 billion of COVID-19 testing revenue. In the quarter, we saw a strong underlying growth in our healthcare market channel, transplant diagnostics and clinical diagnostics businesses, which was offset by lower COVID-19 testing revenue versus the year ago quarter. So, let me get into the details of the guidance raise, in terms of revenue there are three elements driving the raising guidance, $350 million higher assumed COVID-19 testing revenue for the year, a $200 million decrease due to the change in FX rates and a $300 million increase in the outlook for the core business. In terms of adjusted EPS, our stronger business outlook is enabling us to raise the 2022 adjusted EPS guidance by $0.22 from $22.43 to $22.65 further building on an already very strong outlook for the year. PPD our clinical research business is now expected to deliver $6.7 billion in 2022 in revenue, which represents 11% core organic growth on a full year basis for this business, up three percentage points from our previous guidance.
