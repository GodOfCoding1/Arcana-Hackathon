    "content": " For the quarter, we delivered revenue of $280 million and EBITDA of $64 million, lower than last year but still significantly higher than the fourth quarter of 2019, with revenue up 16% and EBITDA up 48% compared to that period. Within our segment results for Q4, we saw mostly flat revenue comparisons to last year with $3.5 million of additional property level labor costs being incurred across the portfolio. And so if you just take the midweek rate, which is roughly around $110, including resort fee, average spend per visitor, assuming double occupancy and run that type of flow-through through the various components, whether it's gaming revenue or F&B, that is where we see $30 million in revenue and $20 million EBITDA opportunity just to get those folks back."
