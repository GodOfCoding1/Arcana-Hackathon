    "content": " While we always expected Q2 of 2021 to be a challenging comp due to the pent-up demand and stimulus impacting last year, we achieved sequential revenue and adjusted EBITDA growth of 6% and 11%, respectively, over Q1, demonstrating the positive trends of our business. For our Nevada Local Casinos, revenues were $39.8 million compared to $43.5 million a year ago, and adjusted EBITDA was $19.8 million for the quarter compared to $23.6 million in Q2 of 2021. I guess my first question would be, obviously, I mean the stock market has been more volatile than casino EBITDA generation that we've seen out there, and you utilize half or almost half of your $50 million share repurchase authorization."
