    "content": " Getting into our segment results for Q3, revenues for Nevada Casino Resorts was $98.9 million, while EBITDA was $30.1 million, with both of those metrics down year-over-year, reflecting the elevated STRAT performance last July, as well as the impact from higher labor and utility costs in the quarter. Our Nevada Locals Casinos reported revenue of $37.7 million and EBITDA of $16.8 million, reflecting the impact of higher August seasonality compared to last year in addition to the cost increases, we've seen in other areas of our business. The hurdle rate is high for us to pursue those as we've talked about in the past, but we think given where the balance sheet sits right now, we're fortunate where we can look at opportunities, invest in our own assets and have the flexibility to return capital to shareholders. So right now we feel like we're on the right track in order to harvest visitation, that is really going to be predicated on those drivers to the city, whether it's increased sporting events the citywide and as you get into next year, we have a very stacked calendar for Q1 when you think about, see as ConAg, what's happening in terms of March Madness and hosting the regional tournament here, so on and so forth. So, I think, our answer to all of that uncertainty and not being able to really pick a particular tell out of the macroeconomy is, as Charles mentioned in his comments, to have a strong balance sheet right now is really what our focus is to be prepared for either way that this thing goes and right now to your point we're not seeing it tail-off to any extent that they're talking about on a macro level. So that just, again, goes to show we just said it really tough comp at that property, when you look July year-over-year, but again I don't think we're having any meaningful supply chain issues right now and we don't see that going forward."
