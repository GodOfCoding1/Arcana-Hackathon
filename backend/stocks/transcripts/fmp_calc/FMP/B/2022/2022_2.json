    "content": " Second quarter sales were $321 million, essentially flat as compared to the prior year period with organic sales increasing 5%. At our automation business unit, a worsening economic outlook and weak operational performance led to a downward revision of its sales and cash flow forecasts, which among other factors triggered a non-cash impairment of approximately $68 million. Excluding the automation goodwill impairment charge and a small amount of residual restructuring, adjusted operating income was 40.1 million this year up 2% from an adjusted 39.2 million last year. Excluding the goodwill impairment and a small amount of restructuring charges in the current and prior years, adjusted operating profit of 19.5 million was down 29% and adjusted operating margin of 9.2% was down 250 basis points. At Aerospace, sales were $109 million, up 26% from a year ago, benefiting from continuing end market recovery. Excluding a small amount of restructuring charges in the current and prior years, adjusted operating profit of $20.6 million was up 76% from a year ago. An effective tax rate of 24% to 25%, excluding Reg G items, CAPEX of approximately $40 million to $50 million -- excuse me, $40 million to $45 million, which is lower than our prior view, average diluted shares of approximately $51 million, and cash conversion of approximately 100%."
