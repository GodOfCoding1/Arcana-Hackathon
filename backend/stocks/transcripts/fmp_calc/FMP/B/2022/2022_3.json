Operating profit was $30 million, down 31% from last year\u00e2\u0080\u0099s $43.7 million. Excluding net restructuring charges of approximately $9 million, adjusted operating income was $39 million this year, down 11% from $43.9 million last year. On an adjusted basis, excluding restructuring charges of $0.16 per share, net income per share of $0.49 was down 11% from $0.55 a year ago. In the quarter, interest expense was $3.4 million, a decrease of approximately $670,000 as a result of both lower average borrowings and a lower average interest rate versus a year ago. For the third quarter, sales were $204 million, down 12% from a year ago. Excluding $9.1 million of restructuring charges in the current year, adjusted operating profit of $18.3 million was down 39% and adjusted operating margin of 8.9% was down 410 basis points. At Aerospace, sales were $111 million, up 18% from a year ago, primarily driven by strength in the aftermarket business where sales grew 55%. Operating profit was $21.2 million, up 56% as compared to the prior year period. Excluding a favorable restructuring adjustment of $400,000, adjusted operating profit of $20.8 million was up 50% from last year. We anticipate interest expense of approximately $14.5 million and other expense of approximately $4 million, an effective tax rate of approximately 24.5%, excluding Reg G items, CapEx of approximately $35 million, which is lower than our prior view, average diluted shares of approximately $51 million and cash conversion of approximately 90%.
