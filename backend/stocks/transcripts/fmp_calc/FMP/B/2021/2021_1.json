    "content": " First quarter sales were $302 million, down 9% from the prior year period with organic sales declining 10% as ongoing impacts from the pandemic offset our aerospace end markets. Operating income was $32.4 million versus $49.3 million a year ago, compared to last year's adjusted operating income of $51.7 million the first quarter was down 37% and operating margin of 10.7% decreased 490 bps from last year's adjusted 15.6%. Your line is open. The team is one thing that has changed, I think, even more significantly in the last year, versus the enthusiasm of each one of the businesses to become even more aggressive, if you like, in terms of looking at opportunities in their end markets. Your line is open. The team has also as I mentioned, we had a great announcement of a $30 plus million order for the B2 bomber, which is \u2013 and again, I think exemplifies the unique capabilities that the aerospace team have in terms of super plastic forming, hot forming, cold forming on fabrications business. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open."
