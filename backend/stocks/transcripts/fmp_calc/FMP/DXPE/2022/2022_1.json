    "content": " Overall, we had a great first quarter that highlights good execution and a number of positive trends developing across DXP, including organic growth in most of our industrial markets, plus growth in new markets such as biofuels, carbon capture, air and water and wastewater. DXP's broad-based industrial end markets which is 73% of our business today appears to be showing some deceleration in growth, but remains above economic contraction and show signs of consistent demand and activity. We regard the broader demand recovery, underlying trends improving across business as the quarter progressed and trends were the strongest in March, which are sales per day going from $4.1 million per day in January to $5.8 million per day in March. Total DXP sales for Q1 increased 9% sequentially, 30% year-over-year or $319.4 million or an average of $5 million per business day for the first quarter. Overall, DXP produced EBITDA of $29.3 million and EBITDA as a percent of sales was 8.9%, which reflects the operating leverage we expect with significant organic sales growth. More specifically, Q1 takeaways are as follows: strong organic sales growth and contribution from acquisitions; meaningful organic sales increase within IPS along with another quarter increase in the IPS backlog; significant operating leverage, leading to improved adjusted EBITDA margins and continued share repurchases. In terms of operating income, combined, all three business segments increased 168 basis points in year-over-year business segment operating income margins or $13 million versus 2021."
