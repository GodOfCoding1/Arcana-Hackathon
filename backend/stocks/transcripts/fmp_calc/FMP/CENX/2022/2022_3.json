    "content": " The resulting high energy prices and lower aluminum prices significantly impacted our results in Q3, driving a third quarter adjusted EBITDA loss of $36 million. Indy Hub power prices in Q3 averaged $90 per megawatt hour, which is up 15% versus Q2, while Nord Pool prices averaged $177 per megawatt hour up more than 37% versus prior quarter. As Jessie Jesse, Indy Hub energy prices have decreased significantly since the end of Q3, averaging around $55 per megawatt hour quarter four to date. From a power perspective, we are assuming a base price of approximately $60 per megawatt hour for Indiana Hub and approximately $105 per megawatt hour for Nord Pool, which are in line with our current spot and market forward prices. So for example, if you look at slide 10, the Q4 outlook slide, power prices Nord Pool assumption $105 per megawatt hour and the Indy Hub power price $60 per megawatt hour, and that's a $50 million tailwind."
