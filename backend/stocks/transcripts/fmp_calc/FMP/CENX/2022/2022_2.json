    "content": " Indiana Hub power prices in Q2 averaged $78 per megawatt hour, which is up almost 60%, that's 6-0 percent, versus Q1, while normal prices averaged $129 a megawatt hour or up another 6% versus prior quarter. Lastly, we expect to see a net EBITDA benefit of $20 million to $30 million related to savings from our curtailment at the Hawesville plant as well as anticipated savings from our global cost reduction initiatives and the catch-up maintenance and top lining that I mentioned from Q2 is not expected to occur in Q3 as we should now be back to our normalized levels. With Nord Pool specifically, we've seen pretty strange pricing outcomes over the course of Q2 and into Q3, where you have some very high priced days and you have some days that are less than $10 per megawatt hour. But if you look at the broad strokes of the bill and the focus, there are some very positive things for aluminum, including renewable energy subsidies, which I think can help produce some of the renewable energy contracts and developments as we talked about earlier, including the EV subsidies, which again should produce additional demand for EV, which as I said in the past, are much more aluminum intensive than internal combustion engine vehicles, specifically, increases demand for sheet and extrusions, which demand the billet and slab that we produce in our U.S. value-added casthouses."
