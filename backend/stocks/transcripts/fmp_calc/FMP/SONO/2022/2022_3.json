    "content": " While our results weren't in line with our ambition, our teams executed well against this challenging backdrop, delivering constant currency revenue growth of 2% year-over-year on a reported basis, revenues of $371.8 million were down 2%. We delivered adjusted EBITDA of $42.1 million, representing a margin of 11.3%. As a result of the macroeconomic softness we are seeing, we are extending the time line we expect it to take to hit our long-term targets with $2.5 billion in revenue, 45% to 47% gross margins and 15% to 18% adjusted EBITDA margin. We delivered adjusted EBITDA of $42.1 million, representing a margin of 11.3%. We're also looking at the reviews from the media, from our customers and from our channel partners as it comes to new products like Ray and those are living up to the kind of reviews you would expect from any Sonos product and the feedback from retailers has been good. And then I would say the rest of the delta between, I think, what we were hoping to achieve in Q4 and what it looks like we're achieving in Q4 is really what we would attribute to macro softness from a demand standpoint across our product line, including how Ray is delivering."
