    "content": " Based on these considerations, the improvement of our in-stock position, our return to normal levels of promotional activity and the exciting new products we have planned for this year, in fiscal 2023, we expect to grow revenues between 1% to 7% constant currency at a 45% to 46% gross margin and deliver adjusted EBITDA of $145 million to $180 million, representing a margin of 8.5% at the low end and 10% at the high end. As I will outline in a minute, we expect to return to our target annual range of 45% to 47% gross margin in fiscal year \u00e2\u0080\u009823. Operating expenses are growing in excess of revenue due to, first, full year expense of hires made in FY \u00e2\u0080\u009822; second, assumed bonus payout this year of 100% of target versus the fractional payout in FY \u00e2\u0080\u009822; third, our strategic and targeted hiring plan for FY \u00e2\u0080\u009823; and fourth, prudent investment in our product road map. And then we factored in, as Eddie mentioned, hopefully, the transparency helps in terms of understanding will be in that gross margin range, our typical 45% to 47% range for this year, flat year-over-year based on what we can see right now and the give and take on component costs and some of the things that we won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have to incur that we did this year."
