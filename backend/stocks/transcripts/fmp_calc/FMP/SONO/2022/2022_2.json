Thanks, Emma and good afternoon, everyone and welcome to Sonos' Second Quarter Fiscal 2022 Earnings Conference Call. I'm Bill Newby and with me today are Sonos' CEO, Patrick Spence; and Brittany Bagley, CFO; Chief Legal Officer, Eddie Lazarus will also be available during the question-and-answer session. Before I turn it over to Patrick, I would like to remind everyone that today's discussion will include forward-looking statements, regarding future events and our future financial performance. For information regarding our non-GAAP financials and a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures, please refer to today's press release regarding our second quarter fiscal 2022 results posted to the Investor Relations portion of our website. As a reminder the press release, supplemental earnings, presentation and conference call transcript will be available on our Investor Relations website investors.sonos.com. Her new Sonos Radio station solar system launched today and showcases the songs and stories that move, shape and inspire her both at home and outdoors. We delivered record-setting Q2 revenue ahead of our expectations, representing more than 20% year-over-year growth. We once again delivered sustainable profitable growth achieving adjusted EBITDA of $47 million in Q2, despite increased component costs and higher shipping and logistics costs. And our continuous product innovation, which causes existing customers to return on a predictable basis to add additional products. Of course product innovation is a critical part of powering that flywheel, which is why we were so excited to announce a trio of new innovations today. The first is Ray, our new compact soundbar that delivers incredible sound for its small size. Ray raises the bar for at-home entertainment with new acoustic innovations that deliver balance sound, crisp dialogue and solid base. Ray brings our category-leading simplicity and versatility to a more accessible price point, which we expect will attract more new customers to Sonos and provide a new way for existing customers to expand their system. When we were launched Sonos One, it opened up a whole new range of customers to Sonos and we're looking to Ray to do the same thing for our home theater segment. Second, Sonos voice control is the first voice experience purpose-built for listening to and controlling your music on Sonos. Designed with privacy at its core, Sonos voice control is the simplest way to control your music, offering complete command of your Sonos system using only your voice.\\ Sonos voice control works on every voice-capable Sono speaker, processing requests entirely on the device. Third is that Sonos Roam, our ultra portable smart speaker is now available in three new colors olive, wave and sunset. Influenced by natural serenity, evening skis, and outdoor living, Roam's new colors are as versatile as the speaker itself, complementing interior and outdoor styles while harmonizing with the rest of the Sonos system. As with all Sonos products, the brand's newest speakers deliver great sound that helps you play more, hear more and really feel more, whether at home or on the go. Separate from what we are doing internally to drive growth, we continue to see three macro trends that we expect will offer significant tailwinds to our business for years to come. We've previously labeled these the Golden Age of Audio, Hollywood at Home and the Great Reshuffling. Whether it's audio or video, individuals continue to find new exciting ways to consume content throughout their lives increasingly demand better products and services to bring this content to life. As everyone is aware, external headwinds have picked up since our last earnings call. At the same time, we are watching the impact of the war in Ukraine on Europe as well as rising global inflation and the strengthening of the US dollar. While we have a large customer base across Europe, we did not have any material revenue from Russia or Ukraine and are no longer doing any business there. Despite these headwinds, we remain confident that we can deliver on our fiscal 2022 revenue outlook. And from everything we can see today, our consumer demand remains healthy. As I mentioned at the top of the call, we continue to have a backlog of orders. While our short-term focus is all the hard work our teams are doing to minimize the impact of the industry-wide supply challenges, there remains tremendous long-term opportunity ahead for Sonos. Now, I'll turn the call over to Brittany to provide more details on our results and our outlook. Despite the improved supply, we still had a backlog exiting the quarter and will remain supply constrained on some of our products for the rest of the year, as we continue to work through component shortages and the impact of the recent COVID lockdowns in China on both manufacturing and shipping. Revenue in the Americas grew 23%, EMEA grew 12% or 19% on a constant currency basis and APAC grew 34%. As we have discussed in prior quarters, we continue to invest in the business this year including in R&D as well as in our systems to support further scale. From a free cash flow standpoint, we had negative cash flow from operations in the quarter primarily due to inventory investments as we returned to a more normalized level and prepared for our new product launches. Despite the use of cash in Q2, we still delivered $82 million in cash from operations across the first half of the year, ended the quarter with $607 million of cash prior to the acquisition and have no debt. Organically, we invested in inventory and we also invested $27 million in the first quarter towards M&A, as well as $100 million in Q3 for our acquisition of Mike. Additionally, you saw us continue with our share repurchase activity. For the first half of the year, we have deployed $74.5 million of cash towards repurchases which leaves $75.5 million remaining on our $150 million share repurchase authorization. As is well known and as Patrick mentioned, there is significant uncertainty in the world right now. Since our Q1 call war has broken out in Ukraine, inflation has accelerated, the dollar has continued to strengthen versus the euro and China has experienced major additional lockdowns due to COVID. We do continue to see demand from our customers, but we are closely watching the EMEA region in particular given the ongoing conflict as well as the impact of ongoing inflation on the consumer and our supply chain and the strengthening dollar relative to the euro. In addition to watching the demand signals, we are managing through an ongoing challenging supply environment. The situation in China along with the commitments we are getting from our semiconductor suppliers and the overall ongoing component shortages means, we expect the supply challenges to last at least through the rest of the year. We have confidence in reaching at least the bottom end of our range based on: one, consumer demand signals from Q2, partially offset by our constrained supply outlook; two, strong new product introductions; and three, the pricing actions taken last September that are rolling through. While demand has remained healthy and we had a strong Q2, the current supply challenges likely limit any further upside to our top line outlook. We expect Q3 revenue, in particular, will be relatively more challenged by the supply constraints we are seeing. While the manufacturing capabilities in Malaysia have been very helpful over this period, there are still supply chain dependencies on China and we are working through the impact and costs as a result. We will also further diversify our manufacturing footprint by expanding into Vietnam, which we expect to have operational next year. As a result of these increased costs we are lowering our gross margin range to 45.5% to 46% for the remainder of the year, down from 46% to 47%, but still within our long-term guidance range of 45% to 47%. This implies roughly 44% to 45% gross margins for the second half, but there maybe some volatility in each of these quarters depending on the timing of spot buys. However, the gross margin impact is still partially flowing through to adjusted EBITDA. As a result, we are narrowing our adjusted EBITDA guidance range to $290 million to $310 million down roughly 2.5% at the midpoint. Despite the uncertain environment, we have significant brand equity, a resilient and loyal premium customer, and a large and growing market opportunity. Overall, we are very proud of the Q2 we delivered and believe the growth shows the durability of our value proposition to customers and the strength of our execution in a challenging supply environment. We believe we still have a record fiscal year 2022 in front of us supported by our new and existing customers, the new products we have introduced and the price increases we took in September, leading to double-digit top line growth and attractive profitability and supported by a strong balance sheet. With that, I would like to turn the call over to questions. Your line is now open. Brittany and Patrick, I know, you mentioned a number of the drivers. But when you strip away some of the pricing changes, channel fill backlog, the concern amongst bears is that demand is at risk of deteriorating. I think the \u2013 we obviously have better insight, I would say than most companies in terms of understanding what's actually lighting up and how we \u2013 how that's actually trending. The other big thing, I would say is, we have a DTC business which now we - is about twice as big as it was pre-pandemic that gives us great visibility into what consumers are actually doing in a pretty real-time basis a very real-time basis. And so we obviously are making sure that, we're watching this very closely. That's a big channel for us, and then as well, the custom install channel. I'd say, from my perspective, there's some pretty conflicting data out there right now, and you see companies like us, and Apple and Tesla all seeing a lot of demand and not able to fulfill all of that demand. I think Bank of America came out with a report yesterday, as well on the \u2013 right now the strength of the more affluent customer as well. It's not even like we fulfilled all the demand we had in the quarter, because as I referenced we do still have a backlog coming out of the quarter. And then as we look at the second half of the year, it's really some of the things I laid out, which is the price increases are rolling through. And while we do look at our demand rates and so far our consumer has continued to show that, they have interest in demand for Sono's products. Remember, we are still supply constrained. And then maybe as my follow-up, Patrick, I'll ask this one for you. Yes, we're very excited with Sonos Voice Control. We acquired Snips, great team based in Paris two years ago 2019 actually, I think it was. And so something we've heard from customers is, they were unwilling to use some of the big tech voice assistance, the generic -- the more general assistance. And we thought we could do something interesting that served both the privacy needs, but as well a deeper music experience and a deeper listening experience and very Sonos quality and Sonos level. And so, as you start to use it, you'll see that this is made for people, who want to listen to music, listen to audio. And the other thing is that, we haven't done it at the exclusion of our partners. So, we know that those customers that engage in voice, engage more heavily with their Sonos and that that fundamentally helps drive higher lifetime value. And so we think, with any of these experiences, with anything we're investing in, we're looking at what does it do for customer engagement. And in this case, we're very confident that Sonos Voice Control will be something that will get our customers even more interested and even more engaged with Sonos. And as they do that, we expect that they will expand their system and continue to tell their friends and family that they should as well get Sonos. Your line is now open. Actually, I wanted to come back to the voice assistant Patrick, and just ask you a couple of things. Are they -- I'm assuming they're okay with that voice system, but of course they've got their own that are competing with it. And then, on the voice assistant two, I wonder could you talk a little bit -- I saw the Jean Carlo as to voice. And I'm wondering, I've seen other things like this where people actually will pay for additional voices. Yes, I look at Sonos Voice control is very complementary to what Amazon and Google have today. So again, we've built this and one of the things I've talked about in the past is the importance of being able to run multiple voice assistants on our products and I think it's a differentiator. So the nice thing is, and of course we've talked to all of our partners about this and -- so Apple as well. This is to create a better experience for our listeners and for music and audio podcast specifically, right, as we get into all of that. Basically people that have been using voice and listen, the voice will come back and purchase products. We will definitely be looking at, are there interesting ways to potentially find other revenue sources as we go through this. But, Rod, I think very much, we're interested in -- always interested whether it's with voice or anything of other potential revenue opportunities, particularly, as we think about services. So I think, as you look across physical retail, our installer channels, and our DTC, a lot of our lead times have come in for many of our products. AMP is the one that I highlighted, is still having fairly significant lead times and that's one that's been pretty hard for us to keep in supply, given both demand and supply considerations for that. We're not perfectly in stock, but we're looking a lot better. Supply is going to continue to be pretty challenging as we go through the back half of the year, though. And so, we'll be having to monitor that really closely to try and stay as much in stock as we can for as many products as we can stay in stock on. Your line is now open. As Brittany mentioned, a smaller, lighter, more energy efficient, better sounding in terms of what's there. But for competitive reasons, I want to keep our future plans under wraps, but we are super excited to get that into our products and we got some interesting ideas. And I know it's hard for all of you, but just as you see with Sonos Voice Control today, we want to make sure that, when we actually have it ready we bring it out to the world. And it's all part of the innovation, and the product roadmap that helps power our Flywheel. One, we continue to have manufacturing in China. And then, two, China continues to have a significant part of the supply chain. And so, all of those other pieces that go into our products also had manufacturing shutdowns, and/or we couldn't get them out of the ports in China which were also shutdown to get them over to Malaysia, to support our manufacturing in Malaysia. And so, it's really been across the board in terms of hitting shipping and logistics, hitting the supply chain from a component standpoint, and then also hitting our manufacturing. And we're obviously watching it very closely, as are many other companies who are working to get their products out. That is, at this point from what we can see and what we can tell that's factored into our supply constraints in our guidance for the second half of the year. So obviously, we're doing everything we can to get what we need, to have where we need it to be. Your line is now open. Tom, I would say our consumer demand continues to be really healthy in Q2. So, it's certainly something we're watching, as inflation continues to be out there and all of the, sort of knock-on effects from trying to manage inflation. So right now we're saying we're keeping an eye on it, but we are continuing to note that we had very healthy consumer demand in Q2. So what I would say is, shipping and logistics costs and supply chain challenges have been with us for really a number of quarters/years at this point. And so, I think that was one of the first places that inflation hit. And then it's the Sono's Voice Control, which Patrick already talked about really driving engagement interaction with our customers. So it's not to say it wasn't an enormous amount of work from all the teams and really great execution to be able to get us in the position to have the supply to be able to launch those products but we're really happy with the cadence of innovation that we've released this year. Your line is now open. I guess, just what you're implying and what you're saying is you ultimately believe that that customer base can stay more resilient through this as things get a little tougher. And, obviously, we've been watching both the kind of all the speculation that exists out there. But you're exactly on it right, which is really a couple of things. And even I would go back Brent to some of the behavior in the pandemic prior to stimulus and prior to things really turning up, we saw an incredible resilience with our customers and so that was something that I reflected on a little bit too in terms of where we are. We -- these are the kind of things that really help improve a home, improve a room, improve an outdoor space and they're still accessible right, for a lot of people. And again, obviously, we're talking through the end of fiscal 2022, which has for us a quarter and half \u2013 less than that as well. And for Brittany, I think, many of us are all tracking lead times on your website. I mean, look our goal is really not to run backlog. And so I think what you're hearing from Patrick and I in Q2, I absolutely get the long-term questions. But in Q2 what we're saying is that 20% growth I think shows the kind of demand that we have when we can start actually getting some of those products in relative to Q1 where we talked about good demand, but just a lack of supply. And I think that's -- I think that's the balance we're working between managing the demand we do see that we saw in Q2 -- the demand that our new products will generate in the back half of the year and then just our balance trying to get those supplied and available. And, of course, you've seen the pricing that we took last September hit. So thank you to everybody at Sonos for all of the amazing work to be able to deliver this quarter and the past, I think, eight that have dealt with supply chain challenges and to all of you for your time today."
