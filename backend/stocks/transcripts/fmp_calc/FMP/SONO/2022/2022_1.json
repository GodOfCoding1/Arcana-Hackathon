    "content": " Demand remains strong, driven by the continued appeal of our industry leading products, and we delivered a record $164.5 million in revenue during the first quarter. As a result of our increased fiscal 2022 revenue guidance, we have also upwardly revised the low end of our adjusted EBITDA outlook and see a clear path toward delivering adjusted EBITDA margins in the range of 14.9% to 16.2% this year. As discussed last quarter, this outlook continues to reflect everything we know about the supply chain situation today across shipping, logistics and components as well as a smaller benefit from product and channel mix as compared to last year. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. Your line is now open."
