    "content": " Our team demonstrated its ability to execute amidst a challenging macroeconomic backdrop as we delivered constant currency revenue growth of 7%, a healthy adjusted EBITDA margin of 18.4% and $168 million of free cash flow. Given everything we see right now, we are maintaining our previously issued guidance range of $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion revenue, 45% to 46% gross margins and $145 million to $180 million in adjusted EBITDA. Quarterly registrations for this last quarter faced a very favorable comparison as Q1 of fiscal 2022 registration growth had declined 24% year-over-year due to product supply constraints, timing of channel fill and low holiday promotional activity in that period. Looking back a year further to Q1 of fiscal 2021 to smooth comparisons, this quarter's reported revenue was up 4%, whereas registrations and products sold are down 4% and 6%, respectively. I think it's a matter of, like, them getting refocused on it from an execution perspective in-store as opposed to anything else in the mix, and so we're expecting to see that through the course of fiscal 2023 and continue to work with them on future products. Our retailers have been -- and I think it's coming out of Q1 and our category share gains, they've been remarkably supportive, I would say, and are quite excited about the products we're planning on launching together. And at the same time, we're just trying to be cautious, having come out last year of a strong Q1 and making sure that we're being prudent, given all the other signals we see, not in our own business, but really across the macroeconomic backdrop, which none of us are economists, but we're just trying to be thoughtful about the way the year plays out and not get too far ahead of ourselves."
