    "content": " For the 6 months ended June 30, 2022, gas adjusted gross margin was $80.2 million, an increase of $7.4 million or 10.2% relative to the same period of 2021. As discussed, year-to-date 2022 adjusted gross margin increased a combined $7.6 million, principally as a result of higher distribution rates, customer growth and colder winter weather. Depreciation and amortization increased by $0.6 million, reflecting higher levels of utility plant and service, partially offset by lower depreciation rates resulting from the rate case order received for the company's electric distribution subsidiary in New Hampshire. Lastly, income taxes increased $0.3 million as a result of higher pretax earnings in the period partially offset by the flowback of excess accumulated deferred income taxes under regulatory orders received in New Hampshire."
