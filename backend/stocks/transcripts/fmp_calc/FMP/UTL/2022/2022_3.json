    "content": " Turning now to Slide 10, for the nine months ended September 30, 2022, electric adjusted gross margin was $76.6 million, an increase of $3.2 million or 4.4%, compared to the same period of 2021. As noted earlier, year-to-date 2022 adjusted gross margins increased the combined $11.6 million, primarily as a result of higher distribution rates, customer growth and colder winter weather. Lastly, income taxes increased $0.1 million as a result of higher pre-tax earnings, partially offset by the flowback of excess accumulated deferred income taxes under regulatory orders received in New Hampshire."
