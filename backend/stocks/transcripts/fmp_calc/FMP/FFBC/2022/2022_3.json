    "date": "2022-10-21 11:45:04",
    "content": " In total, average deposit balances declined $167 million during the quarter driven primarily by a $77 million decline in public funds, a $58 million decline in retail CDs, a $49 million decline in money market accounts, and a $47 million decline in not interest bearing accounts. On an operating basis and excluding summit, expenses increased $2.6 million compared to the linked quarter due primarily to an additional incentive compensation tied to the company's performance. Our asset sensitive balance sheet continues to benefit from rising rates and although there are many variables that impact magnitude and timing, we expect the margin to continue to expand to a range of 4.3% to 4.45% in the fourth quarter based upon anticipated interest rate increases."
