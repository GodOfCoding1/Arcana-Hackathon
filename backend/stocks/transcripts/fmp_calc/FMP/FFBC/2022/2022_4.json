    "content": " Diluted earnings per common share increased 24% from the third quarter, and we achieved record operating revenue of $214 million driven by a 15% increase in net interest income and a 32% increase in fee income. We were also very pleased with $502 million of broad-based loan growth in the quarter, which is a 20.3% increase on an annualized basis and included a $130 million increase at Summit. Net interest income grew by 15% with short-term rate increases providing a catalyst, while record fee income increased by 11% for the year as our acquisition of Summit Funding drove new fees and Bannockburn revenue grew by 23% to a record $55 million. On an operating basis and excluding Summit, expenses increased $11.2 million compared to the linked quarter, due primarily to incentive compensation tied to the record quarterly performance from Bannockburn as well as the company's overall performance. So in terms of a little bit more moderate loan growth if it's in that $100 million to $200 million, $250 million range a quarter, you could see the provision come down a little bit maybe in the short-term. So I think the way to look at it, if charge-offs come back a little bit, I mean, we're not seeing any real deterioration in the portfolio at this point, but if charge-offs come back to 10 or 15 basis points even, you would see and then, but kind of offset by a little bit of the growth, of the loan growth kind of normalizing, you could see what we really look at is the coverage ratio."
