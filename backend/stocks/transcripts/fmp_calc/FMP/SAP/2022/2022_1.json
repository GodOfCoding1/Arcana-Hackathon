    "content": " Current cloud backlog for SAP S/4HANA hit a record 79% growth driven by continued strong adoption of RISE with SAP, our signature offering for business transformation in the cloud. I think we have also been clear already without the Russia impact that the first half year in terms of year-over-year profit development would be more challenging than the second half here because last year, that was a much better performance, so to say, driven by the fact that we have the pandemic still fully in place Q1, for example, at 24% operating profit growth last year."
