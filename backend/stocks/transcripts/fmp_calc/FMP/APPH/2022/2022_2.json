    "content": " Turning to the second quarter, we sold six million pounds of tomatoes from the Morehead farm for 4.4 million and a 39% increase in quarterly net sales year-over-year. The AppHarvest team continued to raise the bar in the second quarter delivering strong operational performance, at Morehead that resulted in a 39% increase in net sales year-over-year, with improved labor and quality trends compared to the prior year. We achieved an increase in percent of premium grade tomatoes, reduced our distribution fee percentage versus the prior year-end quarter, increased our labor productivity and sold six million pounds of tomatoes at a net sales price of $0.72 per pound. The second quarter net loss of $28.7 million was an improvement versus the prior year net loss of $32 million, despite preparation costs related to the opening of our three new farms expected to be online by year-end. Despite the investments in expansion and growth this year, we trimmed our second quarter adjusted EBITDA loss to $17.9 million from $22.6 million last year, as we were able to more than offset that increase through the restructuring we announced in February."
