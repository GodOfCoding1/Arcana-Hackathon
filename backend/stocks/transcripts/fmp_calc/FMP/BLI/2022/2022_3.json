    "content": " Starting with our first strategic pillar of generating positive operating cash flow by early 2025, we shared with you last quarter that under our new operating strategy, we are focused on building a growing, profitable and sustainable business rather than pursuing growth at any cost. Turning to our platform product and pricing roadmap, as we discussed last quarter, we are materially enhancing our approach to the market with the introduction of a more flexible configuration and pricing strategy that is focused on the total cost of ownership that includes lower barriers to entry in terms of instrument pricing with a higher recurring revenue growth model. In terms of synergistic M&A options that expand our total addressable market, this may include complimentary technology that expand BLI offerings, expansion of service offerings to existing in new customers; technology licensing opportunities and opportunistic M&A with market dislocations In terms of providing leverage to our current cost structure, we are looking consolidation opportunities that will enhance our commercial infrastructure or drive significant R&D and G&A synergies. Looking at our results for the third quarter 2022, total revenue was $21.4 million, down 12% compared to the third quarter of 2021 and up 12% sequentially. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open."
