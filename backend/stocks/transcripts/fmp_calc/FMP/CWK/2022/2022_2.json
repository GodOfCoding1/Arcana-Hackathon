    "content": " We posted record results for the second quarter, reporting fee revenue of $1.9 billion and adjusted EBITDA of $263 million, reflecting year-over-year growth of 21% and 23% respectively. In terms of service line performance, recurring revenues in our Property, Facility and Project Management service line continue to generate very pleasing growth from both occupier and investor clients, increasing 16% in the second quarter year-over-year. You may now go ahead. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve always been a very strong, globally-diverse business, more so on the transaction side, going back five years to seven years, but as you touched on in the first question with Neil, the really strong build year-over-year that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen in our recurring revenue businesses, and really exceptional margin growth in those businesses, is very pleasing. You may now go ahead. You may now go ahead. You may now go ahead. You may now go ahead. You may now go ahead."
