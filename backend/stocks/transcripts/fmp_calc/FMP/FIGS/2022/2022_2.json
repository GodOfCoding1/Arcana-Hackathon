    "content": " Net revenues for Q2 increased 21% to $122.2 million compared to Q2 last year, driven by an increase in active customers as we continue to expand our reach globally and maintain strong retention as well as higher average order value, or AOV. I think just based on what we've aired in, there's going to be a higher cadence around how we're launching products through the back half of this year, and that's really exciting. So as it relates to macro, we're recognizing -- we feel really good about the health of our business, but also recognizing that there's just a lot of uncertainty at the moment, and we don't fully know what the future will bring."
