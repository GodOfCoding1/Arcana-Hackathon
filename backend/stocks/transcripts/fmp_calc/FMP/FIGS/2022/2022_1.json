    "content": " As a result of the near-term pressure we see in top line growth and gross margins, we are now anticipating our 2022 full year adjusted EBITDA margin to be in the range of 16% to 18%, which is below our previous outlook of 20-plus percent. As it relates to the top line, we expect our second quarter revenue growth rate to be less than 20% as we continue to be impacted by supply chain challenges and macroeconomic factors, including the rephasing of our product launch calendar, which means more launches to the second half of the year."
