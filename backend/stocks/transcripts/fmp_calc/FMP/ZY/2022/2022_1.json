    "content": " Today, I'll provide a brief update on progress against a few of our key programs, and then Ena will also share a more detailed review of our financials, including our preliminary first quarter 2022 results and our forecasted cash runway. In addition, total revenue for the first quarter of 2022 includes $1.7 million of onetime revenue with the recognition of previously deferred revenue related to the termination of a legacy R&D service agreement as we rotate to focus on our product pipeline. Total operating expenses, including cost of service revenue for the first quarter of 2022 was $68.4 million, a decrease of 22% compared to $87.1 million in the first quarter of 2021. Cost of service revenues for the first quarter of 2022 were $12.5 million, a decrease of 41% compared to $21.1 million in the same period of the prior year. Cost of service revenue increased 30% compared to the fourth quarter of 2021, primarily as a result of annual salary increases that became effective in Q1 2022 and additional stock compensation costs. R&D expenses for the first quarter of 2022 were $28.7 million, a decrease of 28% compared to $39.8 million in the same period of the prior year and a decrease of 4% compared to the fourth quarter of 2021. Sales and marketing expenses for the first quarter of 2022 were $3.6 million, a decrease of 47% compared to $6.9 million in the same period of the prior year and a decrease of 26% compared to the fourth quarter of 2021. General and administrative expenses for the first quarter of 2022 were $23.7 million, up 23% compared to $19.3 million in the first quarter of 2021 and up 7% from $22.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2021. We expect total operating expenses, including cost of service revenue, in our second quarter of 2022 to be in the range of $75 million to $79 million due to deferred spend from the first quarter of 2022."
