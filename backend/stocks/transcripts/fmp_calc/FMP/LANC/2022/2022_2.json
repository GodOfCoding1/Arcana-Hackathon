    "content": " No, and I think this is, you take all of the challenges associated with COVID and if it's possible, you move them aside for a second, one of the things that's happened in the last two years, is that we've grown our business by almost 25% when you look at consolidated net sales. Procurement is going to offer an opportunity, but the bigger area is just going to be the speed of information in our factories to make sure that we're staffing right, and that we're sourcing right, and we're running right, and it's a little bit hard for us to estimate exactly what's that's going to look like in a COVID environment, and then longer term Ryan, what this is going to give us is the ability to do much more seamless acquisitions with cost synergies that we haven't been able to do in the past."
