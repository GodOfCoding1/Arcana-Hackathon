Our Q3 revenue of $51 million declined 1% versus last year, and our reported net income and adjusted EBITDA were both a loss of $10 million. I noted on our August earnings call that, we were baking in risks in our scenario planning for the second half, including continued end market declines in Q3, bottoming out in Q4 along with continued liquidity challenges for our clients."
