    "content": " Today, we are pleased to report continued strong performance in the second quarter, with record distributable earnings of $0.60 per share, a 5% increase over last year, also continued growth in net investment income of 44% from last year and up 13% from last quarter, a dividend of $0.375 per share. Summarizing our second quarter results on Slide 7, we recorded distributable earnings per share of $0.60 and a strong quarter of distributable net investment income of $48 million and recorded gain on sale of approximately $23 million. In addition, as shown on the lower right, our gain-on-sale from securitized assets for the year-to-date was $45 million, modestly lower than prior year by interest rate movements, remaining at a level that reflects continued strong activity in investments that we typically securitize, coupled with ongoing robust demand from our securitization partners. On the lower left, distributable net investment income was over $90 million year-to-date, reflecting year-over-year growth of 43% driven by a larger portfolio and ongoing strong margins. The excess cash proceeds from those transactions, coupled with our $600 million unsecured revolver, have allowed us to continue to fund on investments without needing to access the public debt markets and have created a new transition to a higher rate environment. As depicted by Note 3 on the slide combining the cash flow with the distributable earnings methodology, results in a cash earnings relationship, such that we often record earnings greater than cash in early years due to the cash allocated to tax equity and in later years, we receive more cash than earnings. As our guidance indicates, we have adequate earnings and cash flow to continue to increase our dividend by a compound annual growth rate of 5% to 8% through 2024."
