    "content": " Today, we're pleased to announce the successful debt raise of $383 million, contributing to our strong liquidity position, including cash from operations of over $1.2 billion, which gives us ample runway for funding new deals. We also had a strong quarter of distributable net investment income of approximately $43 million, which is up 36% year-over-year and recorded a gain on sale of $19 million. On the lower left, distributable net investment income was approximately $134 million year-to-date, reflecting year-over-year growth of 40%, driven by a larger portfolio and continued strong margins. And just historically, if you go back and kind of see how you guys matched up versus the 12-month pipeline on like a go-forward basis, it's almost always above kind of 50% if you go back to at least like 2019 or so, is that kind of a good way we should be thinking about the success rate now that the pipeline has gotten a lot bigger, or do you think it -- it's just kind of larger size but maybe not the same kind of success rate on a go-forward basis. I mean, if it's a $4 billion pipeline and let's say we add $1 billion in a year at higher rates, but not -- we're not doubling our yield."
