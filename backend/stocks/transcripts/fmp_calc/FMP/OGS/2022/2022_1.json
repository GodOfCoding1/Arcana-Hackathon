    "content": " Operating income reflects an increase of $15.1 million from new rates, primarily due to regulatory filings completed in the second half of last year, including the Oklahoma Natural rate case and interim filings in Kansas and Texas. In addition, natural gas sales from residential customers increased $2.6 million due to the growth in our customer base that we continue to experience, primarily in Oklahoma and Texas. In the Oklahoma City Metro, we completed the first phase of a 2-year $26 million expansion project that will support the development of over 10,000 planned building lots over the next 5 to 7 years. In the first quarter of this year, we began construction from that initial expansion of a 23-mile multi-phased mainline extension, where we will invest an additional $50 million to $55 million to reach several other developments that are expected to have approximately 20,000 residential and commercial lots completed over the next 5 to 7 years. On March 15, Oklahoma Natural Gas filed its required PBRC application for a $19.7 million increase in base rates, as well as an offsetting EBIT credit of approximately $9.1 million. During the first quarter, Texas Gas Service made gas reliability infrastructure program filings for all customers in the Central Gulf and the West Texas service areas, requesting an increase of $9.1 million and $5 million, with new rates expected to take effect in June and July."
