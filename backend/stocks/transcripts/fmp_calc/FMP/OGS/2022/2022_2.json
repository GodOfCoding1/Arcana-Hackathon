    "content": " The impact of the remeasurement on pension expense for calendar 2022 is expected to be a reduction of approximately $7.2 million, primarily due to an increase in the discount rate, which lowers the projected benefit obligation. Turning to other regulatory matters, on March 15, Oklahoma Natural Gas filed its Performance-Based Rate Change application for a $19.7 million increase in base rates. During the first quarter, Texas Gas Service made Gas Reliability Infrastructure Program filings for all customers in the Central-Gulf and West Texas service areas, requesting increases of $9.1 million and $5 million, respectively. In April, Texas Gas Service filed a cost-of-service adjustment in the Rio Grande Valley service area and the cities approved an increase of $2.5 million, with rates taking effect in August. In June, Texas Gas Service filed a rate case seeking to consolidate the West Texas and two additional service areas into a single West-North service area and requesting a rate increase of $13 million."
