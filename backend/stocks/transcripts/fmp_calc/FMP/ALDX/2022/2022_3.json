    "content": " In the fourth quarter of 2022, we plan to submit what we believe will be the most comprehensive regulatory package ever for a dry eye disease drug candidate with results based on five adequate and well-controlled completed clinical trials, we intend to submit the NDA with data for ocular dryness symptom score, ocular redness, Schirmer test, and Schirmer test \u00e2\u0089\u00a510 mm responder analysis. Based on our current operating plan, we believe that existing cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities will be sufficient to fund currently projected operating expenses through the end of 2023, including NDA submissions and initial commercialization of both reproxalap and ADX-2191 if approved, and continued early and late stage development of Aldeyra's product candidates in ocular and systemic immune mediated diseases. With two late stage candidates in anterior ocular and rare retinal diseases representing potential revenue streams in 2023, and our clinical stage RASP modulator platform and systemic immune mediated diseases, Aldeyra's pipeline represents an innovative opportunity to positively affect patient care in both large and rare diseases. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. I feel like often we get lots of questions about reproxalap and lots of questions about ADX-2191 because those two compounds are the subjects of NDAs that are potential near term revenue generators for our company, but really the core of our development pipeline is RASP modulation as it relates to retinal and systemic disease. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. Your line is now open."
