    "content": " The time and dedication you've invested to advance our strategic priorities in 2022 have resulted in two FDA accepted new drug applications, Reproxalap for dry eye disease and ADX-2191, which was recently designated priority review for primary vitreoretinal lymphoma, a rare aggressive high-grade retinal cancer with no approved therapy. ADX-629, our first-in-class orally administered RAS modulator product candidate, is being evaluated in Phase 2 clinical trials in multiple systemic indications, including: idiopathic nephrotic syndrome, which encompasses a broad group of renal inflammatory diseases, including minimal change disease, and is characterized by edema, proteinuria and hypoalbuminemia; Sjogren-Larsson syndrome, an autosomal recessive neurocutaneous inborn error of metabolism that prevents degradation of specific RASP; and atopic dermatitis, a chronic hypersensitivity condition that is characterized by dry, itchy and inflamed skin. The development of Reproxalap has created a strong foundation for our RASP modulation platform, which now features our orally administered candidate ADX-629 and five Phase 2 clinical trials, representing varied designs and two new drug candidates poised to enter the clinic. Through ADX-2191, we are creating a potential first-line therapy for rare retinal diseases without FDA approved therapies, beginning with ocular lymphoma, proliferative vitreoretinopathy and retinitis pigmentosa, all indications for which our drug has received FDA's orphan drug designation.
