    "content": " Given a unique rapid onset of action and broad activity across symptoms and signs observed to date, we believe that reproxalap has significant potential to disrupt the dry eye disease market, and we're looking forward to announcing the results of the Phase III TRANQUILITY-2 trial later this year -- in fact, this quarter. With all our planned activity in 2022, from TRANQUILITY-2 to INVIGORATE-2 to the ADX-629 trials in chronic cough, ethanol toxicity, minimal change disease and SLS, with the development in our retina programs as well as advancing our RASP platform, broadly, you should expect our spend, particularly in R&D, to increase compared to 2021 levels."
