    "content": " With the recent completion of the crossover and Phase III TRANQUILITY-2 trials, we believe we put ourselves in a position to submit a thorough and extensive NDA based on robust symptomatic improvement, and the achievement of three objective sign endpoints of dry eye disease; ocular redness, Schirmer test and the Schirmer test greater than or equal to 10-millimeter responder analysis. I think it's also worth reiterating that to our knowledge, Aldeyra is the first sponsor to evaluate investigational dry eye disease drug in adequate and well-controlled crossover trial. Based on our current operating plan, we believe that existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities will be sufficient upon currently projected operating expenses through the end of 2023, including potential NDA submissions and initial commercialization of reproxalap in ADX-2191, if approved and continued development of Aldeyra's product candidates in ocular and systemic immune-mediated diseases. So I think, one of the beauties of systemic inflammation and ADX-629 in particular and even alcoholic hepatitis is, we have a variety of different options and we're prepared to pursue those options, assuming that the results are good from this first ethanol challenge trial."
