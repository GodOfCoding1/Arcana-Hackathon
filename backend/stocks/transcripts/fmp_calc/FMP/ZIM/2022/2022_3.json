    "content": " During the first nine months of the year, as you can see in slide number four, revenue grew by 43% to $10.4 billion as compared to the same period in 2021, driven by elevated freight rates and differentiated strategy, our adjusted EBITDA increased 55% and net income increased 43% compared to the nine months period in 2021. In the third quarter of 2022, our revenues grew 3% year-over-year to $3.2 billion, and we generated adjusted EBITDA and net income of $1.9 billion and $1.2 billion, respectively. Adjusted EBITDA was $1.9 billion for the quarter compared to $2.1 billion last year, reflecting more normalized carried volumes and average freight rate. During the first nine months of the year, our adjusted EBITDA of $6.6 billion converted into $5 billion cash flow from operations. I think today, we are focusing on making sure that we extract as much cost as we can on the way we operate, the productivity level of each of the agencies where people are on the sea and on the ground, use and leverage our digital initiatives but also believe will allow us to increase the productivity levels, entering and negotiating with all of our suppliers, not only the vessel suppliers but all the terminals, the rates for next year."
