    "content": " As you can see, slide number two, in the first half of 2022 revenue grew by 73% compared to the same period in 2021, adjusted EBITDA grew 115% and net income grew 106%, as we further capitalize on elevated freight rates and resilient demand. Our second quarter, records first half 2022 financial performance reflects the historically high freight rates, which were significantly higher this quarter compared to the full year, the prior year period, resilience in our demand as well and the value of our differentiated approach. The change in from 20% to 30%, what is actually like you got this quarterly dividend payout should change given that going into H2 and then the next year, there is uncertainty around demand and also the rate -- the rates starts to normalize. So our vessels have been selling full up until today and for the remainder of the year we are also assuming that the utilization will continue to be extremely strong, and this is why, we think that we will be able to catch up on our volume assumption on a full year basis, because utilization will remain strong and we also assume some sort of easing in the current year congestion of the bottlenecks at the terminal as we see yet -- we seeing yet."
