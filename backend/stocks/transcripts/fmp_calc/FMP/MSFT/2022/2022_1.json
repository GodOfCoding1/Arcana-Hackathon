    "content": " On the Microsoft Investor Relations website you can find our earnings press release and financial summary slide deck, which is intended to supplement our prepared remarks during today's call, and provides a reconciliation of differences between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. They are included as additional clarifying items to aid investors in further understanding the Company's first quarter performance, in addition to the impact these items and events have on the financial results. We will also provide growth rates in constant currency when available, as a framework for assessing how our underlying businesses performed, excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations. Actual results could materially differ because of factors discussed in today's earnings press release in the comments made during this conference call, and in the Risk Factors section of our Form 10-K, Form 10-Q, and other reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We're off to a fast start in fiscal 2022, with Microsoft Cloud quarterly revenue surpassing $20 billion for the first time, up 36% year-over-year. We are building Azure as the world's computer, with more datacenter regions than any other provider delivering fast access to cloud services while addressing critical data residency requirements. And we're partnering with mobile operators from AT&T and Verizon in the U.S., to Telefonica and BG in Europe, Telstra and SingTel in Asia Pacific, as they embrace new business models and bring ultra-low latency compute power and storage to the network and the enterprise edge. And with Azure ANC, customers like Nokia, Royal Bank of Canada and SKF can deploy and run applications at the edge or in multi-cloud environments. With Synpase Link for Dataverse, organizations can analyze data from business applications like Power Platform, and Dynamics 365 with just a few clicks. And Azure purview, now generally available is helping organizations such as FedEx, manage and govern on-premise, multi-cloud, and SaaS data. This quarter alone, we introduced more than 70 enterprise features, 84% of the Fortune 100 use GitHub, and we're seeing growing usage from digital native Companies and the world's most established firms. From Pinterest to Procter & Gamble, from Stripe to Society Generale, we're rapidly innovating in AI and our large-scale models are powering everything, from meeting recaps and Teams, to helping developers code in GitHub, to the next best action in Dynamics 365. With Power Platform, we're helping domain experts drive productivity gains with low-code, no-code tools, robotic process automation, virtual agents, and business intelligence. All up, Power Platform now has nearly 20 million monthly active users, up 76% year-over-year. 91% of the Fortune 500 use the service to build applications, and a 129 organizations have more than 10,000 users, including 3M, EY, GSK, Marks and Spencer, Sony, and ZF Group. Now on to Dynamics 365, going forward, every business process will be collaborative, powered by data and AI, and will bridge the digital and physical world. We continue to gain share with Dynamics 365 and teams we are creating a complete, new category of collaborative applications that help businesses like Rockwell Automation, Willis Towers Watson, surface data and insights across the entire organization. Our industry clouds, bringing together capabilities across the entire Microsoft Cloud along with industry-specific customizations to improve time-to-value, increase agility, and lower costs. We're seeing strong customer adoption of our new Industry Cloud for healthcare, and our clients for financial services and manufacturing will become more broadly available next week. With our Microsoft Cloud for sustainability, we're creating an entirely new business process category to help organizations monitor the carbon footprint across their operations. Now onto LinkedIn, we're experiencing a great reshuffle across the global labor market, as people are rethinking not only where and how they work, but why. For example, employees at Levi Strauss, an NTT data are using service now, applications right within Teams Drax's critical info within the flow of work. Across Microsoft 365, we're seeing growth in all segments, including triple-digit year-over-year usage, growth of Teams in front-line. one of Australia's largest retailers chose Teams to bring two-way communications to more than a 120,000 frontline employees. We are providing people and organizations everywhere with the most differentiated devices for productivity, learning, and gaming, and also have massive opportunity to create a new class of applications that take advantage of the edge and AI capabilities in Windows, coupled with cloud. We now have nearly 650,000 customers using our security solutions, up 50% year-over-year. We're also bringing XCloud gaming to the console for the first time, enabling Xbox users to discover the stream and stream more than a 100 games with just a click. In closing, we have the most diversified set of digital businesses, and we are innovating to expand our opportunity across the entire portfolio to help our customers in this new era. Next week, we'll hold our flagship Ignite Conference where we will share the next chapter of Microsoft Cloud from the  to large-scale AI, from hybrid work to hybrid infrastructure. Our First-Quarter revenue was $45.3 billion, up 22% and 20% in constant currency. Earnings per share was $2.27, an d increased 25% and 23% in constant currency when adjusted for a net tax benefit of $3.3 billion related to the transfer of intangible properties this quarter. And our commercial business, customers continue to choose the Microsoft Cloud. In our on-premises business, annuity performance in Office to Server benefited from a greater-than-expected mix of contracts, with higher in-period revenue recognition. In our consumer business, Windows OEM performance was better than expected in a growing PC market, despite ongoing supply chain constraints. Microsoft 365 subscription growth drove Office consumer results, advertising market growth drove another strong quarter in LinkedIn, as well as searching News advertising. Against the strong prior-year comparable commercial bookings grew 11% and 14% in constant currency driven by consistent execution across new, add-on, and renewal sales motions. As a result, commercial remaining performance obligation increased 28% and 29% in constant currency to $137 billion with a roughly equivalent split between revenues that will be recognized within and the portion beyond the next 12 months. Microsoft Cloud, gross margin percentage increased roughly 4 points, driven by improvement in our Cloud Services, particularly in Azure and Office 365, partially offset by sales mix shift to Azure. More personal computing revenue growth was increased by 1 point , less favorable than expected. Gross margin dollars increased 21%, and 19% constant currency. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate discussed earlier, gross margin percentage increased roughly 1 point, driven by improvements in Cloud Services noted earlier, partially offset by sales mix shift to Cloud. Operating expense increased 11%, lower than expected, primarily driven by investments that shifted to future quarters. At a total Company level, headcount grew 14% year-over-year, as we continue to invest in key areas, such as Cloud engineering, sales, customer deployment, and gaming. Operating income increased 27% and 24% in constant currency, and operating margins expanded two points year-over-year to 45%. Revenue from Productivity and Business Processes was $15 billion and grew 22% and 20% in constant currency, with better -than-expected performance in Office, commercial, and LinkedIn . Office 365 commercial revenue grew 23% and 21% in constant currency driven by installed base expansion across all workloads and all customer segments, as well as higher ARPU. Demand for our advanced security, compliance, and voice offerings growth continued momentum in E5 revenue this quarter. Paid office 365 commercial seats increased 17% year-over-year, driven by another strong quarter of growth in our small and medium business and front-line worker offerings. Office commercial licensing decreased 13% and 14% in constant currency, significantly ahead of expectations, benefiting from the higher end period revenue recognition noted earlier. Office Consumer revenue grew 10% and 8% in constant currency on a strong prior-year comparable, with better-than-expected growth in Microsoft 365 subscriptions. Over the past 2 years, our Microsoft 365 subscriber base has grown over 50%, reaching 54.1 million this quarter. Dynamic 365 revenue growth was 48% and 45% in constant currency with continued strong demand for Power Apps, which grew 202% and 197% in constant currency. And in LinkedIn, revenue increased 42% and 39% at constant currency, with continued strength in marketing solutions and better-than-expected performance in talent solutions from the improved job market  earlier. Segment gross margin dollars increased 22% at 20% in constant currency, and gross margin percentage increased slightly. Excluding the impact of the Teams accounting estimate, gross margin percentage increased roughly two points, driven by improvement across all Cloud services. Operating expense, increased 7% and operating income, increased 33% and 29% in constant currency. Revenue was $17 billion, increasing 31% and 29% in constant currency ahead of expectations, driven by continued customer demand for our differentiated, hybrid and Cloud offerings. Azure and other Cloud Services grew 50% and 48% in constant-currency ahead of expectations, driven by our consumption based services. The ARPU user business, the enterprise mobility and security installed base grew 30% to over 196 billion seats. Strengthen, our annuity business, was driven by healthy demand for our hybrid offerings that include Windows Server and SQL Server running in multi-cloud environments and higher in-period revenue recognition, including benefit from annuity purchasing ahead of the Windows Server 2022 launch. Technical gross margin dollars increased 28% to 26% in constant currency and gross margin percentage decreased roughly 1 point, year-over-year. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, gross margin percentage increased roughly 2 points, driven by improvements in Azure, partially offset by sales mix shift to Azure. Operating expense, increased 13% and 12% in constant currency and operating income grew 39% and 37% in constant currency. Now, to more personal computing, revenue was $13.3 billion increasing 12% and 11% in constant currency with better-than-expected performance and Windows OEM and gaming. Windows OEM revenue increased 10% driven by a stronger-than-expected PC market, particularly in the commercial segment, which has higher revenue per license. Surge and news advertising revenue, XTech, increased 40% and 39% in constant currency in line with expectations benefiting from the advertising market noted earlier. And in gaming, revenue increased 16% at 14% in constant-currency ahead of expectations, better than expected console supply and continued strong demand. Xbox content services revenue increased 2%, and was relatively unchanged in constant currency against a strong prior-year comparable. Operating expenses increased 15% driven by the ZeniMax acquisition, as well as Windows 11 marketing. Cash flow from operations was $24.5 billion, increasing 27% year-over-year, driven by strong Cloud billings and collections. Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage decreased roughly two points year-over-year, excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate previously discussed. Longer-term, we expect the Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage to be impacted by revenue mix shift to Azure, increased usage of our Microsoft Cloud services, And ongoing strategic investments to support our customers success. Now to FX, based on current rates, we expect FX to increase revenue at the total Company and all individual segment levels by approximately one point and have no impact on total COGS or operating expense growth. Next, to segment guidance, in Productivity and Business Processes, we expect revenue between $15.7 and $15.95 billion. In office commercial, revenue growth will again be driven by Office 365 with healthy growth across customer segments and continued momentum in E5. In our on-premises business, we expect revenue to decline in the high teens consistent with the ongoing customer shift to the Cloud. In Office Consumer, we expect revenue to grow in the mid-teens with continued momentum in Microsoft 365 Consumer subscriptions. For LinkedIn, a strong job market and continued engagement on the platform should drive revenue growth in the mid 30% range and in dynamics we expect revenue growth similar to Q1. Driven by Strength and Dynamic 365 including continued momentum in Powerhouse For Intelligent Cloud, we expect revenue between $18.1 billion and $18.35 billion. Revenue will continue to be driven by Azure, which, as a reminder, can have quarterly variability, primarily from our per-user business and from  revenue recognition depending on the mix of contracts. And per user business, while continuing to benefit from Microsoft 365 sweet momentum should see a moderation in growth rates given the size of we expect revenue growth in the mid-single digits driven by continued demand for hybrid solutions. In enterprise services, we expect revenue growth to be in the high single digits, In more personal computing, we expect revenue between $16.35 and $16.75 billion. Despite ongoing supply chain constraints, OEM revenue should grow low to mid-teens including 6 points of impact $10 million dollar Window 11referal that shifted revenue from Q1 to Q2. And in gaming, on a high prior-year comparable, that included the launch of our new consoles and strength across Xbox content services, we expect revenue growth in a high single digits. We remain focused on growing high value usage across our differentiated Microsoft Cloud offerings, and delivering exciting new consumer experiences with Windows 11, Surface and our Xbox gaming platform as we enter the holiday season. Please proceed with your question. Can you talk to us about how you think about sizing that opportunity in terms of the programmable edge, and maybe help us understand the Microsoft architectural approach versus perhaps some of the competitors coming into the marketplace from the CDN perspective, who are talking about the competitive differentiation by having a more of them last mile solution. So whether it is, what's happening with the 5G and how naturally compute will go to where data is getting generated with low latency access to a factory floor, to a hospital, to cities where you want to play XCloud gaming, that's one phenomena. The other is just literally treating every Cloud, whether it's the on-premise data center. It's the other public cloud, and our public cloud, and being able to use Azure Arc in its control plane to ease the deployment across all clouds. And I think that the multi-cloud, multi-edge world is really how we build Azure in the first place. Operator, next question, please. Amy, commercial bookings up 14% is impressive, but its slowdown from last call was 25 against the more difficult comp. Yeah I think the important thing when you think about bookings performance is to talk about what happened before you got to those volatile, the large Azure commitments that create some of that top comparables that we're talking about. And that's really the opportunity to execute against selling the Microsoft  day to day, which is Dynamics, Microsoft Cloud, GitHub in the broader universe. Operator, next question, please. Please proceed with your question. From investors about your Windows PC segments in light of all of the unit shipment and supply chain issues and yet, you put up a Windows OEM number that blew away your guidance and your guidance for the Windows OEM business in December was also I think way above what people are modeling. Those things together, which is a growing market, strong Windows performance within that market, in commercial in particular, And then, the resulting higher revenue per license results, and I think a very strong position in Q1 and Q2. Operator, next question, please. With inflation, at least in the U.S., increasing and likely to further accelerate due to government spending, Amy, how do you think this increasing inflation will impact to your customers and your business? And even dealing with constraints, for example, if You have supply chain constraints, one of the things you want to do is run your factories at the efficient frontier, that means things like digital twins, simulation, are the ones where you are going to make sure that every production run has the least amount of wastage. I think any which way you look, whether it's in the knowledge work, first-line work, whether it's actually digital twins and simulation, All of those things are going to be the best way for any Company to deal with inflationary pressures, so that they can, in fact, have the best productivity and that -- thereby the best ability to be able to meet aggregate demand out there. That's why we're very, very excited about making sure our software products are available to our business customers all around to be able to manage through this inflationary environment and I'll let Amy add to that. Yes, thanks, Satya and I think really  got to the heart mark of where I tend to go when you think about -- when you see the intensity of customers across industries and across geographies, wanting to adopt digital technology for many of the reasons Satya just explained. That acceleration, of course, regardless, frankly, of the overall environment is a place where we feel like we offer the best portfolio at the Microsoft Cloud and with our Industry Clouds to make that doable with a very fast time to value. The things I believe to be sustainable are a push to digital -- a push to Cloud help customers get value quickly, and us being a trusted advisor and partner to help that happen. Thank you so much. The first place where we're very, very focused on is to making sure that, with LinkedIn, we're doing everything to help everyone find their best economic opportunity and when Ryan Roslansky was the CEO of LinkedIn, talks about the great reshuffle. The second side to this, though, is also to per take the productivity of the people, whether they are on the front lines, and the first-line workers, or the knowledge workers, or even software developers, and making sure that they have the best tools, whether it's the GitHub harness and Visual Studio code for people who are developers or whether it is Power Apps or whether it is the Office 365, and then Microsoft 365 tooling to help them be most productive. That's I think the thing that we're very, very focused on because key to dealing with labor shortages is productivity gains. And Kash, as you probably noted I did talk about -- in this quarter, we did add, year-over-year, 14% headcount growth. Secondly, you asked some good questions about the supply chain impact, and specifically around data center, given our spend to this quarter, and my guidance is it should be similar next. This quarter, particularly in premium devices, in consoles for Xbox and another bit of -- another challenge I noted will just be -- we'll just need to watch the advertising market through the quarter, because obviously their willingness to spend is entirely connected to their supply as well. Thank you so much. Operator, next question, please. Please proceed with your question. Maybe I can talk a bit to sort of what we are seeing, take the most, I would say, the classic model of lift shift in modernized motions, which is I think at the core of hybrid Cloud, that's still in -- still early innings. In the sense that you take all the SAP workloads that are running on Azure, which I talked about, or other Tier-1 workloads that are migrating, whether it's HPC or transactional database workloads. And then on the data estate, that's the place where perhaps we're seeing significant traction, and I referenced that in some of my remarks all the way from what's happening with, say, operational data stores like Cosmos DB, with Synapse linked to Synapse or Power BI to Synapse or in fact, Dynamics 365 data wars to Synapse. That's where Azure Purview becomes, again, a pretty big driver of that data gravity to the Cloud from a governance perspective. With Teams, you suddenly now have a new platform in which applications get hosted, whether it's developed by the enterprise or by third-party. And I referenced that in my remarks, and those applications in many cases get built on our Cloud, use things like Azure DB, use things like Power Platform. And then the Cloud Plus Edge, which I referenced in the answer to the first question, which is in a multi-Cloud, multi edge world, you still need a control plane that manages all that complexity and that's where something like Azure Arc and GitHub become the two standards. That's the way I tend to think about it and whether that's the fact that people are committed to Windows and SQL server and whether they run that in Azure or whether they run it in a multi-cloud environment it's a commitment to the platform and so I just wanted to make that, probably, more clear as one of the drivers of our Server products and Cloud KPI execution this quarter. Operator, next question, please. Please proceed with your question. I mean, I will point to Amy's guide for the next quarter as far as we are looking at is the demand across the entire stack is pretty robust and obviously what happens in the labor market, whether it's in the tech labor market or any other labor market, will ultimately be something that we would all be subject to. But the thing at least about the software businesses are in order to deal with a lot of other constraints, whether they are labor shortages or supply shortages, deploying digital tech is one way to really overcome them. Yeah, and I do think frankly, Brad, just the signals we're seeing on consumption and usage we'd say customers are doing a good job of figuring out the priority list that delivers value to them, as Satya is saying. I do know obviously, that the labor market has a real impact, and I think that's also why you're seeing investment being made by us in particular, into training and skilling, making deployment easier, making time-to-value faster, really having documentation that makes getting started and trials far more accessible. And so when you talk about adding productivity it's also an investment we as Microsoft need to make, and to making our products easier and really terrific to get going on, so that you're not constrained in the way that you're talking about. Please proceed with your question. Satya, I wanted to ask about comments you made earlier in the call around investments coming and new releases coming for some of the industry Cloud, financial services, manufacturing. Should we think of the Azure business results kind of driven increasingly by these Industry Cloud type solutions away from horizontal type projects like ERP database, that's obviously been there. Thank you so much. Absolutely, we think of the Microsoft Cloud, which includes Azure, it includes Dynamics 365, it includes Microsoft 365, it includes things like Power Platform, it includes even GitHub and VS Code. And then with the Industry Cloud, we add value on top of that, which is specific, whether it's in retail, whether it's manufacturing, obviously in healthcare, and our pending Nuance acquisition really in add further to that. Obviously, we're very focused on, first of all, not any just one piece, which we -- each one of those has to be competitive on their own, it's the coming together of the Microsoft Cloud and in the Industry Cloud, adds further value on top of it. So yes, I think ultimately our competitiveness comes because of all of those layers integrated and delivering that time-to-value for our customers while maintaining openness in each layer and competitiveness in each layer\n That's great, thanks Satya."
