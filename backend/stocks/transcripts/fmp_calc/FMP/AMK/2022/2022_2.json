    "content": " In the second quarter of 2022, our net revenue was a record $110 million, up 21% year-over-year, which is driven by asset-based net revenue, which was up 11% and $99 million, spread-based revenue, which was up a robust 260% to $6.5 million, and the addition of subscription-based revenue from Voyant, which was $3.3 million. Second quarter 2022 adjusted EBITDA was $49.6 million, up 24% year-over-year and the highest quarterly adjusted EBITDA in our company's industry. For modeling purposes, we are using the 3.5% number to show a revenue impact of 25 basis point increase in Fed funds rate, which would equate to an additional $4.5 million in annual spread-based revenue. While we have lost approximately $10 billion in platform assets in the market in the second quarter, we are getting a greater contribution from spread-based revenue than previously expected due to more rapid increases in interest rates as well as a greater amount of cash in AssetMark Trust Company."
