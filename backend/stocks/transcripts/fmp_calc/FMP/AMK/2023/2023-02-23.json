    "content": " We believe both full outsourcers and those that are leveraging the marketplace will benefit from our consulting services community-like community of like-minded advisers and the open architecture nature of our offering -- Adhesion has a strong plan for growth this year, and we will look forward to sharing our progress during future earnings calls. Specifically, of the of the 281, 185 were from our acquisition of Adhesion, 52 were our miners that moved back above the $5 million platform asset threshold as a result of market appreciation and 44 were core advisers who qualify for engaged status for the first time due to their organic growth on the AssetMark platform. Market impact caused a $14 billion loss of platform assets in the year, an asset-based net revenue as a percentage of total net revenue fell to 83%, yet 2022 was another record revenue year for AssetMark driven by over $55 million of spread-based net revenue. But based on my experience, if you spend that time serving your clients, is what AssetMark did in 2022 and what our advisers did you always benefit from the resurgence of interest -- and so that's why one of the green sheets that Gary mentioned earlier and why we're excited about 2023."
