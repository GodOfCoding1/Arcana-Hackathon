    "content": " While most of the QSR industry has seen delivery sales remain relatively flat, the McDonald's brand has captured nearly all the growth in the sales channel, which led to significant market share gains relative to our main competitors in the region. I believe the competitive advantages we enjoy today will last for many years to come, including the largest freestanding restaurant portfolio in the industry, the best digital platform in Latin America's USR segment and the operational excellence of the world's favorite USR brand. So based on our aggressive marketing plans and these recent trends, we are confident that we can deliver another year of comparable sales growth well above inflation in our markets, which will then generate we expect the operational leverage."
