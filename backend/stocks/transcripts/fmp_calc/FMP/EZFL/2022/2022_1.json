    "content": " Companies that we have established partnerships with such as SERVPRO, a cleanup restoration and construction franchise company and Easyscripts, a retail pharmacy with home delivery service throughout Miami Dade, Broward and Palm Beach counties, rapidly enter new markets and have come to rely on our mobile fueling services to support their expansion. We also signed new fleet fueling agreements this quarter with 9/11 restoration of Miami, which is part of a nationwide franchise, providing water and fire damage restoration and other services; and Chef Nissen Catering and active participant in the Summer BreakSpot Program, which provides free meals to kids and teens across Florida. These business partnerships are not only complementary to our growth as we gain greater opportunities to fuel larger commercial fleets and enter new markets alongside our business customers, but are also supplementing the growth of these businesses by streamlining their operations as they expand. In the first quarter of 2022, we realized a 31% increase in average margin per gallon to $0.47 compared to $0.36 in the first quarter of 2021, which was primarily due to the addition of new fleet customers at significantly higher margins.
