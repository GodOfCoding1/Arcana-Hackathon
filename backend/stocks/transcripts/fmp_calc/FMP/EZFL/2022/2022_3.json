    "content": " We reported revenues of $4.1 million, a 120% increase from the $1.9 million we reported a year ago for our first quarter reporting as a public company. As Mike noted earlier, revenue for the third quarter of 2022 increased 120% to $4.1 million from $1.9 million in the prior year period. Depreciation and amortization increased to $0.48 million in the third quarter of 2022 from $0.24 million in the prior year period, primarily the result of the increase in the fleet of delivery vehicles. As also on the technology side, we just introduced an upgrade on our fleet portal, which has a lot of information for our fleet customers that we'll be continuing to add enhancements to that on the tech side and be able to monetize that to give our fleet customers a lot more information and knowledge about their fleet and how they're operating in fuel consumption and those kind of things."
