    "content": " Domestic revenues grew by 95% over the prior year, continuing positive momentum seen in recent quarters, driven in part by BolaWrap's success stories documented on bodycam footage. While our market penetration is still very small with significant room for growth in a large total addressable market, we believe BolaWrap and our related virtual reality training solution are making and continue to make an important difference in modern, safer policing. As previously stated over the next 90 days, we will work to deliver a clear growth-focused strategic plan that will detail the following key priorities: how we will shift our emphasis from intense R&D to sales growth and distribution of the BolaWrap 150; ways to expand awareness and demand for WRAP Reality; potential synergistic technologies and channel partnerships; and expanding training programs and relationships across domestic and international markets. With respect to our outlook, we continue to expect to achieve top line growth in fiscal year 2022, especially as we raise awareness of the BolaWrap 150 and WRAP Reality."
