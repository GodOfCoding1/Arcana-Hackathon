    "content": " Internationally, we just announced the largest BolaWrap 150 deal in our history and initial $1.5 million agreement with a very large police agency in the EMEA region, as well as a new sale of BolaWrap 150 to a large police agency in South America. In Q3, we generated net revenues of $1.7 million compared to $1.8 million in the prior year period, representing a 6% decrease year-over-year, driven by the timing of certain international sales. Our third quarter 2022 revenue performance also includes $240,000 promotional discounts and incentives, primarily related to converting customers to the BolaWrap 150 from our legacy BolaWrap 150. R&D expenses for the third quarter decreased $800,000 or 40% to $1.2 million from $2.1 million in the prior year period. While we invest for new sales growth and greater brand awareness, we remain focused on diligent cost management, which has us comfortably on pace to hit our 50% gross profit margin again in the fourth quarter. While we are building success in our domestic repeatable sales this year for BolaWrap 150, we are also implementing changes to our international approach to sale of BolaWrap 150 that will generate momentum to carry current sales into Q4 and into 2023."
