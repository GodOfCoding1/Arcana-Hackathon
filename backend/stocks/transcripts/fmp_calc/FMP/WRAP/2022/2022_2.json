    "content": " Revenue was $1.2 million in Q2, reflecting the expected first half impact of transitioning customers from the BolaWrap 100 to the BolaWrap 150. Our gross margin for the second quarter was 39% compared to 36% in Q2 of 2021, excluding approximately $700,000 of onetime expenses related to a line change and transition to building to BolaWrap 150 in Q2 of 2021. SG&A expense for the second quarter of 2022 was $3.8 million, representing a $2.8 million reduction from Q2 2021 due to significant new cost containment efforts focused on reducing SG&A expense to be more in line with overall sales. We're focused on driving recurring sales in the U.S., ramping up sales of the new BolaWrap 150 internationally and implementing a customer success function to help us expand existing agencies to full patrol-wide BolaWrap deployment. To drive stronger margins and support long-run profitability, our strategic road map also accounts for improved pricing on BolaWrap 150 devices and cassettes as well as monetizing our valuable training services. But even on top of that, with the agencies we're in today, the 800-plus, one of the things we determined in the strategic road map is we need to do a more thorough job of working to expand them to full deployment, where all patrol officers in the field are equipped with a BolaWrap device. And also just that after the first 90 days of building a strategic road map, we have spent countless hours listening to our employees, our customers, our distributors, our partners, a lot of time with agencies talking about the key factors around the strategic road map and getting feedback before we went final on that and rolled it out across the company in the past week."
