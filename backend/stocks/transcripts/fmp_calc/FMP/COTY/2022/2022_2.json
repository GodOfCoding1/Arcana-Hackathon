    "content": " At the same time, Consumer Beauty also registered strong 8% like-for-like growth in the first half of '22, driven by broad-based growth and a clear turnaround of our key cosmetic brands, CoverGirl, Rimmel, Sally Hansen and Max Factor. For the first half of fiscal 2022, our adjusted EBITDA delivery was exceptionally strong, rising 30% year-over-year to $590 million with a margin of 20%. As a result of this momentum, Prestige Makeup grew from less than 3% of our total sales in the first half to over 4% of our sales in the first half of 2022, and we continue to target approximately 10% penetration by fiscal 2025. Focusing on our e-com results, we continue to make strong progress with e-com sales in the first half up 16%, including particularly strong growth in Consumer Beauty. From a profit perspective, while we had spectacular gross margin performance in the first half of fiscal 2022, as Laurent discussed, our gross margins are usually seasonally lower in the second half compared to the first half while the year-on-year growth will be constrained by one-time benefits in the prior year and a step-up in inflation. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. So this, I would say, optimism that we have because of this acceleration of sales when it comes to Consumer Beauty, this is precisely translated into what you are seeing in the plus 13% in Jan. And we are clearly very confident that the second half will be in line with the fiscal year mid-teens outlook that we have shared with you during -- that we shared with you during -- on the press earnings release. Your line is now open. Your line is now open."
