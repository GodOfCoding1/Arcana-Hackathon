    "content": " And for the fourth quarter, we do believe that the momentum we are seeing behind our Prestige brand is going to continue, specifically that we are going to have a much more balanced, I would say, media investment behind the two divisions during Q4, while Q3 was heavily behind Consumer Beauty and Q2 was heavily behind Prestige. We are having more than 10% of these brands, fragrance sales coming from ultra premium fragrances, and this is certainly changing now only our, I would say, P&L equation, getting much more profitable over there, but also it's a very strong confirmation that Chinese consumers are all about an obsession of premiumization, shopping, highly desirable brands and the most expensive items from this highly desired brand. And I'm \u2013 I would say, more confident than ever that when you look at the portfolio of brands we do have, that's probably what explains the fact that we've been still until Q3 the fastest-growing beauty company in China, among the top 10 beauty companies that are there with a sellout that's been 14% during the last quarter, which is far above the flattening, I would say, market."
