    "content": " Total revenue grew by $4.9 billion compared to the second quarter of 2021, driven by strong organic growth throughout the last year in Medicaid, primarily due to the ongoing suspension of eligibility redeterminations strong Medicare membership growth during the annual enrollment period, the acquisitions of Magellan and Circle and the commencement of contracts in North Carolina. On the topic of the value creation plan, during the second quarter of 2022, we recorded an impairment charge of $1.45 billion related to the reduction in the company's real estate footprint consisting of $744 million related to leased real estate and $706 million related to owned real estate assets. As a reminder, on June 17, we lifted our adjusted EPS range by $0.15 to a range of $5.55 to $5.70 million Today, we're adding another $0.05 to guide to a range of $5.60 to $5.75, largely driven by some of the real estate benefit to be realized in the back half of the year net of some investment spending, such as the Delaware win. We're not quite at the stated pretax goal of 5% to 7.5% in marketplace this year, and we expect to push into that next year as we look at the momentum we have in execution and financially and then think about sort of the right pricing and making sure we maintain competitiveness, sort of balancing all those things as we submitted the bids for next year. What I would just add, I think to Drew's point, it doesn't change all the work that we are doing to prepare the redetermination process, and that includes bringing forward that data in conversations with state partners because I think as we said at Investor Day, we believe that it's manageable, but that still creates the mandate for us to manage it in partnership with the states and supported by data. And the other mitigating factor is that 88% of our membership is in states that we believe not based upon some Kaiser study, but we believe based upon our boots on the ground and the local presence that Sarah talked about that those states will take 10 or more months to redetermine and therefore, that's why we've got sort of this amped-up rate process in place where we're working with the states sort of forewarning them and then are going to be prepared if there is a differential in the risk pool that we need to get compensated for that. I guess that's now 63% now that we printed because we lifted the full year by $0.05 and that $0.05 to your point, it's actually a dime of benefit early benefit on the real estate run rate, minus $0.05 of investment Delaware is one example, but there's other ROI-based investments we're making in the value creation plan that we intend to make in the back half of the year. One thing I would add that we're tracking pretty closely are the ex parte numbers that each state is accumulating, which are those members that would be automatically either dropped or renewed at very different levels of maturity relative to the volume of members that could go through an automated process, but it's actually a helpful proxy for us to understand what would happen in early months versus, as Brent said, the states that are going to take a more measured approach in order not to create member abrasion and also reflective of the fact that the states have staffing issues and want to make sure that they have enough support for the process overall. But on top of that, as we started to see operational execution and indicators from sort of the end of 2020 and then into the first half of 2021 and then look at results throughout 2021 and now some of that's into 2022 in terms of that rating year '23, you're talking about, we believe we're going to underperform."
