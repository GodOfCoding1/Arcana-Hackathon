    "content": " This $4.4 million decrease in revenue was driven by lower revenue per bitcoin mined of $6.8 million, and this resulted from the lower market prices for Bitcoin in the current year period when compared to the prior year period, partially offset by an 8% increase in Bitcoin production activity during the quarter, which had the effect of increasing revenues by about $2.4 million. This $12.6 million increase was driven by accelerated cost recognition associated with our early exit from Harden of about $10.3 million, and to a lesser extent, higher cost per bitcoin -- total margin, which we define as revenues less cost of revenue for energy, hosting and other totaled $8.2 million compared to $25.2 million in the prior year period."
