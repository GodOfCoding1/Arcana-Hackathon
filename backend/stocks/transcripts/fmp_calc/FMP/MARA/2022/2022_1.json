    "content": " Given the dynamic growth and business activity over time, I am going to provide color on our results for the current quarter compared to both last year\u2019s quarter the period ended March 31, 2021, which is also outlined in the earnings release and the last calendar quarter, which we sometimes refer to as the sequential quarter, Q4 of 2021. Encouragingly, in March, the grid operators in Texas granted permission for all 280 megawatts of the first major facility to be energized when you consider that Texas may begin slowing down the rate of deployments for all miners in the state, to monitor Bitcoin mining\u2019s impact on the grid, the fact that we have 280 megawatts pre-approved to energize places us in a uniquely advantageous position relative to our competitors. Sir, the floor is yours. Fred, I really appreciate the outlook and maintaining, I think you mentioned maybe cautiously optimistic or maybe that\u2019s more of the spirit, growth target of 23.3% early next year, how should we think about kind of the cadence of minor deployment between here and there? So if the price of Bitcoin, let\u2019s just say it\u2019s in the $40,000 to $50,000 range at the end of this year, then I think you are going to see continued in the macroeconomic environment remaining kind of as is, I think what you are going to find is miners maybe capital constrained and not able to grow as quickly as they expected. Sir, the floor is yours. If you were to look at Q2, I think you are going to see essentially another 3xahash come online and then a significant increase over that in Q3 and then Q4 you start seeing the increases or decrease because they are now driven by receipt of miners, but the big \u2013 you are going to see a \u2013 think of it as a snake where you have got kind of the tail in the mouth."
