    "content": " As we've mentioned in the past, gross profit margin is a metric that is best analyzed on an annual basis as individual quarters can fluctuate mainly due to changes in the industry mix of our billings and revenues, seasonality factors, the ramping of new merchants, the varying risk profile of transactions approved and other business priorities. So I think we're definitely seeing stay -- the stay-at-home business this year is starting to kind of temper down, and we're seeing some movement downwards there, whether it's home furnishings, kind of personal fitness, really very consistent with what's been out there. Specifically for this quarter, the portfolio of merchants that we have today is very different than what we had a year ago is driven by a number of factors like transaction risk level, industry mix, geo mix, business priorities, just there's a lot of different factors. So we're definitely on track so far within Q2, and it's -- the way we look at it, it's part of new -- that expansion, so both adding some of those new larger clients in Q1, but also seeing kind of persistent improvements within our existing cohorts and more and more segments being submitted to us over time."
