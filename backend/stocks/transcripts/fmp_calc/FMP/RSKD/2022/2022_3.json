    "content": " In addition to the momentum in our sales efforts, during the third quarter, our gross profit growth of 35% exceeded our revenue growth, reflecting the benefits of the ongoing investment in our technology and the strength and leverage in our business model. Your line is now open. So when we think about kind of the path to profitability in the next step, they're reaching those 20% margin, I would say obviously, very happy with the work the team has done this quarter previous quarter lowering our expense base. So this quarter, great go to market performance 20% revenue growth, still in the face of some headwinds, a 4% FX impact, mid single digit regulatory PSD2 to impact and organic e-commerce growth was actually slightly negative. But without getting into guidance, just to give you a general framework if organic  we've definitely seen periods of profitability in the back half of next year, and then I think you can extrapolate further into that kind of longer term 20% target. Your line is now open. So that's 20% growth, which still had the 4% FX impact and that mid single digit regulatory impact really, that was all the growth came from new and existing clients, because the organic base was just slightly negative. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. So when you think about fashion whether it's luxury or kind of general retailing, we continue to see strong growth there because of net new addition and the upsells."
