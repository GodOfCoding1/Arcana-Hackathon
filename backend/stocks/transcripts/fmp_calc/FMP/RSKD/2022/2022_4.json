    "content": " Our growth in full year 2022 was driven primarily by new customer wins and upsells from existing customers, and highlighted by strong performance in our tickets and travel vertical, which grew approximately 150% year-over-year. Our full year growth in GMV and revenue was primarily driven by strong tickets and travel performance, new merchants and upsells, and revenue growth across all geographies. The improvements in our non-GAAP gross profit margin from the initial floor is primarily attributable to improvements in our core machine learning models and optimizing of our cost-of-goods sold that are others in chargebacks offset by the impact of ramping of significant new merchants and a shift in our portfolio mix towards tickets and travel, which has historically been a lower gross margin vertical than others in the portfolio. Second, we anticipate tickets and travel to continue to grow as we have now lapped favorable comps related to the COVID recovery in 2022, we expect to see more normalized growth versus the triple-digit year-over-year growth we saw in this vertical throughout 2022. Thank you so much. Thank you so much. Thank you so much. Thank you so much. Thank you so much. Thank you so much."
