    "content": " In Q2, we grew GMV 30%, revenue 47% and narrowed our adjusted EBITDA loss, both sequentially and year-over-year, exceeding our guidance for the quarter. I think it's important to say that a part of the mix was a lot of this direct revenue that we've had in the past, which was maybe 30%, 30% of our inventory in Q1 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 sorry, as a percentage of revenue was about 30%. But I will say Susan, that largely the benefit to this Q4 result that's implied in our full-year guidance really is maintaining the cost structure as we have put it in place the fixed cost structure for Q3 to continue into Q4 essentially flat on a $100 million more of GMV. I think what we're experiencing with the reduction in the topline projections and lower GMV and revenue, it's harder to get as much productivity in our authentication centers and on our variable expenses because there are some fixed elements to that and it's just tougher on lower volume. Robert, sorry, if this was addressed already in all the discussion around guidance, so when I look at the Q3 guide relative to what you did in Q2, you're essentially saying that revenues \u00e2\u0080\u0093 total net revenues will be flattish to down versus Q2, but the adjusted EBITDA will be a lot better. Let's call it, in round numbers, it's about a $1 million improvement on adjusted EBITDA sequentially and roughly $15 million less in GMV and about $4 million to $5 million less in revenue. So the way I would describe it, Tom, is that Q3 looks an awful lot, like Q2, a little bit less GMV in revenue, a little bit better adjusted EBITDA dollars on a EBITDA margin basis \u00e2\u0080\u0093 adjusted to EBITDA margin basis, exactly flat, both of them minus 18.7% at the midpoint of our guidance."
