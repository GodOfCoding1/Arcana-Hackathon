    "content": " Overall, cross-border volumes grew 42% year-over-year, up 11 ppt versus Q4, driven by cross-border travel growth of 84% year-over-year, up 25 ppt versus Q4. The fact that we were in Q4 at 20% of 2019 levels from an inbound travel standpoint, cross-border travel standpoint is just suggestive of the fact that if you just think about what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s gone on around the regions and how they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve recovered and bounced right back and gone well above 2019 levels, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a significant opportunity both on inbound and outbound as it relates to China. So, the reality is, if you think about PCE growth, you think about the opportunity for the secular shift to electronic forms of payment, you think about the fact that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re growing market share, you think about how we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re delivering on our services capabilities and driving growth from that, and now as we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re doing new and different things around new payment flows as well as new networks, that growth algorithm actually is very sound, very stable, very consistent with what we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve historically had."
