    "content": " Our revenue for the first quarter of 2022 was $226.6 million, as compared to $205.3 million for the first quarter of 2021, an increase of 10.4%. Adjusted earnings per diluted share for the first quarter of 2022 were $0.77, as compared to $0.74 for the first quarter of 2021, an increase of 4.1%. Our adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter 2022 was $22.4 million, as compared to $19.3 million for the first quarter of 2021, an increase of 16.1%. As we have experienced the last couple of years, this timing means we will have two quarters of an approximate cost of living minimum wage increase of $0.40 per hour for our Chicago-based caregivers before we received the offsetting rate increase. Overall, our hospice ADC increased to 3,320 for the first quarter of 2022, inclusive of our JourneyCare acquisition completed during the quarter as compared to an ADC of 2,400 for the first quarter of 2021. First quarter 2022 hospice care revenues include the addition of the hospice division of Armada, which we acquired as of August 1, 2021, and two months results of the acquired operations of JourneyCare, which closed on February 1, 2022. Our gross margin percentage was 31%, compared with 29.8% for the first quarter of 2021, as we continue to benefit from a higher mix of clinical services, including the JourneyCare acquisition completed in the first quarter. Adjusted EBITDA margin in the first quarter was 9.9%, compared with 9.4% for the first quarter of 2021, and reflects the impact of our higher proportion of clinical services, which are now 25% of our revenues."
