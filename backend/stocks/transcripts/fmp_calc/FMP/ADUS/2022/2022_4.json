    "content": " During the fourth quarter of 2022, we experienced improved hiring in our Personal Care segment with hires per business day increasing approximately 10% as compared to the fourth quarter of 2021. The March 1 rate increase, which is a little larger per hour, is going to be probably between $17 million and $18 million kind of based on current volumes in Illinois, obviously, getting 1 month of impact of that in Q1, but you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll see the full impact of that as that rolls through Q2. I want to make sure you understand that just because it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not a focus for our M&A at this point in time, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s largely because we already have about 20% of our revenue in hospice, and we really believe that to get the balance of home health and clinical services set on top of our personal care network is really the strategic way to move forward in the next year or 2."
