    "content": " Some of our notable quarterly highlights include RE/MAX Holdings' total revenue was $88.9 million, down only 2% compared to last year as our INTEGRA acquisition and growing mortgage business helped offset the impact from the softening housing market. For the fourth quarter of 2022, we expect agent count to increase 1% to 2% over fourth quarter of 2021; revenue in a range of $80 million to $85 million, including revenue from the Marketing Funds in a range of $21.5 million to $23.5 million; and adjusted EBITDA in a range of $23 million to $27 million. For the full year 2022, the company is reducing its guidance to reflect current housing market conditions and other related macroeconomic trends, and now expect agent count to increase 1% to 2% over full year 2021, down from 1% to 2.5%; revenue in a range of $352 million to $357 million, including revenue from the Marketing Funds in a range of $90 million to $92 million, down from $354 million to $364 million; and adjusted EBITDA in a range of $118 million to $122 million, down from $123 million to $128 million.
