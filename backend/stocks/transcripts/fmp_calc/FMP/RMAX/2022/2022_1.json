And last one, I guess, then for Karri, can you maybe put any brackets or help us with expenses rolling into 2Q and maybe how to think about it for the rest of the year as well, if there\u2019s anything specific there, especially continuing commented about some of these initiatives to build things add some Motto franchise sales folks and stuff like that. Your line is open. Your line is open. Hey, good morning guys. Your line is open. Hey, on the agent growth, I mean that\u2019s always been kind of the core driver of the revenue model for you guys of late, the last couple quarters, I feel like you\u2019ve grown organically at a really good rate, despite a little bit slower agent growth. Nick, why don\u2019t you take that? And so as we look ahead going forward, we\u2019ve said pretty consistently that we would be kind of a mid-single digit organic revenue growth company kind of 3%, 4%, 5% assuming the housing market hangs in there and that the macro stays strong doesn\u2019t have to be on fire like it wasn\u2019t 2021, but assuming that there\u2019s not anything catastrophic.
