    "content": " Some of our notable quarterly highlights included RE/MAX Holdings' total revenue was $81.3 million, down only 8.9% compared to last year, as our recurring revenue model and growing mortgage business health counterbalanced the impact from the softening housing markets in both the US and Canada. For the first quarter of 2023, we expect agent count to increase 0% to 1% over first quarter 2022, revenue in a range of $82 million to $87 million, including revenue from the marketing funds in a range of $20.5 million to $22.5 million and adjusted EBITDA in a range of $18.5 million to $21.5 million. For the full year 2023, we expect agent count to change negative 1% to 1% over full year 2022, revenue in a range of $315 million to $335 million, including revenue from the marketing funds in a range of $83.5 million to $87 million and adjusted EBITDA in a range of $95 million to $105 million. And as we look out over time, we still think it's a $100 million dollar revenue opportunity for us with margins that are comparable to what we see on the RE/MAX side at scale at the marketing funds."
