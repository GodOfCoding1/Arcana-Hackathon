    "content": " We are very excited by the opportunity to bring the two market, the industry's first fully drive-by-wire commercial vehicle to our pipeline customers in the U.S. with our new Class 5 walk-in van prototype, developed in partnership with EAVX, the EV business unit of JB Poindexter. The pre-booked event will allow EAVX and REE's pipeline customers across retail, delivery, and logistics segments to experience the vehicles, discuss their unique requirements and secure production capacity for 2023 deliveries. So the P7 platform is designed, of course, for Classes 3 to 5, but mainly, if you're going to serve Classes 3 and 5, and the -- I mean EAVX and Morgan Olson are fully capable and day in and day out in building different bodies on top of that. But REE's main focus in the coming quarters, as David mentioned, is the P7 and its application across different market segments, different vehicle classes and the commonality of the core engineering that we just mentioned earlier on all of those."
