    "content": " Not only we have not deviated from this strategy, our CapEx-light model and the favorable unit economics of the segments we are targeting mean that our P7 platform and its class 3 and 5 variants are fully funded through commercial production, with the global market of medium-duty commercial vehicles of approximately 1.4 million vehicles annually and approximately 600,000 vehicles annually in the U.S. and Europe. And together with EAVX, we intend to deliver Proxima Powered by REE test fleet as a fully homologated vehicle for use on public roads in the U.S. We will also be providing test vehicles to some of the world's largest rental fleet and commercial truck retailers in North America. Before reviewing the company's financial results for the third quarter and reiterating our expectations for 2022, I'd like to briefly provide you with expected initial unit economics and give you a sense of the production volume required to reach breakeven gross margin, as this is a question that has come up in recent investor and analyst discussions. With competitive prices for the Proxima Powered by REE and P7-B box truck, we believe that we can achieve a breakeven contribution margin with production in the low thousands of vehicles at our Coventry Integration Center. Now, I don't think it's the initial order size that matters but it's the long-term opportunity here of putting vehicles Powered by REE in their fleet, which gives us the ability to be the validated supplier for EVs for them, and ramping it up over the years. And I think it's very important for our scalability and unit economics to first spend on stabilizing integration center, delivering from there for those initial orders, making sure that the line operates well with the quality control needed in order to deploy high quality vehicles."
