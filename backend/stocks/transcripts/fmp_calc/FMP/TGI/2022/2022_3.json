    "content": " All the $5 million adjustment is attributable to the structures segment this quarter due to our 747 production facility shutdown in Grand Prairie, Texas, which was completed in December, and the shutdown of our Interiors facility in Spokane, Washington, which will be complete in the first half of this calendar year. Systems & Support operating income was $41 million, or 17% for the quarter, which is a 60 basis point increase over last year on an adjusted basis. As expected, free cash flow this quarter included $28 million of non-recurring cash drivers, including $21 million of advance liquidations, and $8 million of funding of previously accrued 747 losses. Capital expenditures increased to $7 million this quarter with investment in our Systems & Support segment in support of rising OEM and MRO demand, and sustaining supporting infrastructure improvements. They're winding down, there's going to be some residual as we close up the remaining factory where we're storing them and shipping them from, but it was only $8 million in this quarter and it'll be less moving forward. But these portfolio actions have been important, they're improving our margins moving forward, for example, our aftermarket business which is so important, because it has higher margin, its spares and repairs has moved from 24% in last year's third quarter up to 32% this quarter."
