    "content": " 737 MAX, 787, A-320 family and the A-350 are some of Triumph\u2019s largest programs and collectively are expected to increase Triumph sales by over $300 million from fiscal \u201922 to fiscal \u201925. For the full year, excluding the impacts of the actions in structures, we expect to generate $30 million to $45 million of cash from operations with approximately $30 million in capital expenditures, resulting in core free cash flow of about breakeven to $15 million in fiscal \u201923. Again, if you have a question, please press star then one. Hey, good morning guys. Although the overall market CAGR is 3% to 5%, we\u2019re seeing this big rate in inductions - you know, month over month, 7%, 8% a month growth, so the quarter was up, I think, 35% in inductions, so it\u2019s really an encouraging trend and because they\u2019re not retiring the wide bodies any further, those as they up their flight volume, we\u2019re seeing both nacelle and engine accessory induction. Hey, good morning guys. Again, if you have a question, please press star then one."
