    "content": " I'm pleased to share that Triumph demonstrated strong organic growth and year-over-year improvement in margins company-wide, driven by increased MRO volumes, all while we continue to come through the pandemic and clean up our portfolio and balance sheet. Our actions combined with OEM and MRO rate increases will support expanded margins and cash flow, putting us on a path to de-lever the company year-over-year. Systems & Support revenues for our third-party MRO increased 19%, while proprietary spare sales primarily for military rotorcraft and commercial narrow-body production rates more than offset commercial wide body declines. We grew margins in the quarter across the enterprise and retired several non-recurring cash uses giving us the confidence to initiate financial guidance for fiscal 2022, with improving cash outlook quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year. Adjusted operating margins for Systems & Support was 14%, 235 basis point improvement from the prior year and benefited from increasing MRO demand. Excluding these sunsetting uses of cash, we used $51 million of cash in the first quarter on modest working capital growth in support of anticipated production rate increases, primarily on commercial narrow-body platforms. After approximately $150 million of free cash use in the first quarter, we expect in total to generate free cash flow over the balance of the year with about $40 million to $60 million of use in Q2 approximately breakeven in Q3 and solidly cash positive in Q4. Consistent with our full year guidance, we'll build momentum quarter-over-quarter by continuing the track record of growth and margin expansion in our core business and drive to positive free cash flow over the balance of the year."
