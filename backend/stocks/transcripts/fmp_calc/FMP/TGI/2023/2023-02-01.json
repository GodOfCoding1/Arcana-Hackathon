    "content": " For the full-year, we expect to use $30 million to $40 million of cash from operations with approximately $25 million in capital expenditures, resulting in free cash use of $55 million to $65 million in fiscal \u00e2\u0080\u009923, that's a $5 million improvement over prior guidance. You may now go ahead. When you look at the OEM rates like Airbus, they delivered -- they're delivering about 45 a month on the narrow body, but they're headed to 58 at year-end with similar increases out of Airbus and we're also on the A220 that's going up from about seven a month to 10 a month of India. You may now go ahead. So first, only cash use this quarter was $5 million and it's really to fund the growth in the fourth quarter, which is above what we expected. You may now go ahead. You may now go ahead. We've seen working capital be a little higher because of supply chain disruptions, but that's improving, and we're looking forward to that improving into next year as well. You may now go ahead. You may now go ahead. You may now go ahead. You may now go ahead."
