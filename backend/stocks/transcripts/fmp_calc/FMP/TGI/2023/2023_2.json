    "content": " While our suppliers are not yet achieving a 100% on time performance we expect, this incremental progress will enable Triumph to burn down approximately $40 million of past due backlog by the end of fiscal 2023. Adjusted operating income of $30 million represents a 10% margin, up from 8% a year ago and includes the impact of decreased military rotorcraft sales more than offset by a favorable closeout of legacy programs, a sale of certain non-core IP and tailwinds from commercial narrow-body production rate increases. For the full year, we expect to use $30 million to $40 million of cash from operations with approximately $30 million of capital expenditures, resulting in free cash use of $60 million to $70 million in fiscal '23."
