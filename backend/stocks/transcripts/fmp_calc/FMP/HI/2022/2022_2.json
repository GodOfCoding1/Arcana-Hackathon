    "content": " Adjusted earnings per share of a $1.1 came in at the high end of our expectations and was up $0.03 or 3% compared to the prior year as favorable pricing, productivity improvements, and higher volume were partially offset by inflation, a higher tax rate, increased strategic investments, and the impact of foreign currency exchange. Revenue of $350 million increased 11% or 16%, excluding the impact of foreign currency driven by higher volume of large plastics systems, favorable pricing, and higher aftermarket parts, and service revenue. Revenue of $251 million decreased 2% compared to the prior year, but was flat excluding the impact of foreign currency, as favorable pricing and higher volume in our hot runner product line was offset by a decline in volume in our injection molding and extrusion product lines."
