    "content": " APS revenue of $310 million increased 2% compared to the prior year or 10% excluding the impact of foreign currency, driven by pricing and higher volume of large plastic systems and aftermarket parts and services. Revenue of $270 million increased 11% year-over-year or 14% excluding the impact of foreign currency, as higher volume from the injection molded product line and favorable pricing were partially offset by lower volume from the hot runner product line, which is due to the COVID-19-related shutdowns in China."
