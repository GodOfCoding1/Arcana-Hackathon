    "content": " Adjusted EBITDA of $135 million decreased 3%, but increased 3% excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange as favorable pricing and productivity improvements, along with higher industrial volume, more than offset inflation, lower Batesville volume and an increase in strategic investments. Adjusted EBITDA of $60 million increased 11% compared to the prior year, or 16% excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange, while adjusted EBITDA margins of 21.6% increased 100 basis points as pricing and productivity improvements and operating leverage from higher volume more than offset inflation. Adjusted EBITDA of $527 million decreased 1% compared to the prior year, but increased 3% excluding the impact of foreign currency, as pricing and productivity improvements and higher volume in APS and MTS were partially offset by inflation, lower Batesville volume and an increase in strategic investments. Adjusted earnings per share of $3.93 increased $0.14 or 4% compared to the prior year, as pricing and productivity improvements, higher industrial volume and lower shares outstanding were partially offset by inflation, lower Batesville volume, unfavorable foreign currency exchange, and an increase in strategic investments."
