    "content": " We've been -- we've seen notable differences and improvements on the supply chain across most of the portfolio with some few exceptions during the quarter, which allows us to change our posture of, you know what, let's turn down the production performance machine in Q4 somewhat. We had been saying all year that in the capital goods portion of the portfolio, because of the inventory balances roll forward and because of the exposure on raw materials, that we expect the back half -- and take a look at the performance on both Engineered Products and the refrigeration unit, I mean, those are largely as a result of the dynamics that we discussed on previous calls. But I mean, I think quarter-to-quarter, across the portfolio, while we're less than one, I mean we're at 0.96, it's not like we've seen a dramatic slowdown. So -- but again, I think it's very difficult to compare company to company unless they're pure players because certain businesses are always going to have elevated backlogs in the portfolio. So you've got to get basically the orders -- before you even buy the subcomponents in the raw materials, you need to have the order in place as opposed to marketing Maags, where we don't get all worked up about backlog because it's just consumer volume and being able to price it correctly and make the deliveries on time. We've seen it, right, because of the fact -- but I think that we were trying to say, if you go back and look at what we were saying Q2, Q3 a year ago of -- let's not get all excited."
