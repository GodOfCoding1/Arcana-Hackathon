    "content": " In the first quarter, Government Operations generated $432 million of revenue, up 2% driven by long-lead material production in the naval reactors business, higher volume in uranium processing and higher volume in advanced technologies related to micro reactors work. First quarter Government Operations adjusted EBITDA was down 3% year-over-year to $84.7 million, driven by lower recoverable CAS pension income and fewer positive contract adjustments, due in part to lower productivity in the naval reactors business. In Commercial Operations, revenue was $100 million for the first quarter, down 7%, driven by lower commercial nuclear power field services, which were higher in the first quarter last year due to a particularly large outage project. I would say, a potentially interesting positive to the business is that the advanced reactors, most of the advanced reactors are designing for HALEU fuels, High Assay Low, Enriched Uranium fuels, that they had expected to get from Russia and that's probably not a possibility now. But as I see it, I think it's a lot of singles and doubles in terms of instituting and understanding around what are some of the terms of our offering to different suppliers and customers and so forth, and so we're kind of going methodically through that and making sure in all our business lines that we're considering not only sort of the earnings potential from future business, but also the free cash flow."
