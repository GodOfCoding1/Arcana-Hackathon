    "content": " So starting with that approximately $300 million as a base level, we anticipate adding growth in line with the high single-digit EBITDA growth from operations and topping that off with some modest benefits from our working capital initiatives, which should yield a solid operating cash flow step-up in 2020. It's actually pretty sequential because you kind of bring on the workforce, you get some of the awards later, you have outages early on, and so I'd see sort of 20% and building to almost about $0.10 every quarter thereafter. And then sort of maybe the surprising demand signal that we're seeing here in the last couple of months, Michael, is that, suddenly, globally, there's an interest in large reactors because I think people get that you really can't decarbonize the grid by 2050, or whatever your goal is, by building 5,000 small modular reactors."
