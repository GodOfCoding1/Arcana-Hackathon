    "content": " Our average enterprise customer spend was $759,000, representing a 4% quarter-over-quarter increase from Q2 and continue to demonstrate the success of Fastly's land-and-expand approach in strategic accounts. However, the key highlight here is that our enterprise customer average spend grew to $759,000 from $730,000 in the previous quarter, representing 4% expansion in dollars spent and further demonstrating our continued ability to expand our business within our largest customers and our strong customer retention. As we previously discussed, this is due to the discontinuance of site implication expenses in the first half of 2022, improvements in our network investment capacity planning to more closely match our traffic patterns and demand and a focus on reducing the cost of components of our cost of revenue, including in the third quarter, a reduction in our bandwidth cost. Our fourth quarter and full year 2022 outlook reflects our continued ability to deliver strong top line growth via improved customer acquisition and expansion within our enterprise customers, driven in part by new and enhanced products."
