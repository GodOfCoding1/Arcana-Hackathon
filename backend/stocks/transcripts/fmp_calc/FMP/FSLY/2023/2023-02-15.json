    "content": " Our average enterprise customer spend was $782,000 representing 3% quarter-over-quarter increase and continues to demonstrate the success of Fastly's land and-expand approach and strategic accounts. As we look to 2023 are first quarter and full year '23 outlook reflect our continued ability to deliver strong top line growth via improved customer acquisition and expansion within our enterprise customers, driven in part by new and enhanced products. I think as we continue to accelerate new customer acquisition, we are expected to remain relatively stable, it's going to move around a few percentage points, as we continue to see expansion within our largest customers, that expansion rate within enterprise customers is one of the motions that we do particularly well. Yes, that's a great question. And I think as we move through this year, what we've seen is and building off of the really strong expansion motion that we saw across our customers, as we've continued to add new customers in the second half of this year, those as they ramp their traffic, and we increase our expansion effort, and those, those start to really take place as you move through the second, third and fourth quarters of the year. Also, I think, we've been very thoughtful about TLG in these first couple quarters that I've been here, specifically, really on building out products, support for motions that allow our teams to move more efficiently and for customers and users to be able to self-serve more. Yes, that's a great question."
