    "content": " EOG\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, consistent execution, low cost structure, reduced hedge position and transparent cash return strategy based on a regular dividend that we have never suspended or cut that has grown 21 of the last 24 years and is now competitive with the broader market, puts EOG in its strongest position ever to deliver significant value to shareholders through the cycle. The Mowry and Niobrara combo plays in the Southern Powder River Basin stand today, well positioned to compete for capital within the portfolio and combined with our position to the north, the basin has significant investment potential for years to come. Inflation turns out to be just a little bit higher than we anticipated this year, so we are going to see a slight increase in our well cost as we go through especially the second half of the year, but we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re still confident we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to stay within our guidance and don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t expect to face additional costs that will increase our budget. Scott, please go ahead. Scott, please go ahead. So clearly our Eagle Ford position has reached a point where it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not a main focus area for growth anymore, but what we see is a very, very long runway of exceptional returns on those wells as you were reinvesting them assuming that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re moving at the right pace, where our team has the ability to execute on lowering costs, increasing incrementally the well productivity."
