While we cautiously guided there would be minimal impact in Q3 from our restructuring program, we were able to accelerate our plans in several areas and fully implement the program to realize our committed $16 million per quarter of savings from our first half 2022 expense base. So that value proposition of being able to displace multiple instruments with higher performing and cost competitive content is really beginning to take hold here and really just starting to take hold at the very end of Q3, and that's what has us excited about the momentum in Q4 and heading into 2023 able to adopt that commercial strategy that we've been waiting to adopt with the launch of A1C in particular. On your first part of your question about our target revenues, because of the -- because our focus at the moment is very much on the short term and many of us are -- the current test that we have in Europe a launch, making sure that those will get launched in the U.S. next year.

Indeed, while focusing our financial operations and strengthening the Company's financial position, we've reinforced our market position with customers and advanced our product and pipeline strategy for transforming the $50 billion point of care market."
