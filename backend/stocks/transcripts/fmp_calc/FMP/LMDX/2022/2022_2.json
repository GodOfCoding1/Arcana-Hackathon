    "content": " To allows for efficient runways to achieve pivotal milestones, we completed $100 million and plus million in financing last month and initiated a restructuring program focused on three main areas, the reduction of manufacturing as a direct consequence of lower COVID demand, deprioritizing a few R&D programs and a few early stage assets, and finally, reorganization of our R&D delivery organization. With the R&D pipeline delivering a comprehensive set of new products, with our global commercial footprint, with our installed base of instruments with world-class customers, with our manufacturing investments capable of rapidly scaling production of our low cost high performance microfluidic test strip we are well-positioned for rapid growth. First, to start with HbA1c, we see substantial opportunity for this product, estimating a global total addressable market for point-of-care HbA1c with lab comparable performance and cost to be approximately $1.3 billion, including an estimated 60% outside the U.S. As previously announced, we achieved CE Mark for our HbA1c test both for monitoring diabetes and for screening patients potentially at risk for diabetes in May of this year. But having said that, we have had a number of inquiries from COVID customers, who actually are looking to change their behavior away from other testing that they do and so they actually may get COVID placements to replace others, because of the nature of our platform, because it offers the multiple tests on the same platform and the COVID Ultra, the 5-minute test is proving to be extremely attractive in people\u00e2\u0080\u0099s work, in customer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s workflows."
