    "content": " During the first quarter, the number of our customers employees covered under the company's administered health plans decreased to 21,139 versus 25,136 at the end of 2021. Our revenues for the first quarter of 2022 were approximately $6.2 million compared to approximately $5.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2021, and revenues of $4.8 million for the third quarter of 2021. For the contract, you and your customers typically rely on brokers to assist them to make the selection of their TPA or health insurance vendor have a decision to make will they stay with the current TPA or insurance company, seeking new vendor or simply pre check the market to ensure that they're paying reasonable fees to their current TPA or insurance company. But we're not insulated from the market dynamics including the bumpy necks, the Martinez, like the one we just experienced with Customer B. I will be comparing the first quarter of 2022 expenses to the fourth quarter of \u201821 expenses, while ignoring first quarter \u201821 expenses as they do not include the continue to benefit expenses and are therefore not comparable to our Q1 \u201822 expenses. Our first quarter operating expenses, not including cost of revenues, depreciation and amortization and stock-based compensation decreased by approximately 700,000 compared to the fourth quarter."
