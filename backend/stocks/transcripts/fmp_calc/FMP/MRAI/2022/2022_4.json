Our fourth quarter operating expenses, not including cost of revenues, depreciation and amortization, and stock-based compensation expenses, were $9.8 million, an increase of approximately $4.2 million compared to the third quarter, where these expenses amounted to $5.6 million. Excluding net interest expense of $115,000, net tax benefit of $521,000, stock-based compensation of $680,000, and depreciation and amortization expenses, as well as one-time asset write-off cost of approximately $1.3 million, adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter was a negative of approximately $7 million, compared to a negative of $4.3 million in the third quarter. First quarter revenues are expected to include approximately $0.5 million of one-time revenues from one of our new ancillary products, which we acquired through the Maestro acquisition, as well as $0.5 million of one time run-of revenues.
