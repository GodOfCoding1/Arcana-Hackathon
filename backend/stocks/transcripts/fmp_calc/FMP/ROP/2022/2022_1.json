    "content": " Turning to the outlook for the balance of the year, we expect to see high single digit organic growth for this segment, driven by a combination of strong recurring revenue momentum and favorable market tailwinds. As it relates to the outlook for the balance of the year, we expect to see high single digit growth for this segment underpinned by strong demand and backlog levels, but somewhat constrained by the current supply chain environment. As you turn to page 12, revenue on our Process Tech segment were $134 million in Q1 up 18% on an organic basis, EBITDA margins were 32.5% in the quarter. Based on a solid start to Q1, strong growth in our software, recurring revenue base and record levels of product demand and backlog we are increasing our full year 2022 DEPS guidance to be in the range of $15.50 and $15.75 up from our original guidance of $15.25 and $15.55. Specifically strong recurring revenue growth, record demand for product businesses and generally favorable market conditions  Finally, we have reloaded our balance sheet and continue to have an active and engaged pipeline of M&A opportunities. Just so you think about your product centric businesses, both in the U.S. and Process Tech again, you've said it that you expect some sequential improvement as we go through the year in revenue with supply chain helping out some, but could you tease out how much of the revenue growth sequentially is coming from better supply chain versus perhaps price eating a little more, you made the reference in MAS?"
