    "content": " Cambium had recovery in our second quarter results with revenues of $69.3 million, increasing 12% sequentially, slightly ahead of our midpoint of between $65 million to $73 million announced during the Q1 '22 quarter call. Looking at revenues across our product lines, our Point-to-Multi-Point, PMP business revenues decreased 9% sequentially and decreased 53% year-over-year, due to the continued sluggish demand from service providers for legacy PMP 450 products, ahead of the ramp of both 28 gigahertz cnWave 5G fixed technology and the introduction of 6 gigahertz products expected during Q4 '22. Our enterprise business had robust revenues of $24 million during Q2 '22, increasing 55% sequentially and higher by 31% year-over-year, due to improved supply and distribution, and strong demand for our Wi-Fi 6 solutions. Instead of building solutions from multiple vendors and spending excessive time dealing with complex install problems, service providers and enterprises can manage one efficient solution utilizing Cambium's expertise in Wi-Fi, fixed wireless broadband, switching, management, and security solutions. In Q2 '22, our non-GAAP gross profit dollars of $33.9 million decreased by $12.5 million compared to the prior-year due to lower revenues and increased by $4.3 million sequentially due to higher volumes and improved mix of enterprise products. Non-GAAP operating expenses in Q2 '22 decreased by approximately $1.3 million when compared to Q2 '21, and stood at $27.5 million, or 39.7% of revenues. We expect revenues of between $280 million to $300 million, and we expect non-GAAP net income to be $13.1 million to $25.1 million, or $0.46 to $0.89 per diluted share, and adjusted EBITDA margin of 7.8% to 12.5%."
