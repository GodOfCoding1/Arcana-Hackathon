    "content": " And we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to be going in so many different directions between a fully diversified clinical lab, genetic testing, but also \u00e2\u0080\u0093 not just genetic diagnostic test but also specifically the whole genome sequencing business. And equipment is already ordered, and so in the fourth quarter other than what I just mentioned in terms of diversifying into blood, urine, tox and so forth, we're really looking to start that up in the \u00e2\u0080\u0093 probably in the first quarter, not the fourth quarter this year, but I will also tell you that there are other opportunities and other ways that we could expand more quickly. If it takes an extra 30 or 60 days to get paid, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d rather get the extra business, because otherwise what happens is you lose the specimen collection partner will go to a different company, if we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t pay them up front and/or if we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not willing to take specimens where sometimes, we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get the insurance information until later."
