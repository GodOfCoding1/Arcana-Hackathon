Good question, it is Cameron here and as far as the data center demand, the best way to look at that is it's just showing further commitment from our customer base into the Atlassian ecosystem, and also the highlights the mission criticality of our applications, as we continue to say that migration to cloud is a multi-year journey, different customers are on different stages of that journey. Sir, your line is open. Sir, your line is open. Sir, your line is open. And so when I look at the investments we're making, like you'd have to say they're in the areas of the three different markets, we talked about those investments required to help our customers make those migrations across the cloud and continued investments in the platform that were that we've built out over those years and continue to build out. So, I think like longer-term, you've seen pressure on our marketplace take rates across kind of, particularly in the consumer side of things has been downward pressure on that, and we get to play that out over the long-term, I would say that we will -- the take rate will be more pressure on the take rates have been historically, but that's also going to lead to a much, much, much larger ecosystem build around Atlassian. We're experimenting and seeing beyond our traditional partners, how we can partner with people, like it, we've made investments into Atlassian Ventures, and overall like the number we focus on is not really our take rate, like that that's nice, but that number we focus on internally is our sort of GMV or so effectively how much money is running through the marketplace, like to our third parties, and that's the number we work internally. Sir, your line is open."
