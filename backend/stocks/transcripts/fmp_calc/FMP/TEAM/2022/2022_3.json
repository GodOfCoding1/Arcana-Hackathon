    "content": " And that's a relatively new product and it shows the type of volume of product market fit, as you would say, is quite strong, increasingly over the last couple of years, largely due to our cloud platform and from an enterprise investment perspective, supported by a variety of really robust features in the IT service management market. But as you've seen from us over time, investing in R&D and investing in products and listening to customers is something that we do very well, and we're going to continue to run that by quarter-on-quarter, and we're very bullish about the Jira work management space and its opportunities. Obviously, we've been talking a lot about server to cloud, server to data center, but also the fact that a good number of our larger customers that generally are on the data center products migrating to the cloud I think, is going to be a theme that continues to play out for a number of years. We also have a series of new products that we've seen, we mentioned Jira work management, taking advantage of the Jira family and Jira's history of compliance and structure and control for organizations and teams that work that way."
