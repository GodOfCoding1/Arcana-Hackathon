    "content": " So we continue to spend circa $200 million a year, just in general maintenance, environmental, safety-related spend, that's going to continue, whether we're in the depths of the pandemic or we're in the current market environment that we see today. So we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got another, call it, $300 million to $350 million of CapEx that I think we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re comfortable overall investing to get that project up and running because that kind of current market environment or current market prices with 300 million gallons a year of production on an annualized basis, that should generate $400 million a year in EBITDA."
