I want to thank our team, they've really worked hard this quarter and done a great job and we're really pleased with our improvement in our credit quality and our continued improvement in margin and very excited about the opportunity to bring on our team members in Colorado and New Mexico, and bring them in as a part of the CrossFirst team."
