    "content": " For the quarter, average deposits increased 7% to 5.3 billion, up 116 million from the previous quarter, excluding the Central acquisition. As Randy noted, our percentage of demand deposits increased to 25% this quarter, with some being related to the added liquidity of the acquisition in addition to organic growth. Even with robust organic loan growth this quarter, our loan to deposit ratio increased slightly to 95%, which was helped by the acquisition, liquidity and deposit base. I think we have this all in the details of the release, but 26% loan growth for the year, 17% without the acquisition for the quarter. And so again, we look at our non-performings at 20 basis points, our classified to capital at 10 and our reserve level of 131, we think the portfolio is really well positioned for future growth and also for some economic uncertainty."
