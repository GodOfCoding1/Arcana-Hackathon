    "content": " Fewer days in the quarter, a positive fourth quarter impact of loans that return to occurring status and headwinds from PPP fee, which continued to decline, all offset positive expansion of interest income from loan growth and deployment of liquidity. We anticipate non-interest expense to be in a range of $27.5 million to $28.5 million per quarter for the rest of this year, subject to our ability to continue to find opportunistic hires in a very competitive environment and subject to revenue growth to support a higher cost base. The portfolio turnover rate decreased during the quarter, but remains at an elevated level compared to historical averages, illustrating the higher continued level of loan payoff activity due to low permanent fixed rates and market cap rates. Your line is open. So, Mike and I think about that as, those two things moving together, we had a little bit of noise in particular in the net interest income in the first quarter that pushed our ratios a little bit, but that range would include anticipated rate changes and our sensitivity. Your line is open. And as I said last quarter, I'll repeat, we believe we have some opportunity to lag deposit increases as the Fed brings up short-term rates and we're working very, very closely with our client facing market leaders to do that in the right way and ensure we don't impact client relationships in particular with a short-term focus. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open."
