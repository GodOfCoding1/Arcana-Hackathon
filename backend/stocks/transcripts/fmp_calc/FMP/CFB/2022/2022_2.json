    "content": " We reported $15.5 million of earnings, and our team produced $179 million of loan growth during the quarter, which is an annualized rate of over 16%. Turning to the balance sheet, we had robust loan growth this quarter, as Mike mentioned, at 16% % on an annualized basis. As previously mentioned, in Q2, we reported a 4% quarter-over-quarter loan growth rate or 16% on an annualized basis. The energy portfolio continued to decrease during the quarter, dropping $37 million to $226 million or 5% of our total loan portfolio. And so, in the second quarter, we did add a little bit of that back, but we're still going to fund our loan growth with core deposits and we've put deposit pricing in place to do that and really proud of the fact that we've grown DDA 42% over the last 12months."
