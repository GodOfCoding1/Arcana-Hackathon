    "content": " The potential of UGN-102 to transform the treatment paradigm as the first viable nonsurgical alternative for low-grade intermediate risk NMIBC, potential future commercialization activities for UGN-102, if approved, data presentations, regulatory filings, future research and development efforts, our goals, potentially reaching cash flow breakeven by 2025 and 2022 financial guidance, among other things. I'm pleased to announce that last month, we initiated a novel multi-arm Phase I clinical trial intended to evaluate the safety and tolerability of UGN-301, as monotherapy and in combination with other chemotherapies and immunomodulators as our first immunotherapy investigational candidate intended to treat patients with high-grade disease, which remains a high unmet need. During the first quarter, we continued implementing our phased launch of the registry, which is expected to provide insights into the real-world outcomes of UTUC patients treated with Jelmyto and evaluate its use in clinical practice in the U.S."
