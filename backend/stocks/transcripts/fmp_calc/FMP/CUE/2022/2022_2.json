    "content": " As an introduction and each will provide a synopsis of our progress to date, as well as describing our strategic and competitive positioning prior to turning the call over to Ken and Matteo who will each provide a summary and status update of the data associated with observations from our ongoing Phase 1 trials of CUE-101, as well as the recently initiated CUE-102 trial. We're excited to be presenting our updated data from the ongoing CUE-101 Phase 1 trial as both a single agent monotherapy and third-line and beyond head and neck cancer, as well as the encouraging emerging early data from the combination study with pembrolizumab in first-line patients. As previously and consistently stated, we believe CUE-101 Q1 mechanism of action is evidenced by the ongoing data generated to-date provides effective and tolerated dose levels enabling selective stimulation of tumor specific T-cells. The data presented on slide seven from a patient treated with RP2D at 4 mg per kg demonstrates stable disease lasting close to 12 months and ongoing with sustained reductions of cell free HPV-DNA, a biomarker that may reflect disease activity in patients with HPV-positive cancers. In addition to the data just described by Ken, we have observed in our 20 treated patients at the recommended Phase 2 dose in our monotherapy trial, one PR and seven patients with durable stable disease for an overall clinical benefit rate of approximately 40%. And then the data that we've been getting from these ongoing cell-free DNA assays which didn't really exist when we started the trial was that several of our TIs have started to follow virtually all of the patients with cell-free DNA to try and get some insight into their disease, especially when we don't know when somebody has an increase in their tumor, if that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s by resist, if that's more I resist, is that an inflammatory change that we should be following, what their cell-free DNA, is that going up or going down, suggesting it might be more inflammatory or with these stable disease patients do they have any active tumor left."
