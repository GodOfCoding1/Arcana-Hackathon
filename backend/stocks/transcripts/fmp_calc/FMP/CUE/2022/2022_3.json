    "content": " I'm now going to turn the call over to Anish who will provide a brief synopsis and overview of the key mechanistic features of our selective T-cell engager, the IL-2-based CUE-100 series, and I'll then turn the call over to Ken and Matteo to review the supporting efficacy data that has emerged from the monotherapy trial and provide an update from our recent SITC presentation pertaining to the current efficacy data from our combination of CUE-101 with KEYTRUDA in frontline HPV positive head and neck squamous cell carcinoma patients. Key observations in patients treated with CUE-101 monotherapy in third line and beyond include as detailed on Slide 10, and demonstration of a single agent -- a demonstration of single-agent antitumor efficacy, evidenced by RECIST based PR and durable stable disease in third line and recurrent metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma and a median overall survival benefit emerging from the survival follow-up in the RP2D cohort."
