    "content": " In addition to generating rig margin per day exceeding most of our industry peers, we ended the year with 20 rigs operating, activated 2 additional rigs during the fourth quarter. All-in-all, ICD entered 2023 in a very strong position, whether from a margin per day and cash flow generation perspective or a fleet composition perspective where we have materially increased the percentage of rigs marketed with our 300 series specification. Today, overall utilization remains above 90% in the industry and we expect continued improvement in our rig margin per day in the first quarter driven by contract rollovers as we reprice rigs contracted early last year. So as we move past the first quarter and all of the rigs have repriced to current market day rates, I expect day rate and margin improvement to flatten out for ICD after the first quarter. Overall, we would expect to operate in the neighborhood of 19 to 20 average rigs during this year, taking into account the transition time that might occur on rig relocations during the second and third quarter. We expect operating days to approximate 1,715 days, representing approximately 19 average rigs working during the quarter, reflecting some rigs beginning to transition from the Haynesville to the Permian. So, our internal planning processes are budgeting that we generate revenue on approximately 17, 18 average rigs during the second quarter, approximately 19 to 20 rigs in the third quarter, and then we resumed full effective utilization of our 21 reactivated rigs in the fourth quarter by year end. But certainly, by the end of the year and I would hope within the fourth quarter, we are back to 20 rigs run \u00e2\u0080\u0093 21 rigs running and position for what should be a really good 2024 when you think about the macro."
