    "content": " What I think is most impressive about these first quarter sequential improvements that we were able to achieve them even though we absorbed sequential labor increases of approximately $900 per day and had approximately 31 idle non-operating days associated with rigs transferring between customers, more idle days than we expected, which was primarily driven by trucking delays and relocating rigs. For the second quarter, we\u2019re forecasting 30% to 35% sequential increases in margin per day and based on the contracts we have in place today and a significant number of rigs that will re-rate again throughout the third quarter, we expect meaningful sequential growth in margin per day and adjusted EBITDA continuing during the back half of the year and into 2023. What that means is all of our rigs will be repriced during our customers\u2019 normal annual budgeting season, and our entire fleet should rerate to at least current market day rates by the fourth quarter of this year. SG&A costs for the quarter were $5.2 million, which included approximately $1 million of stock-based and deferred compensation expense, sequential increases in cash SG&A related to the reinstitution of pre-COVID pay as well as further compensation adjustments to address the tightening labor market as well as elevated recruiting and onboarding costs."
