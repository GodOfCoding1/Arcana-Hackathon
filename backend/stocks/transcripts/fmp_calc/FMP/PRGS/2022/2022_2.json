    "content": " Annual recurring revenues continue to grow, up 13% on an as-reported basis and 3.5% year-over-year on a pro forma basis to $486 million. In constant currency, our second quarter revenue exceeded $154 million or 19% growth on a year-over-year basis. In addition, we closed the second quarter with approximately $486 million in annualized recurring revenue, representing 13% growth on a constant currency basis and 3.5% growth on a pro forma constant currency basis. Adjusted free cash flow was $68 million for the quarter, up $13 million or 23% from Q2 of last year. Finally, as mentioned on our last call, our full year revenue guidance excludes $2 million to $3 million in revenue associated with previously forecasted business activity in Russia. Turning now to our third quarter guidance, I'd like to start by reminding everyone that in the third quarter of 2021, we exceeded the midpoint of our revenue guidance by $22 million and a significant portion of this overperformance was the result of timing, specifically revenue shifting from Q4 into Q3. But I really -- if you look at the different variables on a year-over-year basis, whether it's the impact of foreign exchange, if you sort of take Kemp if you want to sort of take it out of both years, and then just look at the business on a pure sort of year-over-year comp basis, I guess I would say Q3 to us, especially relative to the over performance we saw last year, which was a bit anomalous, feels incredibly steady and pretty solid, Q3 of '22 versus Q3 of '21."
