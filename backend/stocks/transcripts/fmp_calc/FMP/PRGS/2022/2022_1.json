    "content": " Consistent with our growth in revenue, we also saw growth in ARR to close the first quarter with $479 million in ARR to represent 12% growth on a year-over-year basis, and 3.5% growth on a pro forma year-over-year basis. Our total cost and operating expenses for the quarter were $88.8 million, up 18% compared to the prior year and right in line with our expectations. As a result, we are increasing our full year outlook on almost every metric and we expect revenue between $609 million and $617 million, and that's an increase of $3 million from the midpoint of our prior guidance. I'd like to highlight the fact that this $3 million increase to our revenue guidance includes the negative impact of movements in foreign exchange rates and the removal of previously forecasted business activity in Russia, which together totaled approximately $4 million."
