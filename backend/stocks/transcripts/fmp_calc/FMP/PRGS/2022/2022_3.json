    "content": " Moreover, movements in foreign exchange rates during the third quarter alone resulted in a revenue headwind of approximately $1.5 million without which, we would have landed $4.5 million above the high end of our guidance range. However, there are multiple factors that make the year-over-year comparison difficult, including the timing of revenue recognition and contract duration, which we covered in last year's Q3 earnings call, movements in foreign exchange rates and the addition of Kemp to our 2022 results. Deferred revenue was $251 million at the end of the third quarter, down slightly from the second quarter, reflecting normal seasonality in our business, coupled with the impact of foreign exchange rates on deferred revenue. And I think our business generally is a little bit impacted by those foreign exchange rates, and there's probably a little bit of a slight margin compression there, not anything like what we would see on the revenue line. There's a segment about approximately one-third of our business, let's say, 30% of our business is other software companies, right, where we have 1,700 other software companies whose products are built on top of our products, they embed our products into their products and then they license those to all kinds of companies, large enterprises as well as mid-market companies. But the -- when I look at the pro forma ARR sequential additions, I think it's something like $9 million seems probably the highest in the last eight quarters, at least in my model."
