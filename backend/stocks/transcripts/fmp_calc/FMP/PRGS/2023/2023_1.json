    "content": " Revenues came in at $166 million, ahead of the high end of guidance, which was $161 million, and earnings ended the quarter at $1.19 or $0.11 above the high end of guidance range back in January and represents 12% growth on a year-over-year basis. As Yogesh mentioned, the growth in ARR was again driven broadly across our product portfolio by multiple products including OpenEdge, MarkLogic, DataDirect, Sitefinity, MOVEit, and our DevTools products, a trend that continues to fuel our ARR growth is strong net retention with Q1 rates at 102%. In addition to our strong ARR growth, revenue for the quarter of $165.6 million was well above the high end of the guidance range we provided back in January and represents 12% growth on a year-over-year basis. The better-than-expected performance in the quarter was driven by two primary factors; first, and representing the majority of our over performance, was stronger than expected demand from multiple products, including OpenEdge, DataDirect, MOVEit and Loadmaster."
