    "content": " Our overall swaps volume grew by 43%, led by an improved macro backdrop relative to last year and our continued organic growth efforts, which drove market share higher to 15.1% as measured by Clarus. This is another great quarter as our business continues to surge ahead, generating $84 million in revenues despite fee per million pressures in our largest business, institutional corporate credit. Finally, within equities, institutional ETF produced strong quarterly revenue growth the average daily volume up 50% year-on-year, driven by new client wins and strong industry volumes. Just like Credit, the multiyear growth story continues as swaps registered another strong quarter aided by rebounding industry volumes and market share gains. In sum, our blended fees per million increased 3% year-over-year, primarily as a result of stronger growth in higher fee per million rates derivatives and cash equities. For cash rate products, fees per million were up 12%, primarily due to growth in higher fee per million U.S. Treasuries and migration of certain European government bond clients from fixed to variable contracts at the end of last year. For long tenor swaps, fees per million were down 4%, primarily due to lower duration and billable volume mix, while we continue to see growth in emerging market swaps and RFM. Drilling down on cash credit, average fees per million increased 12% due to stronger growth in U.S. high yield, U.S. high-grade and munis, which carry a higher fee per million than overall cash credit. Looking at the credit derivatives and electronically processed U.S. cash credit category, fees per million decreased 2%, driven by stronger growth in CDS, which carries a lower fee per million than the group average. July volumes increased over 10% year-on-year, led by growth across interest rate swaps, money markets and institutional ETFs."
