    "content": " The U.S. Services segment delivered revenue of $398.1 million for the quarter, which represents a decline over the prior year period driven by expected reductions to short-term COVID response work. For the U.S. Federal Services segment, second quarter fiscal 2022 revenue increased to $573.3 million, driven primarily by contributions from the Attain Federal, VES and Aidvantage acquisition. On an organic basis, revenue increased about 9% in the quarter, and if you adjust for the COVID response work, normalized organic growth in the segment would be about 13% over the prior-year period. The U.S. Services new work is driven by fiscal year 2021 awards that were scheduled to start earlier in fiscal year 2022, but have been delayed by the customer and should begin in this third quarter. We anticipate U.S. Services to now be in the 9% to 11% range for the full year and notably expect a margin step down in the third quarter as short-term COVID response work further reduces to close to zero, but before the redetermination activities resume."
