    "content": " While our organic revenue declined 3.5% in the quarter, adjusting for the COVID response work and the concluded Census contract, normalized organic growth would be approximately 9% year-over-year. For the U.S. Federal Services Segment, first quarter fiscal 2022 revenue increased 43.6% to $581.9 million, driven primarily by contributions from the Attain Federal and VES acquisitions. For the first quarter of fiscal 2022, signed awards were $454 million of total contract value at December 31, 2021, of which only a small portion includes short-term COVID work. Operator, back to you. That said, the normalized organic growth of 9% in the December quarter as well as our fiscal year '22 guidance suggests that we have line of sight to exceeding that level in the near term, albeit that's adjusted for the runoff of the short-term COVID work. Operator, back to you."
