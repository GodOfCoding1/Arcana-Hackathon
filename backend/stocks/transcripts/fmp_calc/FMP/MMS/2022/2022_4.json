    "content": " This resulted in a $17 million benefit, or $0.20 of earnings per share, and split roughly evenly between the U.S. services OI, the U.S. Federal Services OI, and the other line item which represents items that are not allocated to a particular segment. New work wins and expansion on recompetes examples of which include the additional region one in VES, the SEC modernization effort announced last year with expanded scope and the CMS contact center operations recompete with higher run rate drove a normalized organic growth rate in the segment of 4.8%. The segment realized an operating loss of $15 million for fiscal 2022, due to the unfortunate rebid outcome in Australia, which included severance costs, and the write down on a percentage of completion project that we described in the third quarter. Reflecting on the revenue guidance, the $4.825 billion midpoint represents mid-single digit growth over fiscal 2022, while also overcoming $300 million of erosion from short-term COVID response work. Further in U.S. services, we successfully converted several contracts originally secured to support short-term COVID unemployment insurance work to longer term relationships, including a more than $200 million TCV contract in California."
