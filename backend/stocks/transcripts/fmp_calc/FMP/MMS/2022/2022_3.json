    "content": " Absent the write down this quarter reflected our expectation for lower earnings caused by declines in profitable short-term COVID response work, while also facing lower volumes in our core programs, as Medicaid redeterminations remained paused. The U.S. services segment delivered revenue of $399 million for the quarter, which is a decline from the prior year period driven by expected reductions to short-term COVID response work. Third quarter fiscal year 2022 revenue decreased to $526 million due to expected reductions to short-term COVID response work, partially offset by contributions from the VES and Aidvantage acquisition. Turning to the outside the U.S. segment, third quarter revenue increased 6.0% to $201 million as compared to the prior year period. So we need to make sure our networks are in place to support those veterans and hence why, we are making a major investment, as David noted, of between $8 million and $10 million in this this fiscal year to first of all, ensure that we are retaining the current staff that we have, but also ramping up new staff in advance of the anticipated volumes."
