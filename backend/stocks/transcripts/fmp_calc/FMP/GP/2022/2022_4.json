    "content": " The other funding \u00e2\u0080\u0093 significant funding source is that California introduced through their HVIP program, a school bus set-aside fund, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s $130 million this year and $130 million in the next 2 years. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and if you look at the Workhorse product, which is a perfect example, their W-750 is incredibly compelling, because it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a new body design, specifically for an EV and that makes \u00e2\u0080\u0093 it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not like you are just retrofitting a legacy diesel vehicle with batteries and electric motors, you are actually starting from scratch and changing the whole concept making it a much more compelling, longer lasting, more efficient, what have you proposition. Fraser, you mentioned earlier the Nano BEAST and the BEAST and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s one thing we found, and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been traveling coast-to-coast with that vehicle with Joe, Angeli and Michael Perez and our school bus team, you really see the difference between our products and all the legacy products and even the converted legacy products, which are basically the market right now for electric school buses besides ours. So on the \u00e2\u0080\u0093 I think the answer we gave Greg is really without getting into future financial numbers because we have not issued guidance and our position is till we hit cash flow, positive cash flow, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and given all the supply chain issues and other things that we battled over the last couple of years, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s probably been a good call."
