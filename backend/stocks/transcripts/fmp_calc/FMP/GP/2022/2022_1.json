    "content": " Revenue increased 17% compared to the first quarter of the prior year and was generated from the delivery of five EV Stars to Forest River; 14 EV Stars to Green Commuter, for which GreenPower provided lease financing; one EV Star to Harbor Air, which will be used as a shuttle between the airline's various locations and for which GreenPower provided lease financing; and one EV Star to the Learning Disability Society of Greater Vancouver for uses in mobile classroom. I mean I think people think a lot about EVs in the commercial side and it's kind of been this e-commerce, lockdown, acceleration in demand, but it's interesting, because where kind of green power fits in the market, it's almost like more of a reopening trade as campuses go back to work and people start flying. There's a lot of future deliveries but among the companies actually delivering there seems to be a conversation that's growing about the pending HVIP vouchers, the pending New York vouchers, the expected benefit from the infrastructure plan putting near-term deliveries on pause, having customers wait to see where they get the best potential support for being early adopters of medium and heavy-duty EVs. Well, I'll start with sort of a high-level comment on the -- in terms of the product mix when we're dealing with a range of products from 25 to 40 footers, it's -- a lot goes into the decisions we have to make on which models that we build up."
