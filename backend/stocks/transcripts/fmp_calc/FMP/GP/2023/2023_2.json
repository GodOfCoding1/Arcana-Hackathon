    "content": " Working capital included $4.2 million in AR, the majority of which was current at quarter end and $44 million in inventory, which was comprised of over $27.5 million in finished goods inventory, which is primarily comprised of EV Star Transit plus, EV Star cabin chassis, EV Stars, EV Star Cargo, and both BEAST and Nano BEAST school buses as well, we had $16.5 million in working process. I guess one of my questions is could you confirm the 29 to Workhorse and then really just thinking about, I know there's seasonality and deliveries of the business, but as we think about that now that we have this agreement with the Workhorse, should we expect more of a smoothing of deliveries as maybe that can kind of offset some of the seasonality and the delivery of buses for schools. Yeah, I think we've said in the past, Greg, the margins is really a function of our product mix, and I would say, right now as we move into higher volume sales, that's likely going to be at a slightly lower margin and depending on certain sales of as an example, EV Stars and certain of our school buses, those could be at higher margins."
