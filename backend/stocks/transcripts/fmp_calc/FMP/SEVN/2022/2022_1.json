We ended the first quarter with 27 first mortgage loans, with an aggregate commitment of $685 million, representing a new high watermark for Seven Hills loan book. Adjusted distributable earnings came in at $5.3 million or $0.37 per share, which was well in excess of our quarterly dividend. Our earnings include prepayment income of approximately $2.3 million or $0.16 per share, driven by 2 loan prepayments ahead of their initial maturity. Interest income from investments was $9.6 million, an increase of 33% on a sequential quarter basis, primarily driven by prepayment income during the first quarter."
