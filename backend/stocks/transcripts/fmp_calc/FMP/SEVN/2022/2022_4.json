    "content": " In January, we are pleased to announce a 40% increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.35 per share, or a $1.40 annually, which was a direct result of our strong operating performance and our confidence in the long term outlook for our business. As of December 31, Seven Hills portfolio consisted of 27 first mortgage loans with total commitments of $728 million representing a 12% increase compared to a year ago. Based on our current expectations, including forward-looking interest rates, our pipeline of originations and anticipated loan repayments, we expect next quarter's DE to be between $0.35 and $0.37 per share. As a result of our earnings growth in 2022, our expectations that earnings will continue to benefit from higher interest rate levels and the quality of our loan portfolio, we increased our quarterly dividend by $0.10 to $0.35 per share, which will be paid to shareholders of record as of January 23 later this week."
