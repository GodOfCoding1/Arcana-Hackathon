    "content": " We do had a couple of things that we priced during the year, but I think as much as anything, it's the effect of our supply chain team solving for those kinds of issues in real time, and we do expect \u2013 we did run higher inflation, but we have built it into our plan certainly for the first and second quarter. Again, I think part of our decision not to take price last year, our relative conservatism around taking price this year thus far, is really meant to make sure that we drive that value proposition  In times like that, they look for consistency, they look for value, they look for quality, and we have our entire team focused on all of that to make sure that should what we're hearing happens, again, we believe that we'd be able to perform well relatively good back then."
