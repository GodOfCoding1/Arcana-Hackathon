    "content": " It's a very good question, and I think if there's one mistake that we've made in the last few years is actually thinking that we should invest more in other technologies and less in firewalls because I mean there is a very, very healthy demand in firewalls today. I think people more and more realize that as much as we speak about advanced technologies and more environment, the network is the best, and it's the most important vector to defend our enterprise, especially as you look at more applications and more IoT devices and things like that, but simply cannot be protected using our technologies. You can also see the consolidation, things that few years ago, everybody thought will be a separate subsystem in a new category are now it's very obvious to everyone that we are part of the gateway that we are part of the firewall."
