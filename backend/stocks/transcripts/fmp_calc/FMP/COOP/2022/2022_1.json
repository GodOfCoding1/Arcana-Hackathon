    "content": " First so let's review the quarter's highlights for the first quarter of 2022 we generated very, very strong net income of $658 million. Net income included, operating results, which were in line with our guidance, the gain from the Sagent transaction, which we closed in March and an MSR mark of $552 million, which was higher than what we previously guided to as interest rates continue to rise through quarter end. Now let's turn to Slide 8 and talk about servicing income, we guided you to expect breakeven results this quarter and we did slightly better than that with pretax operating income of $7 million. Additionally, swap rates increased 162 basis points, which drove higher expectations for custodial deposit income together these rate moves resulted in a positive mark of $552 million, which brought the value of the MSR up 22 basis points to 146 basis points of UPB. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open."
