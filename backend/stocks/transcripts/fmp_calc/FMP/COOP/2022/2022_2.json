    "content": " In fact, we bought back $100 million in shares this quarter, almost 3 times the level of the first quarter, which shows you how we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re constantly thinking about capital allocation and where we can get the best possible returns. I think it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, you know, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re saying that over the balance of the year, $50 million plus or minus is about where we expect to be every quarter. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m curious you know if there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an incentive to lock in book value and repurchase more stock or how you think about you know the balance between the two, because you obviously have shares trading at a pretty substantial discount to book value that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a great return on buying back or you know buying back your stock and there are also potential accretive things that could happen you know over time, that could even be you know, significantly more accretive to book value. On \u00e2\u0080\u0093 last quarter you guys mentioned you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re having some initial preliminary discussions with \u00e2\u0080\u0093 you know with bankers about potentially monetizing the auction exchange platform, there always has been a lot of volatility, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re also \u00e2\u0080\u0093 you know we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re also moving into a cycle where that business could outperform if we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re \u00e2\u0080\u0093 especially if we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going into a recession. And so, I would just point out you know, in May \u00e2\u0080\u0093 on May 6th of 1984, Teledyne stock was $155.75 and Dr. Singleton who you worked for, were for $200 a share to buy 5 million shares, 8.7 million shares were tendered and 44% of the company took it all."
