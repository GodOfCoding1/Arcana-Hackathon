    "content": " So the resulting $1.2 million year-over-year increase in operating expenses was driven in three areas: first, $385,000 in selling expenses related to technology innovation, marketing initiatives and sales engineering resources; second, a $490,000 increase in SG&A for essential investments in IT and other back-office capabilities; and third, a $334,000 increase in research and development costs to support continued investment in new technologies such as the AOX cable platform announced earlier this year and a recent patent announcement for the new Flex Faraday Xtreme technology. This includes taking great care of our people as well as our supplier partners and maximizing our major strategic customer relationships, which are defined by four key characteristics: proactive communication with customer leadership; R&D investments in development in new core intellectual property that delivers higher quality, environmentally sustainable and more competitive product capabilities; early engagement between our engineering teams; and frequent, open, candid and honest dialogue between our supply chain teams. We are continuing to make measurable progress in numerous areas that are critical to improving customer on-time delivery of quality products, including hiring great people, providing them with effective training, paying them fairly, offering great benefits and retaining them for the long-term, improving plant capacity and throughput, reducing waste and process inefficiencies, conducting customer engineering discussions to planned future product capabilities, relocating production to the optimal plant whether it's in U.S., Mexico or China and proactive communication up and down the supply chain to address bottlenecks and prevent lead time issues."
