    "content": " Jay will begin today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s call with a brief review of our second quarter operational performance, and then I will review Nortech\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Q2 financial results before turning it back over to Jay for his closing comments and some highlights from our recent strategic planning process. So beginning with the P&L, in Q2 2022, revenue totaled $32.5 million, and this represents a 7.7% increase from revenue of $30.2 million in the second quarter of 2021, and up nearly 6% from our prior quarter this year. First, net cash used by operating activities for the quarter ended June 30, 2022, was $1.9 million compared with a net cash used by operations of $5.4 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2021. During the second quarter, increases in working capital due to higher sales backlog levels as well as actions taken to address the global supply chain shortages drove the use of cash from operating activities, primarily increasing inventories by $3.5 million."
