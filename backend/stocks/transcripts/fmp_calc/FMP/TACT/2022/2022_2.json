    "content": " However, we still managed to produce a large number of printers in the second quarter, and we plan to produce even more in the third and fourth quarters, approaching near-record levels of production and sales in our casino market, again, barring any additional unseen supply issue. While this number was slightly below our expectations for the quarter, we are optimistic about the back half of the year as our sales team, now led by our new sales executives who have deep experience with selling enterprise software products, is fully built out, and I cannot be happy with the progress they are making. Total net sales for the second quarter were $12.6 million, up 35% from $9.3 million in the second quarter of '21. Sales from our Food Service Technology market, or FST, were up 12% to $3.4 million compared to the second quarter of '21. Additionally, in the 2022 second quarter, we experienced a full effect from our first price increase, which generated a higher total revenue number and allowed us to absorb the cost increases we've incurred. We incurred an operating loss of $3 million or 23.4% of net sales from the second quarter of '22, which compares to an operating loss of $2.6 million or 28.4% of net sales in the second quarter of '22 -- sorry, '21. Adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter of '22 was negative $2.5 million, which compares to negative $2.1 million in the year ago period. It was just a great -- I just got to tell you, it was just a great quarter and so proud of everybody of what we were able to complete going live on a new ERP system, the team getting all the parts, getting back into full production and now really ramped up."
