    "content": " 05:59 Lastly on Elacestrant, our internal values in the Elacestrant from a risk adjusted basis, obviously risk is going in our model down, profitability going up, and if you look at the totality of potential cash flows at different revenue, I would just say, it's a very interesting asset for us. We continue to manage our operating expenses, R&D costs declined by $9 million or 28% versus Q1 2021, reduced costs for the Abaloparatide TD and SC programs drove this decrease as did net program cost for Elacestrant. Your line is open. Your line is open. So if you combine that with less infrastructure, the cash flow dynamics in the second half of the year would be rather different than the first half of the year, that's number one 34:21 Number two, we have previously announced, there is a small milestone we get, when we file elacestrant from Menarini, so that's good. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open."
