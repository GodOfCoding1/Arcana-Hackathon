    "content": " And I'll just say, anecdotally, when we released this interactive video, like the number of people who have been pinging us saying, \"We had no idea that you did this and that this kind of thing was within Vimeo's suite,\" I think is just indicative of the clear opportunity we have to actually get our user experience on the product to actually be our marketing. So if you take a look at the pipeline rebounding in the quarter, the momentum in Vimeo Enterprise in terms of seat growth, the bookings -- even the bookings we saw in the quarter amongst products, and in particular, our sales productivity, where we really feel like the sales force is ramped and really now in the place of optimizing, it makes us have a lot of enthusiasm about sales assistance. And so what you're really going to see in our marketing and product efforts on self-serve is we will always look to be a platform for anybody, but more of a concerted effort now that we really understand like this is the user that we must serve above all and speak to, how can we both attract more of them and convert more of them into our products."
