    "content": " Underneath that, and Anjali mentioned this, but I think it's really important to note, we see metrics in the business that point to that sort of mid-teens organic growth, paid MAUs, uploads. And that, in the interest of being a profitable growth business, which we think over the long haul is really our best way to create value, we are really conservatively investing in Vimeo Enterprise and getting self-serve back to growth and are -- have made choices to not invest in other less strategic areas. As part of a mix shift in Vimeo is sort of a natural sort of focusing on who's our highest value customer, let's make sure our pricing, our website, our product experience really speaks to those customers. You can be a market -- a marketing department of the largest company in the world with the largest budget, you can be someone who has been in the video business and creating video for 20 years, and you will still say it's way, way too hard. Certainly, for Vimeo Enterprise, we see an opportunity to expand internationally and our -- we had planted a flag in EMEA and APAC, and we're seeing really exciting growth there, and we think we're just getting started as it relates to international expansion of our sales force. Despite challenges and tough choices of late, we kicked off the year genuinely energized, and for two reasons: Because the tailwinds for video are strong, and we think we've got the best product for businesses to use video; and because our strategy is to simplify, simplify our products to make it easier for our customers, and simplify our business to make it easier for ourselves."
