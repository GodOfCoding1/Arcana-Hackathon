    "content": " We had many record high metrics, including average daily production of 18,000 Boe per day, adjusted EBITDA of $106.3 million and discretionary cash flow of $93.4 million. Using the bookends of annual cast G&A guidance and combined 3Q actual production for Sitio and Brigham, including a full quarter for momentum, third quarter cash G&A per Boe would have been in the $1.80 to $1.88 range for the combined company. Pro forma for our full quarter of Momentum Minerals assets, our third quarter production was 18,600 Boe per day, which is above the midpoint of our second half 2022 guidance for standalone Sitio. On a combined basis and including a full quarter of Momentum, Sitio and Brigham's assets produced an average of 33,600 Boe per day in the third quarter, which is above the midpoint of the average day production guidance range released at merger announcement for the 12 months ending June 30, 2023."
