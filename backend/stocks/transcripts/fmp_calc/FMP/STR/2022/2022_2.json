    "content": " Overall, second quarter 2022 financial and operational results exceeded our internal expectations and we made significant progress on execution of our large-scale minerals consolidation strategy with the completion of the reverse merger with Falcon Minerals on June 7, the signing and closing of the Foundation Minerals acquisition in late June and the announcement of the Momentum Minerals acquisition which closed in late July. Second quarter 2022 pro forma combined production was 15,149 BOE\u00e2\u0080\u0099s per day which exceeded expectations and was primarily driven by the timing and performance of wells turned in line on our Permian assets. This continued strong production output in the second quarter resulted in first half 2022 pro forma combined production of 15,317 BOE\u00e2\u0080\u0099s per day which is 9.4% above the midpoint of our first half 2022 guidance range and 5.6% above the high end of that range. However, looking at percent oil production alone is a bit misleading because pro forma combined first half 2022 oil volumes of 7,720 barrels per day exceeded the high end of the implied guidance range for barrels of oil production which was 7,685 barrels per day. However, instead of applying the payout ratio to reported second quarter discretionary cash flow which would have resulted in a $0.58 per share dividend, the Board approved a second quarter dividend of $0.71 per share based on $91.4 million of pro forma discretionary cash flow which is inclusive of Falcon Minerals cash flow for the entire quarter and excludes transaction fees related to the reverse merger. For the second half of 2022, we are reiterating our average daily production range of 18,000 to 19,000 BOE\u00e2\u0080\u0099s per day and slightly lowering the ranges for gathering and transportation per BOE and cash taxes after reviewing completed second quarter results."
