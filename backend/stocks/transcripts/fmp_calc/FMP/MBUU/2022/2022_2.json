As Jack mentioned earlier, we maintained our momentum throughout the first half of fiscal year 2022 and exceeded expectations despite continued headwinds from a volatile supply chain and inflationary environment, consumer demand was unfazed and march forward at a robust pace, helping to drive ASPs to unforeseen levels.

Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open."
