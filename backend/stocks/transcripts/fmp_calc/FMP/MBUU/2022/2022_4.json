    "content": " On the call, Jack will provide commentary on the business and I will discuss our fiscal fourth quarter and full year 2022 financials. I also want to remind everyone that management\u00e2\u0080\u0099s remarks on this call may contain certain forward-looking statements, including predictions, expectations, estimates or other information that might be considered forward-looking and that actual results could differ materially from those projected on today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s call. Please also note that we will be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures on today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s call such as adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin, adjusted fully distributed net income, and adjusted fully distributed net income per share. Fiscal year 2022 was another record year for Malibu Boats, which included fantastic fourth quarter results that surpassed expectations. Despite persistent supply chain and inflationary headwinds impacting the broader marine industry, our differentiated operating model, vertical integration capabilities and strategic leadership continues to shine through, helping us persevere and be the market leader. For fiscal year 2022, net sales increased nearly 31% to a record $1.2 billion. Gross margin remained strong at 25.5% and adjusted EBITDA grew 30% to a record $247 million, while adjusted EBITDA margin remained relatively consistent at 20.3%. During the fiscal year, we have met unwavering demand by ramping up our production capabilities through our vertically integrated model. Malibu continues to set the tone led by our operational excellence, premium brands, and unmatched manufacturing capabilities across our differentiated portfolio. During the fiscal year, we did a masterful job of optimizing price in a difficult supply-constrained environment compared to the broader marine industry. With many competitors across our segments raising prices into the double digits year over year, we are proud to deliver our industry-leading innovation with minimal price increases comparatively, which will be a competitive advantage. As many boat manufacturers experienced, we did see a slight pause with the delayed spring; however, retail demand bounced back with dealers seeing a quick recovery around Memorial Day that carried through the quarter end. As a result, we have orders extending well into the first half of fiscal year 2023 and they show no signs of slowing. Led by Malibu and Cobalt, we have consistently increased production volume to keep pace with strong retail orders and have already begun to build back inventory in the channel in these segments. At this time of year in a freshwater environment, that is important because buyers want the boat right away to enjoy the last few weeks of the season before cold weather. While Malibu and Cobalt have begun to build back some of our channel inventory, our saltwater brands, which are still seeing a higher than normal number of retail orders, have yet to make the same step forward and channel inventories remain very low. Although marine-wide supply chain issues continue to limit the channel build across our brands and especially in the saltwater brands, we now believe that if the supply chain cooperates, we will see inventories begin to build at a better pace in the second half of fiscal year 2023. As we have stated in the past, we maintain that any real improvement in the supply chain will not begin until the first half of calendar year 2023, and we are in an optimal position to execute as these headwinds improve and customers start coming back into dealerships looking for stock boats. Based on the early June 2022 numbers released last month, Cobalt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s outboard share is now up to 18.1% year to date. In just the last year alone, we have increased our outboard market share by 600 basis points and look to maintain this trajectory in the quarters to come. Whether it be Malibu, Axis, Cobalt, Pursuit or Maverick, no one has a track record of success in designing and bringing new product and innovations to market. For several years, our focus on features has been around functionality, what makes a customer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s experience more convenient, and ergonomics. Our new Malibu stereo system now features amplifiers that are 70% smaller, subwoofer speakers, improved BSB tuning capabilities, and a transom remote which will take the user into the next stage of sound. Turning to Cobalt, building on our R33 series with the stern drive boat release in fiscal year 2022, we have recently announced the R33 outboard version for our coastal customers. In just three weeks at the Cobalt dealer meeting, we will be unveiling our new R35 stern and R35 outboard boats for a first look by our dealers. At Pursuit, during the beginning of our fiscal year in July, we introduced our largest boat ever built at Pursuit with the OS 445. This offshore boat, which features massive living accommodations, first-in-class , and an incredible amount of storage has already amassed orders for the next year and a half despite just now being seen in the wild. As we end another record year, I am proud of the significant progress our team continues to make. Heading into fiscal year \u00e2\u0080\u009923, we are on track to start our channel build and we remain confident in the outlook as demand remains high. As we have stated over the past 18 months, even if there is a downside scenario, our previous experience, best-in-class operations, and battle tested strategic leadership will mitigate these potential headwinds, allowing us to maintain strong margins in the quarters to come. Overall, our teams\u00e2\u0080\u0099 hard work, commitment to excellence and agility in the midst of a challenging supply chain environment has delivered superior results, allowing us to cruise past the competition, deliver more boats to our customers, and maintain our track record of success. As we embark on fiscal year 2023, we believe our future remains exceptionally bright. From unprecedented consumer demand, the introduction of our new model year 2023 products, historically low dealer inventories, our unbeatable culture of operational excellence and vertical integration, we are extremely well positioned to drive substantial growth and profitability, all the while delivering long term value for our shareholders. In the fourth quarter, net sales increased 27.6% to $353.2 million, and unit volume increased 10.3% to 2,596 boats. The increase in net sales was driven primarily by year-over-year price increases, a favorable model mix, and increased unit volumes primarily in our Malibu and Cobalt segments. Malibu and Axis brands represented approximately 56.9% of unit sales or 1,478 boats, Cobalt represented 22.7% or 588 boats, and saltwater fishing represented the remaining 20.4% or 530 boats. Consolidated net sales per unit increased 15.7% to approximately $136,000 primarily driven by year-over-year price increases and a favorable model mix. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter increased 28.3% to $73.9 million, and adjusted EBITDA margin increased 10 basis points to 20.9%. For a reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA and adjusted fully distributed net income per share to GAAP metrics, please see the tables in our earnings release. As Jack mentioned earlier, we delivered another record-setting year in fiscal year 2022, further cementing our position as the most innovative and efficient operators in the industry. We are just beginning to see the benefits of our timely strategic acquisition of Malibu Electronics, which has helped us successfully improve our volume output across Malibu and Cobalt through the back half of the fiscal year. Looking at the full year numbers, net sales increased 31.1% to a record $1.2 billion, and unit volume increased 13.1% to a record 9,255 boats. Consolidated net sales per unit increased 16% to just over $131,000, driven by higher sales of new, more expensive models and optional features and higher year-over-year prices. Net income for the year increased 43% to $153.4 million, and adjusted EBITDA increased 29.7% to a record $246.5 million for the full year. For the year, non-GAAP adjusted fully distributed net income per share increased 31.6% to a record $7.91 per share. As mentioned in prior quarters, we believe that heading into fiscal year 2023, our continued ability to produce more units will build general inventories, setting our dealers up to win the retail battle. Our agility in managing supply chain issues has given us a significant competitive advantage, helping us continue to efficiently produce the best and most innovative products while fortifying our industry-leading fiberglass boat manufacturing capabilities. We are excited to showcase our new model year line highlighting our unmatched innovation, quality and feature-rich boats. Based on our current operating plan, our expectations for fiscal year 2023 are as follows. In terms of cadence, we see higher year-over-year growth in the first half and nearly double the annual rate in the first fiscal quarter. Consolidated adjusted EBITDA margin is expected to be down slightly; however, we believe there will be a modest increase year over year in the first fiscal quarter. In closing, fiscal year 2022 was a massive success as we set numerous records for operational and financial performance. We have proven that no matter the environment, from supply chain disruptions to inflation, we have the teams and capabilities to push the throttle forward and capitalize on continued strong retail markets. Our differentiated best-in-class portfolio continues to perform at the top of the marine industry, and our fiscal year 2023 line-up will push the boundaries as we continue to drive long term value for our customers and shareholders. Your line is now open. I think from the standpoint of the channel inventory, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve always talked in weeks on hand, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s still double digit weeks on hand - that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s low - across the board more so in the saltwater than the freshwater, as we talked about. I think as the year progresses, we will continue to see a better channel inventory build, first of all on Malibu, secondly in Cobalt, so that freshwater segment, and then it will follow in saltwater, but that won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think, begin taking place until the second half of the year. If we look at cumulatively all of our brands, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s easily--you know, when we get within that three to five weeks on hand, I believe easily it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to be the end of fiscal year \u00e2\u0080\u009923 and then fully getting up to speed on channel inventory is going to be at the end of \u00e2\u0080\u009923 or the beginning of \u00e2\u0080\u009924. Your line is now open. From the standpoint--I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m talking a lot to dealers, anybody that I can talk to, Wells Fargo, whoever it may be, and this is a great time of year for me because we have four dealer meetings in a period of three months, so I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m able to communicate directly one-on-one with the dealers and get an understanding of what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s happening. I think the last year\u00e2\u0080\u0099s brand new T250 model is a great example of that - the largest Axis ever built, it outperformed expectations, so they continue to buy the larger boats, they continue to option up boats and buy every conceivable feature that would make sense for a given customer, and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s across all of our brands. If you look at our annual income across the board of our demographic, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s very, very high, the net worth is very, very high, and when you combine that with the fact that over the last three years, $43 trillion of additional wealth has been created, and I use the term resilient, I think it makes our consumer very resilient. Now moving to the second plane, what we are seeing is that across the marine industry, those smaller units, call it 22-foot and under, are being impacted. Last year, as an example, for the full year calendar 2021, that 22-foot and under market was down 13.8%, whereas the rest of the industry was pretty well flat versus 2020, which we know was a humongous year. Excellent, and then just as a follow-up, I guess, given the cadence of acquisitions you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve had historically, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m curious where you guys are seeing valuations in the boat space, whether there could be opportunities or if it seems like maybe interest is too high across the board, where valuations are running a little bit heated. Since the first of the year, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not been a lot of assets come to market. I will say that what we have seen have not been necessarily assets that we would want to pursue and they have been at higher multiples, but again if we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re entering any type of softening phase, I think that more assets will come to market, number one; and number two, I think it will be not as frothy and people will be more realistic in their expectations. Your line is now open. I would say it still in the saltwater remains in that 80% to 90% range, at a minimum, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re just not creating any channel inventory, whereas we talked in terms of historical trends and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s normally in that 50% level for the freshwater market. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s still elevated a little bit but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s coming back more toward a normal, maybe 60% or so, but that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just really a guess on my part, Gerrick. We obviously, Gerrick, are modeling that out and looking at different scenarios, especially in the environment that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re in today where there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a channel inventory opportunity. Your line is now open. First, EBITDA margin is expected to be down this year, but you said it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to be up in the first quarter. The reality is our plan calls for increased mix in saltwater and businesses that are a little less mature than Malibu, and so on a mix adjusted basis or a mix neutral basis, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re actually seeing margin expansion, and so that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s kind of the aggregate view of what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going on, on margin for the year. In terms of the cadence, if you look at the timing of when that mix change is impacting the P&L, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s more in the second half of the year, and so you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re seeing better performance in the first half. I ask that only because if I look at your website, it says no price increases on model year \u00e2\u0080\u009823s, so maybe if you could break that number down for us and maybe your thinking on why no price increases. There are embedded as prices have risen throughout the fiscal year \u00e2\u0080\u009922, there is--you know, we took into account there is absolutely a natural uplift that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to be happening relative to that, so if you go back to the mid-year and how we modified prices, and so not all boats in the year were at the price that we ended the year at, and so there is a modest uplift that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s associated with that. The other thing I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll point out, Joe, a couple things--and you cut out a little bit, but a couple things I do want to point out is you were looking at the website relating to Malibu, so that is specific to the Malibu and Axis products and not necessarily the other brands. The other thing is that is the beginning of the year from a price increase standpoint, so that does not say, you know, we want to do that. We think that gives us a competitive advantage, but that doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t say we will not re-evaluate that at the beginning of the calendar year. Your line is now open. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a little bit more unclear when you get to companies that are not public, but generally we believe that we are at the--you know, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll put in the framework of we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re at the lower end of the spectrum, regardless of whether it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s public or private. Malibu Boats continues its dynastic run, delivering another great quarter and outstanding year. Our daily backlog remains exceptionally strong, supported by the unprecedented consumer appetite for larger, feature-rich boats, and it will drive ASP growth across the board. From Malibu and Axis to Cobalt, to Pursuit, to the Maverick brands, we are in a unique and favorable position with our suite of premium brands and boats and our model year 2023 line-up is sure to make waves among consumers. Lastly, channel inventory remains at historical lows, providing an incredible opportunity for our continued success for the next two to three years as the supply chain normalizes. As always, I would like to thank you for your unrelenting support, and I look forward to our continued victories together as we strive to make fiscal year 2023 the best year yet for Malibu."
