    "content": "   Operator: Good morning, and welcome to Malibu Boats Conference Call to discuss First Quarter Fiscal Year 2023 Results. Malibu Boats kicked-off fiscal year 2023 with a splash, as our continued momentum was supported by ongoing demand strength in both our fresh and saltwater businesses. In particular, this bodes well for our first full year for the Axis T25, which was introduced last year and is the largest axis ever built, as well as the Malibu 26 LSV, which is the largest Malibu ever built, Cobalt's R33 sterndrive and outboard and R35 sterndrive and outboard, as well as the new OS 445 per pursuit, which is the largest pursuit boat ever built. Said another way, Malibu remains a premier course in the marine industry, as well as the entire leisure space, led by our premium suite of award-winning brands, which we believe will continue to drive growth as we navigate through fiscal year 2023 and beyond. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open."
