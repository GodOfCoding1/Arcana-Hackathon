    "content": "   Operator: Good morning, and welcome to the Malibu Boats Conference Call to discuss Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2023 Results. For the second fiscal quarter, we posted strong net sales of $339 million, increasing nearly 28% over the prior year, with adjusted EBITDA growing approximately 20% to $58 million and net income growing 18% to $36 million. With respect to discounting Gerrick, it really is not a meaningful factor incrementally from a boat show or year-end sales event perspective, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u0093 you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not seeing an incremental discount drag versus what we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen historically. The other thing I would add to that is that if you look at the details of those monthly numbers that you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re talking about, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re talking about comps that are still really, really high, if you look at them in a historical context, when you elongate the period that you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re looking at that and you look at the first half of the fiscal year performance, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s in line with the entirety of the market."
