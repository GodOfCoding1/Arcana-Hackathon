Our brand resonance across consumers in the Northeast is significant, and our penetration across existing medical retailers is strong in those markets, including 100% penetration across retailers in New Jersey and over 90% of existing dispensaries in New York on our platform at the end of Q3. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve built a robust platform for retailers and brands with some amazing products and key technological integrations, and now we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re focused on penetrating local markets, adding retailers on platform and connecting them with high-value traffic. We feel like that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the right strategy, and from what we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen as we continue to add retailers onto the platform at prices that make sense for them, and allow them to really understand the value that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re bringing."
