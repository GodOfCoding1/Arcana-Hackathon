    "content": " Revenue for the second quarter of 2022 was $1.02 billion, an increase of $304 million or 43% compared to last year. So I think the best guidance we can give to people is that same range, 17% to 18% -- and on these revenues, obviously, that kicks out a pretty good result. I mean, how do you -- you're booking $1 billion plus a quarter here, it sounds like your markets are still really strong."
