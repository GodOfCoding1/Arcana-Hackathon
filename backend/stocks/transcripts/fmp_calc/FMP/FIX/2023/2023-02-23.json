    "content": " So revenue for the fourth quarter of 2022 was $1.1 billion, an increase of $261 million or 30% compared to last year. Our full year Mechanical Services segment revenue increased $636 million or 25%, and our Electrical Services segment increased by 81% to $431 million. Same-store revenue increased by 22% or $669 million in 2022, a broad-based increase driven by strong ongoing market conditions. Quarterly gross profit percentage in our Mechanical segment increased to 19.1%, while margins in the Electrical segment rose significantly to 18.2% this year from 14.8% in 2021. For the full year 2022, gross profit increased by $178 million, and our gross profit margin was 17.9% in 2022 as compared to 18.3% in 2021. Our average interest rate on our credit facility was 5.7% as of December 31, 2022, and we expect that with higher rates, our interest expense will increase in 2023 compared to 2022, especially early this coming year when comparable periods a year ago had much lower rates. After considering all of the factors above, net income for the fourth quarter of 2022 increased by over 40% to $55 million or $1.54 per share. Our full year 2022 EBITDA has increased by 32% compared to the prior year, and it was $338 million. Year-over-year, our same-store backlog increased by $1.7 billion or 75%, a broadly based increase with strong bookings in both our electrical and mechanical construction businesses.
