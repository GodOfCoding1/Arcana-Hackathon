    "content": " Given our expectations regarding the durability and growth potential of these products, along with our continued focus on adding new products through corporate development, we believe we are well-positioned to achieve our Vision 2025 goal of $5 billion in revenue. Our 2023 guidance for Neuroscience of $2.675 billion to $2.825 billion encompasses our growth expectations for both Xywav and Epidiolex, and the continued decline in Xyrem due to strong Xywav adoption, authorized generics of Xyrem, and potential competition from an additional high-sodium, branded oxybate. Your line is open. And we're feeling that we're going to continue to expect in 2023 continued strong uptake of Xywav in both narcolepsy and IH with continuing transition of narcolepsy patients from high-sodium oxybate, either that being Xyrem or later on from the AG over to Xywav based on its differentiation as the only lower-sodium oxybate product. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open."
