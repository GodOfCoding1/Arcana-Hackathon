    "content": " On the call today are Bruce Cozadd, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Renee Gala, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Dan Swisher, President; and Rob Iannone, Executive Vice President, Global Head of R&D; Kim Sablich, Executive Vice President and General Manager, North America; and Phil Jochelson, Neuroscience Therapeutic Head, will join the team for Q&A. On Slide 2, I'll remind you that today's webcast includes forward-looking statements, such as those related to our future financial and operating results, including expectations related to Vision 2025 and our guidance for 2022, growth potential and anticipated development and commercialization milestones and goals, which involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual events, performance and results to differ materially from those contained in these forward-looking statements. We encourage you to review the statements contained in today's press release, in our slide deck and in our latest SEC disclosure documents, which identify certain factors that may cause the company's actual events, performance and results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements made on today's webcast. Since the beginning of the year, we've demonstrated considerable progress across commercial, R&D and corporate development, while delivering solid year-over-year, top and bottom line growth in the first quarter. On the commercial front, we're very encouraged by the positive direction of the launch of Xywav in idiopathic hypersomnia or IH underscored by the growing number of patients on therapy, the effectiveness of ongoing outreach to educate prescribers and patients about the benefits of Xywav and the high level of engagement and receptivity in the market. Moving to neuroscience, data from the first of three ongoing Phase 3 clinical trials of nabiximols in multiple sclerosis related spasticity is expected this quarter as is the initiation of our Phase 3 trial of Epidiolex in epilepsy with myoclonic-atonic seizures or EMAS. Moving to Slide 6, in January, we announced Vision 2025, which includes three components central to driving sustainable growth and enhanced value, commercial, pipeline and operational excellence. Collectively, our continued execution in the first quarter provides additional evidence of our ability to achieve Vision 2025. I'll now turn the call over to Dan for an overview of our first quarter commercial performance, after which Rob will share an update on progress of our R&D programs. Starting with neuroscience, the divestiture of Sunosi allows our highly experienced commercial team to further sharpen its focus on our key neuroscience products, Xywav and Epidiolex. We continue to build momentum in our oxybate franchise as highlighted on Slide 8, in addition to market leading adoption of Xywav in narcolepsy, we are with the progress of the commercial launch of Xywav in IH. Average active oxybate patients increased to approximately 16,650 in the first quarter and approximate 6% increase compared to the same period last year. With Xywav, we have meaningfully advanced patient care with a lower sodium oxybate product and continue to see enthusiasm for adoption. In narcolepsy, our effort center around educating physicians and patients about the lifelong burden of high sodium intake in this patient population who live with an increased risk of cardiovascular comorbidities. In the first quarter, we continued to drive adoption in narcolepsy and importantly, we see opportunities for additional growth in narcolepsy. We exited the first quarter with approximately 7,050 narcolepsy patients taking Xywav. For Xywav in IH, we're encouraged by the continued launch momentum as well as feedback from prescribers and the IH community. Exiting the first quarter, there were approximately 750 IH patients taking Xywav. We're particularly pleased with this initial adoption, given that we expect new patients starts in IH to more closely track the trajectory of a rare disease launch, where there have been previously no approved therapies. As a reminder in the fourth quarter of last year, Epidiolex net product sales benefited from a temporary increase in specialty pharmacy inventory levels, which increased fourth quarter net sales by approximately $18 million. The majority of this reversed in first quarter 2022, reducing first quarter\u2019s revenues. Excluding this impact, we saw double digit percentage revenue growth in the first quarter with continued growth and underlying demand, despite challenges posed by the Omicron variant. We have been successfully adding new prescribers, growing Epidiolex\u2019s active prescriber base. As we have previously highlighted, we expect that as newer prescribers gain experience with Epidiolex and see its clinical utility, they will more broadly adopt Epidiolex as a cornerstone of therapy for their treatment resistant epilepsy patients. During the first quarter, we launched Epidiolex in Ireland and expect to launch in France later this year, pending final pricing and reimbursement discussions at which point Epidiolex would be launched and reimbursed in all five major European markets. We continue to invest in additional real world evidence and observational studies, as well as perspective clinical trials in second line small cell lung cancer and see additional opportunities to continue to grow market share. We believe these data will add to the body of evidence around Zepzelca\u2019s positive benefit risk profile for second line small cell lung cancer patients, and potentially drive increased adoption moving forward. Beyond second line therapy, we believe our robust development plan, which Rob will cover in more depth has the potential to identify additional patients who can benefit from this therapy, providing the opportunity for accelerated and meaningful growth. As a reminder, fourth quarter 2021 net product sales included an initial buildup of inventory, which is typical for products early in launch and inventory levels began to normalize through 1Q 2022. Feedback from customers remains positive and prescribers have indicated they are now returning to best clinic practice with respect to moving to non-E. coli-derived asparaginase because of the product profile, reliable supply of Rylaze and suite of support services that we provide. Looking ahead, we\u2019re excited to evolve our launch messaging based on the potential label update to intramuscular dosing on our Monday, Wednesday, Friday schedule and IV administration, which Rob will also cover in more detail. Slide 13 provides an overview of our R&D pipeline, and I\u2019m excited about the recent addition of two promising early stage molecules. This afternoon, we announced that we have licensed rights from Sumitomo Pharma to DSP-0187, a potent highly selective oral orexin-2 receptor agonist with potential application for the treatment of narcolepsy, idiopathic hypersomnia and other sleep disorders. Our concerted effort to expand our pipeline and capabilities is now beginning to bear fruit, following multiple clinical trial initiations in 2021, we are primed for a number of exciting program milestones in 2022 and multiple IND submissions through 2023. On Slide 14, we\u2019ve detailed the mid and late stage clinical programs in our pipeline. Starting with programs emerging from the GW cannabinoid platform, we are on track to begin a Phase 3 trial for Epidiolex in epilepsy with myoclonic-atonic seizures later this quarter. And if results from this first trial are supportive, there is the potential for a regulatory submission in the U.S. later this year. The enrollment for both trials is ongoing and we remain on track to top line data from these trials in the first half of 2024 and late 2023, respectively. Three separate trials were initiated in 2021, a Phase 3 trial supported by Jazz and our partner Roche to evaluate Zepzelca in combination with TECENTRIQ in first line extensive stage small cell lung cancer. In the first quarter of this year, we also initiated our Phase 2 basket trial called EMERGE-201. This is a multicenter open label trial designed to assess the safety and efficacy of Zepzelca as monotherapy in three cohorts of patients with solid tumors, advanced urothelial carcinoma, large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma, the lung and homologous recombination deficient tumors. In January, we submitted an sBLA for Rylaze to update our label to an intramuscular Monday, Wednesday, Friday dosing schedule with patients receiving 25 milligrams per meter squared on Monday and Wednesday and 50 milligrams per meter squared on Friday. This schedule, which is more in line with current clinical practice to avoid weekend dosing allows patients to maintain a clinically meaningful level of serum asparaginase activity through the entire duration of treatment. And I\u2019m pleased to announce that we recently completed a separate sBLA to support intravenous administration, which will also be reviewed under RTOR. First quarter total revenue of $814 million, represent growth of 34% compared to the same quarter in 2021. This included neuroscience and oncology revenues of $612 million and $197 million respectively, both delivering double digit growth compared to the same period in 2021. As we continue to drive operational efficiency and grow our recently launched products, first quarter adjusted SG&A expenses were 32% of total revenue, an approximate six percentage point improvement compared to first quarter 2021. Our continued focus on both the top and bottom line drove first quarter adjusted net income of $262 million, a 14% increase compared to the same period in 2021. Adjusted EPS was $3.73 in the first quarter, slightly below the same period last year, and reflecting the increased share count related to the accounting change for convertible debt. And without this change, adjusted EPS growth would\u2019ve been 7% compared to the same period last year. We\u2019re pleased to deliver strong first quarter results despite payer churn, seasonality, and the impact of Omicron. We\u2019ve increased total revenue guidance to $3.5 billion to $3.7 billion driven by neuroscience revenues, which were increasing to $2.6 billion to $2.8 billion or $40 million at the midpoint. This increase reflects our confidence in both Epidiolex and Xywav adoption, the increased focus and resources available to support those products, divestment of Sunosi, continued Xyrem strength and updates to our assumptions regarding Xyrem competitive entry, which have the dual effect of strengthening Xyrem revenues and pushing out our assumptions on the entry timing of Xyrem authorized generics to late 2022 or possibly even January 2023. With the divestment of Sunosi and our increased revenue guidance, we expect our full year 2022 revenues from newly launched or acquired products to be between 60% and 65% representing substantial diversification of our business since 2020 and importantly, a strong foundation for growth. Turning to the bottom line, we are raising our adjusted net income guidance by $50 million to a range of $1.18 billion to $1.25 billion. In less than a year from closing the GW acquisition, we have reduced our non-GAAP net leverage ratio by a full churn to approximately 3.9 times at the end of the first quarter, which will enable us to remain opportunistic with respect to corporate development and other strategic investments in our business. I\u2019m also excited by the potential of the compounds we\u2019ve licensed from Sumitomo, and Werewolf both are promising and differentiated compounds, targeting significant unmet patient needs in areas where we can leverage our expertise and internal R&D engine to drive their development. As we look at additional pipeline and commercial deals, primarily in our core therapeutic areas, we will remain focused on opportunities where we believe we can provide unique insights, commercialize efficiently, and bring significant value to patients. With our strategic investments, long live product portfolio, and continued commitment to operational excellence, we believe we are well positioned to achieve our vision 2025 and deliver further diversification, sustainable growth and enhanced value to patients and shareholders. Our achievements in the first quarter of 2022, we\u2019re a continuation of the strong momentum we created last year. In commercial, we are focused on execution across our neuroscience and oncology portfolios, including maintaining the strong start of our Xywav and IH  and Rylaze launches, as well as realizing the blockbuster potential of Epidiolex and continuing to drive adoption of Xywav in narcolepsy. We\u2019re pleased with the way we\u2019ve leveraged our experience and expertise to identify and perform against the drivers outlined in vision 2025, which in our view, come down into having the right foundation, the right assets and the right opportunities for execution, raising our top and bottom line guidance for the year, underscores our confidence across the business and our strategy. Your line is open. Just wondering as we think about the Zywave and IH really nice penetration, and I know Dan gave some perspective of this could look like a standard rare disease launch. And with that, just wondering if where you believe this could peak obviously Xyrem using maybe narcolepsy and Xyrem\u2019s penetration into narcolepsy as a comparator. So let me split it up a little bit and maybe comment first on peak expectations, there\u2019s never been a drug approved to treat this serious disorder idiopathic hypersomnia. And in a second, you\u2019ll hear from Kim a little bit how that early launch is going and what we\u2019re hearing from our customers and patients. Our initial launch focus is a little more narrow than all potential diagnosed patients with IH, but there\u2019s certainly that potential that this could be a quite significant opportunity. Maybe Dan could talk a little bit about why he used the language, he did in describing how this launch might be different from our narcolepsy\u2019s Xywav launch. Yes So in IH, unlike narcolepsy, there\u2019s not a pool of experienced oxybate patients. So in narcolepsy, we had the data and we are able to very rapidly bring experienced oxybate Xyrem patients over to Xywav. In IH, it\u2019s more of a first FDA-approved therapy. We know that there\u2019s 37,000 diagnosed patients actively seeking treatment but it\u2019s sort of bringing them into the office making them aware of the medicine getting them enrolled in the REMS and bringing them on patient by patient and titrating up. The good news and you\u2019ll hear from Kim is that in real world, the experience has been very positive for the patients who\u2019ve adopted therapy. And really what we\u2019ve been hearing the last quarter is very consistent with what we\u2019ve been hearing since November and that our healthcare providers are very pleased with the profile of the medicine, excited to have a treatment option with positive and compelling clinical trial results that ultimately addresses not just one or two of symptoms of the condition, but addresses the full condition itself. And then lastly, the initial coverage that we\u2019ve had from payers on this launch has ultimately allowed prescribers to prescribe with confidence. So overall our team is remaining focused on executing our launch strategy, building on the momentum that we have and executing both a branded effort as well as continuing to help educate our customers around some important aspects of idiopathic hypersomnia and diagnosing it and doing patient identification. Your line is open. I wanted to ask about the orexin agent, in licenced, what attracted you to this molecule in particular and how confident are you that you\u2019ll be able to avoid the side effects that we\u2019re seen with Takeda\u2019s product, was that issue they had on target or off target. Late breaking news, obviously coming out just a few minutes before our press release, but maybe I can ask Rob to weigh in a little bit on what excites us about this particular program, but also address your question about how it might or might not relate to what we\u2019ve seen from another agent. That\u2019s also highly potent and given the preclinical and clinical validation around this target we think it\u2019s a very promising mechanism and has the potential to really be complementary to oxybate as a treatment for narcolepsy, but also beyond into idiopathic hypersomnia and obvious sleep disorders. Your line is open. Can you speak to the impact like dose titration has on revenue recognition in the early period, like 1Q where oxybate or Xywav sales were a little bit light versus is consensus, but yet you\u2019re raising guidance. There was a piece of this that was very specific to IH, but maybe I\u2019ll come to Renee in a second for just talking about what we typically see in the first quarter for our oxybate business, be at Xywav for narcolepsy, Xywav for IH or Xyrem. But on your particular question about IH, it is true that patients new to therapy which is generally the case for all IH patients and not generally the case for most narcolepsy cases where they can transfer over dose for dose. But I think the dynamic you\u2019re seeing in our results is probably more attributed to something else and Renee, maybe I can ask you to weigh in on that. And if you look at the last several years, you do see a decline from Q4 to Q1 in terms of the oxybate revenues. But coming back to the guidance more broadly in terms of raising by $40 million at the top line, which of course was driven by neuroscience, there are a number of factors that do go into it as I\u2019d mentioned on the call, we have Xywav and Epidiolex adoption. We do with the Sunosi divestment have an increased focus in terms of shared management teams and marketing teams that now will be focused squarely on Epidiolex and Xywav, really looking to maximize the potential. Your line is open. So as we saw on the results, we saw 6% revenue growth in the first quarter compared to first quarter 2021 last year. And I think you recall back in 4Q, we did talk about the fact that Epidiolex net product sales benefited from a temporary increase in specialty pharma inventory levels of about $18 million. And if we exclude this impact, we saw double digit revenue growth of about that will basically double digit revenue growth in the first quarter plus continued growth and underlying demand, despite, the challenges that were certainly out there posed by the Omicron surge in the early part of the quarter. So, all of this underlies that is that we\u2019re continuing to see positive trends in terms of adding new prescribers as well as we see current prescribers broadening their use and using it earlier in the treatment regimen. And as we bring those new prescribers on board, we just feel like they\u2019re going to follow suit with the existing prescribers in terms of getting more experience, seeing the clinical utility in the product and starting to adopt it more broadly and ultimately make it a cornerstone of therapy. And I\u2019ll just leave you also with the notion that we\u2019re very pleased right now with the increases in personal engagement that we achieved in March and April, as we kind of came out of this Omicron surge and really feel like we\u2019re building some of those nice moments in here. And outside the U.S., we\u2019re really pleased with the progress we\u2019ve been making, significant progress in Europe. We\u2019ve launched in 13, importantly, because of the value of the product and the data we\u2019ve got, we\u2019ve been able to establish pricing at greater than 70% of the U.S. whack. Your line is open. So it is the leader out there and a fair amount of the share has come from topotecan, while we don\u2019t provide product level guidance, we are continuing to see opportunities for growth with Zepzelca by displacing just what you alluded to further displacing topotecan as well as immuno-oncology products that are being used as monotherapy. But we also see quite a bit of potential among patients that are, today being rechallenged with platinum-based chemotherapies or receiving other chemotherapy regimens. So, we\u2019re continuing to see demand for Zepzelca and are progressing as you heard, Rob talk about a robust clinical development program that we feel is going to make the products proposition even stronger and provide even more rationale for expanding its use in the second-line setting. Yes, I'd love to add to that color there, just to say that I think from a medical perspective as physicians gain experience with Zepzelca in the second-line, they're going to find that it's a relatively easy drug to give and very well tolerated, relative to re-challenging for example, with a platinum doublet, which can only be given for a limited time period. And as you know, we have an ongoing first-line trial where will be compared to placebo\u2019s add-on therapy during maintenance for extensive states, small cell lung cancer. And so it's a real opportunity to extend their progression-free survival and hopefully ultimately overall survival, giving patients a longer duration of therapy then if they were to wait for second-line. Your line is open. So as we think about the Sunosi transaction, as we said, we're really focused on ensuring that we have the ability to focus on our highest strategic priorities. Coming into 2022 and looking at our business holistically, we see other priorities that relate to products that we've either launched or acquired since we launched Sunosi. So as we look at our broader portfolio and think about what has transpired since getting approval and launching Sanofi, we had approval and launch of Xywav in both narcolepsy and IH, we have launched Zepzelca. So we'll continue to look at the portfolio, ensure that we're optimizing both the commercial portfolio, where we are expanding geographically and then importantly, continuing to lean into business development, both for expanding and growing our pipeline, but as well as expanding and diversifying our revenues, as we've stated with Vision 2025. Your line is open. I would think that Jazz with the calling points that you have and this fitting your narcolepsy and sleep focus, you would've been in the best position to extract value from this asset. Yes, Balaji, maybe I'll take those in opposite order and just say on Sunosi, the call point was a little bit different as we moved out of that core narcolepsy space that we've been so active in for so long into EDS in obstructive sleep apnea, which required a much broader set of physicians and physicians who obviously both weren't familiar with oxybate and \u2013 or I'm sorry, we're not familiar with Sunosi, but also didn't in all cases have drug therapy as part of their standardized approach to optimizing their OSA patients. And as Renee said, when we looked at our portfolio after everything that's happened with, all of our product launches over 2020 and 2021 and the acquisition of GW, we essentially had our smallest near-term opportunity product with the largest sales force. And while we could have continued down that road, we had other places in our business, including our ongoing launches, some exciting pipeline programs in addition to some exciting corp dev opportunities. So these are current prescribers, those that have gotten some experience early on first couple years, that Epidiolex, really telling us that while they were primarily using it as a fourth line, let's say agent, they've had good results with it, and they're starting to use it third-line, second-line and so forth. They're going to go through a very similar experience, having their positive first experience with those patients in later lines of use and then moving towards \u2013 forward to earlier lines of use. Your line is open. I was just wondering, could you break down the levers that are driving the picked up revenue guidance through the end of the year, just like maybe specifically go through what gives you confidence that you can raise \u2013 that you were able to raise guidance. So as we've mentioned previously, the $40 million raise at the top line was driven by neuroscience, truly reflects our continued confidence in both Epidiolex and Xywav adoption, but also as we'd mentioned that with the divestment of Sunosi having increased focus and resources available to get then behind those two product launches. And while that shifts out, it does both strengthen Xyrem revenues, but also has the impact of pushing our assumptions around the Xyrem AG entry to late 2022 or as I'd mentioned on the call \u2013 on the prepared remarks, even potentially January, 2023. And going back to our commitment to delivering more to the bottom line to operational excellence, this has in turn the impact of expanding our projected adjusted operating margin to 46% at the midpoint for the year of 2022. Your line is open. Kim, you want to talk about growth in Xywav specifically on the narcolepsy side, both what we saw on the first quarter, but how to think about that going forward. So in the first quarter, we saw some nice growth there in narcolepsy for Xywav specifically, we had an increase from 6,650 patients in the fourth quarter to 7,050 patients in the second quarter. So overall, pleased with that launch, now \u2013 that growth now we would expect with any launch the uptake curve to come down and flatten a bit over time, particularly as we were impacted by, as we mentioned Omicron in January and February. Maybe I'll just broaden the answer a little bit to say, in the near-term, we'll have a business unit that's completely focused on Xywav, which we obviously view as a huge opportunity, both in narcolepsy and idiopathic hypersomnia, but I also just want to go back to Vision 2025 and point out that we view this as a global and durable franchise, even in the face of competition. And so our target that $2 billion in revenues, even as we get out to 2025 would be coming from the oxybate franchise, I think tells you where we see continued opportunity over time. Your line is open. In terms of the ramp for Xywav in IH, 250 patients last quarter and 750 this quarter. Kim, I\u2019ll hand it over to you to take the Xywav IH related questions. We really see right now that the opportunity for IH is concentrated in the hands of really more of the sleep specialists which have multiple different kind of specialties behind them, but ultimately are concentrated in focusing on treating patients with sleep conditions and really in terms of sequencing in growth. We are focused, I think as we've said several times today at launch on those 37,000 patients that we can see out there and claim data not only have a diagnosis for idiopathic hypersomnia, but also have been actively engaging very recently in the healthcare system. So while today, we're really focused on going after those patients who have this diagnosis and who are largely seeing a sleep specialist, not a primary care physician. We will, at one point in time be able to sequence from there and really sequence less from a specialty standpoint, but more from a patient standpoint to those patients, probably that are beyond that 37,000 that perhaps get a more solid diagnosis as a result of us or start reengaging with the healthcare system as a result of their finally being a product out there that is clinically proven and approved by the FDA for the condition of idiopathic hypersomnia. Your line is open. Number two is, are you looking at other sleep disorders to target for further Xywav development or even a next-gen or once-nightly oxybate product. David, maybe I\u2019ll take the first part of that specific to oxybate and Rob, have you weigh in a little bit on the orexin side. At the moment, you know that we made a decision many years ago, that the most important thing we could do for narcolepsy patients getting oxybate was substantially reduce the sodium burden by 1 gram to 1.5 gram per night, a 92% reduction that FDA has found provides a clinically superior product because it\u2019s safer and will result in fewer cardiovascular comorbidities for these patients. And flexibility in timing of your own life, if you take a dose a little bit later at night, then you\u2019re used to \u2013 that has implications for when you can get up and safely operate an automobile in the morning, get to an early morning meeting. Even if patients have access to branded Xyrem, IRU generic Xyrem, Xywav potential once a night products, we believe that Xywav is actually going to be the preferred product across that patient population. And certainly the orexin agonist we\u2019re developing has the potential beyond narcolepsy to other sleep disorders, including idiopathic hypersomnia or any other disorder that cause this daytime somnolence. Your line is open. And so our strategy in the U.S. is really to leverage all of those data and bridge to a U.S. submission, which the FDA has said should include additional data using endpoints other than the numeric rating scale that we \u2013 that was the primary endpoint for European submissions and approvals. Your line is open. Well, we\u2019re excited Oren to be in a position where we\u2019ve got Xywav being rolled out, I would still say, still fairly early in narcolepsy and now brand new in idiopathic hypersomnia. And while you pointed out correctly, the sort of rate of narcolepsy adds, of course, we added 900 patients to Xywav across the two indications in the first quarter, which is really terrific. And in our promotional efforts, we definitely want to balance continuing to make progress in narcolepsy, where we think all patients can benefit from the sodium reduction relative to Xyrem where we\u2019re seeing new patients to oxybate predominantly start directly on Xywav, rather than going through Xyrem. So Kim, maybe you could just close this answer by talking a little bit about how you do think about allocating the sales force across those areas and how we continue to make progress in the narcolepsy ramp. So in terms of making progress, it\u2019s really staying the course on our strategy that we think is really resonating with customers about the benefits of reduced sodium for patients, and the fact that the FDA has recognized Xywav\u2019s clinical superiority to that of Xyrem. But also I\u2019d say that the strategic divestiture of Sanofi that we were talking about earlier does enable us to sharpen our focus and our highest strategic priorities, specifically in sleep, it allows our sleep team to be very laser focused on achieving the full potential of Xywav, both in narcolepsy and in IAH. So, we feel fortunate to have both opportunities and really right now it\u2019s about staying the course and executing on both very strongly. Your line is open. So Greg, the quick answer to that is that relationship ended when we stopped selling ERWINAZE and I wouldn\u2019t comment on any possibilities for the two companies working together going forward. But Dan, maybe I could ask you to comment generally how we think about Rylaze being on the market today in the U.S. and where we\u2019re going. I mean, we\u2019re really excited with the Rylaze launch and it\u2019s the one and only, and reliable \u2013 reliably supplied, we\u2019re seeing the change in the medical practice back to ensuring that any patient who shows a sign of hypersensitivity or reaction to an E. coli-based can move to Rylaze. And I\u2019d say also there\u2019s a suite of services, plus a field of medical team that knows that customer extremely well. Outside the U.S., we\u2019re on track for a midyear filing. And we anticipate a product launch as soon as 2023, and look forward to bringing that same optimized product, which is in an easy vial already reconstituted, it\u2019s got a higher concentration than ERWINAZE into those markets as well, where ERWINAZE is available. Let me just close by saying, we\u2019ve got numerous opportunities across our commercial portfolio, our pipeline and our operations to continue to drive a growth and value and achieve operational excellence. And when I look at how we\u2019ve successfully integrated the two organizations, something that sometimes trips people up in acquisitions and think about how well we did that during a pandemic. What we\u2019re seeing in terms of ongoing combined performance, including being efficient with our spend and importantly de-leveraging as quickly as we have in that 12 month period, it couldn\u2019t be more pleased. I\u2019d like to close the call by recognizing our Jazz colleagues for their tenacity, their dedication and their creativity, which have led to us delivering new therapeutic options to patients. We look forward to updating you on our progress this year, as we now move toward our raised top line guidance, our raised bottom line guidance, our improved guided midpoint margin. Again, we\u2019re really excited about the rest of this year and importantly, how that continues to position us well toward achieving Vision 2025."
