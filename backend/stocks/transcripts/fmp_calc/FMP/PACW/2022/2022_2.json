    "content": " As Bill mentioned, we booked a provision for credit losses of $11.5 million in the second quarter, $10 million related to loans and $1.5 million related to our held-to-maturity investment portfolio which I'll talk about in a few minutes. As we look into the second half of the year, we talked about the slower loan growth that we anticipate but with the deposit outlook, I expect we'll have some further increases in wholesale deposits during the quarter looking ahead. But to Matt's point, I mean I do think as opposed to Q1, there's a little bit more sensitivity, obviously around yields, we saw a larger movement towards PWAM and example Bart spelled it out, $500 million in the quarter. And I'll say lender finances kind of cut from same cloth in the sense that there's still a tremendous amount of dry powder out there $780 billion in the private equity landscape in the U.S. alone, and they're all looking for to deploy that capital."
