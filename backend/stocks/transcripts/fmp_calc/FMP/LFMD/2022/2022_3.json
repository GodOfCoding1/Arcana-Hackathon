    "content": " This represented an 86% improvement versus even the prior quarter sequentially, when our adjusted EBITDA loss totaled $6.9 million and is a testament to the tremendous focus we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve placed on optimizing our customer acquisition and retention investment, while pairing back areas that produce growth but not long-term profitability. During the third quarter, WorkSimpli not only grew revenue 57% year-over-year but also finished with over $1 million of EBITDA in the quarter, which is expected to exponentially grow in the quarters and years to come."
