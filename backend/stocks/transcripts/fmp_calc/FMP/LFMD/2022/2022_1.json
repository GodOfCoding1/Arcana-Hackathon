    "content": " I believe that the combination of growing strength in our core business, coupled with strategic enhancements and new lines of business this quarter positions LifeMD to achieve record results this year, including adjusted EBITDA profitability by year-end. In conjunction with this, we are revising our full year revenue guidance to be between $132 million and $138 million but without any impact to our bottom line guidance in order to reflect short-term revenue impact from the first quarter, while we remain laser focused on margin expansion, unit economics and growing profitability. Revenue in the first quarter totaled the record $29 million, up 60% as compared to the same quarter a year ago. Operating expenses for the first quarter totaled $36.9 million, an increase of $10 million versus the year ago period. Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure which excludes noncash stock-based compensation, depreciation and amortization expenses, financing transaction expenses, inventory adjustments preferred stock dividends, nonrecurring charges and interest expenses totaled a loss of $7.6 million in the first quarter of 2022. Cash flow of $25.1 million as of March 31, 2022 and included the impact of $7 million of onetime cash outflows related to the two acquisitions we completed in the first quarter plus related working capital. But as we\u2019ve stated early on when we did the acquisition for the year, we expect Cleared to be in the range of about $3 million to $4 million of revenue for the year, EBITDA-neutral to slightly accretive and then begin to see that jump up pretty significantly next year with the business getting to $10 million plus."
