    "content": " But as you look at our pie chart that we have in Slide 7 of the deck, the breakdown there as you go deeper into the pipeline, especially in preclinical as well as discovery, we're beginning to see the platform used across therapy areas, as one might expect, things like CNS diseases, inflammation, women's health, infectious diseases and other areas. While it's a small percentage of active programs today, it's an area that is a lot of interest, a lot of inbound interest as our BD team is talking to new potential partners, given the fact that those cow-inspired antibody structural features have the potential to open up new approaches to antibody-based therapies that many partners say they've not been able to access before. And it's the kind of innovation that I think attracts partners to us, because they realize the impact that, that can have, especially in areas like CNS diseases, or other infectious diseases or emergency settings or variety of targets that having that structural characteristic built into a humanized chicken host creates some pretty substantial and meaningful opportunities downstream, especially well matched with our capabilities around ion channels and transporters, as well, because ion channels and transporters are targets where that technology could be even more meaningful."
