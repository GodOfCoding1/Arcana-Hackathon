    "content": " We're really proud of the fact that we've been able to continue improving through our operational efficiency, our learning about how to treat these -- this rock in terms of completion and through larger drilling pads, infilled child locations and a higher percentage of wells in our Signal Peak area, which we continue to be very excited about. The first slide I want to talk about is on Page 4 of the deck and this is similar to our last slide that we talked about in our third quarter, very similar, but I think the important thing is that our production averaged 37,300 barrels a day, which is a 42% increase over the third quarter, a 150% increase compared to last year's fourth quarter. I'm going to try to go through these fairly quickly to just hit the highlights on these slides, but Slide 5 is a differentiated growth story that takes us from overspending to actually having free cash flow in this year's business. So again, it gives us confidence that we can go in and infill between the 2 development areas and it's roughly another 75, 80 wells that we can feel very confident that in 2023 and '24, we'll be able to go to build that very machine-like development, very low cost, efficient and continue to drive these margins of. There's 3 little streams on the log that we're able to see much more brittle, should hold a frac better all of the geomechanics, geochemistry,  analysis, all lend itself to suggest that those wells will be even better than the lower base D.  So what we've shown here on the chart is where we've done the 3-finger test."
