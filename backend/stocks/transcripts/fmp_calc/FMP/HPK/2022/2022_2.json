    "content": " We ended the quarter with six rigs running and three frac crews running, which was an increase when you think about last year's business of almost 3x the number of -- we had 1 rig running most of last year, and now we have six rigs running. Our production average legacy production averaged over 22,000 barrels a day, and of course, from year -- from the beginning of the year in terms of our effective date on Hannathon, our total pro forma production averaged over 25,000 barrels a day, actually almost 100-plus percent increase in production quarter-over-quarter. So we're looking at HighPeak with the growth story we have, with the financial and with the operation and with the team we have, it's going to be a very good place to be in terms of ownership, in terms of growth and in terms of making money for our shareholders. So to answer that question, yes, as we picked up activity over the last couple of quarters going from two to four to now six rigs, yes, we will have a large number of wells coming online toward the end of the year and a large production response associated with that year end kind of exit rates are going to be very similar to what we put out as guidance. But on the whole, oil prices are going to continue going up into the right over the course of the next year or 1.5 years and our production is going to continue going up and to the right, and our operational efficiency is going to continue to become better and better and lower cost, lower G&A, lower lifting costs with LOE."
