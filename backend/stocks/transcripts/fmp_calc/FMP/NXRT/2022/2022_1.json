    "content": " And leased 489 renovated units during the quarter, achieving an average month rent premium of $138 and a 26.3% ROI during the year, which is about 450 basis points higher than our long-term average ROI and rehabs. Inception to date in the current portfolio we have completed 6,398 full and partial upgrades, 4,510 kitchen upgrades and washer dryer installments, and 9,624 technology package installations achieving an average monthly rent premium of $139, $48 and $44 respectively, and an ROI of 21.8%, 70.8% and 33.5% respectively. First quarter, same-store NOI growth was pretty special across the board with the portfolio averaging 16.4%, driven by 11.3% growth in total revenues in a well managed 4.6% growth in total operating expenses. This population growth in lack of quality affordable housing should remain elevated this year, in our opinion, and as illustrated again by the highlight page compared to other multifamily options, there's still a significant Delta between Class B, Class A and FFR rents to our markets, with deltas ranging from $300 to $500 unit for multi and nearly over $700 for FFR."
