    "content": " On to Slide 12, where we walk through this quarter's key drivers of Canadian Banking net interest margin, which was up 3 basis points from last quarter and follows a significant 25 basis points expansion in the second half of last year. Revenues were up 14% year-over-year, aided by robust net interest income growth of 44%, reflecting the benefit of higher rates in both Canadian Wealth Management and U.S. Record Global Markets revenue was up 17% from last year, reflecting a record quarter for macro products with strong results across all product lines underpinned by robust client activity across rates and effects. So when I break out the 2 main drivers of that primarily attributed to the repo business as well as some of our equities derivatives businesses, that takes our number down and what you're getting from a capital markets perspective then on a total bank level, that would take that number down, which is roughly about 12 basis points down to 1 or 2, which is mainly on the loan book as margin impacted by higher funding costs. And from a technology standpoint, what you're seeing there is a lot of the investments that we've done not only from from a client perspective and driving a lot of our growth in terms of our applications for Canadian Banking, for Wealth Management and for Investment in the Capital Markets business."
