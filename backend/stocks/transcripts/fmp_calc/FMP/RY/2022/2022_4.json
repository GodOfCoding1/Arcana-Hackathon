    "content": " So in terms of we've been commenting over the last couple of quarters our continued investment in this business given the strength of growth we've had in terms of tripling the size of the bank, so we have seen very favorable NIM expansion over the year as interest rates have been rising given the asset sensitivity of City National's balance sheet. We have been similar to what I explained to Ebrahim in Canada, we have also been reducing some interest rate sensitivity in the City National as well to protect us from further downside to the extent that interest rates start to come off in the U.S. From what we're seeing from an operating leverage standpoint, for City National, we do have the benefit of not only the very strong volume growth that we've seen this year. You also heard us talk about expenses and being front-footed on growth with its Capital Markets, hiring MDs and building out our advisory, investment banking capability, our Commercial Banking capability, our mortgage and frontline branch officer capability to handle these 400,000 new clients that we hope to do again next year or more, therefore, being front-footed."
