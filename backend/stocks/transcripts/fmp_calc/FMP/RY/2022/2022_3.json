    "content": " Today, we reported earnings of $3.6 billion, a solid quarter driven by continued strength in our personal and commercial banking businesses in both Canada and the U.S., where we benefited from double-digit volume growth and strong tailwinds from rising interest rates. Adjusting for these markdowns, revenue net of PBCAE was up 2% from last year, underpinned by strong volume growth and broad-based benefits from higher interest rates. RWA was up from last quarter largely due to strong loan growth across Canadian Banking, Capital Markets and City National as we continue to support our clients\u00e2\u0080\u0099 financing needs. Canadian Banking NIM was up 15 basis points from last quarter, primarily due to higher spreads across our low-beta core checking platform and GIC portfolio, which is seeing inflows as clients shift into higher yielding deposit products."
