    "content": " I would also say that, that deposit base has been a strategic complement to our advantage overall and funding advantage given the fact that not only has the low beta on it and I'll reference the U.S. in a moment, but in Canada, in particular, how that's accelerating our NII growth, but also a funding advantage overall to support our strong asset growth, both in Canada and the U.S. We did anticipate that given the fact that there is a higher deposit beta in the U.S., but we still do expect that only to ramp up very slowly over time with the Fed rate hikes getting up to 200 basis points roughly before we start to see that deposit beta around the 39% start to move up."
