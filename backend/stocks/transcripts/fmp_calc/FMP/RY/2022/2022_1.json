    "content": " Looking forward, we have a consistent and clear focus on creating client and shareholder value and a disciplined balanced approach to capital deployment as evidenced by our 15% year-over-year growth and book value per share this quarter and a 9% compounded annual growth rate over the last three years. So I think what typically we would\u2019ve referenced in the slides is the impact on our retail franchise of both Canadian banking and in the U.S. wealth management business and pointed out as I called in my remarks, focusing on what it looks like is the more of the curve flattening, so the rising in the short end of the rates. I mean I think that we've hit on the primary objective there in terms of our organic growth and we have seen the significant ability to deploy that capital in high ROE businesses and looking at good returns, you see it both within capital markets and high ROE this quarter continued around and able to deploy it in the higher-margin underwriting businesses, the loan book as well as City National with that double-digit growth. Capital Markets, our long-term strategy is executing against expanded industry coverage, bringing new MDs and focusing on high-growth, high-opportunity sectors like health care and technology, driving really strong noninterest revenue growth is the consistency and the approach and the focus on the strategy is delivering results, and that's the message that we really want to hear."
