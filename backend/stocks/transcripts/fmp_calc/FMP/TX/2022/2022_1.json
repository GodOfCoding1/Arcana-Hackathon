    "content": " Looking forward, we expect revenue per ton to rebound in the second quarter on higher realized price in Ternium's main steel markets for the reasons already discussed. Your line is open. In the first quarter, we produced almost 700,000 tons from that country mill and we expect to produce almost 1 million, I think, it's 900,000 tons in the second quarter and then 1 million and a little bit in the third quarter of this year. I mean, the commercial market was very weak in Mexico in the fourth quarter and it was -- and it started to increase a little bit this quarter and I think it's going to be better next quarter, as I said in the previous remarks. Your line is open. Basically, what we had during this quarter, is a decrease on stock which was not only good because we were able to reduce the level of inventory but because the pricing of the different raw materials were increasing Secondly, we have an increase in our account receivables because of the increase of volumes to the market during the first quarter and especially the ones to the U.S. And the third leg of that is that we increased the level of account payables because of the increase of prices and the increase of volume required because of the new production levels at the higher price that we are already seeing in the market. Your line is open. I think it's -- so next -- I mean, remember, the facility -- Ternium's Brazil facility produced 5 million tons of slabs, roughly, I mean, the capacity is not producing that it's producing 4.6 million now or something like that. Your line is open. So if we think about Q2 and we think about the 900,000 tons from Pesqueria and just assume flat year-over-year, I mean, we're talking about almost 4 million tons in Mexico -- sorry, overall. Your line is open. Your line is open."
