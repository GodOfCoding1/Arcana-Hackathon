    "content": " Ternium is perfectly positioned to take advantage of this market environment as we are very advanced in the ramp-up of our new constraint mill and we are bringing back up capacity utilization in other lines, which we had reduced last year to adjust to lower market demand. Cash from operations was partially strong in 2021 and also in 2022, the significant shift in working capital in those year reflecting tariff fluctuation in steel prices and raw material cost and an inventory buildup in 2021 in connection with the ramp up of the new mill in Mexico. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open."
