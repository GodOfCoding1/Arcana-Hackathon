    "content": " Looking forward to the second half of the year, our expectation is that Ternium will show healthy cash generation based on the CapEx estimate for the year of approximately $600 million, a decrease in income tax payments compared to loss of the first half and a reduction in working capital and the price deflation of steel and raw material flow through Ternium Brazil. But I think it's important also what Maximo mentioned, which is that going forward, we enter into 2023 or if you want, depending on your expectations, well, we have a more normalized level of prices and especially raw materials, the Ternium after all the investment that we did, that the ramp-up of the new Pesqueria facility, we should be targeting margins that are at the upper side of the range, even a little lower that range. And probably this is a consequence of the readjustment that we marketing on sales we are mentioning during the opening remarks where we are seeing, as Steve mentioned also during third question that, there will be an adjustment on margins to probably a reason closer to what we used to have prior to the pandemic after having a couple of years of very or extremely good margins the company's and since we are still having or reflecting the multiple with an EBITDA that is not yet reflecting that new level. I mean, if you see the different reports that are out there, probably demand for steel for the automotive industry, it's going to stay stable for the last -- for the next couple of years until the new generation of batteries come forward and then costs will be also the main issue from industry."
