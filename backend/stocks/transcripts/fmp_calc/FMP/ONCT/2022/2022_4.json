    "content": " In 2022, we transitioned Oncternal into a multiproduct clinical stage company with the initiation of our Phase 3 study ZILO-301 in mantle cell lymphoma and the initiation of our Phase 1/2 dose escalation study of ONCT-808, our autologous CAR T product targeting ROR1 in advanced B cell malignancies. As a reminder, the ONCT-808 Phase 1/2 trial will be a three plus three dose escalation study in patients with aggressive B cell lymphoma, including those that have failed prior CAR T treatment, and both safety and efficacy results will be taken into account to select the recommended Phase 2 dose. And Salim, just one question before if you can answer about what the ROR1, CAR T results could look like later this year, just generally speaking, but just specific question is, is TP53 in your experience in conversations with regulators or KOLS, TP53 mutations and clinical trials aimed at this specific patients with this kind of mutation, do regulators view that as sort of a higher bar for therapies meaning that potentially having accelerated approval type potential, or  study approval, or we just don't know yet?"
