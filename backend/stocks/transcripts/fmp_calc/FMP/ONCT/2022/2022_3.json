    "content": " We will be making forward looking statements during this call about future events such as our business and product development strategies, the timing of initiation of our pre-clinical and clinical studies, the potential for our ZILO-301 Phase 3 study to support a BLA submission, the timing of planned interim updates, the timing of our regulatory filings and submissions and expected pre-IND feedback. Second, we announced the receipt of a Study May Proceed letter from FDA just 30 days after submitting our IND application for a Phase 12 dose escalation study of ONCT-808, our lead autologous CAR-T product candidate targeting ROR1. The ONCT-808 Phase 12 trial will be a three plus three dose escalation study in patients with aggressive cell lymphoma, including those that have failed previous CAR-T treatment, and both safety and efficacy results will be taken into account to select the recommended Phase 2 dose. With perspective to upcoming milestones for our zilovertamab program, we expect to open sites outside of the US for our global registrational Phase 3 study, Zillow 301 in the first quarter of 2023, and to provide an interim clinical data update from our Phase 12 study of zilovertamab, plus ibrutinib in patients with MCL and CLL as an oral presentation at the 64th American Society of Hematology Annual Meeting and Exposition in December, 2022. For ONCT-808, our lead autologous ROR1 CAR-T cell therapy candidate, we plan to initiate our Phase 12 study in patients with aggressive B-cell lymphoma in the first quarter of 2023 and to present an initial clinical data readout in 2023."
