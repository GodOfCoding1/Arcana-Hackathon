    "content": " We will be making forward-looking statements during this call about future events, such as our business and product development strategies, the timing of initiation of our preclinical and clinical studies, the potential for our ZILO-301 study to support a BLA submission, the timing of planned interim data updates, and the timing of our regulatory filings and submissions, including our IND submission for ONCT-808. During the second quarter of 2022, we made significant progress across our entire pipeline, including an encouraging data update at ASCO from a Phase 1/2 study of zilovertamab plus ibrutinib in patients with MCL and CLL, which sets\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\n Richard, it looks like Dr. James Breitmeyer disconnected\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\n Okay, could you try him back? In patients with p53 mutated CLL the landmark PFS of zilovertamab plus ibrutinib was 100% at 24 months and 100% at 30 months, which compares favorably to the historical ibrutinib monotherapy landmark PFS of around 68% and around 55% at 24 months and 13 months, respectively. Additionally, we are planning to conduct ZILO-302, an open label companion study of zilovertamab plus ibrutinib for patients who have progression -- progressive disease during the ibrutinib monotherapy run in phase of the study of ZILO-301 and result of the study could potentially support an additional approval and indication expansion. To summarize our upcoming milestones, for our zilovertamab program, we expect to initiate the global registrational Phase 3 study ZILO-301 in September 2022 and provide an interim clinical data update from our Phase 1/2 study of zilovertamab plus ibrutinib in patients with MCL and CLL in the fourth quarter of 2022."
