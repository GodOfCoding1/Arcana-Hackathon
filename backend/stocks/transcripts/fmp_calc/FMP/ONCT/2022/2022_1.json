    "content": " During the first quarter of 2022, we further sharpened our focus on the achievement of key pipeline catalyst in immunologic malignancies in prostate cancer as we navigated an unprecedented challenging macro environment, which is obviously continuing in the second quarter, including today's stock market you got. We made significant progress toward the initiation of our global Phase III Registrational Study ZILO-301 for zilovertamab in patients with mantle cell lymphoma, which is planned to be initiated in the third quarter of 2022. In the third quarter of 2021, the NIH awarded the company two research and development grants for up to $2.2 million to support preclinical activities for the company's ONCT-534 and ONCT-216 programs, including $700, 000 that is payable to sub awardies. We look forward to multiple catalysts in 2022, especially the initiation of our global Phase 3 zilovertamab study and submitting our ROR-1 CAR-T IND application, and advancing our DAARI program toward the clinic. Thank you,\n Hi Brian and thank you for standing in for Kaveri today, so the ROR-1 and ROR-2 can actually form a Hetero dimer, which can act as a receptor for  and so the ROR-2 to is for us kind of in the background, we're not targeting it because first of all, our antibody doesn't target ROR-2 and it's also harder to target ROR-2 selectively on tumors because it has a broader distribution on normal tissues."
