    "content": " As the management team adjust our sales and marketing tactics, the group managed to obtain 17,233 new subscribers this quarter, down by 17.2% year-over-year and 6.8% quarter-over-quarter. By the end of June 2020, our accumulated subscriber base increased to more than 849,000, and our first quarter storage revenues increased by 13% year-over-year to RMB119 million. Facing such challenges, we managed to recruit 17,233 new subscribers in the first quarter, representing a decrease of 17% year-over-year and 7% quarter-over-quarter. Revenues generated from processing fees and other services decreased by a lesser degree by less than 4% year-over-year to RMB162 million, as the full period contribution of the revised processing fees pricing partially offset the decrease of new subscribers. As a result of the increase in operating income and the increase in fair value of equity securities, income before income tax for the first quarter increased by 24% year-over-year to RMB160 million. For the first quarter of fiscal 2021, in terms of new subscriber break down, approximately 67% of new subscribers were from our Guangdong province; 20% from our Zhejiang market and the remaining 17% were from our Beijing market. So one thing worth highlighting is that, as you are aware that this is still a challenging time, we have expanded our installment programs in order to maintain our market presence, as well as to meet our target as well, but nonetheless still a significant amount of our new subscribes elected bullet payment option, which has generated a sizeable amount of cash inflows, but investors need to be aware that the installment payment option is now 29% as compared to a year ago, which is approximately 10%."
