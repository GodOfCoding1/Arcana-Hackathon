    "content": " During the reporting quarter, the group managed to recruit 19,066 new subscribers, up 8% year-over-year as a result of the relatively low base in the previous year period and down 3% quarter-over-quarter in line with management\u2019s expectation. In the second quarter revenues increased by 10% year-over-year to approximately RMB314 million, driven by the increase in revenue from both processing fees and storage fees. During the second quarter, the group recruited more than 19,000 new subscribers, representing an increase of 8% year-over-year, partially due to the low comparable base in the same quarter of last year, the improved business environment and also our sales efforts during these challenging times. By the end of September 2021, our accumulated subscriber base expanded to over 938,000 and storage fee revenues for the second quarter increased by 10% year-over-year to approximately RMB134 million. In the second quarter operating income increased by 15% year-over-year to approximately RMB161 million mainly due to the top-line growth, coupled with a relatively moderate increase in SG&A expenses. Sales and marketing expenses in the second quarter increased by 5% year-over-year to RMB57 million, primarily attributable to an increase in labor costs. Sir, please go ahead.
