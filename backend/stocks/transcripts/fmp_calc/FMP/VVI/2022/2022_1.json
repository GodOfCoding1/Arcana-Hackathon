    "content": " Pursuit same-store revenue increased by $8.9 million from the 2021 first quarter, primarily due to stronger visitation at our Canadian experiences from lift to travel restrictions, as well as our efforts to refresh our existing experiences and maximize revenue. GES realized total revenue of $153.6 million during the first quarter, which increased $134.4 million compared to the 2021 first quarter due to increased face-to-face live event activity and the return of large-scale events that were canceled or postponed into the first half of 2021. GES Exhibitions' first quarter revenue increased $104.7 million, with an increase in adjusted EBITDA of $10.7 million, as compared to the 2021 first quarter. For the first quarter, Pursuit delivered record revenue of $23.8 million, which increased $14 million or 143% year-over-year. And in Montana, that had our only year-round lodging property, Grouse Mountain Lodge, we saw strong performance with room revenue up 38% versus the pre-pandemic 2019 first quarter, and that was driven by -- through a 30% increase in occupied rooms and a 7% increase in average daily rate. Despite the cancellations and other headwinds caused by supply chain challenges, GES Exhibitions performed well in the first quarter and delivered $111.8 million in revenue and $2 million in EBITDA, with a significant acceleration of activity during March. I'm happy to report that GES Exhibitions had a flow-through on incremental revenue of approximately 19% from Q1, 2021 to Q1, 2022, excluding one-time gains in the first quarter of 2021. As shown on page 27, we expect Pursuit's adjusted EBITDA for the 2022 full year to be approximately $80 million to $90 million and for the second quarter to be approximately $17 million to $21 million."
