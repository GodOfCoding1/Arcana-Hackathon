    "content": " We had a very active quarter of new business, including our new contract with the city of Rochester, Minnesota, where we were selected for our ability to bring technology-based solutions to the city's parking operations, which covers over 4,300 parking spaces at 11 locations and also includes on-street meter collection and special event management services. In the first quarter, adjusted gross profit, which excludes depreciation, amortization and restructuring and other costs, increased 28% year-over-year to $51.4 million as we are seeing the benefit of contract wins in the past 12 months and also an improving business environment that Mark spoke about earlier."
