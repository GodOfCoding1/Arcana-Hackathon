    "content": " That's, that's great, Kris and leads to my next question, which is, with location growth look, net locations now growing again, and you winning new business, prior to the pandemic, you have a sort of a mid single digit gross profit also goal, as we now get back to pre-pandemic levels of profitability and beyond, if locations are growing, and profitability for location hopefully continues to grow. So we're very eager in our organization to get more locations, we can bring the technology there, but at the same time, continue to look for ways to bring additional capabilities to our existing client base because a lot of our growth fundamentally, historically and in the future is going to come from serving more clients with a broader array of our services. But what I would say, Dan, is that our aviation segment, in terms of the level of business activity, it's serving, both our airport group and our bags business have really resumed all of the services that they're going to be providing to our existing client base, and that includes any new clients, we've won."
