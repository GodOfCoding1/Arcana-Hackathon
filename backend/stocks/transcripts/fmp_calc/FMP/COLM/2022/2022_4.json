    "content": " As it relates to the fall book, that's also nearly complete, and we're buying -- well, we're matching the fall order book against our inventory levels that exist today, style-by-style, color-by-color, and we've done some purchasing to map to balance the book and our inventory so that they're in sync. And then when you think about the high single-digit rate of growth for the Columbia brand, by and large, is that -- that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the case across all markets except the EMEA distributor market, which, of course, we'll be lapping the Russia shipments that we had in 2022 that we did not have contemplated in our outlook for 2023. I think the way I would think about Q1, Q2, the key call out is what we've included in the CFO commentary, and that's that we would expect gross margin to be down in Q1, that in part being reflective of the fact that we're lapping the exceptionally low promotional levels from a D2C perspective last year. Aside from that, Laurent, I would expect that the first quarter from a growth standpoint should outpace the second quarter related to what Tim was describing earlier the fact that our spring inventory receipts for 2023 are much more timely than they were a year ago. I think to the degree we provided detail from a channel perspective, it's a little bit higher level, Alex, but we are anticipating after an incredibly solid year from a wholesale perspective in 2022 that the D2C business would outpace wholesale growth in 2023."
