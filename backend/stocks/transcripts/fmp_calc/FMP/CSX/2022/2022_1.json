So the demand is there, as the railroad begins to continue to improve as we go forward, we see a lot of opportunity and there could be changes, while there are obviously -- obviously, there are going to be changes in various supply chains, whether it\u2019s import/export grain, whether it\u2019s continued demand for U.S. coal, steel, plastics, chemicals, you name it, everything is going to be moving around a little bit. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. And then in terms of your question on the cost side, those training costs are -- it\u2019s up $10 million versus last year, so call it, roughly $15 million a quarter that we are spending on training right now. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. And so we have had to revamp, work extremely hard and now we are beginning to realize the benefits of all that hard work and it\u2019s going to be month after month after month after month with these employees are then qualified, they actually go out and start performing work and as the year goes on, on a month-to-month-to-month basis, we will see continued improvements in fluidity and increases in the speed of the network, when the net -- so you have got a compounding effect. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. I think when you look at some of the discrete items that I pointed out in the first quarter, we think some of those obviously are going to go away as we get through the year and then Jamie talked a lot about the additional resources we are adding and I think there are opportunities as the mines reinvest and they are making a lot of money right now and that allows them to reinvest in probably some deferred capital that they have had over the years. Your line is now open."
