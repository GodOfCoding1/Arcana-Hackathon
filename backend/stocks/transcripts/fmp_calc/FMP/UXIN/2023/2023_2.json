When we entered this traditional industry with digital and intelligent technologies, we spent over 11-years to build digitized processes and management systems from inspection, reconditioning to exhibition and sales we leveraged our system and data to standardize the business processes, which had long been a non-standard categories, such digitized systems and standardized processes significantly improved our efficiency in operating our used car business. As regulators continue to implement more industry boosting policies across the nation, we will carry out further efforts for expanding our business footprint through our original IRC network, our strong brand equity, as well as leading product and service capabilities will enable us to continue driving the transformation of China's used car industry into the next development stage. The expansion made our superstore the largest used car marketplace in China's Northwest region, which further enhances our value propositions to our customers with a wider vehicle selection, larger store scale and better shopping experience. So for example, new regulations require that each individual can only trade less than two used cars in a year, and this policy restriction will eliminate the illegitimate operations that were largely unregulated in the industry before, thus standardizing the market and creating a healthier environment for compliant businesses to grow."
