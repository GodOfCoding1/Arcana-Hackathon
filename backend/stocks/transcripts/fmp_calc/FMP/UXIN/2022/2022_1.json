    "content": " In the first quarter of fiscal year 2022, although we were only able to maintain a relatively small retail inventory due to cash constraints, we still achieved to enhance our fundamental capabilities in vehicle sourcing, reconditioning, sales and delivery. Therefore, to balance the car sourcing supply and our cash capacity, we increased the percentage of vehicles sold through our wholesale channels for the quarter ended June 30, 2021. Non-GAAP adjusted loss from continuing operations, which excludes the impact of share-based compensation, was RMB45 million for the three months ended June 30, 2021, and compared with RMB98 million in the previous quarter and RMB133 million in the same period last year. Net loss from continuing operations was RMB69 million for the three months ended June 30, 2021, compared with RMB133 million in the previous quarter and RMB152 million in the same period last year."
