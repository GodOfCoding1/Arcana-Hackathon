    "content": " Research and development activities increased $4.7 million, reflecting a full quarter of development expense from our ModeX operations, as well as costs related to our so much drug and development activities, principally around the development of a next generation device. We continue to execute our Reach program as Elias mentioned, and during the third quarter alone, we do start annualized employee costs by $46 million and our targeting further expense reductions across the entirety of the organization. As Elias mentioned again, so far in 2022, we have reduced our expense run rates by over $100 million and continue to see benefits of this program, each sequential month of the third quarter of 2022. The third quarter of 2021 reported operating income of approximately $19.7 million, which benefited from significant COVID-19 testing that occurred last summer. Net loss for the third quarter includes a $30.6 million noncash mark-to-market adjustment from the declines with the price of Sema4\u00e2\u0080\u0099s common stock, offset by an income tax benefit of $40.3 million, resulting in a net loss of $86.1 million or $0.11 per share, compared to net income of $28.7 million, or $0.04 per diluted share."
