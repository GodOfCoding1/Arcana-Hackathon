    "content": " We will continue our Reach initiative, which is designed to improve productivity and reduce costs which has touched every part of the organization, and we're targeting more than an additional $30 million of reductions or about 5% of our expected spend in 2023. As I mentioned on our last call, we continue to focus on operational excellence, including revenue cycle management, while pursuing efficiencies in virtually every aspect of this business, including refocusing on our higher-margin products post COVID and geographic redeployment of our patient service centers with 11 new patient service centers opened so far and 13 less productive centers closed in 2022. Our commercial footprint has expanded during the fourth quarter of 2022, with the addition of 8 new oncology sales territories as well as 5 new molecular oncology sales roles, who will focus on our cancer genomics offering in large cancer centers, health systems and large oncology practices. Net loss for the fourth quarter of 2022 included a $49.1 million noncash mark-to-market adjustment reflecting the decline in value of our equity holdings in GeneDx, formerly Sema4, partially offset by an income tax benefit of $17 million, resulting in a net loss of $85.2 million or $0.11 per share for the quarter. For our diagnostics segment, we assume COVID testing volumes will continue to decline throughout 2023, and we have assumed modest growth in core testing volumes with stronger growth in our higher-margin oncology, women's health and urology specialty lines of testing. For the first quarter of 2023, we expect the following: total revenues between $165 million and $185 million, with revenue from services between $130 million and $140 million; revenue from product sales between $30 million and $35 million and other revenue between $5 million and $10 million."
