    "content": " We plan to have scaled manufacturing of leading fuel cell engines and components in our core regional markets of North America, Europe and China to support further and future industry growth patterns and volumes across our verticals. Our investment is expected to reduce MEA manufacturing costs, align with China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fuel cell value chain localization policy and position the Weichai Ballard JV and Ballard more strongly to participate in the hydrogen fuel cell demonstration cluster regions and for the post-subsidy market. So, I think you are going to see in \u00e2\u0080\u009824 -- \u00e2\u0080\u009823 and \u00e2\u0080\u009824 significant scaling, both on -- green hydrogen production, there is a lot of activity going on in China on green hydrogen production, and scaled electrolyzer projects as well as fueling infrastructure getting rolled out to support larger fleets. And I do think that we will see a large part of the bill of materials in engines, fuel cell modules, where you see new compressors and humidifiers, and hydro recirculation blowers, pumps, valves, sensors, et cetera that will be sourced in the China market increasingly going forward."
