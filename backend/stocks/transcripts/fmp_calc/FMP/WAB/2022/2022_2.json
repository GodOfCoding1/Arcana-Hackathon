    "content": " As we look forward to the second half, we continue to expect accelerated growth in revenue from the first half behind significantly increased locomotive deliveries and lower year-over-year margin percent due to unfavorable mix in our equipment sales and comparing against much higher back half margins in 2021. Our adjusted gross margin expanded 1.7 percentage points to 31.6%, driven by a richer mix of products, increased pricing and strong productivity, partially offset by higher input cost and unfavorable foreign currency exchange. Foreign currency exchange adversely impacted revenues by 3.8 percentage points, and adversely impacted second quarter gross profits by $15 million. As I already discussed, Freight segment sales improved for the quarter and segment adjusted operating income was $301 million for an adjusted margin of 20.3%, up 1.8 percentage points versus the prior year. Turning to Slide 13, Transit segments sales were down 17.5% driven by the negative effects of foreign currency exchange, the exit of low margin contracts in our U.K business and a late quarter manufacturing disruption caused by a cyber incident. And with that, just one thing to also keep in mind is if you think just about the backlog from a quarter-over-quarter impact from FX alone, it's been over $400 million, year-over-year, it's closer to $600 million."
