    "content": " This is a more than 40% higher repurchase rate versus non-bridal customers, and average transaction value of their second purchase has increased, up 23% compared to three years ago. Non-GAAP SG&A in Q3 was roughly $500 million or 31.4% of sales, deleveraged 80 basis points compared to last year but 215 basis points better than Q3 FY \u00e2\u0080\u009820. Look, I understand you're not going to be guiding here, but maybe can you just give us some color on the puts and takes of gross margin, operating margin into next year, how to think about Blue Nile and Diamond Direct, how their impact on the business from a gross margin and an operating margin perspective."
