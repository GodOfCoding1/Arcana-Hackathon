    "content": " We've also selectively increased prices this quarter, but well below the inflation we've seen overall in the industry, proving that our scale and competitive advantages enable us to provide customers with value that is hard to match, while at the same time protecting our margins. Turning to the second quarter, we expect revenue in the range of $1.79 billion to $1.82 billion, with non-GAAP operating income in the range of $188 million to $204 million, reflecting our ability to continue driving growth, while defending against the shift in consumer spending that we expect to play out across the year. This year, we're leaning into wedding day merchandise and higher price point assortments, and so we're able to dynamically change our focus within our portfolio, focusing on, at this point in time, the customers who are in the market, and I think that's something that can continue for us. As we talked about in our remarks, we saw very strong traffic, great Valentine's Day performance, we leaned into higher price points, we're leveraging our marketing research, our consumer data, to understand in advance of key purchasing occasions what customers will be looking for, who will be in the market. And then, if you move to the year, we're providing guidance that has bottom line expansion at the higher end, but it's also giving us the ability to \u2013 flexibility with promotion, flexibility with taking action and the agility that Gina mentioned to continue to drive leveraging in our cost base as well."
