    "content": " Fiscal '23 was the best Cyber Monday in Signet history with traffic up 18% and an 11% increase in demand revenue versus last year, and we're seeing improvements across nearly all our digital touchpoints. By investing in our strategic choices and capabilities, we are creating a wider mode of competitive advantages year after year, and we're able to continue fueling this growth through revenue generation and ongoing cost discipline that will deliver more than $100 million in cost savings in fiscal '24. Fourth quarter non-GAAP operating income of $405 million was slightly down from $411 million last year, and is a 15.2% margin, a 60 basis point improvement from last year. In total, we expect the enhancements we're making across services will generate more than $100 million in incremental revenue this fiscal year, putting us on track to build services into a billion dollar business within two years, and to continue growing in a range of mid to high single digits. Recall we're lapping first quarter top line growth of 8.9% last year, which was the highest quarterly performance in fiscal '23, and included the remaining impact of stimulus spending in the first part of the quarter last year. I think at one point, Blue Nile was generating about $560 million in revenue, and I'm just looking at the difference in fourth quarter revenue growth and comp growth, and that differential suggests to me that you're capturing about 60% to 70% of that level."
