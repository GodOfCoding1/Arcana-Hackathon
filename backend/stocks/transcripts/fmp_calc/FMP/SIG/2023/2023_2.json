    "content": " Importantly, we delivered operating income within our original guidance range and non-GAAP operating margin was strong at 11%, which is nearly 3x higher than Signet's operating rate in fiscal year '20. Overall, core inventory is down 13% in the quarter compared to the second quarter of FY '20 or $300 million and importantly, it's also nearly 2% down for last year, indicating our ability to change quickly in response to macroeconomic shifts. Penetration of clearance inventory at the end of Q2 is down one point to last year and down eight points compared to FY '20, reflecting the health of our inventory, and inventory turn of 1.5x at quarter end is turning 47% faster compared to pre-pandemic levels and is also improved to last year. So we're really, I think, based on our consumer insights, we've been able to get our orders in early and to work early on the kind of innovation that is giving us more access to the part of the market that's growing, but also helping us be very competitive and offer great value at the lower end of the market."
