    "content": " Customers are responding, as we saw, total sales of our bridal category increase over $150 million or 25% this quarter to two years ago. This year, it's probably a bit more important given the macro uncertainties in Q4 and so we're looking to really drive top of the funnel marketing to be part of customers' consideration set in Q3 so that as we move toward the holiday, we've already been in contact with the 2.3 million people that we anticipate getting engaged this year and we are a big part of where they are considering purchasing. And in this year, particularly as we see the momentum and the delay of the anticipated shift that we expected later in the second quarter and with the momentum, we're seeing in the third quarter, we think it's very important for us to manage into that and maximize our share in the market with the strategies that we've put in place. Importantly the holiday receipts, so much of it being within on the water, as well as really in receipt already also helped us support that strategy importantly, so we're positioned to take advantage of the timing of what we're seeing in the market and bring to our customer the product newness that they would expect for gift-giving as well."
