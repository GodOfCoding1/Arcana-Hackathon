We have $463 million of secured contract revenues, 25% of our fleet is contracted for more than 1 year, our fleet average charter period duration is about 1.2 years and we have an additional yearly revenue capacity of about $20 million plus from our 17 scrubber-fitted vessels due to the inherent fuel price differential.

At the same time, the -- I mean to the extent that we are able to do additional period time short charter contracts that gives us the visibility of our cash flows, this -- and as we said, this exceeds $400 million at this stage, I think this makes a very good company for anyone who would like to invest because you invest in a low leverage company with substantial contracted revenue with the dividend."
