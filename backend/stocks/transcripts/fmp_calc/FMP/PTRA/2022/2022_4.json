    "content": " Last year, we also announced multiple new battery supply agreements with OEMs including the ship groups and the rail groups EMC, amongst others, growing the Proterra Powered & Energy goal to approximately $1 million and total company backlog to approximately $1.6 billion, including transit. At Proterra Powered & Energy, revenue for the full year 2022 grew 150% year-over-year to a record $118 million. Through year-end 2022, Proterra Powered has delivered battery systems to our OEM customers for more than 1,600 vehicles since our first delivery in 2018, excluding the batteries produced for more than 1,000 Proterra transit buses. Consolidated revenue was $80 million in the fourth quarter of 2022, representing growth of 17% year-over-year, albeit a decline of 17% compared to Q3 2022 due largely to supply chain constraints, limiting Proterra Transit production and difficult comparisons with a record quarter of deliveries at Proterra Energy. Taking into the results, Proterra Powered & Energy revenue in Q4 grew more than 141% year-over-year to $32 million. Operating expenses in the fourth quarter were $53 million, representing an increase of 40% year-over-year, including $3 million related to start-up costs for Powered 1 factory that was under construction. Our adjusted EBITDA loss in Q4 was $60 million, driven largely by a gross loss of $20 million and operating expenses of approximately $55 million, offset by non-cash compensation of $6 million and excluding Powered 1 start-up cost of $5 million. But if I just take a look, step back and say, what were my, I'll say, onetime items of cash usage that are likely not going to repeat in '23, you can -- there's probably about, I'd say, $16 million of cash that was used to complete the Powered 1 facility plus the start-up costs."
