Our investment income decreased by 11.2% to RMB435 million in the first quarter from RMB490 million in the same period of last year, mainly due to the decrease of investment assets, partially as a result of share buyback. Turning to our expenses, in the first quarter, our total expenses grew by RMB1.6 billion or 19.1% to RMB10.2 billion from RMB8.5 billion in the same period of 2021, primarily driven by the increase of credit impairment costs.
