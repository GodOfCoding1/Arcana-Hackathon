    "content": " At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the ChargePoint Second Quarter Fiscal 2022 Earnings Conference Call and Webcast. I would now like to turn the call over to Patrick Hamer, ChargePoint\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Vice President of Capital Markets and Investor Relations. We would like to remind you that during the conference call, management will make forward-looking statements, including our fiscal third quarter and full fiscal year 2023 outlook. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control and could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. For a more detailed description of certain factors that could cause actual results to differ, please refer to our Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on June 7, 2022 and our earnings release posted today on our website filed with the SEC on Form 8-K. Also, please note that we use certain non-GAAP financial measures on this call, which we reconcile to GAAP in our earnings release and for historical periods and the investor presentation posted on the Investors section of our website. And finally, we will be posting the transcript of this call to our Investor Relations website under the Quarterly Results section. I am pleased to report another strong execution quarter as we posted Q2 revenue of $108 million, above the high end of the guidance provided on our Q1 call. Notably, Q2 is our first $100 million quarter, another major milestone in the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 15-year history. And as we have said before, improvement in historic attach rates, our growth closely tracks the arrival rate of vehicles. As we covered in recent earnings calls, we continue to prioritize assurance of supply to support our land and expand strategy and strong upward growth trajectory. Despite the headwinds, our operations team worked tirelessly to deliver 19% non-GAAP gross margin in the second quarter, up 2 percentage points sequentially, while achieving impressive growth. Net, we are quite pleased with our performance in Q2 and Rex will provide more color on that in our outlook for the rest of the year. Our installed base of network ports grew to approximately 200,000, a year-over-year increase of 70% and sequential increase of 7%. As a reminder, we do not include home chargers for single-family residences in this count, where we also continue to see strong demand. On our first quarter call, we discussed ramping manufacturing of new fleet and commercial AC and DC charging platforms. And additionally, our customers rely on us for everything from upfront consultation and planning through build-out and ultimately continued optimization of new infrastructure. Commercial, which lagged from a rate of growth perspective during the pandemic accelerated in the quarter with the global business up 83% year-over-year and 45% sequentially. Regarding our partnership with Volvo and Starbucks, the first site went live in the quarter, an important step in reinventing the road trip. The commercial vertical in Europe was particularly strong, with billings up over 300% year-over-year and 24% sequentially. Fleet continues its growth with strong demand for management software, combined with our AC and DC charging solutions that balance charging costs with operational readiness for light to heavy duty vehicles across depot, on-route and take-home charging. In Q2, fleet billings grew 135% year-over-year and 23% sequentially following a strong first quarter. Billings for residential were up over 125% from the second quarter of last year and a sequential increase of 11% versus the first quarter, the growth would have been significantly higher, if not for supply chain constraints. Additionally, the Inflation Reduction Act was signed shortly after the close of the quarter, which includes stimulus for both vehicles and infrastructure across passenger and fleet categories. As discussed previously, we do not include these federal programs in our guidance or long-term views of turning cash flow positive. Our network has fueled over 4.4 billion electric miles to-date and we estimate these drivers have avoided over 178 million cumulative gallons of gasoline and over 800,000 metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions. A quick reminder, as in previous calls, my comments are non-GAAP, where we principally exclude stock-based compensation, amortization of intangible assets and non-recurring costs related to restructuring and acquisitions. For Q2, revenue was $108 million, up 93% year-on-year and 33% sequentially, above our previously announced guidance range of $96 million to $106 million. All verticals were strong from a demand standpoint with a healthy and welcome uptick in commercial AC business, but supply constraints across all products persisted. As before, strong demand and supply constraints translated into higher backlog that we work down a meaningful percentage of our existing backlog during the quarter, our ending backlog grew 26% sequentially from Q1. Network charging systems at $84 million was 78% of Q2 revenue, up 106% year-on-year and 41% sequentially. Other revenue at $4 million and 4% of total revenue increased 23% year-on-year, down 12% sequentially. As we have discussed before, subscription revenue growth is tied to the growth in sales of network charging systems. Our deferred revenue, which is future recurring subscription revenue from existing customer commitments and payments, continues to grow finishing the quarter at $168 million, up from $157 million at the end of Q1. Turning to verticals, as you know, we report them from a billings perspective, which approximates the revenue split. Q2 billings percentages were commercial 72%, fleet 14%, residential 13% and other 1%. From a geographic perspective, North America Q2 revenue was 84% and Europe was 16%. In the second quarter, Europe delivered $18 million in revenue and grew 254% year-over-year and 11% sequentially. Non-GAAP gross margin for Q2 was 19%, which includes $7 million or 6 points of purchase price variance logistical cost associated with the supply chain. We expect continued technology-driven margin improvements for our newer products, lower purchase price variances and improving ASPs to drive recovery in the second half. Despite these challenges, however, we are encouraged at the improving gross margin fundamentals demonstrated in Q2. Non-GAAP operating expenses for Q1 were $80 million, a year-on-year increase of 50% and a sequential decrease of 5%. Excluding higher new product introduction costs in Q1, OpEx was sequentially essentially flat as we focus on delivering operating leverage and managing expenses against environmentally driven gross margin challenges. From an operating leverage perspective, we are pleased to see OpEx as a percentage of revenue drop from over 100% in Q1 to 74% in the second quarter. And with our guidance for the year, I will mention momentarily, we expect a particularly strong finish on this metric, which is key to achieving our stated goal of free cash flow positive by the end of calendar 2024. Stock-based compensation in Q2 was $26.4 million, up from $15.5 million in Q1. As you may remember from last year, we typically do our annual refresh brands in Q2, so there is a stair step there. Looking at cash, we finished the quarter with $472 million in cash and short-term investments. Turning to guidance for the third quarter of fiscal 2023, we expect revenue to be $125 million to $135 million, up 100% year-on-year and up 20% sequentially at the midpoint. We are also confirming our annual revenue guidance of $450 million to $500 million, annual non-GAAP gross margin guidance range of 22% to 26%, and operating expense guidance of $350 million to $370 million. Your line is now open. And so we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have any expectation as there will be any significant flow this year at all, anything material with respect to Nevi. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a great tailwind for that segment of the business that affects one vertical, one of our verticals and we are in many verticals. So again, we will treat it completely as upside and we will be very conservative with respect to how we plan for that going into next year, because life always has more imagination than we all do. On the second point with respect to fleet vehicles, we are seeing \u00e2\u0080\u0093 if you look at the transit category for bus, we are seeing that scale now, because those are the most mature with respect to the number of OEMs that serve that segment with mature product. And same thing with class kind of 4 through 8 vehicles and yard haulers that very, very, very, right now vehicle limited, but we do expect next year that to start to ease back as OEMs start to hit their production ramps on vehicles. But again, we will be relatively conservative with respect to that, because until you see it, you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to bet on it. But for us on the fleet side, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s about the logo wins. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just as hard to get a 5 vehicle pilot off the ground as it is to get a 50 vehicle or a 500 vehicle or deployment off the ground when it comes to software integration planning, etcetera. Your line is now open. So in terms of what picked up in the quarter, as we said in our prepared remarks, we had a very nice performance from the commercial vertical that had a nice little recovery. It was the one part of the business that lagged the most relatively speaking, of course, during the pandemic. And then we just had a very nice performance from the operations teams to bang in product out, to be honest with you. And so we were able to outperform a little bit at the end of the quarter, but again, nothing systemic that I could describe for Q2. So if you look at Q3 and the guidance for the rest of the year, I think what we see there is we were able to grow from Q4 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 well, yes, a little bit from Q4 to Q1 and nicely from Q1 to Q2. Obviously, you can do the math for Q3 and Q4, good growth but not outlandish and we think our teams and our supply chains are up to it just in terms of hitting those numbers. So, I think this is more of a \u00e2\u0080\u0093 it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s more of a consistent C ball game right now until the external environment changes, where we just keep pushing the envelope, but any breakouts that we would expect would be a function of the external weather clearing up considerably from where it is today. Well, I mean, if you could breakdown how we get to the margin range you provided that would be helpful. So the \u00e2\u0080\u0093 if you look at the quarter we just finished going from 17% to 19%, you can imagine there is a lot of operational grinding it out that happen to provide those improvements. From a software perspective, our subscription line obviously includes both software and our Assure warranty product. What most people don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know is that we put our call center costs against our subscription line, which is why the gross margin on that is less than what you would expect from a pure software or SaaS business. And I think they are \u00e2\u0080\u0093 I think the big thing there is going to be to scale, because I think there is a baseline level and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not a low baseline, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a high baseline. So I would expect we are investing heavily there and we will continue to do that, but you will see efficiency and scale gains for that over time as we go into next year. So Europe, Europe had a really good quarter this quarter. Sequential growth was not as big a number, but that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s such a great quarter last quarter. So I think Europe is definitely gotten on the map here as part of the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s strategy, and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re executing beautifully in that area. And if you talk about seasonality more broadly, which I think you did mention, we had a nice Q4 to Q1 transition this year, first time ever that Q1 was higher. I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t speculate on what will happen this year, but obviously, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got a lot of momentum in the company. Your line is now open. I was curious if you could talk a little bit about the advertising side and how it sort of fits into your portfolio, there is been some talk about it recently. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m just curious how you think about that part of the business, sort of the opportunity there and how it kind of just basically fits into ChargePoint\u00e2\u0080\u0099s overall product portfolio. So from us \u00e2\u0080\u0093 from our side, Stephen, we view it as a way for certain sub verticals inside of commercial, say, certain retailers, shopping malls, etcetera, to get started with EV charging. And we really view it as not an or an or \u00e2\u0080\u0093 excuse me, an or, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s very complementary from a get a site where advertising is going to throw off naturally any kind of revenue that is substantial enough to offset the cost of charging, which is a narrow set of applications. So again, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just \u00e2\u0080\u0093 I think about it as a broadening of the business. Your line is now open. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s right because on a GAAP basis, it looks like it declined about 600 basis points. But because that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mostly in the line, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not a big swinger, and then there is amortization of intangibles as well. So \u00e2\u0080\u0093 but from a business standpoint, you should track it from a \u00e2\u0080\u0093 you should also look at it from a non-GAAP perspective because \u00e2\u0080\u0093 that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s when we can get down to what we think are some of the fundamentals operationally of building, selling and making margin on the product. And there, what you see is us doing what we said we were going to do, which is marching up from the \u00e2\u0080\u0093 what we hope is the low of the 17% in Q1 and driving that number back up to something closer to the models that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got it out in the street. One thing I would tell you, if you look at the gross margin, we obviously have confirmed guidance for the year. And then maybe just \u00e2\u0080\u0093 you guys have obviously said a lot already on margin, but just curious if we could get a little more color on the specific levers that you highlighted previously and how those are progressing, I guess. I think I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m pretty sure we covered this in the last call, we had one adjustment that we did very early in the calendar year and then we had another one that was occurring fairly late. I think it was in June, and so we haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t seen enormous impact on that in order do we actually expect to see norms impact on that in Q2. So \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve said this in my remarks, we do expect to see the improved ASPs kicking in Q3, in Q4 across the product side. And then as far as gross margin, generally, there is just the stuff we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re doing across the Board to work prices on existing components and then where necessary swap out components for either higher performance, lower costs or both. Your line is now open. So \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Hi, Pat, I wanted to dig into fleet a little bit more. Obviously, you mentioned were vehicle limited at this point, but the vehicles are, they are coming. They are coming next year, and they are going to ramp pretty significantly, and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to be a big chunky piece of your business. So I guess how are you thinking about your supply chain, your contract manufacturers ramping or expanding your capacity to handle that what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to be probably a pretty big surge in volumes. So first of all, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re always improving the sophistication of our supply chain and CM base, and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an ongoing optimization process that we would be naturally running one. Two, I think we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re reasonable forecasters as evidenced by a lot of the things that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve managed to forecast accurately since we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been a public company, you can look back at the records there. We \u00e2\u0080\u0093 just as a matter, of course, with the factories, we control the test infrastructure. So net-net, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t see supply chain as the real limiting factor on fleet, I still see it being more vehicle limited. Well, I mean it depends on \u00e2\u0080\u0093 I mean, obviously, the answer is it just depends on the customer. They have been piloting things and frankly, hiring people out of our industry, the utility industry, the vehicle industry, etcetera, to kind of get ready for this. But again, I think we can stand in for customers that that have a bit less aptitude because we have really fantastic consultative and design-build services very comprehensive software, really one-stop shopping. So again, I think the real \u00e2\u0080\u0093 if I were in your shoes and modeling, I would be looking at the \u00e2\u0080\u0093 still at the vehicle curves. I think fleet much like \u00e2\u0080\u0093 or excuse me, our commercial business is going to be inextricably tied to vehicle penetration into the vertical. Your line is now open. Craig, I think it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s easier to answer it from the last question and then work back into the specifics. Environmentally, demand for electric vehicles exceed supply by a long margin. But if the macro environment for consumer goods, begins to hit some rough patches the vehicle demand is still going to be there on the electric vehicle side sufficient to basically consume the production capacity of most OEMs. And as we still see the growth facing into a supply chain environment that will have less mouths to feed, we should see a continued improving trend there. But where it was much more broad-based a year ago, much more broad-based with respect to everything from sheet metal to plastic to electronic components. The pressure points are centering much more not exclusively, but much more around electronic components, and so we think that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s actually pretty well aligned with the softening macro, but we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to be presumptuous. I mean, the hiring \u00e2\u0080\u0093 it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s still, as you said, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re managing operating expenses to slightly lower gross margin performance than our guidance range had at the beginning of the year outlined. And so we basically are shaping OpEx, but we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re still growing, as you said, and still hiring pretty much across the board. In terms of where the biggest scale pressures are in the company, you can think about our infrastructure as a company that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s growing effectively 30% quarter-over-quarter, which most companies don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t see in a couple of years. So that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s qualitatively how management here and literally every charge pointer thinks about where the investments need to go, so you can use that as a lens. With that said, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re still growing R&D, but we preloaded R&D growth over the \u00e2\u0080\u0093 in the last 15 years, it was pretty much a invest in R&D and sales and not a whole lot else before we were before we were public, just like most private companies do. Your line is now open. So the impact we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re quoting, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s about $7 million or 6 percentage points in the quarter of things that we would call purchase price variances or unusually adverse logistics costs, expediting costs as sort of things. And then this quarter, we get at 6%. Obviously, as I mentioned earlier, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to be working on that. One of the things that you should note, we did have a \u00e2\u0080\u0093 there was \u00e2\u0080\u0093 so product transition costs also that we had some NPI issues in Q1. In Q2, we had some product \u00e2\u0080\u0093 new product introduction transition costs that hit gross margin. So it \u00e2\u0080\u0093 we do think fundamentally, there could have been some additional upside there. So I think what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to happen is growth into Q3 and Q4, some easing of the supply chain issues that we see will help us drive gross margin. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve not actually given a number to that, but it went up 30% plus, I think, in Q1, and then it went up another 26% in Q2. So you can imagine if we could literally just build anything and everything and ship everything, we would have a substantially higher number on the top line. And then just if I could squeeze one in, just it looked like \u00e2\u0080\u0093 look overall like pretty good improvement in terms of OpEx leverage from Q1 to Q2 but even versus Q4. And then obviously, the guidance is assuming there is continued improvement in the back half. So I think \u00e2\u0080\u0093 so first of all, just to baseline, Q1 was in the mid-80s, Q2 was about 80. So if you look Q1 to Q2, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s effectively flat. So, I think the leverage is going to be significant as we go through Q3, Q4 and into next year because you have got a complete differential in growth rate between the top line sequentially and operating expenses sequentially. So, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to keep getting much, much better from a leverage perspective. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t actually see the number itself going down, but I see the rate of increase trailing very much the rate of increase that the top line is going to be giving us. Your line is now open. And if you look at what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s already been put in place with respect to bans on internal combustion vehicles, 2035 is about the centered the number that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s already been put in place in a lot of different places around the planet, especially in Europe. And it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s impossible to maintain R&D on the internal combustion side and the battery electric side because the platforms are to optimize them, they are substantially different in the end. So, the net of it is, I really support what California has done in terms of aligning with a lot of the bans that have already been put in place. And I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think that will have much effect now, but I think in one or two buying cycles of vehicles it will accelerate the early retirement of vehicles when the supply is there from an auto OEM perspective when they have worked all their supply chain transformations out. So, I like the date certain dangling out there, because I think it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just \u00e2\u0080\u0093 it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s batting cleanup, so to speak, on the conversion to electric vehicles. I am going to turn the PPV versus ASP question back to Rex since he was commenting previously on margin, I will let him take that one. And as I said earlier, those \u00e2\u0080\u0093 they have been \u00e2\u0080\u0093 they have definitely been running hot now for several quarters in a row. The problems are getting more focused and narrower, which I actually think is a positive sign. And then on the other piece of your question, I think where you were going is, do you think that that we can get that 6 points to go away or at least be covered by ASP changes. I do think our ASPs are going to move northward nicely given the price increases that we have done, and those are in full effect now for Q3 and Q4. So, as you can imagine, you announced them in June, but they don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really take effect until you get to Q3, Q4. And then I think the other things as the environment improves, will naturally decline. So, I would like to think that as those two things converge over the next six months that we would actually be in a substantially better place, will more than cover\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\n Understood. Your line is now open. Just two quick ones for me. Pasquale, just at a \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and apologies if you mentioned this, but just at a big picture level, can you talk about how you are thinking about the impact of the Inflation Reduction Act across just \u00e2\u0080\u0093 across your business in light of your discussion around demand above supply capacity. So, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s very key for us from a policy shaping perspective to see policies that look at the whole picture in totality and don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t create effectively demand hotspots or incentive hotspots, so to speak. And this one looks like it tried to address that in reasonable balance, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s always tough to do that in something as large as that as a bill like that. The \u00e2\u0080\u0093 in terms of impact to the business, the fine print on the usability of the tax credits given the customers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 unique situations tax-wise, is always the wrinkle with the tax credit based incentive or for that portion of what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s in IRA. But again, because we are probably over the next couple of years, still going to be supply limited on vehicles relative to demand in both fleet and passenger cars. But it does, I think on the margin, get the smaller companies off the blocks because there is a little grease to the skids there, right. If you look at the quotes that I made in my prepared remarks with respect to the Fortune 50 versus as you move down through the Fortune 500, the penetration rate gets lower, you are upwards of 80% at the top of that range, and it gets \u00e2\u0080\u0093 it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s still substantial. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s still better than 50%, but it starts to move down. And as you trickle into the diffuse mass of businesses out there, having some incentive may get them off the blocks a little bit faster. But I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think it \u00e2\u0080\u0093 frankly, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think it would move our forecast substantively. Yes, on that second piece around operating expenses, I would say two things. One, as I said earlier, on the gross margins side, if you do the math for Q3, Q4 against guidance, you would probably ascertain that we are looking at shading towards the lower half of that range on gross margin. So, I would expect to be in the lower half of that range as well for the year. Your line is now open. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just from a confidentiality perspective, I just \u00e2\u0080\u0093 it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s something I just don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to comment on right now. What I can tell you about how we are looking at it is we are not trying directly to monetize the advertising, so to speak, we are what the model does is it supports a, one of a couple of buying options from us to provide the infrastructure. So, from a charge point perspective, it will look like we sold or used our charging-as-a-service program into a particular customer, right. But in the law of large numbers, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not changing our forecast, and I am certainly not seeing anything broad brush. Your line is now open. This is what I call an all whoosh, no bang industry because it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s so broad. So, I would not expect commercial to have a massive dislocation in a quarter. just the business just \u00e2\u0080\u0093 it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s got too much inertia, it just doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t work that way. The level of engagement from a broad base of sub-verticals in the commercial space, everything from parking operators, commercial real estate operators hospitality operators, retailers across the board, everyone has got the wake-up call now, for sure. So, all the things that we are investing in for scale is specialization of our sales force, specialization of our channel, specialization of our sales enablement materials and our support capabilities to enable each one of those verticals to get the best possible counsel from us on how to approach charging in their parking lot. So, I think you will \u00e2\u0080\u0093 you are seeing it in our growth rate, right. Our growth rate that we report on is a very lagging indicator, a leading indicator into the sales force is just a tremendous level of interest across the board. Your line is now open. Just real quick, you talked about increases in hardware fees really in U.S. based. I am curious why we are not also increasing in Europe as well. I am curious why we are not also increasing in Europe as well. From a hardware ASP perspective, in North America, obviously, we have got a very \u00e2\u0080\u0093 a great market position here. And so we are busily for lack of a better term, we are training \u00e2\u0080\u0093 educating or training the market to understand the full value of a fully integrated network solution that ChargePoint provides it, we believe is superior to what other people are doing. But there is work to do there, to be honest, to be able to educate the market and bring the overall level of price more in line with what we are accustomed to seeing here. So, then from a software perspective, we did do an adjustment from \u00e2\u0080\u0093 to our selling prices here back in February. And then we have what you would expect from any software company, which is annual escalators that we have in place on most of our contracts. And so you would expect to see that creep up over time just because that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what software companies do, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a cost of living kind of thing. But with the overall level of software content in the fleet space is going to be a meaningful adder to us certainly, from a dollars perspective, the rest of the business that we are going to be doing with fleet is going to be a big enough number that I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know where the percentage will shake out, but I know that the dollar content there is going to be attractive. Your line is now open. Just two quick ones for me. First, a point of clarification, Rex, for the lower end of the guidance for the gross margin, I just want to make sure that revenue is not included in that was just for the gross margin side. So, first clarification, my commentary on gross margin and OpEx was specific to gross margin and OpEx and there is no shading on the revenue line at all. And then from a first half, second half perspective, again, I think gross margin is going to be a combination of things that will improve the trajectory there. And it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, again, everything from the price increases kicking in can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t hurt. There is a lot of work we are doing with our CMs, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s everything from what they charge us to do what they do, but they charge us to get a shift and then, of course, what we are paying for parts. So, I think we will fundamentally improve incrementally there just by getting better in operations, I think you may have seen we hired Rick Wilmer, who is a gentleman to join us and focus heavily, particularly on that operations from supply chain side of things. Now we have a new version of the power module, and it has it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s better, faster, cheaper, which, of course, you are not supposed to be below, but that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s definitely what is. So, I think it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the combination of all those things is why we believe that the gross margin is headed back where it needs to be. Well, first of all, when you cross through your first $100 million revenue quarter, there is a long list of people to thank it really internally for a 15-year-old company and a lot of people that have worked tirelessly to get to this point, I have to say thank you. So, to all the ChargePointers out there that have been really pushing it to scale, as I mentioned in one of the answers the quarter-over-quarter growth here is an enviable multiyear growth rate for most companies. Our customers make this all happen for us, and they trust us, and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an honor to be trusted by so many companies, and to have to could come through for them, especially under very demanding times. And thank you very much to everyone that listened in, asked questions. We had 45 minutes for Q&A, so it was very robust, and we have a lot of analysts that are putting a lot of time into modeling the company."
