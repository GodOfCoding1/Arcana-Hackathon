    "content": " The issue is the random onset of decommits in the supply chain for components and our teams\u2019 -- with our contract manufacturers, deep focus on making sure that we exercise every potential source of supply and our engineering teams right behind them, qualifying second, third, fourth sources in some cases, so we can desensitize the risk, you can\u2019t drive it to zero, but desensitize the risk to sudden decommits where you think you have a source of supply, but suddenly, they can\u2019t meet shipment into the factory. And then, you have to have the supply chain partners to be able to deal with the -- what is the delivery vehicle for software, the hardware products at the other end of the wire and the decisions we made there or to partner with large household names, contract manufacturers, of which we have multiple that are partners of ours, not too many because we obviously don\u2019t want to spread ourselves too thin with respect to management bandwidth but enough there where there is plenty of capacity with reasonable -- very reasonable lead times to lay in more manufacturing scale in front of the growth of the Company."
