    "content": " So with the advent of the whole pandemic workplace has been, it's been solid that it hasn't had the growth that has had historically over the last X number of quarters, DCs perform, excuse me fleets performed very well, which includes DC, there's also fast bill and our home business is going extremely strongly over the last two quarters, those are on the lower end of the gross margin curve for us. Individually, we don't give out gross margin by product, but we have to understand  two guardrails, look we did have a good performance internally, I think this quarter, so the biggest drivers of gross margin are mix and then as we go up both the operational improvement curve, the cost reduction efforts to renewing our components, and then obviously growth and workplace and commercial, those are all very, very positive influences on gross margin, as we look out."
