    "content": " My name is Heena, and I will be your coordinator -- conference operator for today\u2019s call. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the ChargePoint Third Quarter Fiscal 2022 Earnings Conference Call and Webcast. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there\u2019ll be a question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the call over to Patrick Hamer, ChargePoint\u2019s Vice President of Capital Markets and Investor Relations. With me on today\u2019s call are Pasquale Romano, our Chief Executive Officer; and Rex Jackson, our Chief Financial Officer. We would like to remind you that during this conference call, management will be making forward-looking statements, including our fiscal fourth quarter and full year 2022 outlook and our expected investment and growth initiatives. For a more detailed description of certain factors that could cause actual results to differ, please refer to our Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on September 10, 2021, and our earnings release posted today on our website and filed with the SEC on Form 8-K. Also, please note that we use certain non-GAAP financial measures on this call, which we reconcile to GAAP financial measures for the current quarter in our earnings release and for historical periods in our investor presentation posted on the Investors section of our website. And finally, we\u2019ll be posting the transcript of our call to our Investor Relations website under the quarterly results section. And with that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Pasquale. I\u2019ll provide a business update, including details of our strong Q3 execution against plan before turning it over to Rex for financials. According to BloombergNEF, as many as 2.9 million electric vehicles are expected to be sold across North America and Europe this year, an increase of approximately 67% from 2020. Our strong financial performance throughout this year is the result of investments in a product and go-to-market strategy we have made over many years to be able to capture associated demand across commercial, fleet and residential verticals in both North America and Europe. First, we added more commercial and fleet customers in Q3 than any other quarter in the company\u2019s history. I\u2019ll remind you we acquired ViriCiti, a leading eBus and commercial vehicle management provider and we also announced the expansion of our partnership with WEX, a leading fleet payment solutions company. Third, consistent with our prior calls and as you can see in our earnings release, we report revenue along three lines, networked charging systems, subscriptions and other. Q3 revenue was $65 million, up 79% year-over-year at the high end of our previously announced guidance range of $60 million to $65 million and up 16% sequentially. Networked charging systems at $48 million was 73% of total revenue for the quarter, consistent with Q2 and grew 111% year-over-year and 16% sequentially. As I mentioned last quarter, the delta in growth rates between networked charging systems and subscription revenue as a function of two main factors, mix and time lag. Second, for most of our solutions, we began revenue for subscriptions at a fixed time after the associated hardware shipments to accommodate installations, using a time lag of at least a quarter. Our deferred revenue from subscriptions, representing recurring revenue from existing customer commitments and payments grew nicely finishing the quarter at over $120 million. Other revenue at $4 million, a 6% of total revenue increased 37% year-on-year and 30% sequentially as driver activity and associated credits picked up during the quarter. Turning to verticals, as you know, we look at verticals from a billing perspective, which approximates the revenue split, Billings by vertical for Q3, for commercial 69%, fleet 16%, residential 13% and other 2%, reflecting outperformance in both fleet and residential. From a geographic perspective, Q3 revenue from North America was 89% and Europe was 11%, representing a slight percentage gain in European contribution, driven by both organic growth and acquisition contributions. In the third quarter, our European business delivered $7 million in total revenue, almost tripling from last year\u2019s third quarter and up 41% sequentially. Turning to gross margin, non-GAAP gross margin for Q3 was 27%, a 4-point improvement over Q2, reflecting continued improvements in our cost of goods sold and positive margin contribution from our European acquisitions. Of the $28 million of stock-based compensation in the second quarter, approximately $14 million was attributable to services performed prior to the second quarter and included grants to employees who join the company during the preceding 12 months, as well as incentive awards to key personnel in both cases delay, while the company executed SPAC transaction. In Q3 the revenue contribution from the acquisitions was approximately $2 million comprised of subscription, hardware and other, reflecting the fact that we own these assets for only a portion of Q3. Looking at cash, we finished the quarter with approximately $366 million, down from $618 million at the end of Q2, reflecting cash spent on operations and $210 million paid for acquisitions in the quarter. For fiscal Q4, we expect total revenue of $73 million to $78 million at midpoint an increase of 78% versus Q4 of last year and a sequential increase of over 16%. For the fiscal year, we\u2019re taking our revenue guidance up from $225 million to $235 million to $235 million to $240 million at the new midpoint representing a 62% increase year-on-year. And with that, it concludes our prepared remarks and we\u2019ll turn it over to Q&A. Just -- the first one, Pat, I think you had mentioned that, you expect to see the federal stimulus to more meaningful manifest in 2023. We may see some of the back half of the year, it\u2019s hard to predict. And in terms of how much money is going to flow actually in that year versus subsequent years is, right now it\u2019s too hard to call. I\u2019m not trying to be evasive is this if you look at the, I will give you an example, the VW Appendix D program that was implemented in an analogous way, it was money that flew -- flowed from the Federal Government on the federal portion of the settlement anyway to all states but California, California had its own settlement carve out. The sum total of money, like I said, we don\u2019t expect to be the next year. I also want to draw your attention to one other thing is that the budget reconciliation and other associated conversations about where the government is trying to generate stimulus in other areas for EV charging, that could have faster effects. But again, it\u2019s too hard to pin that down right now. So in previous quarters, we\u2019ve reported, it\u2019s similar or analogous to a backlog number associated with kind of the sum total of approved utility programs that are running in the United States. I got a question in terms of what the programs are out there that\u2019s available, because that\u2019s how I heard the question. But in terms of total programs, it\u2019s in the hundreds of millions of dollars. So, first of all that the OpEx number is a broad base number, because we\u2019re investing heavily in sales, marketing, obviously, we\u2019re a newly public company. As you may have seen, we had a big fleet announcement several months ago and that\u2019s just a huge watershed event for the company. There\u2019s a huge amount of energy that goes into what we see is one of our greatest differentiators, which is, of course, the software platform. So there\u2019s a big, big push right now, and obviously, since we play in all verticals in both North America and Europe and we see that the time is now from an industry perspective, we\u2019re really putting our shoulder to it. I can\u2019t give you a number, obviously, because it\u2019s learning yet, but I think we should see some steady leverage next year that I think you guys to be happy about. So as you -- if you do the math, you can tell that the hardware, you get back into the hardware number by just looking at the overall math, but one you can talk to the other. We\u2019ve recently, over the last couple years made enormous progress in Europe and we\u2019re not putting a ceiling on that. We\u2019ve done two acquisitions in very different industries, one is targeted at expanding, consolidating customers, as well as extending functionality in a fleet space that was ViriCiti, one that you saw, and then has to be is in the center of the commercial business in Europe. And in -- with respect to inorganic versus organic growth, we\u2019ll be intelligent that we obviously will evaluate opportunities as they present. But I don\u2019t think it\u2019s necessary to have an all inorganic strategy to gain market share, its early innings in the EV market in general. Early enough and we have strength that\u2019s broad based with respect to our product portfolio and position where in our modular and we are in every vertical that we can think of in both continents, so there\u2019s a tremendous amount of leverage there that we have. And with that said, if there\u2019s an opportunity that presents itself like that has to be like ViriCiti and it has team, it has tech and it has customers that are aligned with our business model, we\u2019d certainly looked at it, so would be very interesting products. And then for my next one more of a theoretical question around site owner\u2019s decisions between Level 2 and Level 3 charging especially in places with like shorter visit times, like grocery stores, malls, parks, et cetera. Early conversations we\u2019re having, I think, there\u2019s some split opinions on what the preference may be for future EV drivers. So I\u2019m just -- I\u2019m curious, what are your conversations been like, with new site owners deciding which route to go with and if any existing Level 2 customers are looking to expand but with a DC solution. So, one point by the way of fact, it\u2019s not an opinion. When you make the switch to electric drive, a depot is not your primary fuel anymore, meaning you don\u2019t wait till the little yellow lights on, go drive somewhere fill up in the hall. That doesn\u2019t happen, especially if you have access to charging it home or work or both or street side parking. This is -- we\u2019ve seen these driver patterns kind of dominate how people behave, they\u2019re always corner cases where people, certain percentages of the population don\u2019t conform, but they usually have outlier reasons for not conforming. In fact, it\u2019s actually matching the natural parking duration and how much energy is expected to be reloaded in that day. So if you\u2019re going to the grocery store near your house, you\u2019re not trying to show your tank or your battery, you\u2019re not trying to do that. You\u2019re trying to avail yourself of some convenience miles you may pick up as an amenity, buy a grocery store. Now, if you pulled off the highway and you\u2019re on your way to a weekend holiday and you happen to pick a grocery store to stop it, because it had a fast charger, you\u2019re doing that because you want to make an essentially a refueling stop. The average shopper doesn\u2019t want to use a fast charger, if they\u2019re in their local area. So it\u2019s -- and I\u2019m not talking down one or the other, it\u2019s about matching it correctly. And if you don\u2019t match it correctly, let\u2019s say, you\u2019re at that grocery store, if you don\u2019t match it correctly, you\u2019re very expensive utilization mistake of the total construction cost and equipment cost versus the number of parking spaces and customers you can serve. It\u2019s a, I got a real problem, because I really made a massive mistake. Because you\u2019re going to, if you plug in around town and you\u2019re just topping up, you are a fast charger is such an expensive proposition for that use case and consumed so much electrical capacity for that use case that you\u2019ve made a mistake. But if you\u2019re well positioned to serve highway drivers as they\u2019re going out of there, beyond the battery range, having a mix on your grocery store site between L2 for your local customers and fast for your long distance customers makes a whole lot of sense. So what we do is we consult with customers to try to help them understand how to allocate the right strength for the likely use cases that are going to present in the parking lot, because the number of parking spaces you can electrify with the electrical capacity and the cost of one fast charger is pretty significant on the LP, if you\u2019re primarily serving local clientele. So that -- this is just some of the coloring and it\u2019s so much different than putting gas stations up, it just has no relationship to that legacy market at all. I mean, I\u2019ll give you generalities, because we\u2019re not coming to the typical specifics. But in both acquisitions, we\u2019re newer to the has to be and frankly in ViriCiti one, because it\u2019s earlier innings, because that closed a couple months past one ViriCiti one did. But on both, we\u2019re making good progress on integration. On the fleet side, we\u2019re already co-selling. And we are -- we have customers that, like I said, we\u2019ve done some customer consolidation and we\u2019ve had customers that have used ViriCiti for different functionality from and had our charging solution and ViriCiti vehicle solution. And where that\u2019s the case, we are already moving the ball down the field to integrate the two solutions. With that said, it\u2019ll take some time to get things integrated in an orderly way. We are in earlier innings, would have to be, but we\u2019ve already got some customers activity going on, where 1 plus 1 is already equaling 3, where we can bring additional functionality, either to their customer base or ours, vice versa. As you\u2019ve seen, we turned in upside results now over several quarters. And if you can, when -- if you can imagine how hard that is in a supply chain constrained environment, because obviously, we\u2019re laying forecasts into our supply chain, either under -- even under normal circumstances with significant percentage of a year\u2019s worth of visibility that because that\u2019s just what you need to do, especially as you\u2019re scaling. Rex, first of all, I believe in your prepared remarks, you commented that, correct me if I\u2019m wrong, it was about a 2-point -- the supply chain issues resulted in about a 2-point penalty and gross margin relative to what we could have turned in. Maybe just kind of back to the supply chain, can you give us a sense of how much visibility you have to -- into fulfilling orders over the next several quarters and maybe just any thoughts around or commentary around inventory that\u2019s on hand currently? But in terms of visibility, it\u2019s not so much visibility that\u2019s -- visibility into supply chain that causes us many other companies say the same thing. Now there\u2019s a bit of -- there\u2019s not a bit, there\u2019s quite a bit of preplanning going on there where we\u2019re scrambling to multiple sources wherever possible on parts that we forecast is possibly being problematic. But our communication to supply chain, the firm orders that we\u2019re placing into supply chains for product, et cetera are well out this year, well out into next year. Our inventory actually, like I said this last quarter, I keep wanting it to go up because it\u2019s the spot supply chain challenges. So -- but I will just tell you, if we can build inventory going forward, we will, we just haven\u2019t done that yet. And Gabe, that\u2019s not weakness, that\u2019s just continued upside materializing. But nonetheless, it\u2019s a -- it\u2019s on the good side of the problem balance sheet. \u2026I mean, our bank, because it\u2019s kind of odd to have a CFO say, hey, let\u2019s increase our inventory level. So if you\u2019re trying to ramp the business and you got supply chain challenges you\u2019re trying to make, building the inventories as fast as it\u2019s a smart thing to do. \u2026Gabe where the modularity of the platform is, I know all the platforms that we ship is really coming into play, because we have a lot -- we drive a very broad set of use cases on the hardware side of the product line with very few skews or very few internal parts that we have to make. It may show up as different orderable part numbers, but that\u2019s largely just configuration at the end. Architecturally the product line is not without its challenges in a supply chain constrained environment, but it\u2019s better than most. And you saw the competition with another announcement today, VP making acquisitions, but could you maybe just give us a little bit of color on conversations, whether it\u2019s here in the U.S. and Europe, and just generally our demand and -- is stemming from the fleet channel and how you expect that to progress over the next couple quarters? I mean, it\u2019s coming at us from all sides, and again, in a good way. The comment though, I would say in our opinion, we think we have the most wholesome broad based software solution in that space, especially with the addition of ViriCiti, because now we\u2019ve even ripped up the food chain on the vehicle side and remember, also full service provider with respect to the ability to add design, build, consultancy, and project management, help with utility infrastructure on the sides with respect to consultation there. I mentioned on a previous earnings call the one example of that is we\u2019re seeing a lot of fleets that have a take-home components to parking operations and refueling operations, not refueling in the traditional sense, but with electricity, wanting to reimburse the contractor that is taking the vehicle home. So because we\u2019re operating in those verticals naturally, in especially in Europe that develop solutions for lease codes that are providing both company cars and leasing services to commercial fleets. And we are -- as Rex mentioned on the R&D side, we\u2019re piling a tremendous amount of R&D into that on a continuous basis, so we\u2019re not stopping with the functionality that we have. And I think that, obviously, we\u2019re going to continue to battle that a bit, as you look forward. But I would just tell you, what\u2019s important is to understand that there was demand in the quarter little bit is big enough number that worth mentioning it. And it wasn\u2019t a massive number, but it was a meaningful enough number that pushed us well above the high end of a range. And then in terms of the drivers of the revenue increase versus the plan that you guys laid out last quarter, sounds like momentum across the Board. It\u2019s -- as we said earlier, as Pat said earlier, it is broad based across the three verticals. So superb performance from home even though that\u2019s not any revenue number, relatively speaking, because it\u2019s a fairly inexpensive product relative to our other products, we\u2019ve seen really good performance from our CPE250, which is our DC products and then we\u2019ve seen workplace do, okay, relative to what we think you should be doing once we get out of COVID. So it isn\u2019t like, I wouldn\u2019t say, there\u2019s anything moving left or right. Let\u2019s go...\n Hi, James. I think, I mean, I think, it\u2019s pretty basic. What I would love to do is say, hey, we\u2019re taking -- we\u2019re having -- I think we are gaining share, but at that -- there was a -- relative to a couple years ago no share to gain, because there were limited vehicles. And when there aren\u2019t vehicles shipping in volume for manufacturers and you\u2019re limited the pilot level program sizes, just isn\u2019t that meaningful. And if you remember some of the comments I\u2019ve made in previous earnings calls, I pointed out that the revenue in fleet is not proportional to the opportunity that we\u2019ve seized, because as we develop pilots and submit our relationship with our fleet customers, obviously, based on earning that trust, as they expand they will expand with us. So the challenge is, it\u2019s an incredible from an OpEx perspective relative to money returned in the period, it\u2019s an -- it\u2019s certainly in the investment category, not the kind of run rate category, so to speak. And we are doing a ton of work and we -- if you look at the size of our business, the OpEx that we\u2019re able to deploy, because of the size of our business, it is in our opinion a huge differentiation on a go forward basis, because we can afford, frankly, to do the work. We can afford that mode, because we have a commercial business that\u2019s healthy. So they\u2019re obviously getting the signals from the OEMs and we all know about all the models that are coming out and about to hit the next 12 months, 18 months. I think most any information that I know that isn\u2019t perfect , I couldn\u2019t say. If you just look at -- if you look at public announcements, in terms of, flip over points where the majority of auto manufacturers lines will be electric, you\u2019re looking in your brands shooting for somewhere between depending on the brand that 25, I think, that\u2019s a bit aggressive. But by 2030 or the early 2030s, you\u2019re seeing most commit to being substantively full electrified. And we\u2019re seeing the dealers respond to those OEM programs substantially and we think that especially it\u2019s geographically broad based, it is not in the usual hotspots for EV. It is geographically much more broad based, not perfectly broad based, but much more broad based, that is a very good indicator that auto OEMs are communicating to dealers that get ready since that\u2019s coming. It\u2019s hard to say whether growth is going to eclipse seasonality or not and shift some of the usual trends around, it\u2019s just hard to say, normally that we\u2019ve seen seasonality in the business relative more to construction cycles in northern hemisphere. So normally has a deep winter construction cycle slowdown in some areas, but you got so much growth going on now, it\u2019s hard to predict how much it\u2019s going to get offset. And so in terms of mix, I\u2019ll caution you on something revenue mix and unit volume mix are very different, because of the while price point differences between the residential business inclusive of multifamily and then the commercial and then the fleet business. So what that bodes for is a very challenging segment in fleet to reconcile unit volume even within the segment or vertical, it\u2019s very difficult to match unit volume to revenue, especially in early innings where averages have not stabilized. Overall, I believe Rex correct me if I\u2019m wrong, but I believe residential was 13% of our billings this past\u2026\n Correct. We\u2019ve actually seen here in the last few weeks The California Energy Commission, as well as The California Air Resources Board announced some pretty significant dollars over the next few years, $1.4 billion total plan, $1.1 billion in new money of which a big chunk of that is spent for charging infrastructure. So, I mean, we\u2019ve got a lot of experience with this issue. CEC moves relatively quickly, as you said, relative to other programs, because it\u2019s not specific to the Federal Infrastructure Bill, the bulk of the money has to flow to states and then states of design programs. So you get this inherent two tier cascade where the CEC doesn\u2019t have that two tier cascade, it\u2019s a very large state that already has a very large EV population and it\u2019s been operating with significant EV programs for a lot of years. And so, it\u2019s hard to call how much of that is going to flow again to us. It hasn\u2019t -- it was not in any of our models, because we don\u2019t put something into a model until we can count on. But remember, the customer\u2019s initial buys usually a fraction of their ongoing buys and you have a lot of time over the life of that customer to mature and evolve the product they need to buy today, so if they buy a product today that\u2019s under say supply chain pressure. Well, you want that customer anyway, because most of the products they\u2019re going to buy is going to be well past when all of this clears. But we could or would want to engineer backwards or forwards and the fact that our mix has been consist -- fairly consistent Q2, Q3 and will probably be consist -- I think consistent in Q4, just means we -- we\u2019re and we have demand is more than what we can meet, we are meeting demand as best we can. Just --we are and by the way, we have got the inventory coming backwards, we\u2019re effectively flat. But we\u2019re -- anyway the difference is so slight, it doesn\u2019t really matter. But we are chasing a very, very strong demand level across our business and we\u2019re meeting it as little as we can. So we don\u2019t have big open holes anywhere, but we would expect that to continue at some level, but thus far we\u2019re managing it, our team has done a great job. First, when you look at your opportunity in Europe, any sense how we should think about sort of relative growth rates in Europe over the next couple of years versus the U.S. market? But also, you think the European business grows at about the same rate as your U.S. operations or do you think it\u2019s materially different based on sort of the maturity of the market and product lines? I don\u2019t think it\u2019s, the product lines aren\u2019t substantively different between the two markets. There are some differences in some areas, but they\u2019re not substantively in the long-term different. We\u2019ve got some startup conditions in our business in Europe but we\u2019re having with ourselves out of yet, but that\u2019s process. So I actually think fundamentally the early -- the -- in the next few years, just because of the regulatory and the policy environment in Europe, you will -- you\u2019re likely to see higher percentages of electrification of new car sales than you will in the United States and now own and lease out over time. I\u2019ll remind you of an interesting stat that almost no one, everyone says I had, when I say that no one realizes it upfront. In terms of our business, we should acquire market share faster in Europe then we\u2019re acquiring market share in the U.S., because the market share is already so high in U.S. And so by definition, we should be acquiring market share, and therefore, I will also point out something else. On the other side of the software -- of our software, it\u2019s a much higher percentage in the U.S. It\u2019s not 100%. But it\u2019s much higher in the U.S, and therefore, the average, when you look at the ports under management and you try to equate that to revenue, it\u2019s a little bit lower in the early days in Europe, because not 100% of the customers on our hardware or not an equivalent percentage on our hardware. And then just the other quick one for me and I -- you mentioned on the call, so the similar one quarter lag on subscriptions, just based on the time from installation. There\u2019s -- so there\u2019s a one quarter lag and then the other factor, when you look at hardware, sorry, networked solutions versus our subscription revenue is, you get a very different outcome on a percentage basis something and what you said, right? So if you\u2019re selling a home unit that has lower percentage software content than a commercial unit, on a percentage basis and then in our DC line, the equipment itself is sufficiently expensive, that again, relative to that number, software is the smaller percentage, so mix can really bang the percentages for subscriptions around. I\u2019d actually really enjoy your insights into when we\u2019ll be returning to work-for-home, kidding. Rex, if you want to, one, the jest there is around -- it\u2019s a difficult predictive environment for us in terms of return to work. So what we\u2019re doing, but what I\u2019ll point out is that the growth rate in the overall industry, the just the sheer volume of cars that have entered the market, while workplaces certainly not on a total, on a proportional basis, hasn\u2019t returned to its previous levels, because there\u2019s not as much utilization pressure work. So the only thing I would add is, if you look at our Q4 guide, the assumption that\u2019s built into that is that workplace doesn\u2019t come back in Q4 in a big way, because if you\u2019re looking at all the things that are going on out there, even got updates today, it\u2019s really hard to think that people are going to be back the office by the end of January. Philosophically whenever there\u2019s doubt, we take a conservative stance in how we think about it, because that\u2019s safe. And as Rex said, we\u2019ll bill as much inventory as humanly possible, because right now there\u2019s -- it\u2019s not possible to over bill, it\u2019s just not, especially with our limited scrap risk and obsolescence risk. So we\u2019ll bill as much inventory as possible should things come out on the positive side either that -- via early onset of stimulus money, early retreated COVID, what have you, if we get surprised to the upside, awesome. Are you seeing any shift to more of a push model in the sense that a lot of companies are certainly focused on ESG metrics sustainability, where maybe there\u2019s some offsetting impact where there -- the demand is going up regardless of kind of what the utilization is at the moment. So what that would, I\u2019m sure there\u2019s some of that, frankly, because all companies are turning their attention to making sure that they have the right posture with respect to supporting electric cars much fun transportation, which supports the climate goals will have. What I\u2019ll point out, which I think is significant is that, early buys from a company just moving into electric vehicle charging tend to be small. But I bet you it\u2019s in there, I just can\u2019t quantify it. I don\u2019t, I think, there\u2019s a, it\u2019s hard to call the build ahead, because we\u2019re so close to the waves that hit us anytime, they\u2019re hitting it now. What\u2019s also happening, I\u2019ll point this out as is, there is actually construction happening during COVID, because it\u2019s an opportune time to do construction and remodeling of office space, because it\u2019s unoccupied or lightly occupied. In fact, we\u2019re seeing that being relatively strong on the construction side. So, first of all, I want to thank everyone for the questions and I want to welcome all the new folks that have asked questions that haven\u2019t -- hadn\u2019t participated in our earnings calls interactively before the family really good to have you all, wonderful questions today. And I want to just sum up again, as I said, last quarter\u2019s remarks, I really want to thank the ChargePoint team.
