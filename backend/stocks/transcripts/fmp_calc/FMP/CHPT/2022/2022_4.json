    "content": " This guidance reflects a number of factors benefiting ChargePoint including, first, new customer yields from significant investments in our sales and marketing capacity in North America and Europe in calendar 2021 and going forward this year and a healthy customer rebuy rate, which has continued to 60% or better of our business. One would think we're going to have a meaningful growth rate in ensuing years as well, but there's no way that OpEx is going to keep pace for that because it doesn't mean to."
