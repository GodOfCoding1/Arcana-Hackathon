    "content": " In order to try to get the flow of the business directly stated of where we are, I want to first have Anthony explain occupancy costs and how the September quarter this year compares to the September quarter last year, what were the big differences, because there were adjustments last year which sort of inflated EBITDA in the fourth quarter and there are adjustments this year which sort of deflate our EBITDA in the current September quarter. Those deals were signed last year in the fourth quarter and they will recorded, which reduced occupancy last year by about $800 to $1 million. So basically, last year we reversed an accrual of rents for the full year of our fiscal year 2021 in September, which created $1 million increase in EBITDA essentially based upon that accrual. Because we didn't have signed leases in Vegas, we weren't allowed to approve for the full year as the year was going on until the leases were signed and essentially those rents for the full year, because we had to go back to January 1 of 2022 where about $1 million that fell into the fourth quarter. Payroll went up roughly $2.8 million compared to last year, September quarter. We don't know -- it's an art form to try to figure out what the elasticity of pricing could be in some of these restaurants, but we're at prices that are sort of special when you've been in business 50 years. So the $14 million number of EBITDA that we did this year, that's a big hole."
