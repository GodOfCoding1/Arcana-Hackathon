    "content": " So if I were looking at the quarter, and roughly $4 million last year, $600,000 of that -- and $3 million this year, $600,000 of that decrease, $300,000 was because of the accounting for the rent that we did not have to pay, the reduced rent on our deal with Bryant Park. Please proceed with your question. Please proceed with your question. If we were going to pay somebody $1 million for - on a sale leaseback, if we're going to pay $1 million in rent, we thought we can get $12 million for something that we paid $7.5 million for and still have an operation doing $500,000. Now in Blue Moon, we couldn't buy the real estate, but we've bought an operation that was making $1 million a year to $2.7 million, and we negotiated a 26-year lease, a new 26-year lease with landlord. Obviously, we have great hopes for to the Meadowlands and that would sort of follow this idea of what we did at New York, New York, if the Meadowlands became casino, I'm sure there are eight to 10 restaurants in there, a few bars and that could be a $50 million, $60 million business for us.

The obligation this year for Gallagher's is certainly under $2 million, probably $1.5 million, but we're just in the process, and we don't know if there's going to be cost overruns, but we think Sam and Jennifer, who are the key players along with the local people in Vegas, but the key players here have really gone over those numbers with Linda Clous, who is our facilities manager and overseas construction as well that likelihood is $1.5 million in CapEx."
