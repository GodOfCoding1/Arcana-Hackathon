    "content": " The addition of over 440 high-quality net lease properties to our growing portfolio, the commencement of a record 28 development and Partner Capital Solutions projects for total committed capital of nearly $110 million, the receiving of an upgraded investment grade credit rating of Baa1 and from Moody's Investors Service and positioning our balance sheet to execute in 2023 without the need for additional capital, while raising approximately $1.7 billion including $1.3 billion of equity. Our capital markets activities during 2022 provided us with approximately $1.5 billion of liquidity at year-end, including $557 million of outstanding forward equity, $900 million of availability on the revolver and $29 million of cash on hand. And hence unless you are in middle market or a private equity sponsored retail or who needs capital today via sale leaseback where banks have pulled back and lenders have pulled back on LTVs, rates are obviously extremely elevated, you can find a lender, or last resort in terms of sale leaseback who will be there as a secured creditor with your real estate to help you with your growth. If you look at our disposition we developed for them in the Chicago MSA filing bankruptcy, there will be more -- the carwash space, the childcare space, the urgent care space, the quick lube oil change operators, the experiential entertainment operators, there will be private equity backed companies that have to again either have fixed or variable rate short-term debt where their LTVs and their rates are going to go way up, those loans don't last longer than five years, as we all know."
