Hey, good morning, guys. Hey, good morning, everyone. I think if we're investing capital, and let's call it around 75 basis points unlevered on an accretive basis, and high quality assets, with a later infusion of debt, again, not with the tenure at 2%, and spreads back to 100 with an all-in cost of 3% I think we can get there. But at the same time, maybe it's wishful thinking I would hope in the back half of next year that we'll see a debt market that materializes and truly becomes a market again, that is rent capture that companies are able to obviously raise that capital. Could you talk on the flip side with your retailers who are also going through that rising cost of capital and kind of, bad balance sheets, if any, and just talk a little bit about the watch list where you see going in any particular categories, you become a little bit more concerned about with just what's going on with the overall macroeconomic backdrop in the U.S? Hey, good morning, everyone. Hey, good morning, guys."
