    "content": " On last quarter's call I mentioned our expectation to commence between $50 million and $100 million through our development and PCS platforms this year, and we have now surpassed the low end of that range and our pipeline continues to ramp. At quarter end, our quickly growing retail portfolios surpassed 1,500 properties, a remarkable achievement in terms of our exponential growth in recent years and consisted of 1,510 properties across 47 states, including 186 ground leases, representing 13.5% of total annualized base rents. As mentioned on last quarter's call, we have $300 million of forward starting swaps in place, effectively fixing the base rate for contemplated long-term unsecured debt issuance at 1.7%. I never envisioned if you would have asked me several years ago that we'd be deploying at the midpoint of just that acquisitions $1.5 billion a year at 70-plus percent investment grade, and then putting another $50 million to $100 million in the ground, I would have told you, that's pretty crazy. So let's call it nearly $300 million post settlement of some of the forward at before 331 gives us that medium term visibility into a pipeline, and also into effectively outside of just spreads on the debit side locked in our cost of capital."
