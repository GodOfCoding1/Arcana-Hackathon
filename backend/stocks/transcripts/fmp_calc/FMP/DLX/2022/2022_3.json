    "content": " Deluxe delivered another quarter of strong sales-driven growth, once again reflecting increases in all 4 of our business segments, and we remain on track to deliver a second consecutive year of sales-driven revenue growth. Payments grew third quarter revenue of 5.9% year-over-year to $169.8 million, largely driven by growth in our treasury management business. Excluding the impact from business exits, segment revenue increased 4.9% year-over-year to $66.7 million in the quarter. Promotional Solutions third quarter revenue was $136.1 million, up 9.2%, excluding the impact of business exits. Checks' third quarter revenue increased 6% from last year to $182.4 million as new competitive wins, pricing actions and strong demand for business checks outpaced the broader secular declines within the industry. But you've now seen us and we've said we're going to deliver 2 consecutive years of sales driven or organic revenue growth, and we're very proud of our sales accomplishments, the wins we've had, obviously, with Checks returning to secular declines that will have some impact on our business. You've had many of these wins, and we think that's going to help solidify that business like we've been saying for a long time now that we're very confident we can hold that as a mid-single-digit revenue growth business for the long term at very healthy margins."
