    "content": " Net sales of $1.5 million for the second quarter of 2022 decreased 28.6% compared to sales of $2.1 million in the second quarter of 2021, mainly due to delayed funding related to military projects, utilizing our products, as well as fluctuations in the timing and pace of commercial projects, and the lingering macroeconomic supply chain impact as a result of the COVID-19 impact. The sales cycles for the military are dependent on many factors, including government funding, U.S. Navy award and new ship construction schedules and the timing of vessel maintenance schedules when compared to the 0.9 million of sales in the first quarter of 2022, net military sales declined to $0.5 million in to second quarter of 2022. Sales of our commercial products were approximately $1 million or 65.9% of total net sales for the second quarter of 2022, down 103,000 as compared to the second quarter of 2021. Adjusting gross profit margin for excess and obsolete in-transit and net realizable value inventory reserve and scrap write-offs related to our inventory reduction project contributed to the non-GAAP adjusted gross profit margins of negative 5.1% for the second quarter of 2022, compared to 17.6% in the second quarter of 2021. Operating expenses in the second quarter of 2022 were $2.3 million, compared to $2.6 million in the second quarter of 2021. Net loss was $2.5 million or negative $0.35 per share of common stock for the second quarter of 2022, flat as compared with a net loss of $2.5 million or negative $0.59 per share of common stock in the prior year comparable quarter. Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure, which excludes depreciation and amortization, interest expense, stock based compensation and other non-recurring charges and/or sources of income such as incentive comp was a loss of $2.1 million for the second quarter of 2022, compared with a loss of $2 million in the second quarter of 2021. Our net inventory balance of $7.2 million as of June 30, 2022 decreased from the $7.9 million balance at December 31, 2021 as part of our expense reduction initiatives we have significantly decreased our warehouse space beginning in the third quarter of 2022."
