    "content": " Net sales of $663,000 for the fourth quarter of 2022 decreased 72.4% compared to sales of $2.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2021, driven mainly by a decrease in military sales. When compared to $1.8 million in the third quarter of 2022, sequential net sales were primarily down due to a decrease in commercial product sales. Net sales of our commercial products were $349,000 or 52.7% of total net sales for the fourth quarter of 2022, a decrease as compared to net sales of $1.2 million or 48.6% of total net sales for the fourth quarter of 2021, reflecting our supply chain constraints and the continued long-term impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic due to fluctuations in the timing, pace and size of commercial projects. Gross loss for the fourth quarter of 2022 was $0.2 million compared with gross profit of $0.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2021, a decrease of 200% year-over-year. Sequentially, operating expenses decreased approximately $458,000 from the $2.2 million in the third quarter of 2022, reflecting lower product development and SG&A expense as the company entered its current strategic initiatives. Sequentially, this compares with a net loss of $2.7 million or $0.29 per basic and diluted share of common stock in the third quarter of 2022. Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure, which excludes depreciation and amortization, interest expense, stock-based and other non-recurring charges and/or sources of income such as incentive compensation and impairment charges taken against fixed assets was a loss of $1.8 million for the fourth quarter of 2022 compared with a loss of $2.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2021 and a loss of $2.3 million in the third quarter of 2022. For the full year, net sales were $6 million for 2022 compared with $9.9 million for 2021. This compares with net loss of $7.9 million or $1.73 per basic and diluted share of common stock for 2022, inclusive of non-cash pretax gains of $1.7 million from the forgiveness of our Paycheck Protection Program loan and other income recorded relating to the employee retention tax credit. The excess availability under our credit facilities was $55,000 at the end of the fourth quarter 2022 and $169,000 at the end of the third quarter 2022 and $1.7 million at the end of the fourth quarter 2021. During the fourth quarter of 2022, cash used in operations was $472,000, of which a net loss from operations used $2.3 million of cash but that was offset by a source of cash attributable to working capital of $1.6 million, while cash used in investing activities was $16,000 and the company generated $4.1 million in cash from financing activities."
