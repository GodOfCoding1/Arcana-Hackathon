    "content": " Net sales of $1.8 million for the third quarter of 2022 decreased 35.8% compared to sales of $2.7 million in the third quarter of 2021, mainly due to delayed funding related to military maritime projects utilizing our products, as well as fluctuations in the timing and pace of commercial sales projects and the lingering macroeconomic supply chain impacts as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Sales of our commercial products were approximately $1.3 million or 73% of total net sales for the third quarter of 2022, down $234,000 as compared to third quarter 2021. Adjusting gross profit margins for excess and obsolete inventory in-transit and net realizable value inventory reserve and scrap write-offs related to our inventory reduction project contributed to the non-GAAP adjusted gross margin of 3.2% for third quarter of 2022, compared to a gross profit margin of 17.9% in the third quarter of 2021. Adjusted EBITDA a non-GAAP measure, which excludes depreciation and amortization, interest expense, stock-based compensation and other nonrecurring charges and/or sources of income such as incentive compensation, and the gain on forgiveness of the PPP loan in prior periods was a loss of $2.3 million for the third quarter of 2022 compared with a loss of $1.7 million in the third quarter of 2021. During the third quarter of 2022, cash used in operations was $0.9 million, our net inventory balance of $6.2 million as of September, 30 2022 decreased from $7.9 million balance at December 31, 2021."
