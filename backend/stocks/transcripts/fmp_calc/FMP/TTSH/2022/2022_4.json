    "content": " This conservative approach, combined with increasing inventory costs contributed to the 200 basis point sequential decline in gross margin rates between the third and fourth quarters. Fourth quarter 2022 selling, general and administrative expenses decreased by $2.8 million from 2021. For the full year, selling, general and administrative costs increased $3.8 million due to an $8.2 million increase in wages and benefits, primarily due to higher staffing levels that was partially offset by a $6.5 million decrease in bonuses due to lower annual incentives and sales bonuses. Our adjusted EBITDA margin rate decreased by 60 basis points to 10.2% during the fourth quarter of 2022, largely due to a decrease in gross margin."
