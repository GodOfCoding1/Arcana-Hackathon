    "content": " These statements include expectations and assumptions regarding Heliogen's future operations and financial performance, including implementation of Heliogen's strategic plan and growth initiatives, plans to priorities sales of Heliogen's industrial steam product and installation of commercial scale projects, expectations for scale in Heliogen's concentrated solar thermal technology, discussions with potential customers and commercial contract progress. Together, we have a shared vision for Heliogen's success, and that successful will be built on three pillars: closing sales contracts, installing our first commercial scale projects, and extending our cash runway. In the meantime, we have a dedicated team focused on finding deals with early adopter customers who are open to starting with a single module deployment, which we expect will lead to larger installations once they experience the benefits of Heliogen's cutting-edge technology. And so really, this contract serves as a commercial proof point that Heliogen's long-term strategic goals are attractive to the market in high-growth areas like calcining, which is a process used in processing battery materials and other critical material input."
