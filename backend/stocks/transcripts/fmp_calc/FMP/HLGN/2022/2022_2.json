    "content": " As part of the collaboration between Heliogen and Dimensional Energy, the LOI includes a goal of building a fully integrated sustainable aviation fuel demonstration to produce approximately one barrel per day, both Heliogen and Dimensional expect demonstration project to be a first step to develop a pipeline for approximately 3 million barrels of fuel over the next 10 years. As written, the bill includes a suite of provisions that will make industrial decarbonization more economical by lowering the cost of renewable energy and by providing longer term market certainty for companies like Heliogen that are actively investing in domestic, renewable energy manufacturing and technological development. We expect our revenue to ramp up considerably in the third and fourth quarters as we begin placing orders for additional long lead equipment on our first project for Woodside Energy under the contract, we signed back in March for a five-megawatt electric power demonstration facility in Southern California. And Elon recently said that investing in lithium refining is a license to print money because lithium is so valuable right now because of the electrification transportation and the fact that people need thermal energy for all of these mining operations really makes us perfectly suited for that, because what we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re making thermal energy, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re almost three times more efficient than converting sunlight to electricity."
