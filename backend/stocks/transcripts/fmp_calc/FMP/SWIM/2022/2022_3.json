    "content": " By product line, net sales for in-ground swimming pools increased 22% to $102 million. We generated $59 million of gross profit in Q3, up $8 million or 15% due to an increase in net sales and a $1 million year-over-year decrease in non-cash stock-based compensation expense. Net sales for the first 9 months of fiscal 2022 were $588 million, up about $96 million or 20% year-over-year. By product line, net sales for in-ground pools increased 14% to $326 million. Excluding about $4 million in non-cash stock-based compensation expense, gross profit increased $32 million and gross margin decreased 20 basis points to 34.1%. Adjusted EBITDA was $139 million for the first 9 months of 2022, up 23% from the prior year period, and adjusted EBITDA margin increased 70 basis points to 23.6% from the prior year period. Net cash generated by operating activities was $5 million for the first 9 months ended October 1, 2022 compared to $29 million in the prior year period, with the year-over-year change primarily driven by investments in working capital, mainly inventory to return to normalized lead times, the embedded impact of inflation on inventory, and elevated inventory levels primarily associated with packaged pools. Capital expenditures totaled $12 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2022 compared to $6 million in Q3 last year, driven by the increased investment in fiberglass capacity, most notably the Kingston, Ontario manufacturing facility project. Based on the seasonality of our business and current market conditions, we have issued a revised outlook for full year fiscal 2022 of net sales of about $685 million to $700 million, representing 9% to 11% year-over-year growth. Adjusted EBITDA of about $140 million to $145 million, representing flat to 4% year-over-year growth and capital expenditures of about $40 million to $45 million."
