    "content": " That's after purchase accounting adjustments for the full year of $629 million transaction and integration related expenses of $33 million, and net charges related to the Ukraine conflict of approximately $2.7 billion. That's a very strong number, which was driven by continued strong cash collections and operating performance, as well as sales proceeds from some aircraft that run finance leases that were sold in the quarter, along with the letter of credit proceeds related to our Russian leases. Our EPS guidance for full year 2023 is $7 to $7.50 of adjusted EPS, excluding any gains on sale, as well as other items like recoveries of unsecured claims. If we take a look at our projected income statement for 2023, you can see that we expect to have total revenue of approximately $6.8 billion interest expense around $1.8 billion depreciation of approximately $2.5 billion and leasing expenses, SG&A and other expenses of around $1.2 billion. In terms of funding so we have about $6 billion to $7 billion worth of funding that we would expect to do that that obviously depends on the on getting all these deliveries 79 aircraft during the course of the year, as well as the level of sales that we that we ultimately end up doing."
