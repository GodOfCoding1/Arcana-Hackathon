    "content": " The impact of purchase accounting adjustments, which include lease premium amortization and maintenance rights amortization in the second quarter was $132 million including a reduction to revenue of $105 million and increase in leasing expenses of $27 million. So when you add the $52 million of lease premium amortization, the $53 million of maintenance rights in relation to revenue and the $27 million of amortization running through leasing expenses, you get to the total of $132 million of purchase accounting adjustments that I mentioned on the previous slide."
