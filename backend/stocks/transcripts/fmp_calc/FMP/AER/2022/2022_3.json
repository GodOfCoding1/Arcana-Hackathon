    "content": " The impact of purchase accounting adjustments which include lease premium amortization and maintenance rights amortization was $123 million in the third quarter, including a reduction to revenue of approximately $80 million and an increase in leasing expenses of $43 million. Through the first-three quarters of this year, we've had gains on sale of $108 million and proceeds from unsecured claims of $69 million, so the combined impact of those two items is $176 million year-to-date. So to take an example, let's say, two years ago, we wrote a lease rate, say it was $300,000 is the lease rate, and what we call the adjustment factor per 1% was $30,000, now it will be per basis point but stick with me with 1%. As you've heard me say in the past, I think it would be an error to launch a new airplane now without the engine technology being able to provide any new airframe with the type of operational savings that would persuade an airline to switch out of a very good airplane such as a MAX 8 or an A320neo, both are excellent aircraft. But when I think about the lease rates and also the expenses that you've had so far, just wanted to get a sense of whether the third quarter is a good jumping off point when we think about the fourth quarter especially given the strength you've been discussing in terms of demand for lease of aircraft, so that's first question."
