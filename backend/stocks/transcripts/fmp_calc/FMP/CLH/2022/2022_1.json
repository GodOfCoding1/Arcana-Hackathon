    "content": " Based on our first year -- first quarter results and current market conditions for both our operating segments, we are raising our 2022 adjusted EBITDA guidance to a range of $800 million to $830 million with a midpoint of $815 million. In our corporate segment, at the midpoint of our guidance, we continue to expect a negative adjusted EBITDA to be up around 5% from 2021, largely due to the addition of the -- of a full year of HPC corporate costs and wage inflation, offsetted by a lower severance and integration expense compared with a year ago along with the Vertex payments. Please proceed with your question. Please proceed with your question. Please proceed with your question. And so, I think that's why, to Mike's point, I think we made up a lot of margin from the benefits that we had in first quarter and in a really high-cost inflationary environment that we're operating in, particularly when you look at diesel today at -- on the street being over $6 a gallon. Not -- last year was an anomaly we thought because of COVID and seeing safety now under one is really -- we've been under one before, but I think what was important coming out of the first quarter when you're coming out of the winter season, it's typically when we don't see a safety number like that. Please proceed with your question. Please proceed with your question. If you look at March revenue versus February revenue, it's up $90 million and if you look at March revenue versus prior year, it's up $140 million and both those things kind of put pressure on our -- the AR buckets are all current and as such that is a cash flow bad guy. Please proceed with your question. Please proceed with your question. Please proceed with your question. Please proceed with your question."
