    "content": " Q4 adjusted EBITDA was 29% higher than a year ago, coming in at $224.2 million, which equates to a margin of 17.5% or 190 basis points increase from Q4 of last year. Income from operations in Q4 increased 55% to $127.4 million, driven by healthy revenue growth, combined with our margin improvement in environmental services. For SKSS, we anticipate full year 2023 adjusted EBITDA at the midpoint of our guidance to decrease by approximately 15% from 2022, reflecting recent base oil pricing trends. Based on our 2022 free cash flow results, rising interest rates and latest working capital assumptions, we expect 2023 adjusted free cash flow in the range of $305 million to $345 million, or $325 million at the midpoint. Please proceed with your question. And then just to be clear, the corporate overhead guide is off the $237 million \u00e2\u0080\u0093 3% to 5% growth off the $237 million not normalized, like... We took the actual number, and we assume there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to be some \u00e2\u0080\u0093 the thing when you think of the corporate cost, I think we assume that there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s wage inflation, things like that.
