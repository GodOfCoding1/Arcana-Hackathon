    "content": " Based on our outstanding second quarter results and current market conditions for both operating segments, we are substantially raising our 2022 adjusted EBITDA guidance to a range of $975 million to $1.005 billion with a midpoint of $990 million. Looking at our guidance from a quarterly expected perspective, we expect Q3 adjusted EBITDA to be approximately 50% higher than what we posted in Q3 of 2021 due to HPC's contribution, continued strong demand in the ES segment and increased SKSS segment profitability. Based on our free -- our first half free cash flow results, working capital assumptions and revised adjusted EBITDA guidance, we are also raising our 2022 adjusted free cash flow to a range of $310 million to $350 million or a midpoint of $330 million. I think the bottom line here for us as well is that all of those used motor oil customers are generating other demands for services, whether they're parts washer or their oil filter disposal or it's containerized waste emergency response. What is different about Clean Harbors today versus that operating period, and therefore, give us the market more confidence that this $990 million, while it might have some spread compression on oil in that, maybe that's really $940 million. If you remember, after the Eveready acquisition and a lot of our growth and expansion, going after a lot of the oil sands work and a lot of the fracking work, we were generating close to $150 million in EBITDA on that part of our business. We'll probably generate $25 million in EBITDA in that business now because we've sold a lot of those assets, as you know, and we've really tried to focus on the pure environmental side and the industrial service side of that business."
