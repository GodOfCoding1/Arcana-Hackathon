    "content": " For the full year, we expect revenue to be in the range of $523 million to $526 million, representing approximately 16% to 17% growth over 2022. For the full year, we expect adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $152.5 million to $154.5 million, which is higher than the $151 million to $153 million previously communicated on the Q3 2022 earnings conference call, and represents 15% to 17% growth over 2022. Beyond 2023, we maintain our annual revenue growth expectations of 15% or greater, and we continue to expect adjusted EBITDA dollar growth of 15% to 25%, as we invest in the business to capitalize on market dynamics and support current and future growth. If you were to look at '22 and '23 and sort of add it together, you're going to get more of a normalized EBITDA growth rate, probably more in the midpoint, but that's why you saw a lot more the higher end in '22 and closer to the lower end -- our expectation is sort of that 15% to 17% in 2023. Specific to '23, because we're -- the EBITDA expectation is sort of that 15% to 17% and our revenue expectation is 16% to 17%, that's why you're not seeing an improvement in margin in '23. '22 you certainly got, obviously -- you've seen margin expansion in prior years and there will be years in the future where you would expect to see that as well on our path to 35% overall adjusted EBITDA margin."
