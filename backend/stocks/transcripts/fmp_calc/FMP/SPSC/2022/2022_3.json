    "content": " Revenue was $114.5 million, a 17% increase over Q3 of last year, and represented our 87th consecutive quarter of revenue growth. For the quarter, adjusted EBITDA grew 31% to $34.7 million compared to $26.5 million in Q3 of last year. For the fourth quarter of 2022, we expect revenue to be in the range of $120 million to $121 million, which represents approximately 17% to 18% year-over-year growth. For the year, we expect revenue to be in the range of $448.9 million to $449.9 million representing approximately 17% growth over 2021. We expect adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $130.1 million to $130.8 million, representing approximately 22% growth over 2021. But for modeling purposes, we expect to deliver approximately $151 million to $153 million in annual adjusted EBITDA in 2023 or approximately 15% to 17% year-over-year growth. It -- we're seeing different things in the supply chain, not surprising that shipping rates are coming down as there's -- it's been well-documented excess inventory at retailers, which that seems to be correcting, but obviously, that pushes back to suppliers and the suppliers' suppliers still have excess inventory. But again, the great thing for us being truly omnichannel is it's just going one place instead of another at SPS Commerce, whereas I think when you look at the competitive landscape, that is our -- one of our competitive advantages is that we are one of the -- we are really what we believe is the true omnichannel solution for suppliers and retailers. So excluding the GCommerce, then it's 400 customers acquired organically, which I think is a bit lower in the year, a lot of -- quite a bit lower than the year-ago period and what you have been trending at."
