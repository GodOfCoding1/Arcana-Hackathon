    "content": " I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m pleased to report that we had another strong quarter, despite broad macroeconomic headwinds with sales growth of 10%, core operating margin of 18.4% and core diluted earnings per share of $0.63. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re pleased to report second quarter sales of $2.2 billion, up 10% versus prior year. Implantable sales were $444 million in the quarter, up 21% year-over-year, primarily due to market recovery, the strength of Vivity and sales of Hydrus, which is not part of our portfolio last year. In equipment and other, our sales were up 10% year-over-year to $208 million in the second quarter, primarily due to strong reception of our suite of cataract equipment. So, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll give further guidance and better color on \u00e2\u0080\u009823, obviously, later in the year, but my expectation is that as we get through these difficult comparators, things will begin to normalize around what we have historically seen as a, kind of 4% or 5% growth rate for the markets and then us growing hopefully a little bit faster than that. And it is my own view that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll see a steady, slightly warmer than historical rates for the market in cataract surgery, both internationally and in the U.S. And then, globally, you made a comment, and if I look back last quarter, I think you guys were at 60% share, PCIOL share globally last quarter went down to 55%."
