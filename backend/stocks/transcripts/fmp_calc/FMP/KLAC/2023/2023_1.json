    "content": " At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the KLA Corporation September Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call and Webcast. Today's discussion is presented on a non-GAAP financial basis, unless otherwise specified. Our CEO, Rick Wallace, will begin the call with some brief quarterly comments and highlights before discussing the semiconductor industry demand environment, including our business in China. I'll spend some time sharing highlights of KLA's performance in the quarter, touch on our business in China and provide a brief perspective on the overall semiconductor demand environment. Before we get into details, I'd like to first acknowledge our global KLA teams who have continued to demonstrate perseverance in navigating dynamic challenges to deliver for our customers. Specifically for this quarter, record revenue of $2.7 billion was at the top of the guidance range, growing 31% on a year-over-year basis and 10% sequentially. As drivers for semiconductor demand continue to diversify beyond traditional PC and consumer facing markets, process control is considered critical in enabling customers to execute on node and technology transitions. As this demand backdrop continues to evolve, our KLA operating model ensures focus on delivering for our customers, navigating supply chain challenges and continued investment in R&D. First, KLA continues to deliver strong relative outperformance versus peers and is positioned to be one of the fastest-growing Tier 1 WFE equipment suppliers in calendar 2022, substantially outperforming expected overall WFE market growth. Second, our patterning systems revenue grew 49% sequentially and 67% on a year-over-year basis. Third, KLA delivered strong quarterly revenue in our SPTS segment. KLA has intensified efforts in advanced packaging and automotive electronics, leveraging the combined portfolios of both, the semiconductor process control and EPC groups. Fourth, the KLA Services business grew to $529 million in the September quarter, up 16% year-over-year. Finally, operating cash flow topped $1 billion for the first time, and we generated quarterly free cash flow of $927 million and free cash flow margin of 34% for the 12 months ended September 30, 2022, total free cash flow grew from 37% to $3.14 billion. Total capital returns in the quarter were $278 million, comprising $90 million in share repurchases and $188 million in dividends paid. Early in October, the US government issued new regulations to control aspects of the US semiconductor industry trade with China. Specific to KLA, a meaningful amount of our business in China is focused on legacy node investment, which is not the focus of the recent export restrictions. However, our system and service revenue will be adversely impacted going forward as we are unable to provide systems and support to certain customers for certain end uses. As we look at the industry demand environment, growth for the semiconductor industry has evolved to be more strategic with more diverse end market mix. As a result, semiconductor customers are adjusting CY 2023 CapEx budgets lower with the largest impact to date coming from memory customers. However, long-term growth for the semiconductor equipment industry continues due to the prioritization of R&D investment at the leading edge, continued investment in legacy nodes and growth in enabling technologies such as advanced packaging. Considering all factors, KLA's long-term targets announced at our Investor Day in June remain intact. In summary, KLA September quarter's results demonstrate sustainable outperformance and highlight the critical nature of KLA's products and services. Our teams continue to navigate and execute against dynamic challenges, and KLA remains well positioned with a comprehensive portfolio to meet evolving customer requirements. The KLA operating model and our strategic objectives are the foundation for our sustained technology leadership, wide competitive moat, leading financial performance, strong free cash flow generation, and consistent returns to shareholders. As you heard from Rick, KLA's September quarter results were strong, better than expected and demonstrated our consistent successful execution. While supply chain challenges continue in certain areas and are still limiting output, we have seen marginal improvement as new supplier capacity has come online to meet our requirements. Our continued focus on meeting customer needs, while expanding market leadership, growing revenue, sustaining industry-leading growth and operating margins, generating strong free cash flow and maintaining our long-term strategy of asserted capital allocation is what makes us successful. Quarterly revenue was $2.724 billion, at the top of the guided range of $2.475 billion to $2.725 billion. Non-GAAP gross margin was 40 basis points, above the midpoint of guidance at 63.4% at semiconductor process control systems, which carry stronger gross margins delivered virtually all the revenue upside from the guidance midpoint. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $526 million, slightly below our expectation of $530 million for the quarter. And free cash flow was $927 million, resulting in a free cash flow conversion of 92% and a free cash flow margin of 34%. Switching to the balance sheet, KLA ended the quarter with almost $3 billion in total cash, debt of $6.3 billion and a flexible and attractive bond maturity profile supported by strong investment-grade ratings from all three agencies. Over the last 12 months, KLA has returned $5.2 billion to shareholders, including $4.6 billion in share repurchases and $664 million in dividends paid with total capital returns amounting to 166% of free cash flow. Based on the midpoint of our December quarter guidance, KLA is positioned for mid-28% revenue growth for the total company in calendar 2022, with semiconductor process control systems growing several points faster than the company average. Furthermore, this business is expected to significantly outperform the overall WFE industry growth, which is currently projected to be up mid-to high single digits to the low $90 billion range. Though early, we are planning our business based on the expectation of CY 2023 WFE declining approximately 20% based on increasing global macroeconomic concerns and recent public statements from several customers, particularly in memory, and the impact of the new US government regulations on native China investment. In memory, we expect WFE investment to decline by more than the market as memory customers respond to lower consumer demand by cutting production and factory utilizations to bring device supply in line with demand. This estimate is before any potential system reallocation for products where supply is meaningfully below current demand, which has resulted in significant lead time to other customers. Given our backlog and forecast, we expect that we will be able to reallocate certain tools to other customers as we move through next year. KLA's unique broad portfolio differentiation and primary value proposition is focused on enabling technology transitions, which our customers continue to invest in regardless of business environment. In this environment, we will continue to focus on meeting customer requirements, maintaining a high level of investment in R&D to advance our product road maps and KLA's market leadership and delivering strong relative revenue growth and financial performance. Total revenue is expected to be in the range of $2.8 billion, plus or minus $150 million. Foundry logic is forecasted to be approximately 76%, and memory is expected to be around 24% of semi PC systems revenue. We forecast non-GAAP gross margin to be in the range of 61.5% to 63.5%, due primarily to expected product and segment mix. Looking ahead, KLA will continue to balance investments in technology and infrastructure to support our long-term growth objectives with the expectation of a softening near-term outlook. As a result, operating expenses will grow to approximately $550 million in the December quarter, with growth in quarterly operating expenses expected to flatten out as we move through calendar 2023. In conclusion, although the CY 2023 outlook for WFE demand has softened, we remain confident that the secular trends driving long-term semiconductor industry demand and investments in WFE are durable and compelling. Broad-based customer demand, the increasing strategic role semiconductors are playing an influencing national industrial policy, and simultaneous investments supporting growing semiconductor content across technology nodes remain important trends. These are long-term secular growth drivers for the industry as technology investment and node transitions reflect the value that semiconductors in our industry have in lowering costs for our customers, and enabling a broader application universe for semiconductor-based technology across multiple end markets. For KLA, considering our strong track record of execution and the power of our portfolio strategy, we have confidence in our ability to continue to deliver sustainable relative outperformance. These factors, combined with the KLA operating model that guides our execution, positions us to continue to deliver strong relative performance as we execute our strategic objectives. They are also the foundation of our sustained technology leadership, wide competitive moat, industry leading financial performance, history of robust free cash flow generation and consistent and growing capital returns to shareholders. Your line is now open. As you mentioned, the team has been outperforming WFE and process control spending growth for the last few years. I mean, it looks like given your December quarter guidance, your process control systems business is going to be up 30% to 35% when WFE is only up high single digits. I know in the last downturn, 2019, not as severe, but as potentially 2023 is, but you guys actually grew your process control and services revenues when WFE was down back then. So I think the way to think about KLA performance is typically, historically, most of the volatility we've seen in WFE has been in the memory space. So as they pull back on their capacity investments, they continue to invest in technology, and so there's a certain amount of business that -- with KLA that continues to happen almost irrespective of their revenue levels. And so while they're pulling back on CapEx investments, they still tend to run the installed bases pretty heavily. As we look at next year, I think that there will be continued demand there as you see the \u00e2\u0080\u0093 start to see more investment in the 3-nanometer node. There's also some investment in infrastructure that's happening in some of the legacy mask inspection and new infrastructure that's being built in China to support the legacy reticles, and so there's also an aspect of investment that's happening there as well. So I would expect it to have another good year this year, our strong year in 2022, but also a strong year 2023 as well. And one other thing, Harlan that I think that -- one of the things that contributed to our strength is share gain due to new capabilities on our products. Your line is open. I would say it's less than -- if our systems business in China and semi PC is somewhere between 20% and 25%, I would expect the service stream is less, because it's less developed. It's newer in terms of the investment that's happened, and so it would be lower than as a mix of service revenue, that is a mix of consistent revenue. I think it will be below the -- in that WFE environment, it'd be below what our long-term growth rate target of 12% to 14%. Krish, when we set the 2026 plan at our Investor Day, we didn't know when, but we anticipated there'd be this digestion period of WFE just based on the historic growth, so we're still modeling the targets that we set out for 2026. And we didn't know when, but it seems like it's coming in 2023, and we weren't sure if it was 2023 or 2024, but it was going to be in that period. And so they'll be going into services as we move forward, and so we feel pretty good about where we are relative to the long-term services plan. Your line is open. I guess first question, I was hoping you could speak to changes in backlog over the last three months, how you're incorporating the changes around domestic China embargo. It's still fairly fluid, and we're working through our own assessment of the new regulations and engaging with the government about how to think about certain situations there. So I think from a lead time point of view, it's been a very cross certain products. So we have certain products that are high-end sort of technology-enabling products like broadband plasma inspection, our retinal inspection tools, our Voyager laser scanning system, SD7-SeRscan products. I think certainly, we're still constrained today in a lot of areas, and I would expect that we'll see that continue for a little while. But I think as we move through '23, we'll get up with a little bit more flexibility and more normalization on certain more capacity-centric product. As a quick follow-up, I think you talked about $100 million of gross risk related to the China impact for December. So I think that as we move into next year, we'll \u00e2\u0080\u0093 I think we'll be able to reallocate more, including some of what we expected here. Your line is open. Yeah, It's I think it's de-risked. But as we looked at what we have in backlog and we looked at what we expect to book over the course of 2023 for the affected customers, we were able to go tool by tool to come up with the range that I provided. Again, we're at a very preliminary stage in terms of working through the regulations and also engaging with customers. There's the possibility that, that we're able to get some of that back as we move forward, but we'll have to see how that plays out. And so I think we feel pretty good about the range given where we are, the range we provided. But as people look forward and especially this topic of WFE intensity, in the last two years, it grows about 15% to 16%. And actually, that's the one that I think is the one that we've been spending a lot of time thinking about. And I think part of why it went back up was that scaling resumed, and scaling has resumed both in what we've seen in logic/foundry but also in memory. So I do think it is going to trend slightly higher than it was, and that it will be in 2019 or 2023, but it will go back up. Whether it goes all the way back up, it's not exactly clear, but I do think there's going to be pressure on that for people, everybody that's trying to move forward in technology. And the one thing that we know will happen during 2023 even if there's a slowdown in capacity, there won't be a slowdown in technology advancement because everybody knows the way you get out of a downturn is by having newer products. But I think there's some improvement in capital intensity, and then we're on the strong belief that process control intensity will hold on to some of the gains that we've made and potentially build on them as we bring new products in. Fundamental to our thesis was that we would see semiconductor revenue grow, and WFE would grow slightly faster. So you'd have a flat to up trend line in WFE intensity that would be faster than semiconductor revenue, predicated on the things that Rick talked about, but also that a lot of the dynamics in the industry that drove significant efficiency in WFE have been worked out of the system. And so I think that there's -- we think the long-term assumption that's there is, I think, a fairly straight down the middle assumption in terms of how we think about long-term. When you look at the regionalization efforts and you think about new fabs around the world, they will tend to be slightly less efficient, which will drive up the efficiency, and those numbers are not really in anything in calendar 2023. Your line is open. You guys have talked about seeing the logic restrictions coming, I think, before, and I heard from anyone else. I think from the standpoint, I think what you meant is that we see the memory restrictions coming, right, because we talked about the logic ones. When I talk to customers about their plans in China, I think a lot of what they're doing is trying to figure out what are the implications of those extensions and what's the long-term viability. So, I would say that it's a much better question to ask them than us. And ultimately from our standpoint, frankly, it doesn't matter that much because if they choose not to invest there, what they're doing is investing to support demand and they'll move that investment to where they could do it. So, I think from our standpoint, a lot of the \u00e2\u0080\u0093 now that this has happened, we're in a much better position to not speculate, but support as we move forward. Your line is open. Last quarter, you had talked about productivity, your manufacturing staying relatively similar rates in the second half into the first half of next year. Look, we -- as you see in the guidance, right, we have another step-up in output expectations out of the factories and are still driving to deliver into the first part of the year. I mean, certainly, there's been some customer churn that we've seen. So, I think we'll have to see how it plays out, but we start to see some rescheduling as we move into '23. I think those are still questions out there, given just the dynamics we're seeing on the macro front and what we're hearing from customers. But for now, I think our view on the first part is somewhat consistent with what I've said in the past. Well, it really goes back to the -- it's a good question, and we had contemplated a rationalization of WFE in support of the overall industry. So that's really how I think about that is that, ultimately, there \u00e2\u0080\u0093 most of our customers end up having pretty strict investment forecast based on their belief of the capital intensity that they can afford. But eventually, it was going to get rationalized and then we go back to believe in the semiconductor industry growth. As I mentioned, there will be some investment that when you look at some of this regionalization that hasn't happened yet that would have been upside to that plan and now I think you end up it kind of all blends together. So if you believe the semiconductor growth, I don't think capital intensity goes down, and we feel pretty good about process control and our share, that's supportive of the numbers that we laid out. I think that's one where certainly we're feeling pressure this year, and we expect to see more volatility in that part of the business given its proximity to consumers. Your line is open. I think it will be up modestly quarter-to-quarter, but the bulk of the revenue increase will come from semi PC. So I think in terms of gross margin in the September quarter, it was most of the upside, and I think we did better overall in semi PC than we expected, and EPC was a little bit weaker on the margin than we thought going into the quarter. I think as we look at December, again, it will come back to mix dynamics in terms of how we model the business. We're kind of operating in line with the long-term range that I've talked about is somewhere between 63%, plus or minus, 50 basis points or so, and we've been operating fairly consistent with that if you look at the broader picture of calendar 2022. And as we move into 2023 and we see some of that, it could create a little bit of inventory exposure from an excess inventory point of view. In prior down cycles, KLA usually outperformed initially because customers want to improve yields, maybe continue to invest in R&D. But essentially, the downturn -- eventually, the downturn would catch up after several quarters, maybe just memory get CapEx at tax first and then time foundry/logic comes later. And there has -- the rescheduling that there's been, I'll call it, churn in our backlog management, but backlog grew quarter-to-quarter. So I think to your other point, look, it depends on how long these soft periods last in terms of how customers ultimately adjust and then what are the demand drivers as they come out of it. But as I said before, we're much more levered to our customers' technology road maps than the increment of capacity. We're certainly doing much better in capacity investment than we used to do, particularly around some of the issues we talked about at Investor Day due to higher design starts and less reuse and so on. But at the end of the day, the biggest part of KLA's business is exposed to development and ramping up production. So as long as technology road maps hold together, we feel pretty good about how we're positioned. I mean, at Investor Day, we talked more about our exposure, as Bren said, and the ability we have to scale when there's capacity. I think the other thing that's changed, particularly with EUV is we're actually more an enabling technology now. And now with some of our products, particularly in BBP and then Rapid, those are the tools that our customers have repeatedly said, no matter what happens in this downturn, keep us on your list. So I think that we've broadened from being primarily a company associated with ramping yields to one of enabling technology, particularly around EUV and then in capacity. So I think we have better exposure, which is why we feel pretty good about how our products are holding up and the fact that we are getting very clear signals from customers that are saying, we understand we're slowing overall, but please do not take us out of the list. Your line is now open. And I ask because 2023 is going to be kind of a weird year because there's about $4 billion to $5 billion worth of deferred WFE just from two of your peers that should have been WFE this year but really is going to become WFE next year, and that sort of optically creates maybe like a little bit of a headwind for your WFE share. It seems like $6 billion is a pretty reasonable bogey, but I'm wondering if you like that number or not. Also, I think feeling very good about the actual market share within process control and the, we think, some tailwinds there as well. So I think against the backdrop that you're talking about, if you're thinking WFE somewhere in the $75 billion-ish range or so, the kinds of numbers are reasonable that you're mentioning. But I'll have the ability, I think, to provide a little bit more clarity around how we see that as we move into guidance for 2023 in January. And if you take -- the China restrictions are taking like between $7 billion and $9 billion out of WFE for next year, maybe some of that gets replaced somewhere else. I mean I don't want a number, but just the idea that you should take some sort of a handicap toward the WFE is the dollars because the productivity of those dollars is not equivalent to dollars being spent beyond China. No, I think that's true. But it's interesting because that investment didn't really utilize EUV, so that wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t particularly capital-intensive investment on a relative basis. So I think over time, there is going to be more pressure on everybody that stays on the technology road maps to invest in technology that leverages, frankly, more to KLA, whether it's in logic, foundry or memory. So I think, sure, the capital intensity was probably running a bit hot because of that, but that's going to get reset. So I don't think we go back into where we were, but I don't think we go all the way down either. I think it's somewhere in between, and that's how we modeled our 2026 plan. Yeah, I would say it's more efficient today than it was in 2016 when we saw all this escalation in investment. So there is a little bit more maturation there than what we have, let's say, five, six years ago. So I think when you look at that, there is that question about how much of that is real demand versus more strategic investment. And so I think that that's -- there is some adjustment factor there, but it's probably a little bit different than what you might have thought five years ago or so. As you think about process control intensity, typically in legacy nodes, we tend to then do fairly well as facilities are starting up. But process control intensity in the trailing edge, unless they're there are big drivers of some major change, doesn't really -- isn't really as high as it is at the leading edge. So when you think about foundry, logic, process control intensity at the trailing edge, it's more like memory, maybe a little bit better than that in China, but it isn't like a leading-edge investment would provide. Your line is open. Bren, on the China impact, in calendar 2023, which you sized that $600 million to $900 million, I think that was a gross number. I think it's too early to tell, Toshiya. I think as we move forward, there are certain products that we will be able to repurpose fairly easily, and there are other ones that might be a little bit more difficult depending that they're back to the capacity versus technology discussion we had earlier. But the way I thought about it was, as I said earlier, I looked at the backlog and I looked at our forecast in terms of expectation and timing of revenue and added up what we -- absent new regulations, what -- how much revenue we would have, and that drove the range that I provided. And then we'll have to see also, as I said earlier, how as we progress here moving forward, what is truly out and what is and as we start to work our way through and engage with customers and get a clearer picture from the government as we go through. So I think that's the best way I can size it right now is that impact, and I would expect for more higher end products where the times are extended that we'll be able to reallocate some of those tools. I think it's fair to say that the WFE outlook has deteriorated over the past three months or so given memory weakness and the export controls, your business is going to be a lot more resilient than the overall market. But just given how the trajectory has potentially changed from a revenue perspective, I'm sure you're thinking through and revisiting your footprint into 2023. I think you talked about on a quarterly basis, things moderating into Q1. So as we get a clearer picture on what the revenue profile looks like for 2023, we'll have a better level of sort of quarter-to-quarter guidance. We've invested a lot over the last couple of years to support the revenue growth and to continue to invest in driving innovation and differentiation, which is so critical to KLA's go-to-market, and so we've made those investments. But also, ensuring that we have the right products to meet our customers' road map requirements over the next few years is really critical. We'll have a merit cycle, so we'll have to work through all of that as well, but my expectation right now is that you'll -- we're tapping the breaks and you'll see it flatten out. Your line is now open. But I can just say for KLA systems, given the nature of our tools and the maintenance that's required to support them and the supply chain, which is fairly custom, the ability to do maintenance is important to keeping the tools up and performing as designed and spec. I want to say it's about $700 million or so this year in 2022 in terms of what we'll call kind of auto exposure from a revenue point of view, and we would expect to see that grow over time. And we're engaging at levels with our customers that are driving a different way of thinking about process control, given the reliability requirements in auto and the margin structure, the cost of defectivity, the cost of recall and so on."
