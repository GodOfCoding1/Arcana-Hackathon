    "content": " Looking ahead to calendar 2023, we expect industry spending to slow with the continued expectation for CY 2023 WFE demand to be down approximately 20% in the year, down from approximately $94 billion to $95 billion in CY 2022, due to increasing global macroeconomic concerns highlighted by our customers in most end markets and widely reported customer CapEx expectations. In this industry environment, we will continue to focus on meeting customer requirements, maintaining a high level of investment in R&D to advance our product road maps and KLA's market leadership and align our operating structure with topline expectations, which we expect to be in line or better on a relative basis, while delivering strong relative financial performance. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. So, when I look at the overall, inclusive for KLA, inclusive of what we expect in export restriction, which hasn't changed from what we talked about a quarter ago, I think overall, we'll see our business in China likely decline less than the overall WFE. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open."
