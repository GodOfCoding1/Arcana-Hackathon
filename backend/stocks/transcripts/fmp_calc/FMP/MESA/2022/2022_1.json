Well, when I think about -- I think, in my prepared remarks, we talked about $3.3 million in the quarter for additional pilot training and recruiting costs. Go ahead please, your line is open. Go ahead please, your line is open. Go ahead please, your line is open. So it's very easy for us to say, without any of the other COVID-related problems, like the delay in our SIMs  and all the other things that happened, we could easily identify $9 million of COVID-related expenses or -- excuse me, loss of revenue in this quarter that we feel pretty easily we can identify. Go ahead please, your line is open. It's going to take us some time to dig our way out, but I think it's fair to say that, besides the structural problem that exists within the industry in terms of pilots, that we are hopeful that Washington will address before it's too late, I mean I think there's -- I think it's very fair to say that in terms of what's happening at Mesa and our partners at United, American and DHL, there is no structural issue there that would cause, at least from my perspective, any concern."
