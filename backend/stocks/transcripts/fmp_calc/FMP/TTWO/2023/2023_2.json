    "content": " We made excellent progress with our integration of Zynga, and we remain highly optimistic about the vast long-term growth potential for the mobile industry, which is expected to reach over $160 billion in gross bookings within the next four years. Zynga's President, Frank Gibeau and his leadership team have evaluated our mobile portfolio, including existing games and titles in development, and they've identified numerous opportunities to enhance our performance. o Zynga unveiled several high-profile brand integrations, including Socialpoint\u00e2\u0080\u0099s partnership with AMC Network\u00e2\u0080\u0099s The Walking Dead in Dragon City and Monster Legends; CSR2\u00e2\u0080\u0099s debut of Pagani\u00e2\u0080\u0099s new multi-million-dollar Utopia hypercar; and Game of Thrones Slots Casino launched a new ingame event, Week of the Dragon, in conjunction with HBO\u00e2\u0080\u0099s new hit fantasy series, House of the Dragon. Operating expenses increased by 144% to $932 million, primarily driven by the addition of Zynga; and business acquisition and higher personnel costs; which was partly offset by lower console and PC marketing expenses. So in terms of the legacy Take-Two mobile business versus the Zynga business, I wouldn't necessarily -- I mean, again, we don't really disclose that so I don't think there's any really way try to see that behavior."
