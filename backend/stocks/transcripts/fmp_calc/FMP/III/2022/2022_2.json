    "content": " Taking the current strong demand environment and balancing it with the potential impact of broader macroeconomic factors for the third quarter, we are targeting revenues of between $71 million and $73 million including a negative FX impact of approximately 400 basis points and adjusted EBITDA between $10 million and $11 million. Revenues for the second quarter were $70.7 million, up slightly on a reported basis and up 5% on a constant currency basis compared with the second quarter last year. Second quarter adjusted net income was $6.8 million or $0.13 per share on a fully diluted basis, compared with adjusted net income of $6.3 million or $0.12 per share diluted in the prior year's second quarter. Last year, you ended this quarter at $31.5 million; you're looking potentially for acquisitions, still returning cash, just kind of walk us through how you see where, what kind of cash levels you really be comfortable with?"
