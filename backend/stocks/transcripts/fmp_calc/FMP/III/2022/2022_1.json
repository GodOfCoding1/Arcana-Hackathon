We continue to expand our recurring revenues reaching a record $26 million, up 13% over last year, driven by our subscription governance and research businesses and on our way to our year-end goal of $100 million. And with a focus on delivering end-to-end solutions via our ISG iFlex global delivery model, our utilization for the first quarter was 79%, up 320 basis points compared with the first quarter last year. This region had a record-setting Q1 performance with revenues of $7.7 million, up 34% versus the prior year, driven by growth in our insurance, media, public sector and health sciences industry verticals. Revenues for the first quarter were a record $72.6 million, up 9% on a reported basis and up 12% on a constant currency basis compared with the first quarter last year. First quarter 2022 adjusted EBITDA was a record $10.6 million, up 23% from last year's resulting in an EBITDA margin of 15%, up over 165 basis points as compared with the prior year's first quarter. Consulting utilization for the first quarter was a record 79%, up 320 basis points versus the prior year, reflecting the impact of our ISG NEXT operating model. You saw that our operating income was a bit over 10% as a percentage of revenues, which was up almost 300 basis points versus last year's first quarter. And the outstanding utilization rate that we were able to deliver in the first quarter of 79%, while we don't know that that's necessarily sustainable, we've been very steady in the mid-70s versus maybe 10 -- or 1,000 basis points lower pre-pandemic."
