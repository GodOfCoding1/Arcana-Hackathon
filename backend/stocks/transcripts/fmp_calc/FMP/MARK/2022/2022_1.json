    "content": " That first quarter 2022 revenue was driven by a $0.6 million increase in China revenue with the total revenue of China, including $2.2 million from projects in the construction industry and $2.2 million from projects in the education sector, plus an additional $0.2 million from deployments of our smart retail systems in cities that were less affected by the ongoing lockdown. The loss on investment of $19.1 million, which consisted primarily of the change in the fair value of our investment in the common stock of Sharecare, Inc. was almost entirely responsible for the large net loss in the first quarter of 2022."
