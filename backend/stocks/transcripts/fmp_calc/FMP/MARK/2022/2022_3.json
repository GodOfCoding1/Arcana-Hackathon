    "content": " Our other highlights in the third quarter for China, despite the stringent zero COVID policy, they include Remark AI Smart Campus solutions, which were deployed at more than 70 campuses in China, bringing our total installations to more than 530 campuses, and now we cover in excess over 1 million students. In the Smart Construction industry, we have now completed an initial 60 site installation project -- and compared to the previous quarter -- and we've now also completed an additional 19 installations -- I'm sorry, building -- we completed in the 19 installations during the third quarter on top of what we initially have done. Revenue contributed by our U.S. business decreased primarily due to a $0.2 million decrease in advertising business related to a daily fantasy sports project in the prior year's third quarter, which did not repeat in the current year. Gross profit of $0.4 million remained essentially unchanged in the third quarter of 2022 compared to the prior year's third quarter, though such amount represent a gross profit percentage of 12.6% in the current year quarter compared to 30.8% in the same period of last year. Of those increases in our operating expenses, the largest during the third quarter was a $2.3 million recognition of bad debt expense as we increased our provision for bad debt related to accounts receivable from certain China customers. The prior year third quarter included a $78.9 million gain on the revaluation of the company's investment in common stock of Sharecare, Inc., and the value of such assets has declined significantly since the prior year due to macroeconomic and stock market conditions."
