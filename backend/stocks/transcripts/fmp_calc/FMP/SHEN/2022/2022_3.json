    "content": " Our government relations team continued its progress in securing new Glo Fiber franchises and government grant agreements, bringing our total franchise and grant award passing to $457,000 or 95% of our 2026 target fiber passings. Broadband revenue grew 7.7% to $62.4 million, driven by an increase of 8.7% in residential and SMB revenue due primarily to 127.6% increase in Glo Fiber data RGUs and a 3.8% increase in incumbent cable data RGUs. Commercial fiber revenue grew 5.1% over the same period last year to $9.5 million, due primarily to growth in circuits. We expect to incur a $1.5 million gain on the sale of the spectrum, $400,000 in transaction fees that we accrued in the third quarter, $1.4 million in estimated restructuring charges related to the termination of Beam operations, and $5.8 million in accelerated depreciation related to the remaining Beam network assets in the quarter, we cease operations. On Slide 9, Tower segment revenues grew $300,000 to $4.7 million in the third quarter, due primarily to an 11% increase in the average revenue per tenant. Consolidated revenue grew 7.5% to $66.9 million in the third quarter, due to growth in Broadband and Tower revenue increases of 7.7% and 5.1%, respectively. Broadband data average revenue per user declined about 1% year-over-year to $72.75, as we rolled out a lower speed tier targeting more price sensitive customers. Although the cost per pass is higher than our Glo Fiber underwriting practices, we do expect the penetration rate to be approximately 65% as we will be the only broadband provider in these markets."
