    "content": " We believe the completion of this project provides a significant unlock for our company, because it doubles our capacity and puts us in a position to support over $650 million in annual revenue from eggs today in service of our primary goal to further grow Vital Farms household penetration across the United States. As Russell mentioned, we had a record quarter with net revenue of $92 million, an increase of 42.4% compared to the prior year period. The growth in net revenue in the third quarter was due to continued growth in egg related sales driven by strong volume increases at our customers, as well as distribution gains at both new and existing retail partners. One moment for our next question. One moment for our next question. One moment for our next question. One moment for our next question. On the flip side, what we saw back in 2016 is that, when Avian influenza starts to hit those big mega farms like we saw last week in Iowa with 1 million bird farm being affected, it starts to affect supply on the shelf and I have read a lot recently about continued kind of low service levels or low fill rates on retail shelves as being a reason why we continue to see strong price increases, strong pricing. One moment for our next question."
