    "content": " We believe the completion of this project provides a significant unlock for our company because it doubles our capacity and puts us in a position to support over $650 million in annual revenue on eggs today, in service of our goal to further grow Vital Farms household penetration across the United States. But as you think about that new category that you are going after and you have identified without \u00e2\u0080\u0093 any way to renationalize  kind of the timing of when you think that would actually become a commercial product and be on shelf and especially over the course of the next 12 months to 18 months, kind of any rough sense at this juncture capital costs, incremental operating costs needed to get that business off the ground. And then going back to the core egg business, I think in the prepared remarks, you alluded to kind of pretty steady gain the kind of low-30% gains in household penetration over the last 2 years, 3 years."
