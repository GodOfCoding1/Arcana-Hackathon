    "content": " Channel inventory decreased by $8.4 million in the quarter, although stronger shipments to resellers in September allowed us to begin rebuilding channel inventory, partially offsetting the decreases that occurred in July and August. As shown on Slide 6, our steadily improving sales run rates in August and September allowed us to reduce excess past due orders by $11.1 million in the quarter. With the improvements we realized within the quarter, we believe we're now better positioned to convert more of the demand we've seen into sales as supply chain conditions continue to improve and as we continue to execute operationally. Holley delivered net sales of $154.8 million in the third quarter, a 3.1% decrease from $159.7 million in the third quarter of 2021. The remaining comparable sales decreased by $12.6 million or 7.9% compared to the prior year quarter, offsetting the impact from the acquisitions. The issues we have discussed, which include supply chain challenges that disrupted sales and cost operational inefficiencies, elevated warranty expense and higher shipping expenses were the core headwinds to our EBITDA performance during the quarter. As supply chain pressures eased during the quarter, we saw sequential improvement in our production levels, which in turn drove higher sales and earnings."
