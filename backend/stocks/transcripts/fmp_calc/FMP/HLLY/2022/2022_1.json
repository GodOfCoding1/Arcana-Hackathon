    "content": " Sales, excluding the impact of acquisitions, which we refer to as organic sales, increased by $21.6 million, contributing 13.5% of year-over-year growth, whereas sales associated with acquisitions contributed $18.1 million or 11.3% of year-over-year net sales growth. During the first quarter, sales associated with our nine recent acquisitions contributed $18.1 million or 11.3% of year-over-year growth, further highlighting the strength of our platform and the synergies we are able to capture. Holley delivered net sales of $200.1 million in the first quarter, an increase of $39.7 million, or 24.8% from the first quarter of 2021. As Tom mentioned earlier, organic sales provided $21.6 million, or 13.5%, of year-over-year growth. This organic growth was driven by improved price realization, which contributed $13.6 million, or 63%, of the total organic growth in the quarter. The remaining $8 million of organic growth came from higher unit sales volume, largely driven by strong consumer demand in our electronic fuel injection and safety product categories. I think on the prior call, you had mentioned you expect a return to more normal seasonality in 2022, which would imply a larger rate of growth in the back half of the year, but you just had a very nice top line print in the first quarter. I think last call you talked about contribution in 2021 from acquisitions to be a little more than $30 million, with acquired growth adding $18 million here in Q1."
