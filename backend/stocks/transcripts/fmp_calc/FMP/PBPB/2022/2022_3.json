    "content": " Continued strength in our digital business once again accounting for 36% of revenue, 10.6% shop level margins, an expansion of 190 basis points year-over-year, 15% same-store sales growth leading to another record weekly AUV of $23,383, net income of $9 million for the quarter. With all this success and only an approximate 2% brand fund contribution as a percentage of system-wide revenue, we remain optimistic in our ability to expand our investments in digital advertising and marketing as a core driver of continued top-line sales growth. AUV growth was primarily driven by sustained demand in general, as well as continued improving performance from previously lagging CBD and airport shop types and a 3.6% price increase in the quarter, to mitigate the impact of input cost inflation. Shop level margins were 10.6%, a meaningful improvement compared to 8.7% in the year-ago period, driven primarily by top-line growth, including the continued recovery of previously lagging shop locations, disciplined cost controls and operational efficiencies. Our digital business continues to serve as a vital component to revenue, accounting for 36% of total revenues, consistent with prior quarters on a percentage basis, but higher on an absolute basis, given higher AUVs. For the remainder of the year, we look to continue our strong AUV and sales momentum, supported by leveraging and applying our learnings from accretive marketing initiatives, expanding our catering business, higher engagement from Perks loyalty members, successful deal offerings such as our BOGO promotions, LTOs and targeted digital advertising campaign. With the October sales momentum we expect revenue of $114 million to $119 million for the quarter and, building on my earlier comments about margin expansion during September we now expect Q4 shop margins of between 10% and 13%."
