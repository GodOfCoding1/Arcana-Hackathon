    "content": " First, AUVs of $1.3 million, which we've seen meaningful progress towards through our improving performance rooted in our commitment to enhancing the customer experience, investment in technology, operational systems integration, strategic marketing and our differentiated menu. We were working on it a little more quietly, but we also know that in the shops, there's an opportunity for additional technology investments, whether they're through software enhancements that allow us to manage the business better, like I mentioned, some with our labor guide and the financial performance metrics that we have, the operation standards evaluation tools that we use. And then the promotional activity that we've put forth throughout the quarter, certainly, you should see that as a reflection of our desire to make sure we're giving our customers as much value as possible, especially those digital and Perks consumers, and they responded really well."
