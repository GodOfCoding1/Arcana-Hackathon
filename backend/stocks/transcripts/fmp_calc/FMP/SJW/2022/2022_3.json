    "content": " The change in diluted earnings per share for the quarter was primarily driven by cumulative rate increases of $0.32 per share, a $0.26 per share production cost savings due to lower customer consumption, an increase in our California utilities surface water production and $0.13 per share increase due to the impact of our California Utilities Water Conservation Memorandum Account. These increases were partially offset by production cost increases of $0.31 per share, a decrease of $0.14 per share due to lower water sales and a $0.10 per share decrease as a result of changes in our Connecticut utilities water revenue adjustment account, otherwise known as the WRA regulatory mechanism, which I will discuss later in my comments."
