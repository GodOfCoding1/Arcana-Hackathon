    "content": " We recorded the company's first product revenues, secured substantial non-dilutive funding for our oncology development and gained clarity with the FDA on the design of our ONC201 Phase 3 ACTION study. With all of that said, we know the FDA has raised the bar for accelerated approval, and so that's why we're seeking additional clarity on their position now that, they have more visibility into ONC201 safety and were aligned on the Phase III plan. As Mike mentioned earlier, we successfully executed product sales and monetized TEMBEXA during the third quarter, resulting in $270 million of non-dilutive capital to the organization, and ending cash balance at September 30, of $285 million. Your line is open. Your line is open. Now the data suggests from our Phase II trial that it is those patients who have better performance status, have less sort of disease burden maybe fewer tumors smaller tumors all of those things characteristic of what you'd expect to see in the population that we are enrolling. Your line is open. So, specifically we have built in safety analysis that if there is an issue -- and the only way I'd expect it would be if the higher dose is not tolerable that we could stop that arm if it's appropriate according to guidelines we're getting from the DMC -- independent DMC. Your line is open."
