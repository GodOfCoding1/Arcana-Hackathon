This also is addressed in part, but what you've seen from the FDA regarding optimization of dose and we think that this helps also address the situation where you do have two shots on goal, and essentially you have two places for a patient to get on study with ONC201 and  I'll pass it on to Josh for additional comments. We \u00e2\u0080\u0093 as we discussed at our last call, we essentially delayed that conversation after their feedback this \u00e2\u0080\u0093 earlier this spring with a focus on getting moving with the Phase 3 trial and knowing that without this additional safety data in hand we were a little bit limited in our ability to make a strong case for the risk benefit assessment. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. Your line is now open."
