    "content": " Adjusted EBITDA was $15.9 million or 17.1% of sales compared to $10.3 million or 10.8% of sales in the same period last year, reflecting strong operational performance and the impact of pricing actions implemented earlier in the year to recover inflationary costs. Given these underlying drivers, our outlook for 2023 is as follows, sales to be in the range of $1 billion to $1.2 billion, representing 7% year-over-year growth at the midpoint, adjusted EBITDA of $70 million to $100 million, representing 20% growth at the midpoint, adjusted EPS of $0.97 per share to $1.59 per share, which includes an effective tax rate of approximately 25% and shares outstanding of approximately $30 million."
