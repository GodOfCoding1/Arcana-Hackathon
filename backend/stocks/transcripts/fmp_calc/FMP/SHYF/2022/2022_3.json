    "content": " Revenue for the third quarter was $286.1 million, up 4.9% from the year ago quarter and up 23.2% sequentially with improvements in chassis availability. Third quarter adjusted EBITDA was $27.1 million compared to $33.7 million in the previous year, while as a percent of sales, adjusted EBITDA declined 9.5% compared to 12.4% in the same period last year. While our outlook remains consistent with our prior quarterly communications, given our third quarter performance, chassis visibility for the balance of the year and strong backlog, we are tightening our full year outlook as follows: revenue in the range of $1 billion to $1.1 billion adjusted EBITDA of $62.5 million to $72.5 million, including approximately $30 million of expenses related to EV initiatives. If you think about sort of chassis flows and progressed to the year, we saw improvement late in the second quarter, and that continued into the third quarter where we were really healthy, call it, mid-Q3. But as you look at the strength of the underlying businesses that we have there, we do feel confident with the margin profiles of those products and businesses as well as our ability to sort of expand over time, but I think when you look at it on a year-to-date basis, you're probably in the 13% range, which is still a great increase year-over-year."
