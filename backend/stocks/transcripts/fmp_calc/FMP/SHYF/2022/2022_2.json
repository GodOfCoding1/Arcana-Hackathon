    "content": " Sales were $95.3 million, an increase of $12.9 million or 15.7% year-over-year with strong performance in our service body, Builtmore Contract Manufacturing, and luxury motorhome chassis businesses. Adjusted EBITDA was $12.9 million or 13.5% of sales, up 280 basis points, compared to 8.8 million or 10.7% of sales in the same period last year, primarily driven by higher sales volume, pricing actions, and improved product mix, partially offset by material and labor cost inflation. So \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and they've been doing that, I think last time I mentioned, typically three deliveries would create a trend, but we want to see a three months or more of a trend here on chassis and they continue to have some ups and downs, but overall they're averaging about what they have in the past. And so, we expect maybe some continued movement there as we go forward, but I think to your point, we're still looking at a backlog that extends beyond a year in our FVS business right now and feel really comfortable with the demand, the underlying demand in the markets that we're playing."
