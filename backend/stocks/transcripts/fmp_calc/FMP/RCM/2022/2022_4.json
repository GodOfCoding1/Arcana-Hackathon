    "content": " We are pleased to report solid fourth quarter results with revenue of $532.8 million, up almost 34% year-over-year, and adjusted EBITDA of $125 million, up 31%. Non-GAAP cost of services in Q4 was $364.5 million, up $85.4 million year-over-year, driven by Cloudmed, costs related to the onboarding of new customers, and operational investments to support new growth. Embedded in our outlook are the following factors: one, an expectation of 20% year-over-year growth at Cloudmed; two, operational improvements, which should generate higher incentive fees quarter-over-quarter; three, operational cost improvements as our new business matures; and finally, a realization of cost synergy through the year as we continue the Cloudmed integration. So, just stepping back, we have on the end-to-end side $55 billion of NPR in our end-to-end space of which call it $19 million, $20 million is still in some phase of onboarding, right, which we've talked about before, it's why we're so confident in the earnings power of the business with essentially a 100% customer attention and ability to onboard that over time and drive to our EBITDA numbers. Based on sort of your target for call it roughly $131 million in EBITDA in Q1, that's only about 21% of your full-year guide if I use the mid-point. So you mentioned now you have 500 modular customers with $850 billion of NPR, strong pipeline and expect 20% growth this year in Cloudmed."
