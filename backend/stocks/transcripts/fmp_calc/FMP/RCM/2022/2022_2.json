    "content": " We're pleased to assign Sutter Health as our newest end-to-end operating partner customer with $10 billion in net patient revenue under our scope for a 10-year term, this win presents meaningful growth and expansion on the West Coast. The macro trends I discussed earlier are also driving strong interest in Cloudmed's revenue integrity solutions, and we continue to make progress selling more solutions into current customers as well as expanding our market share with new customers. With approximately $55 billion in NPR under management in end-to-end relationships and $800 billion of NPR touched by Cloudmed, we have significant scale and are distinctly positioned to automate the numerous manual tasks performed in the revenue cycle process. Other revenue, which now includes revenue from Cloudmed since completion of the acquisition, was $43.7 million, up $13 million over the prior year and $11 million over the prior quarter, driven by a $13.3 million contribution from Cloudmed, partly offset by a delay in revenue from the VA contract and planned customer attrition related to RevWorks."
