    "content": " GEO sales over the five-year period ending 2028, are expected to average 140,000 GEOs per year, a significant increase over the current levels, primarily due to Northparkes, where, in the short-term, increased gold production from E31 North open pit, and in the medium term, the ramp-up of E22 deposits were \u00e2\u0080\u0093 both of which host materially higher gold grades than the current run-of-mine feed forecast for 2023. Your line is open. Your line is open. But we are seeing multiple transactions for the first time in a couple of years really that are meaningfully cash-generating and well-advanced precious metals focused, some acquisition financing-related opportunities, some sort of value realization situations, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d say, generally in favorable jurisdictions. Your line is open. Your line is open. And as I said, the actual underlying operating performance that they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve done on silver because you may have seen next to put our guidance for the next three years, they had good results, but they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re three years, I think, on some of the base metal assumptions have come down. Thanks very much, Shaun. Your line is open. Your line is open. Thanks very much, Shaun."
