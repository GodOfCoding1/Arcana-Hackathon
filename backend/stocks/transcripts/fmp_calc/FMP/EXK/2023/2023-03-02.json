Before we get started, I would ask that you view our MD&A for cautionary language regarding forward-looking statements and the Risk Factors pertaining to these statements. With us on today's call is Dan Dickson, Endeavour Silver's CEO; Christine West, our Chief Financial Officer; and Don Gray, Endeavour's COO. Following Dan's formal remarks, we will open up the call for questions. I will keep today's call as brief as possible as all the details were published in today's news release, but make sure I hit some of the key points for our investors. Our production exceeded guidance, which helped alleviate the upward pressure on costs. Inflationary pressures across the entire spectrum of the inputs were fault across the entire mining sector, and it was no different for us. Ideally, a financial package would be complete. However, things outside our control has pushed that into this year. We continue to be excited about the acquisition of the Pitarrilla project, both solidifying our presence in Mexico and furthering our strategy of delivering industry-leading growth. On a consolidated basis, we produced 9 million ounces of silver equivalent metal with both silver and gold production exceeding the upper range of guidance by 17% and 4% respectively. The second consecutive year, we've significantly exceeded production guidance. Guanacevi was a star performer yet again accounting for over 70% of consolidated production, with silver and gold grades well above plan. In fact, Guanacevi had record throughput grades averaging 512 grams per tonne silver and 1.44 grams per tonne gold, while the plant approached 1,300 tonnes per day average throughput in Q4. Overall, the mill performed well with recoveries averaging just under 86% for silver and just below 90% for gold, demonstrating consistency and stability at the slightly higher throughput. Our strong operating performance enabled robust financial results, particularly in Q4, as gold and silver prices strengthened; we are able to take advantage of the higher prices by selling most of the silver inventory. As a result, revenue rose by 27% marking a 10-year best bolstered mostly by volume. The higher revenue translated into increased cash flow with mine operating earnings of $51.5 million, up 42% from 2021. We ended the year with cash costs of $10.65 per ounce, which is about 7% over our guidance and all-in sustaining costs of $19.97 per ounce, which is below the lower end guidance of $20 per ounce. Our direct cost per tonne were up 16% compared to the previous year, as we saw cost increases in a lot of our key inputs. Fortunately, the increased Guanacevi grades offset the increases in direct costs, but cost control will continue to be a key focus for the company going forward. We had cash on hand of $84 million with no long-term debt, aside from normal course leases for equipment. Working capital totaled about $94 million, which includes unsold volume held at cost of $6 million, but has a market value of $15 million. This past year, we were very busy and productive at Terronera preparing the site for full scale construction. We spent $41 million on initial development using our own existing cash, while we continue to confirm a viable debt package. During the year, the project team delivered several achievements. The Board has approved an additional $26 million in development expenditures for Q1 2023, while we continue to advance the project. At the outset of 2022, we began executing on our three-year sustainability strategy, which is anchored on three pillars: people, planet, and business. We took several steps to increase employee development, engagement, and inclusion with positive results across the company. In addition, we amplified our community investments in Mexico, aligned with our priorities -- priority areas of education and employability. Over the past year, we devoted a significant amount of time and effort across our organization to better understand the potential risks and opportunities related to climate change. These are discussed in our first climate disclosure report that will be published next week, aligning with the TCFD framework. While it's still early days on integrating climate initiatives, we are trying to be thoughtful and diligent in determining the most effective steps for us, as we deepen our understanding of the impact of climate change initiatives on our company. For 2023, our production outlook continues to be strong with another year of robust grades from Guanacevi. We are targeting to produce between 8.6 million and 9.5 million ounces of silver equivalent, a mid-point which marks the fourth consecutive year of production growth. The combination of higher consolidated throughput and produced ounces allows for a projected unit cost of $10 to $11 per ounce for cash costs and $19 to $20 per ounce for all-in sustaining costs, similar to 2022. At Guanacevi and Bola\u00c3\u00b1itos, we have plans to invest more than $35 million in sustaining capital to optimize performance and maximize output. Of course, as everyone knows, this company has been built through the drill bit, and we are aiming to invest $10 million into exploration for 2023, with the largest portion $3 million being allocated to Pitarrilla while Parral has a $1.5 million budget. In December, we confirmed an indicated resource of nearly 600 million ounces of silver plus material amounts of lead and zinc. This year, we plan to extend a historical ramp to better understand the feeder structures we identified in the deposit. With continued expert  success, we ultimately hope to identify a business case to model an underground operation at Pitarrilla. In closing, it's going to be another busy year. I'm very excited about our outlook as we continue to exercise on our growth pipeline, particularly at a time when silver demand is beginning to strengthen. So you talked about cost control being a key focus for this year and in particular, business improvements. And maybe if you could just touch on any cost improvements you've already seen, that would be great. I mean, cyanide power costs were significant contributors in steel at Guanacevi and Bola\u00c3\u00b1itos with TCs and RCs, power costs. For us, it really comes down to making sure that on a daily basis, a weekly basis, on a monthly basis, we're reviewing our cost reports, reviewing the inputs that are going in, particularly at Guanacevi. When it comes to actual improvements, we think we do a really good job at Bola\u00c3\u00b1itos, it's Guanacevi where we can be better at waste management, managing our waste, managing the tonnes, being more efficient on a productivity basis and moving tonnes. I don't know if we've seen that come through yet here March 1, 2023. We have seen that slowdown in Q4, and hopefully, that continues through 2023. Thanks for the color, obviously, a lot of moving parts there. You're sitting on over $80 million in cash, just under $94 million of working capital. I mean I think the key part to that is the fact that we are looking for a debt financing package, and that debt package would be anywhere between $100 million to $120 million. We recognize and when we do have that debt package, we'll likely update the market on where that capital costs are. But to answer your question, ultimately, what we want to see and we kind of have on hand just for the two operating assets, somewhere between $30 million, $40 million as a cushion. I think the key component there is the relatively similar, a little bit lower for Bola\u00c3\u00b1itos. I think for the year, we have, like I say, it's about similar to a little bit lower at Bola\u00c3\u00b1itos. Hey Dan and team, thanks for taking my questions. So Dan, you touched on moving Pitarrilla and Parral through the economic study stage. I mean, part of that visibility also depends on our exploration ground. And really those -- that drill meters will happen when the ramp extensions complete, which we expect it to done mid-year, so the start of Q3, and then we'll drill. Ultimately, for Pitarrilla, the studies would happen in 2024 just because of the scale and scope of Pitarrilla. For Parral, we'd actually had a plan to put in place to start economic studies in 2022, just but with the acquisition of Pitarrilla that pushed it back a bit. This year, we're drilling close to 3,000 meters at Parral, and that's drilling has done. So start that -- those studies at the end of the year, possibly with publishing early 2024. I mean, obviously, you guys did a good job of taking advantage of higher silver prices in the fourth quarter of last year. I think as we get into the build of Terronera, we get less flexibility just depending on where our balance sheet is. But as you say, we've come down into the 2020s level . Obviously, our balance sheet is in great shape. And as -- like I said, as we move through the year, we'll see how we do it. Ultimately, in the feasibility study, the production period or construction period is a two-year process. Our goal with being able to advance it is still to be commissioning at the end of 2024, so full year's production effectively in 2025. But hopefully, if things go well, knock on wood, we could have first pour obviously back half 2024, maybe commercial production at the end of 2024. We -- yes, our permit team and as all of our listeners and investors know, Terronera is fully permitted. And with the feasibility study and we have the permits to start construction, which obviously, we've advanced a lot of the things. There are amended permits for operational flexibility, so we don't particularly need the permits to construct. But over the 12-year mine life, we want various flexibility, one, being a staging area that we want to push out 300 meters. We've actually had very good communication with the permitting departments, the different authorities because there's a number that we have to go through Semarnat, Conagua. And all been advancing and over the last I'd say, three months, we've gotten approval for smaller permits. So today, where we sit at $20 silver -- between $20, $25 silver, we pay a 13% royalty. So Q4 has an elevated royalty, but on an annualized basis, we're producing similar amount from that area, which we call El Curso, which is subject to that slightly scaled royalty with Frisco. I mean, clearly, right now with Bola\u00c3\u00b1itos is effectively offering at breakeven. First thing, obviously, the optionality to Bola\u00c3\u00b1itos and to that production. Thirdly, we have talent there that ultimately, if one day Bola\u00c3\u00b1itos doesn't operate, we want to make sure we can keep that talent to move them to Terronera that would come in. So we're not discovering three years or two years, we're finding three months or six months at a time. I wouldn't say I'm jumping up with joy and I'm not compressed, so somewhere in the middle of all that. There's a lot of concessions that surround us that have a lot of opportunities still, and we just have to work through that. And from a production standpoint, it looks relatively flattish compared to 2022. But if you do this financing package and the interest rates have come up, so you will -- you would have the additional interest expense. And I think for us, the ability to exceed that plan or hit the high end of that range really comes down to our operating team at Guanacevi and ultimately, our operating team at Bola\u00c3\u00b1itos for that matter. We did a lot of development in 2022, though it will give us some efficiencies this year. But at the end of the day, the reason we put out our 2023 guidance is because we expect that's where we're going to be at. I would point to 2021 and 2022, we've revised guidance upwards two years in a row, and we actually exceeded those revised upwards guidance, but we'll see how this year unfolds. Well, I think a lot of people are looking at Terronera. I mean, at the end of the day, it's a project loan financing. And the key aspect of the project loan financing is ESG and ultimately getting commercial banks, some big banks on side from an ESG standpoint. Like I say, I won't get into what happened necessarily this past year at this point, but there's things that were out of our hands, but it's been moving forward. I expect, like I said in my outset, clarity in relatively short order on that. Dan, I also want to follow-up on Terronera. Obviously, things unfortunately, it changed quite a bit from 2021. Lucas, I mean, that's a very fair question. The two quick answers to handle the right ballpark, but I'll get maybe a little bit more detail into that. Ultimately, we completed that report in March of 2021. If you compare what we paid compared to what was in that feasibility study, we're right on point. And ultimately, what we've been looking at over the last year, year-and-a-half, as we push through this financing package and advance Terronera is optimizing from that feasibility study. So going from a 1,700 tonnes per day to 2,000 tonnes per day has been looked out and has been looked out over time. When we have the detailed financing package in place, we're going to -- we will provide the market with where we expect the capital to be what type of size that Terronera will be. But as you say, higher throughput will help offset some of the inflationary pressures that we've seen. I mean at the end of the day, Lucas, we put out 2023 guidance because we have clarity on that. For 2024 all-in sustaining costs, it's highly dependent on where we sit with Terronera. Guanacevi and Bola\u00c3\u00b1itos, they're mature assets. We kind of know where their costs, and then they were very similar for about 12 years until the last couple of years, they've really picked up. And like I said, I don't think that's specific to Endeavour Silver. Of course, our resource grades are very similar to what we have in reserves so that might continue. But if Terronera can come online and into 2024 and the timing of that comes online in 2024, it will be highly dependent on our consolidated all-in sustaining costs. Dan, I really appreciate the color and to you and the team, best of luck. Thanks, operator, and thanks to all our investors and listeners today. Again, as I said in my formal comments, I think 2023 is going to be a very busy year for Endeavour. Of course, pushing forward at Pitarrilla and Parral is important for our pipeline. But if we can get to a formal construction decision on Terronera in relatively short order, I think that will be the next catalyst for everyone. Thanks a lot, and have a good day."
