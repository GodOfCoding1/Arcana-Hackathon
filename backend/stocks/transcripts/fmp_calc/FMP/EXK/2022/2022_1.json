    "content": " With us on today\u2019s call we have Dan Dickson, Endeavour Silver\u2019s CEO; Christine West, our CFO; and Don Gray, Endeavour\u2019s Chief Operating Officer. Following Dan\u2019s formal remarks, we will then open the call for questions. First, let\u2019s talk about operations. Consolidated, Q1 production was up 4% year-over-year to 2 million silver equivalent ounces. And based on where we are mining this high grade ore, it\u2019s expected to continue in the near-term. Ultimately, the first quarter puts us in great shape to achieve this year\u2019s production guidance of between 6.7 to 7.6 million silver equivalent ounces. This bullion was sold throughout the first quarter at significantly higher prices than what we saw in December, which contributed to cash flow from operating activities of more than $22 million. As at March 31st, we had $151 million and no long-term debt aside from normal course equipment leases and working capital of $168 million. For the quarter, our all-in sustaining costs per ounce metrics were 5% higher than the previous year, just inside our guidance range of $20 to $21 per ounce. While this is an industry-wide issue that is expected to prevail throughout the course of the year, we are closely reviewing our purchasing practices to see where and how we can mitigate the impact. We are tracking two major milestones here in the second quarter, securing financing for Terronera and closing the Pitarrilla acquisition. In terms of our schedule, we are still expecting to complete commissioning in the first half of 2024, if we can secure the debt portion of the project financing by the end of this quarter. Last year, the Board approved $21 million to advance the Terronera project while we were working through this financing. We have another $9.5 million earmarked to spend at Terronera in the second quarter to complete earthworks, Phase 1 of detailed engineering and the commencement of the permanent camp construction. For us, Terronera is a game-changer, and it\u2019s a very important part of our future. Situated in Durango State, Mexico, it\u2019s one of the world\u2019s largest undeveloped silver deposits and we believe has the potential to be a Tier 1 asset. We announced this acquisition in mid-January and expect it to close before the end of June, at which time work will immediately commence to define historical resources as a current resource, assess a number of targets and advance the project to an updated economic study. To close the transaction, we\u2019re awaiting approval for the Mexican Federal Economic Competition Commission that\u2019s expected imminently. To fund the cash portion, we completed a Bought Deal for $46 million in March. This equity raise, together with the strong operating cash flow this quarter, has really strengthened our balance sheet. I\u2019m pleased to say that tomorrow, we will be releasing our 2021 sustainability report. I felt that quite interesting as a frustrated consumer who\u2019s been trying to more or less do the same thing when I hire contractors and whatnot, obviously, on a much smaller scale. But, frankly, I\u2019ve really had no or very little success because people have small show-up for jobs or just hold your stupid prices. I mean, I think some of the obvious areas where we can\u2019t mitigate inflation pressures, and that\u2019s on power costs, and we get most of our power from CFE, the Mexican Federal Commission of Electricity. The other -- our largest cost, and obviously, where it\u2019s most difficult to get concessions is labor. And, at the end of the day, with our union contract at Bola\u00f1itos and Guanacevi are obviously you don\u2019t never see wages come down. Where we can push is on contractors, but obviously, they\u2019re seeing inflationary costs, but where we do have a little bit of power, it comes down to combining purchasing between Bola\u00f1itos and Guanacevi. And obviously, we\u2019ve seen cost increases in cyanide and steel, and those are going to be prevalent because of the primary inputs. But we can get some purchasing power if we can combine that stuff, but we haven\u2019t been overly successful to this date with much. And it\u2019s obviously something that we\u2019re looking at, and we\u2019re going to build Terronera. And I think we\u2019re very lucky on the Terronera front that we\u2019ve sourced a lot of our equipment, a lot of our -- and we\u2019ve gone through Sandvik and a lot of the equipment we purchased with regards to operating is actually already on site. But from an operations standpoint, again, it\u2019s looking at purchasing more volumes that we can share between Bola\u00f1itos and Guanacevi and then hopefully, ultimately, Terronera when it comes on line. There is a fluctuation, and that\u2019s from the mark-to-market on deferred share units that are paid to our Board. But ultimately, our G&A on a cash force and budgeted somewhere between $6 million and $8 million, so ultimately $7 million, and it\u2019s pretty straight line. But in general, for the year, you kind of used $1.5 million to $2 million per quarter, it kind of gets you there. The biggest thing is COFECE, which is the commission against antitrust, and we\u2019ve been going back and forth with them and submitting information on, ultimately, Endeavour Silver\u2019s market share globally and in Mexico with regard to silver. And so, we\u2019ve submitted all our documentation. So, it\u2019s our belief we\u2019ve completely answered all their questions. So, it\u2019s now just getting through that process, which we actually think is quite imminent. But at this point, we\u2019re just waiting for a regulatory approval. And I wondered if you could maybe distinguish a bit between the inflation rates you\u2019re seeing in local currency versus on the U.S. dollar rate, and what percentage of your cost is approximately in local currency? So ultimately, we\u2019re about 60% to 65% tied to the Mexican peso. Now last year, in 2021, the Mexican peso\u2019s inflation rate was just shy of 6%. This year, it\u2019s tracking a little bit higher than that, similar to what we\u2019re seeing in Canada and the United States. But ultimately, it\u2019s lining up to where the U.S. is. So, it\u2019s not like the Mexican peso is running at a higher inflation rate impacting the Mexican peso, or given us less purchase with our peso. With oil prices being higher, Mexican peso generally does a little bit better because they are tied quite a bit. You\u2019ve been shoring up financing, and congratulations on that. As I touched on, I mean, our working capital is $168 million as of March 31st. Of course, $35 million of that cash will be paid out to SSR when we close Pitarrilla. So, we\u2019re still in a very strong cash position. Obviously, the big thing that\u2019s coming down the pipe for us is a formal construction decision on Terronera. And right now, in our feasibility study, the Terronera initial CapEx is $175 million. But ultimately, you want to carry a float in the company and put in about $80 million to $90 million of debt on the book at a project loan financing ability. Carrying $80 million of debt on our balance sheet, I think, is very prudent for our shareholders. And ultimately, that\u2019s where we\u2019re going to go. So, as far as putting more powder on the balance sheet, it\u2019s not at this time. I think, with the acquisition of Pitarrilla, with the construction coming of Terronera, we\u2019re quite busy. Just a reminder that more is our Annual General Meeting of Shareholders, it\u2019s being held at the Metropolitan Hotel in Vancouver at 10:00 a.m. We hope to see you there."
