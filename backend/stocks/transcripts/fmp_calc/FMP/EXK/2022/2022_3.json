    "content": " First off, we had a 10% upward revision to our consolidated production guidance, guiding 7.6 million to 8 million silver equivalent ounces produced in 2022, which marks the second year in a row we've done so. And ultimately, we see projects, that's relatively the same, like the inflation increase on capital, hopefully, can be offset potentially by increases in throughput or slight level changes into the operations that will offset a little bit of those inflationary costs that we've seen. We'll see where silver and gold prices go, and I think it's important to note that our management's job is to manage through these periods, but the long-term outlook with Pitarrilla, Parral and Terronera, I think the Company set up to do very well over the next handful of years."
