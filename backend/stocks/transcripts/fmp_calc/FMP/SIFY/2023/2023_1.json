At this time, all participants have been placed on a listen-only mode and the floor will be open for questions-and-comments after the presentation. I'm joined on the call today by Raju Vegesna, our Chairman; Kamal Nath, Chief Executive Officer; and M. P. Vijay Kumar, Chief Financial Officer. If you do not have a copy of our press release, please call Grayling Global at 646-284-9400 and we will have one sent to you. Alternatively, you may obtain a copy of the release at the Investor Information section on the company's corporate website at www.sifytechnologies.com/investors. Sify results for the year are according to the International Financial Reporting Standard, or IFRS and will differ somewhat from the GAAP announcements made in previous years. Before we continue, I'd like to point out that certain statements contained in the earnings release and on this conference call are forward-looking statements rather than historical facts and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described. With respect to such forward-looking statements, the company seeks protections afforded by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These risks include a variety of factors, including competitive developments and risk factors listed from time to time in the company's SEC reports and public releases. I would now like to introduce Mr. Raju Vegesna, Chairman of Sify Technologies. Even though for the last couple of months, there's uncertainty in the macroeconomics of the world, India still retained a strong outlook for investments and growth. This is in a large part due to the consistent economic reforms of the government, and it started ambitions to pursue the digital methods to deliver the social benefits. The technology landscape has been the biggest beneficiary of these policies, and this is reflected in the growing number of incoming requests for the digital transformation. Let me now bring in Kamal, our CEO to expand on some of the business highlights for the past quarter. Our cloud-focused digital initiatives are now called upon to create new business processes, customer experiences and greater cost effectiveness. Enterprises increasing interest in outcome-based initiatives, incoming policies around data and the government's aggressive adoption around all things digital should act as tailwinds for our data center, network and digital services. The revenue split between the businesses for the quarter was data center colocation services at 34%, digital services at 26% and network services at 40%. During the quarter, Sify has invested $150,000 in start-ups in the Silicon Valley area as part of our corporate venture capital initiative. As on June 30, 2022, Sify provides service via 824 fiber nodes and 1,910 wireless base stations across the country, a 11% and 5% increase, respectively, over the same quarter last year. The network connectivity services crossed a critical milestone of deploying more than 5,000 SD-WAN service points across the country. Let me bring in Vijay, our CFO, to elaborate on the financial highlights for the quarter. Revenue was INR7,709 million, an increase of 20% over the same quarter last year. EBITDA was INR1,525 million, an increase of 5% over the same quarter last year. Profit after tax was INR271 million, a decrease of 18% over the same quarter last year. Capital expenditure during the quarter was INR2,241 million. As we scale, our focus would be on ensuring that costs are optimized and revenues are improved across our services mix. Cash balance at the end of the quarter was INR3,794 million. First, in terms of the data center services performance this quarter, it came in a little bit better than we were expecting. And then earlier this year, I guess, the government classified data centers, they gave in infrastructure status. The Kotak partnership is a convertible instrument, so it's essentially equity. We have so far drawn about INR2,000 million, 2000 million and before in rupees and before end of this financial year, we are committed to draw another INR2,000 million which is also a convertible instrument. And given the infrastructure status is the government has recently committed to notify we should be able to raise longer-term resources where the repayment would be spread over a longer period, leaving more free cash flows within the company to fund the expansion plans. I think both goes hand to hand, but we are going to go both the businesses parallelly. I think both data centers and the network, we see the potential. As the more hyperscalers and the cloud platform is taking digital transformation, the -- Yes, there are certain advantages, but we consider those two businesses are independent and run separate P&L. So in terms of your investment plans for this year, you mentioned for -- you've commissioned, I guess, four megawatts of additional data center capacity this quarter. So we currently have about 86 megawatt of IT power capacity, which is operational across 11 data centers spread over seven cities and we are committed to three greenfield projects, which are under construction. But I guess the plan still remains to add 200 megawatts of capacity over the next, I think, four years is what you laid out. Over the next four years, the outlook is pretty positive, very positive. And we have done financial closure, which should support us to more than double our capacity in the next two to three years. So typically, we have two, three benchmarks with the Board has set for the company. One is in terms of debt to equity, which currently we are sub one whereas we could go anywhere up to INR1.5 million. Second is a debt-to-EBITDA ratio, which fairly good accepted multiple is about three times, and we are currently little over two times and we have enough leveraging ability and on a debt service coverage ratio also, we have enough room to add debt. Thank you for your time on this call, and we look forward to interacting with you through the year, and have a great day."
