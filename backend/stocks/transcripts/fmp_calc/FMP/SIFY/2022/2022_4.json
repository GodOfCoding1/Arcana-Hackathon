As I stated before, the government of initiative for a digital transformation of the country and our enterprise demand for a multi-services and multiyear contracts, positioning us in a unique confidence to ICT players, integration of our services portfolio give an advantaged view of the emerging scenario and ability to cater to this demand. And in the mix of all these services, there are also engagements where we initially started with digital services, with complete operations outsourcing but later on, when the customer took their cloud transformation journey, they have subscribed to Sify's cloud services. So overall, we have multiple kinds of competition in multiple segments but with our cloud at the core offering, ranging from data center, network which are cloud aligned as well as the services on top of this infrastructure which we own and we offer to our customers."
