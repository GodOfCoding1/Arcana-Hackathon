Based upon our third party appraisal report, we recalculated the fair value of our interest in LMAO and recognized an unrealized gain on securities of $12.2 million for the three months ended June 30, 2022. We ended the quarter with $17 million in cash, working capital of $21 million and no long term debt, which provides us a solid foundation to invest and drive returns from our bitcoin mining operations. Operating expenses totaled $5.6 million for three months ended June 30, 2022 compared to $642,000 for the three months ended June 30, 2021. For the three months ended June 30, 2022, net income attributed to LM Funding shareholders was $2.8 million compared to $11.1 million for the three months ended June 30, 2021. Net income in the second quarter of 2022 included an unrealized gain on investment and equity securities of $12.2 million related to the company's interest in LMAO, partially offset by $3.6 million of noncash stock based compensation expense. Finally, net cash used by operations was just $154,000 during the six months ended June 30, 2022, reinforcing our lean operations as we get ready to commit bitcoin mining operations."
