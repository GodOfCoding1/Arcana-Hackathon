    "content": " Adjusted gross profit for the quarter was negatively impacted by approximately $2.1 million of onetime customer expenses, which in part helped enable negotiated price increases and margin optimization initiatives that have collectively resulted in over $16 million annualized adjusted gross profit improvement already for 2023. Supported by the progress we have made to-date, we are confident in our ability to say that we fully expect to achieve positive adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter in this year, while expanding our adjusted gross profit margins to within the low-double-digit range. Just to underscore what Kevin said, just with the margin optimizations within the existing RubiconConnect business, we've already added an annualized $16 million of adjusted gross profit this year within the existing portfolio."
