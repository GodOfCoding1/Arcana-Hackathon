    "content": " Referencing slides 15 and 16 of the deck and a quick update on the balance sheet and our credit profile as of year-end -- quarter end to round out my comments on Q2, we ended the quarter with $273 million and unsuppressed availability on our revolving line of credit and total leverage came in at 3.5 times 2022 adjusted pro forma EBITDA. First, with YIT, we've added approximately $47 million of revenue and $9.4 million of EBITDA to the material handling segment for a total implied purchase price of $33.5 million, indicative of a 3.5 times EBITDA purchase multiple, which is immediately accretive to Alta shareholders. And what we continue to hear from customers is that the automation is becoming not a nice to have, but a need to have because of the dearth of labor to kind of come full circle to Alex's first question, where the idea of not having labor on the line, if you will, at a new manufacturing facility or a distribution facility is posing a risk to revenue streams for some of our customers, where they're saying we need the robot rather than the robot makes sense from an ROI perspective, almost like it's becoming existential to their own businesses."
