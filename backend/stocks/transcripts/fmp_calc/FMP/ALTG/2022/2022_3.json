    "content": " From a nominal dollar perspective, the majority of the quarter-over-quarter revenue beat related to approximately $72 million in additional equipment sales with $45 million of that figure coming through on an organic basis. Moving on from revenue to EBITDA, on a pro forma basis, adjusted EBITDA was $44 million for the quarter, which is up 39.2% or $12.4 million from the third quarter 2021. As I've mentioned on previous calls, with the asset-light businesses we've added to our platform via M&A and our organic growth in parts, service and rental, we expected to drive this conversion metric higher in 2022, and results through the third quarter are in line with that expectation. Considering that Alta\u00e2\u0080\u0099s annual EBITDA at the IPO was $94 million and the $42 million of EBITDA that has come through M&A, it follows that we've been able to grow EBITDA by $27 million on an organic basis in less than three years, suggesting that the engines of our growth strategy, both M&A and organic, have been running strong. Thank you for your questions, sir. Thank you for your questions, sir. Ted, this is Ryan. Ted, this is Ryan."
