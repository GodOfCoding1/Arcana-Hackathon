The second point I'll make is that over time, as I look into the next 2022 -- the next 10-years, in any case I suspect banners are at risk of being dissolved, because if you can imagine, and I mentioned that in my letter, we're seeing really good momentum replacing banners with this sort of carousel experiences that are half editorial and half paid and the paid portion is either e-commerce, video or native advertising. And that's a very hard competition, so we're seeing good momentum there and I mentioned in E-Online, NBC Sports, South East and others and I think over time that is where Taboola will grow the most, which is 10s of billions of dollars of banners that will be replaced by basically this paid recommendations and editorial recommendation. Your line is open. Your line is open. So let me just say, you know, as I think about the opportunity we have on the advertising side Google and Facebook, Weibo to get to millions of advertisers, Amazon as well we just saw they just quashed a $30 billion in advertising, which is mostly performance as well, a big amount of advertisers, Snap I believe it's quarter million advertisers, we had 15 and I believe the rest of the companies in advertising space have less than us. Your line is open. Secondly, I think as you look into the people that we partner with publishers, publishers need a very, very good friend and we are the best friend, you can get we empowered the entire organization, it's more than just money, the editorial team get newsroom and help it\u2019s for you they get commerce strategy, subscription opportunities and that's why you're seeing five to 10 year partnerships, which I believe no other company on the Internet has ever had. Your line is open."
