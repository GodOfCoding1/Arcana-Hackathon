    "content": " For instance, we're seeing strength in our e-commerce business a bit better than we expected as well as we continue to see exponential growth in to Bulnes, which, for the first time, we're showing the run rate to generate north of $50 million in revenue this year. Tabula News is growing triple digit, as I indicated on our last call, and we expect it to reach close to $50 million annual run rate by the end of the year, so becoming a meaningful contributor to our financials. But now more than ever, it is important so we come out even stronger on the other side of this, whenever this ends, I'm proud of Tobira's north of $150 million in adjusted EBITDA this year, along with our strong cash flow profile. Of the Q2 gross revenue growth of $14 million, $22 million came from new digital properties, while existing digital property partners decreased $8 million. We generated adjusted EBITDA of $34.2 million, which was above our guidance of $23 million to $28 million, a decrease year-over-year driven by our investments in the business."
