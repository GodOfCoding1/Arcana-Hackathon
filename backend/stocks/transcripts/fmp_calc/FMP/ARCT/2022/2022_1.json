    "content": " Importantly, this quarter, we learned from Vinbiocare that the Phase 1/2/3 study has met its primary endpoint objective of vaccine efficacy and that ARCT-154 demonstrated very strong protection against severe and fatal COVID disease, even when up against the most challenging variants that have escaped other vaccines, like Delta and Omicron. Coming back to our booster trial last week, we released additional data from our Phase 1/2 booster clinical trial here in the United States and Singapore, showing the durability of neutralizing antibody response, extending to at least three months after a 5 microgram ARCT-154 booster dosing following primary vaccination with Comirnaty. All of these data, including those was from the current Omicron variants, provide important clinical validations and highlight ARCT-154's potential as an effective booster candidate against a broad range of variants of SARS-CoV-2. Data show that in an analysis of COVID-19 cases accrued between 7 days and 56 days after completion of a two-dose vaccination series, two 5 microgram doses of ARCT-154 demonstrated 55% vaccine efficacy for preventing symptomatic COVID-19. We're definitely pleased to have another productive quarter, advancing our pipeline of mRNA vaccines and therapeutics, in particular the recent clinical data from ARCT-154 that helps validate our self-amplifying mRNA technology platform, our LUNAR lipid nanoparticle delivery platform, and our proprietary trade secret manufacturing processes, including lyophilization."
