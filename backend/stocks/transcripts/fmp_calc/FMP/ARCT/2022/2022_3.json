    "content": " This collaboration with CSL is designed to develop and commercialize self amplifying mRNA vaccines targeting COVID-19, influenza, three additional pathogens and pandemic preparedness. Together, we will focus on the development of self amplifying mRNA vaccines targeting COVI-19, influenza, three, additional defined respiratory infectious disease vaccines and pandemic preparedness, and we look forward to providing continued updates on our plans and progress in the coming months. The award will support preclinical, manufacturing, nonclinical safety studies, along with development and regulatory support for Acrturus\u00e2\u0080\u0099s self-amplifying mRNA vaccine platform technology for rapid pandemic influenza response through Phase 1 clinical studies. With respect to the question on any sort of CSL flu development programs, if CSL uses Acrturus\u00e2\u0080\u0099 technology or its platform or manufacturing knowhow in any way, that will trigger the financials for that program, meaning, the associated milestones and royalties."
