But when we shared this with KOLs, and experts in the field, they do refer to the third shot vaccine data that that other approved vaccines that I've shared where they've shown titers in the 300s and GMFR of 17 after one month, and we've shown a GMFR of 44 after three months. If ARCT-154 stands alone and it's very strong at generating high GMFR's against BA.5 and we have, we're in a fortunate position where we can continue to progress that as a standalone monovalent vaccine against all variants of concern."
