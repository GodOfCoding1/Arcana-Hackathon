    "content": " On an unadjusted for inflation basis, our GMV growth was 66% in the third quarter and 68% in the first nine months of 2022 compared to the same periods of last year. Adjustment for inflation, our GMV declined by 9% in the third quarter bringing the first nine month GMV growth to minus 1%. Fueled by the continued momentum in active customers and older frequency, we achieved 26% older growth during the third quarter contributing to 29% growth in the first nine months of 2022. Having recorded 66% GMV growth in the first nine month compared to the same period of last year and considering the performance in our growth drivers, we are raising our GMV growth guidance once again from around 60% to around 70% for the full year. In the third quarter on an unadjusted for inflation basis, we generated TRY10.7 billion GMV corresponding to 66% year-on-year growth. On an unadjusted for inflation basis, our revenue grew by 93% in Q3 compared to the third quarter of last year. Compared to the second quarter of 2022, our gross contribution margin improved by 3.4% points in the third quarter given our focus on inventory management and the slowdown in the monthly inflation rates. Net total OpEx as a percentage of GMV was 14.2% in this quarter, slightly less compared to the 13.3% in the third quarter of last year. Looking at acknowledging the challenges and uncertainties, we are confident to increase our GMV growth guidance from 60% to around 70% on an unadjusted for inflation basis, while keeping our EBITDA as a percentage of GMV guidance within a range of negative 2.5% to negative 3% for the full year 2022."
