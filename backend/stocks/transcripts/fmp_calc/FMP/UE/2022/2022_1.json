    "content": " We are pleased to report a strong start to the year, with FFO as adjusted of $0.28 per share for the first quarter, up 8% compared to prior year driven by a 5.5% increase in same-property NOI and external growth through approximately $250 million of acquisitions completed over the past year. The first quarter results this year included $1.3 million of recoveries for amounts previously reserved, an expected decline compared to quarterly levels throughout 2021, including $3.3 million recognized in the first quarter of last year. So, we think we can pick up 300 plus basis points in small shop occupancy from what\u2019s been reported and get that done by year-end, which will push us hopefully over the finish line on the 96%. I mean the way I would model it \u2013 I don\u2019t have the exact number off the top of my head, but the way I would model it is, again, I would look at this \u2013 the chart on Page 21 that shows $4.9 million of rent coming in, in 2022 from the leases that have been executed, but not yet rent commenced. So, I mean it sounds like \u2013 I mean just back-of-the-envelope, if you increase your small shop by just over 10%, just alone on that, your operating margins are going to be massively higher rents, and that\u2019s assuming just on current rents. Maybe if \u2013 one last question for me, which is Kohl\u2019s, they are 3.7% of your rent, but they are paying very low average rents of $150  a square foot or something like that."
