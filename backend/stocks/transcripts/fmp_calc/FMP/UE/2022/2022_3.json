    "content": " First, in terms of our third quarter results, we had a very good quarter with FFO as adjusted of $0.30 per share, achieving same property NOI growth of 3.4% compared to the third quarter of last year or 1.5% when including properties and redevelopment. This is up from $23 million we reported last quarter and reflects $7.3 million of new rents from recently executed leases, including Target at Bruckner, while $1.8 million of rents commenced during the period, resulting in a net increase of $5.5 million. Looking at our receivables, we expect only minimal collections during 2023 on accounts previously deemed uncollectible as we now believe that the bulk of collections we were estimating have been realized, including another $1 million to $2 million which we are expecting in the fourth quarter of this year."
