    "content": " Net sales from our combined Canadian and U.S. Cannabis operations grew 14% year-over-year to $35.6 million from $31.2 million, with the increase being driven by the growth in our Canadian Cannabis business, primarily driven by the addition of Rose brands in Quebec and the increase in Pure Sunfarms brands with the contribution from a full quarter of Balanced Health. Total Cannabis adjusted EBITDA was $5.4 million compared with $9.4 million for the third quarter of last year, with the decrease due substantially -- due to lower margin on our Canadian nonbranded sales due to price compression in the wholesale market and incremental SG&A spend in 2022 versus 2021, due to investment in brand launches and innovation, the addition of Rose as well as higher percentage of SG&A spend in our U.S. Cannabis business."
