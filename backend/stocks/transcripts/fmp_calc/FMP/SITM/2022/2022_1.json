    "content": "  Operator: Good afternoon, and welcome to SiTime's First Quarter 2022 Financial Results Conference Call. At the conclusion of today's conference call, instructions will be given for the question-and-answer session. On today's call from SiTime are Rajesh Vashist, Chief Executive Officer and Art Chadwick, Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I would like to point out that during the course of this call, the company may make forward-looking statements regarding expected future results, including financial position, strategy, and plans, future operations, the timing market and other areas of discussion. It's not possible for the company's management to predict all risks, nor can the company assess the impact of all factors on its business or the extent to which any factor or a combination of factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. In light of these risks, uncertainties, and assumptions, the forward- looking events discussed during this call may not occur and actual results could differ materially and adversely from those anticipated or implied. For more detailed information on risks associated with our business, we refer you to the risk factors described in the 10-K filed on February 25th, 2022, as well as the company's subsequent filings with the SEC. Also, during this call, we refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures which we consider to be an important measure of company's performance. Before I talk about SiTime's performance, I'd like to make a few comments about the war in Ukraine and the impact on SiTime. We've had an office in Lviv, Ukraine for more than 15 years and it's an important location for us. This is behavior that is central to the culture and integrity of the company and as the employees tell me, it's one of the key reasons worldwide that employees join SiTime and stay on at SiTime. SiTime's business is exceptionally strong, underpinned by macro trends, such as connectivity, cloudification, ADAS, and AI, which I believe will continue to drive worldwide growth across industries for multiple decades to come. SiTime has a singular focus on precision timing, a category we pioneered and we are leading, is in a wonderful place to capitalize on it. In precision timing, we, of course, service customers with significantly improved products from SiTime that customers are unable to get from traditional suppliers. Additionally, however, with the launch of products like Elite X, we are creating new categories of precision timing and these categories that we are creating new markets and new demand for our products. This is being recognized by customers, leading to a significant increase in our opportunity funnel as well as driving our average prices higher in 2022, across our major product lines. An example is in the automotive segment, which is one of our fastest growing markets and where we continue to build a $100 million business over the coming years. We're well underway, with automotive revenues expected to double this year, over 2021. The same dynamics that work, in data center and enterprise, we continue to see strong growth here. And again, revenues this year are expected to double over 2021. As cloud services providers expand and add new advanced features, precision timing, again, becomes critical for increasing bandwidth and lowering latencies. With some of the unique products that we are creating, we expect to see here to a $100 million business in the coming years. In summer 2019, we introduced our Endura line of products for this market, creating specialized products that are specifically oriented towards mission-critical electronic equipment in aerospace, defense and satellite communications. These devices must reliably operate in the harshest of environments, compared to -- and compared to Quartz-based alternatives, SiTime's Endura Solutions provides up to 50 times better performance in such environments, making it the preferred choice for these applications. In 2020, the second half, we introduced our first clocking product family, the Cascade product line. I'm especially pleased that in the past few quarters, we have seen a huge upsurge in customer activity, based on the performance and delivery of the Cascade product line, with the result that customer traction that will normally take 24 months has been compressed to a few quarters. As a metric, we have over 100 customers today in our Cascade product line and anticipate reaching 200 customers by the end of the year, doubling in effect. With 10x higher reliability and resilience, our clocking chips are being used across more than 20 applications that include switches, radios, satellite communications, video, power grid, and we are getting new opportunities weekly. You can tell that we are excited about the clocking business, not only because of its strength, but also because we have several new clocking products under development that we will be introducing over the coming quarters, forming a very strong business for years to come. As I mentioned in the past, SiTime is a product innovation company, and we are meaningfully increasing our investment into new product development, because this is a golden chance for us to seize the high ground in precision timing. With these new products, we believe we expect that our Served Available Market, SAM, as its known, will grow from $1 billion in 2021 to $4 billion per year in 2024, out of $10 billion per year total available market. Recently, we introduced one of these new products, our Elite X Super-TCXO that I mentioned earlier. We believe that this platform is a true game changer for edge networks, as it delivers tremendous value, 2 times better stability, 30 times better reliability, 2x smaller, 4x lower power, you can see that there are applications that need these features such as edge data centers, 5G front haul, connected cars, industrial IoT, to name a few. As with all of SiTime\u2019s TCXO devices, our Elite X product is fully programmable to within a very wide range of parameters. And this unique capability allows one product to address countless applications, which you can understand, would be very important in a supply-challenged environment as well, at the same time, while giving the customer exactly the product they want. This is being driven by a powerful combination of secular trends in rapidly growing end markets, our expanding high-value product offerings and road map and our aggressive customer acquisition strategy. Today, I'll discuss first quarter financial results and provide some guidance for the second quarter and full year 2022. I'll focus my discussion on non-GAAP financial results and refer you to today's press release for a detailed description of our GAAP results, as well as a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results. As Rajesh just pointed out, we continue to experience exceptional strength in our business and had a very strong first quarter. Revenue in the first quarter was $70.3 million, up 98% over the same quarter last year. Sales into mobile, IoT and consumer, which consist of sales into mobile phones, wearable devices and consumer products, was $30.0 million or 43% of sales. This was down 28% sequentially due to seasonality, but up 34% over the same quarter last year. Sales into industrial, automotive and aerospace, which includes sales into auto, industrial, medical, aerospace, military and broad-based sales were $27.6 million, or 39% of sales. Sales in the comms and enterprise, which consists of wireless infrastructure, including 5G, data center and networking were $12.6 million, or 18% of sales. Gross margins were 65.3%, up more than 10 points from a year ago. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $24.6 million, up from Q4, as we continue to expand our workforce and increase the cadence of new product development. Non-GAAP operating margins were 30.3%, nearly three times higher than they were in the year ago quarter. Non-GAAP net income was $21.3 million or $0.94 per share, up from just $3.9 million or $0.22 per share last year. We generated $20 million in positive cash flow from operations, invested $8 million in equipment and assets and ended the quarter with $571.4 million in cash and no bank debt. To begin with, we expect 2022 will be another great year for the company. Market trends that require precision timing are stronger than ever, and we continue to have excellent visibility well into the year. We continue to target high-growth market segments, including 5G connectivity, data center, automotive, aerospace, along with other markets that require advanced timing solutions. Furthermore, we expect gross margins will remain strong in the mid-60s with operating margins of at least 30%. For the second quarter, we expect revenue will increase between 8% and 12% sequentially, which at the midpoint would be approximately $77 million. On our last conference call, I commented that wafer costs will increase this quarter, and that remains true. We are increasing operating expenses as we continue to expand our workforce and increase spending on new product development, but we plan to manage that growth to be commensurate with top-line sequential growth. Therefore, we expect operating expenses in the second quarter will increase between 8% and 12%, sequentially, which at the midpoint would be approximately $27 million. The dilutive effect of employee RSUs will add an additional 2.0 million shares, taking the total diluted share count to approximately 23.0 million shares. When SiTime went public in November 2019, we granted RSUs, which stands for restricted stock units to employees of the company with RSUs vest on a quarterly basis over four years to five years. To avoid this, we have now entered into what's called an at-the-market sales agreement with Stifel Nicolaus and filed a prospectus supplement with the SEC relating to that sales agreement. So going forward, we now plan to withhold that portion of the employee shares needed to cover taxes and use the sales agreement to sell those shares directly into the market. For the sales agreement allows the company to sell shares for reasons other than tax withholding, our current intention is to use it for test withholding. Decide this, in the first quarter, there were 86,000 shares sold to cover tax withholding. So at that rate, this at-the-market sales agreement and prospectus supplement should be sufficient for the next few years. So to recap, the shares we intend to sell for Texas withholding through this at-the-market sales agreement and prospective supplement are simply the shares that would have been sold by our employees, but now be sold directly in a much more orderly fashion. Your line is open. So I think Art said that we would grow by at least 50%, not more than 50%, I'm not quibbling. But I think that it's exactly what I spoke about, Tore, its comms, enterprise networking, data center as well as the automotive sector as well. The consumer stuff does grow, but albeit small, and the mill aerospace, as I singled out this time will also grow, but it's going from a pretty small base. It's good for us because these are high ASP, high gross margins in dollars as well as in percentage products, and they're very, very sticky. And you mentioned you keep finding more and more opportunities, right, for your high-precision products. So we're definitely working with distributors, and we're definitely working with semiconductor partners in customer acquisition strategies because, as you know, that's where a lot of the leverage happens. But we've also added significantly higher amount of salespeople, direct titan salespeople. And finally, or not maybe so finally, we have our program that we call our CAP program, which is looking at customer pain points of delivery in very short lead times and fulfilling those. That's been, as we have said before, phenomenal success in acquisition because when any -- everybody else has been unable to supply SiTime may always be able to supply something, if not all their needs and even more importantly, higher quality and program to their final needs. We also have just started paying great attention to digital marketing, customer experience. But really, it's firing on all cylinders, Tore. Your line is open. First question is regarding some of the macro conditions out there, particularly some of the China lockdowns that we've heard from some of the customers in the space. We've paid attention to it quite a bit actually just based on the headlines, but we are unable to find any real impact to SiTime because of that. I guess moving forward, we -- I guess a two part question here, and we've obviously been in a pretty tight supply situation from an industry standpoint for a while that you benefited from having better access to supply. Well, I don't want to be a spokesman for the semiconductor industry because we play in certain markets. And so I would say, in my book, even for 12 months, even outside this calendar year between now and 2023, second quarter, I continue to see a generally tight supply. And regarding one more point, which is that we are a premium supplier with very specific use case of our products. So we may be seeing a particularly tighter supply because there are fewer customers, there are fewer customers for it, but there's also fewer suppliers for it, if at all. I just looked at this yesterday looked at our statistics, and our customers are still booking orders on average six months out, some a little more, some a little less, and that has actually remained relatively constant for a number of quarters now. Your line is open. Art, maybe one for you just on gross margins and the tremendous gross margin performance you're able to put up in this tight environment with input costs. I think in the past, you guys have said that you viewed 65% is the long-term target, at which point you'd be giving up revenue growth for margin. But it seems like between data center, automotive, traction and higher-margin IC product that you have maybe stronger gross margin tailwinds than we would have thought. We are getting two premium pricing in terms of the value that we provide our customers, and that is even more so the case in some of these high-value, newer products and higher performance products that we have introduced and we'll continue to introduce. We've always thought that 65%, plus or minus, kind of mid-60s is the sweet spot for gross margins. And I think that's still a good way to look at it, though we are seeing upward bias to that for the reasons that you mentioned. So, in the back half of the year, we generally have a slightly higher percentage of consumer sales than other sales and that will put a slightly lower bias. So without getting too granular, I think the best way to think about our gross margins are mid-60s with a slight upward bias going forward. And then, just on the inventory and the increase in your inventory dollars, I understand that's for the revenue. That capacity has been going in, in the last couple of quarters, and that helps us to get more throughput. And obviously, we have to -- if we're going to grow revenue, we have to grow inventory. So, our ops group is making sure that we've got the inventory to support our expected sales growth. Your line is open. Roger, you gave us some pretty impressive stats on the adoption of the clocking product Cascade with over 100 customers already and expecting that to get to 200 customers by year-end and you expect to announce additional clocking products. I think it would have been material in last year, but the thing is we're growing our standard operator-based revenue a lot as well. So, I think we'll still come out at a pretty decent number for the year. And I think next year, I think it can be really significant. That's been the one product that -- it's not just the absolute amount of revenue, Quinn that I'm really thrilled about. It is the relative to what we thought we do, because we thought it is a very high-end clocking product. And I think in that transition, there's been quite some significant loss, which has been, of course, our game. Exiting next year, I think it will be really quite meaningful, because we'll have more than one product line shipping in that. I'm proud of the funnel, and it's also demonstrating our ability to be a multi-timing product supplier. Because as you know, we started oscilators, and we always said, we'd grow into clocking and resonators. But even at the low end in so-called the standard opulator, not the TCXO, not the OCXO, not the VCXO kind of level, even there, SiTime significant value proposition around programmability, delivery, quality, reliability and commitment to the customer. And I think we are still able to focus on some of the LTAs that we have talked about in getting customers to sign on for longer periods, not just because we can supply and others can't, but because we have a better product, and they are committing to that. Your line is open. I think the United States, Europe that includes Israel in the comms, enterprise \u2013 comms enterprise data center has done very, very well for us. You can think of all the top server manufacturers and that's where we're getting a lot of traction from optical companies, switches, routers, et cetera. So clearly, I would pick networking and telecommunications enterprise data center as my biggest number in absolute terms and biggest number for growth. As I mentioned before, it's in China, it's in Korea. It's in certain parts of Europe, although Europe might be some of the weakest in the automotive area. I don't have anything like earth traveling to report, but it's been a design win by design win, but I don't think we've had anything of the kind of -- that we described the last time and the was time before that, primarily because of those kinds of wins are only few and far in between. But I do believe that the -- what is really good to see is the renewed push towards electric vehicle, electric mobility, electric trucks, farm equipment, bikes, boats, it's just more than just cars and Tesla and others. And I think the auto companies are looking at their the older lines, other companies are looking at all their products and seeing where they can lose weight and adding semiconductors is a good way to remove electromechanical, harnesses, wires, cables and focus on high performance and low weight. Your line is open. And Rajesh mentioned six new products scheduled for this year, which would give an additional $3 billion SAM. I mean I know historically, you've always been very efficient from an R&D perspective, but it just seems like this is a really big step-up. So I don't know how you can add more color on that, whether it's how many SKUs you can get from those six product lines. But yes, any color you could share with us on the R&D efficiency really stepping up with those six new products -- that would be great. First of all, these six new products are across the categories of oscillators, clocks and resonators. So assuming that all of these six are either a clock or an oscillator, which they're not because, as I mentioned, there's at least one resonator in there. But even five of them at 20 derivative products, not all at once, not all in one year, but within a year, year and a half, two years means that that's a good 100 other products that are easily available. Add to that our Endura line and our automotive line, and I think you get some specific products that are really going to, as you said, be a significant step-up for SiTime going forward. But some of them, as I mentioned, are category creators are very clearly products that today don't exist, just like EliteX, which is the TCXO that replaces OCXOs or like the Excalibur product, which is -- takes the world of passive resonators and makes it an active resonator. These are new products with new ways to sell, new ways to adopt that, I think, open up markets. So, to some extent, that world is a little unknown, but it's the one that we are forging ahead because we think that that's what the role of SiTime in delivering exceptional timing products is. One is new products, and Rajesh just talked through that. Electric vehicles, for example, that's a segment that's growing significantly. If that's the case, we will conclude this conference call. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference."
