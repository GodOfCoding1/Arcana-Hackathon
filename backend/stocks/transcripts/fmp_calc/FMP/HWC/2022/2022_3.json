    "content": " Applying the math gives us a potential fourth quarter NIM between 3.74% and 3.8%, allowing that a lot of this is hard to predict, the assumptions that can materially move the needle or around deposit mix and betas and our ability to fund most of the projected loan growth with our expected seasonal fourth quarter deposit increases. Your line is open. So again, in terms of how we're thinking about managing the balance sheet, it may be aspirational, but certainly what we'd like to do in the fourth quarter and really going forward is to fund our loan growth with as much deposit growth as we can. Your line is open. But at the same time, we are pivoting up this quarter, the fourth quarter to higher deposit rates and certainly think and believe, again, as I mentioned earlier, that we'll be able to complete this cycle with the deposit beta really no worse than we did last time. Your line is open. Your line is open. We do think that, that 49% is likely to kind of track down certainly in the context of the current high rate environment and likely to get higher as we go through the next couple of quarters."
