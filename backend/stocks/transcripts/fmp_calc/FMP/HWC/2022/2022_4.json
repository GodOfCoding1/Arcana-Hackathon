    "content": " But certainly, the way we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re looking at 2023 is really to be in a position where between the runoff from the bond portfolio that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll use to fund loan growth, between that and any difference really coming from deposit growth, that would really be kind of the most optimum way that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099d like to manage the balance sheet from a loan deposit perspective. But I think it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s really what happens with our balance sheet, whether we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re able to grow loans, as John mentioned before, a little bit faster clip than maybe what the guidance is suggesting."
