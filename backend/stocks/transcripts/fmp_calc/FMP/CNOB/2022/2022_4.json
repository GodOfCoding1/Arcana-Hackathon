Hey guys, good morning. I mean, is it fair to kind of summarize that by saying, obviously, this was the first quarter in a while where you guys saw the efficiency ratio dip over 40%, but it seems like it's going to be in that low 40% range for this year with the hope that maybe you could improve that a bit. We see opportunities within the marketplace, but I think 2023 is going to be a more challenging year for, not just us, for the economy, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the interest rate environment, it's the lack of liquidity, it's business formation, you name it, it's going to be a challenging year. Hey guys, good morning. And regardless of what's going -- one of the things I just want to add here is that, we've entered times before where things are a challenge, but we continue to produce year in year out very strong return metrics and credit quality metrics and I see no difference this coming year. I think one of the areas that, of course, we watch very intently because it's -- a good part of our business is construction, because there's a lot going on there, not only with the cap rate, not only with what the potential debt service coverage ratio will be a completion, but the cost of the construction, inflationary pressures on the execution of getting a project on the timeframe in which to get it done, so those are things that we're watching very, very closely."
