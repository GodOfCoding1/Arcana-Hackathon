    "content": "  Operator: Good morning, and welcome to First Eagle Alternative Capital BDC, Inc. earnings conference call for its first fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2022. It is my pleasure to turn the call over to Sabrina Rusnak-Carlson of First Eagle Alternative Capital BDC, Inc. Ms. Rusnak-Carlson, you may begin. Joining me on today\u2019s call are Chris Flynn, President of First Eagle Alternative Credit; Jen Wilson, our Chief Accounting Officer; Jim Fellows, our Chief Investment Officer. The uncertainties and other factors are, in some ways, beyond management\u2019s control and include the factors included in the section entitled Risk Factors in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K as updated by our quarterly report on Form 10-Q and our periodic and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Chris. On today\u2019s call, I want to discuss recent actions we\u2019ve taken to drive strategic initiatives as well as review our first quarter results and share some portfolio highlights. From there, I\u2019ll hand the call over to Jen to discuss our portfolio and financial results in more detail. We had a busy quarter working toward our 3 strategic initiatives: one, reducing our cost of debt; two, increasing our portfolio yield; and three, increasing our portfolio diversification. First, we\u2019ve effectively reduced our debt financing. Second, we refinanced the Logan JV into a middle market CLO structure, which we expect to increase the dividend to FCRD as a result of this incremental leverage. Despite a challenging market stemming from the war in Ukraine, inflationary pressures, competition for AAA buyers, we were able to secure a deal that we believe is favorable to our shareholders, and that\u2019s thanks to the overall strength of our platform. Moreover, we expect the Logan JV return on equity to increase from around 10% historically to approximately 14% going forward with this new structure. To show our alignment with shareholders, we agreed to waive $400,000 of our management fee in Q1 and part of the management fee waiver in Q2 in order to maintain the $0.10 dividend. We noted during our last call in connection with increasing portfolio yield, we aim to increase our leverage range and increase our allocation to higher-yielding asset-based loans. In connection with the amendment to the credit facility, we have increased the credit facility size to $175 million and pushed out our maturity date, which allowed us to further increase leverage. We ended the quarter with a net asset value of $6.12 per share, down 3.5% on a quarter-over-quarter basis. Similar to the broader market trends, we have seen a few of our portfolio companies facing supply chain challenges, labor shortages as well as inflationary pressures, including in-place wages and material costs. As we\u2019ve noted before, portfolio diversification and stabilization of our investment portfolio is of paramount focus. In line with that trend, the FCRD portfolio invested $2.3 million in a new portfolio investment in Q1 with an additional $17.5 million invested in follow-on investments, including revolvers and delayed draw fundings. The growth of the platform allows the BDC to hold a more diversified portfolio, with the number of positions up from 45 in Q1 of 2018 to 77 this quarter, while also allowing First Eagle to provide more capital to middle market businesses. First Eagle\u2019s Direct Lending platform has remained robust, and we expect it to continue to provide us with attractive investment opportunities. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Jen. First, I\u2019ll start off with some investment and portfolio highlights. As Chris mentioned, Q1 was a relatively muted quarter for a new activity with 1 new and several follow-on investments totaling $9.8 million at a blended yield of 6.5%. As of March 31, our portfolio was valued at $400.7 million, up slightly from $392.1 million at the end of Q4. The remaining 4% of the BDC\u2019s portfolio was held in second lien debt and other nonincome-producing and equity holdings, including our restructured equity-like second lien investment in OEM. The weighted average yield on the debt and income-producing portfolio, based on costs and including Logan, was 6.5% in Q1, which was flat with Q4. Total nonaccruals as a percentage of our portfolio at fair value and at cost were 2% and 4.5%, respectively. During Q1, we recognized $7.4 million of investment income primarily from interest and dividends. Interest income decreased approximately $548,000 from Q4 to $5.5 million for Q1. The decrease was primarily driven by the decline in accelerated amortization of OID from $367,000 in Q4 to $17,000 in Q1. Dividend income from Logan JV was relatively flat quarter-over-quarter at $1.7 million, and other income of $230,000 was approximately half of Q4. Total expenses net of management fee waivers for the quarter were $4.5 million, down from $5.3 million in Q4. The biggest driver of the decrease were a $379,000 decrease in interest and fees on borrowings during the quarter due to our 2023 notes being fully redeemed prior to year-end as well as the $433,000 decrease in management fees due to a decrease in our net asset value and a $400,000 waiver during Q1. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Chris. Before I turn the call over to Q&A, I wanted to take a moment to assure our shareholders that we\u2019re committed to doing what\u2019s right here. We have the benefit of a $20 billion platform in direct and tradable credit assets where we successively managed private funds, CLOs, separately managed accounts, levered and unlevered for institutional investors. As noted in previous releases, now that Logan is closed later than budgeted, we should be in a position to see NII growth, which should result in a dividend increase starting in Q3. If the dividend is not able to be increased or stock continues to trade at a significant discount to our peer group, we recognize the status quo isn\u2019t acceptable to our shareholders. And to be clear, it\u2019s not acceptable to the management team. While our track record on executing this plan has been far from perfect, our track record of supporting the shareholders and doing what\u2019s right for the shareholders has been impeccable. But basically, I really question whether we\u2019re at a size which makes sense for us to be publicly owned. I\u2019ll get them out on the table and I\u2019d like to get your response, some of which you\u2019ve already anticipated. With $400,000, it\u2019s about $0.01 and a fraction. Our cost of capital is too high, and Wall Street has created a lot of companies in the BDC, MLP, REIT space that only worked if they were able to sell stock at a premium to NAV. But we\u2019re on a vicious cycle, the wrong way. You can\u2019t sell stock, and you know the story. I\u2019m going to take them probably in a random order, if that\u2019s okay. Just as a rule of thumb, as you look at the market today, I think being a public company at less than $1 billion of equity is probably punitive. We\u2019re too small, and that puts us at somewhat of a disadvantage. As it relates to waivers, we\u2019ve said publicly that we\u2019ll support the dividend through Q2 on that $0.10. We expect to have a waiver of some sort in Q2 to maintain the $0.10, primarily related to the expenses associated with putting these financing packages in place. As it relates to the dividend, I think we said in the press release that based on our expectations of the new financing that you could see the dividend go up by anywhere from some 20% from where we are, so call it, $0.11 to $0.12. Excess capital, we have more capital now that we\u2019re able to -- we have more flexibility of capital that we were able to upsize the ING facility. We do have a program in place where we are buying shares, albeit at modest amounts just given the way the program works and the fact that our stock doesn\u2019t trade that much. Your second question, which was related to a sale of the business, I\u2019m not in a position to comment on that today. And if the play results in our stock price sitting where it is today, obviously, it didn\u2019t work, and we\u2019ve always come back and said that we\u2019ll do what\u2019s right for the shareholders. So I\u2019m in a wait-and-see mode, but the period of time that we\u2019re going to wait and see is probably much shorter than it was historically. I\u2019m not happy with the results, and the environment has become more hostile. I mean, mathematically, it\u2019s easy, we\u2019d rather buy back stock. If you look at what we did in the portfolio, we primarily just supported our existing portfolio of companies, which is -- that\u2019s part of doing this business. So we\u2019re trying to find a balance between the 2, but we have been actively buying stock in the market, and we\u2019ll continue to do so on the program that we have in place that was approved by the Board. I appreciate your answer, and I wish you well, and you\u2019re a good guy. Chris, I wanted to follow up a little bit on Lee\u2019s question. If I look at your slide deck, you have Slide number 11 and Slide 29 that really shows kind of the growth of your overall direct lending platform at First Eagle. And it shows that FCRD is really just a small component of the overall direct lending platform as far as the deals you participate in, and then Slide 29 shows that you all have deployed $2.4 billion of capital across the platform, and obviously, FCRD was a really small percentage of that. Obviously, FCRD , it\u2019s not been a good run for shareholders for the last 5 or 6 years as there\u2019s been the notable issues that you all have been trying to work through. I can\u2019t imagine -- as you\u2019ve been very shareholder-friendly, I can\u2019t imagine this has really, FCRD\u2019s, been a super profitable entity for the overall First Eagle manager given all the fee waivers and the low fees it generates. If you think about the beginning of, I guess, it was legacy THL and now First Eagle Direct Lending platform, the BDC used to be the only vehicle that we had. I mean at one point, I think it was like a $750 million vehicle. Unfortunately, due to lots of things that we\u2019ve talked about in the past, they had some portfolio issues. That vehicle has shrunk from $750 million down to, call it, $400 million. Outside of that, we basically have grown private markets business from 0 to over $5 billion. And therefore, we\u2019re bringing in a significant amount of capital alongside the BDC. And like I said in my prepared remarks, is if it works and the dividend is able to be increased and we narrow the gap in book, that\u2019s great. If we don\u2019t, listen, we\u2019re 100% aligned with the shareholders because where you are the single -- we\u2019re still the larger shareholder in the platform. And when it\u2019s trading as Lee said, when they\u2019re above book, you can have -- you can generate a lot of value. And as I said, we\u2019ll know here in short order how the market is going to react, and we\u2019ll plan accordingly. But I\u2019ll tell you as we sit back and we\u2019re underwriting new business and we\u2019re looking at our portfolio of companies, listen, we\u2019re credit people. So to the extent there is something that there\u2019s a shock to the system, we\u2019re able to navigate that. Right now, I think it\u2019s hard to come back and put a number on it, but I would just say, to your point, yes, we\u2019re probably more bearish than bullish as it relates to how we\u2019re underwriting credit. Now we\u2019re trying to reposition the portfolio, hence the reason why we\u2019re not chasing yield right now, we\u2019re not going deep on the capital structure. When we are deploying, we\u2019re going to do it on a controlled basis at the top of the capital structure to minimize any loss given default if there is a step back in the economy. The other question that I had was you talked -- you have, obviously -- you\u2019ve already started working on -- you outlined some initiatives, some of they\u2019ve already been executed like refinancing and restructuring Logan to increase the ROE for that entity. And obviously, I know there\u2019s a lot of uncertainties out there. I mean we\u2019ve got some differentiated strategies with like ABL lending, where I think you can pick up some incremental yield. But being in a position now with a much more diversified portfolio to lower the liability side is what\u2019s driving what we believe to be, going forward, a more stable ROE. If you look at the balance sheet of FCRD on a stand-alone basis, that should be in the, call it, the 8% to 8.5% range in this market. When you add in Logan, because we\u2019re using more synthetic leverage there, we\u2019ve already quoted that, that\u2019s around a 14% ROE. So if you blend those out, you\u2019ve got 15% of the portfolio out of 14%, you get the balance at an 8% or 9%. And I\u2019m not going to do that math in my head because I\u2019ll get it wrong, but that\u2019s basically where things stand. Lowering that cost of debt was mission-critical because we never want to be in a position, even though our cost of debt was higher than it should have been, where we\u2019re taking excessive risk in chasing yield. Now we\u2019ve got the balance sheet ripe, now we can lower our cost of debt to drive a much more stable ROE on a combined basis. And then as far as the ABL lending, I know that\u2019s kind of a newer initiative. If you look at ABL across the entire platform, it\u2019s, call it, a 10% to 15% allocation. There could be SMAs or asset-specific funds where that\u2019s 100% allocation to ABL for institutions that want direct access, but think of it as about 10% to 15% of the book across the entire $5 billion. Some rough approximations, but if you were able to raise your dividend by $0.02, there would be a $0.48 annual dividend. And I would just say that very strongly, listen, everything you\u2019re saying, you seem to be very objective, but I think the conclusion is obvious. And that\u2019s the way you want to run the company, and I appreciate that given the risks out there. And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference call."
