    "content": " During the quarter, the Logan JV returned approximately $12.8 million of capital as a result of refinancing due to the issuance of a middle market CLO. The Logan JV dividend was $2.1 million in the third quarter, representing a 24% increase from the Q1 dividend, which is the last dividend pay before the Logan JV refinance was done. In the third quarter, FCRD invested a total of $24.7 million of which $12.1 million was in three new portfolio investments with the remainder on follow-on investments, including revolvers and delayed draw fundings. During the quarter, as a result of its financing of its capital structure through the issuance of its middle market CLO, the Logan JV also returned $12.8 million to FCRD. The Q3 dividend of $2.1 million represents the return to a normalized quarterly dividend from the Logan JV, enhanced by the more efficient financing structure of the middle market CLO and rising benchmark reference rates."
