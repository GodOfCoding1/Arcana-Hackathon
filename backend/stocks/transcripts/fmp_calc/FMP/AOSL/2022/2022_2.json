    "content": " Second, the joint venture in Chongqing completed Phase 1 of its capacity ramp in September, and in December, we sold 3.2% of our equity interest in the JV for approximately $26 million. Our Oregon fab is currently undergoing a $100 million R&D facilities upgrade and capacity expansion project, which is expected to be completed in the December quarter of 2022. Unless otherwise noted, the following figures refer to the December quarter of 2021. As discussed previously on our Form 8-K, we completed a sale of 2.1% of our equity interest in the JV Company for $16.9 million on December 2, 2021, which resulted in the deconsolidation of the financial statements of the JV Company as we were no longer controlling shareholder. Subsequently, in December, we completed another sale of 1.1% equity interest for $9.4 million and the JV Company also issued approximately 4% equity interest to its employee stock ownership plan. With the above transactions, our equity interest in the JV Company at the end of December was 45.8% and our equity investment recorded on the balance sheet was $376.1 million. In addition, an after-tax net gain of $358.7 million was recognized on the income statement for the quarter and we excluded such gain from our non-GAAP financials as it was not related to our ongoing business and operations. Subsequent to the December quarter, the JV Company completed an equity financing transaction of $80 million, representing approximately 7.82% of post-transaction outstanding equity of the JV Company, which further diluted our equity interest to 42.2% as of January 26, 2022. Unless otherwise noted, the following figures refer to the December quarter of 2021. Revenue was $193 million, up 3.4% from the prior quarter and up 21.7% from the same quarter last year. Power IC revenue was $55.1 million, up 5.3% from the prior quarter and up 7.4% from a year ago. Non-GAAP gross margin excluded $0.8 million of amortization of purchased IP for the December quarter, the prior quarter and the same quarter last year, respectively. In addition, non-GAAP gross margin excluded $1.7 million of share-based compensation charges as compared to $0.6 million for the prior quarter and $0.4 million for the same quarter last year. Non-GAAP income tax expense was $1.3 million, which excluded $32.8 million of tax expense on the gain of our equity interest in the JV Company compared to $1.3 million for the prior quarter and $0.7 million for the same quarter last year. We completed the December quarter with a cash balance of $269.3 million compared to $252.5 million at the end of last quarter, which included $20.9 million cash balance at the JV Company. You will note that our bank borrowing balance was $22.7 million compared to $159.2 million a quarter ago, which included $137 million from the JV Company."
