    "content": " Revenue was a record $203 million, which represented 20% growth year-over-year and was the first time in our history to cross the $200 million threshold. However, we still anticipate June quarter revenue to be around $190 million. In terms of product mix, DMOS revenue was $140.6 million up 4.1% over last quarter and up 14.6% year-over-year. Power IC revenue was $60.4 million, up 9.6% from the prior quarter and up 39.1% from a year ago, which puts our Power IC revenue over $200 million annual run rate. In addition, non-GAAP gross margin excluded $0.8 million of amortization of purchased IP, the same amount as last quarter and a year ago. By comparison, operating cash flow in the prior quarter was $50.8 million, which included $11.2 million customer deposits. We expect revenue to be approximately $190 million, plus or minus $10 million, primarily reflecting the production lost at our Shanghai factory due to the impact of the Shanghai COVID lockdown. The 33% an estimate for the June quarter's gross margin, non-GAAP gross margin is primarily based on the loss of production in our Shanghai facility and some incremental expenses we have to deal with the Shanghai lockdowns and logistic challenges and transportation, those things."
