    "content": " While our near-term results will be impacted somewhat, I think it is important to highlight that our total PC revenue for calendar 2022, including our December quarter outlook, will actually grow slightly year-over-year against a 20% decline in PC units according to DIGITIMES. Revenue for the quarter was $208.5 million, up 7.5% sequentially and up 11.5% year-over-year. Power IC revenue was $61.8 million, up 16.3% from the prior quarter and up 18% from a year ago. Assembly service revenue was $1.6 million, as compared to $2 million last quarter and $4 million for the same quarter last year. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $36.6 million, compared to $36.7 million for the prior quarter and $35.1 million last year. And then lastly, I appreciate that having invested $100 million in the Oregon fab expansion that the company and customers were going to light things up, but given that we are in a pretty meaningful inventory correction, I am a little bit surprised that the company plans to start production in the fiscal third quarter."
