    "content": " As a result, we forecast March quarter revenue to be approximately $130 million, plus or minus $5 million. Revenue was a record $794 million, up 9% year-over-year, and non-GAAP earnings per share was a record $4.16, up 5% year-over-year. Looking ahead, in the March quarter, we expect total Computing segment revenue to be down about 30% sequentially as we actively work with our customers to right-size their inventory. Turning to the Consumer segment, December quarter revenue once again set records increasing 21.3% year-over-year and 4.2% sequentially and represented 25% of total revenue. Now, let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s discuss the Communications segment, which also set record quarterly revenue as it increased 38% year-over-year and 12.4% sequentially and represented 18.7% of total revenue. In the March quarter, we expect this segment to face a steep correction of about 45% sequential decline as we help our customers normalize their inventory levels after two quarters of record shipments that didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fully sell-through to end consumers as a result of lower discretionary spending due to inflationary headwinds and China zero-COVID restrictions. Revenue for the quarter was $188.8 million, down 9.5% sequentially and down 2.4% year-over-year. In terms of product mix, DMOS revenue was $137.6 million, down 4.8% sequentially and up 2.3% over last year. Power IC revenue was $50 million, down 19.8% from the prior quarter and down 10.1% from a year ago. Assembly service revenue was $1.2 million, as compared to $1.6 million last quarter and $3.3 million for the same quarter last year. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $32.8 million, compared to $36.6 million for the prior quarter and $33.5 million last year. Net inventory was $163.8 million at quarter-end, slightly down sequentially from $164.9 million last quarter and up from $129.1 million last year."
