    "content": " As expected, bill rates within our travel nurse business declined by 7% from the first quarter, which is partly offset by a 3% increase in billable hours. Consolidated revenue for the quarter was $754 million, up 120% over the prior year and down sequentially approximately 4% on the normalization of bill rates for our travel business. We're guiding to the third quarter revenue of between $605 million and $615 million, representing a sequential decline of 18% to 20%, driven predominantly by the anticipated decline in travel bill rates as well as the impact from summer break on our education business. You may go ahead. You may go ahead. You may go ahead. I guess I'd say based on where -- how we're looking at bill rates, we would think that with the most significant declines coming in the Q3 and Q4 for the year that our fourth quarter would expected to be the trough on that point of it and volumes are expected to continue to inch forward. I mean for us you can imagine that the spend under management for today attracts a fee for us, right, because almost all the technology that's used there is third-party so that cost is anywhere from 75 bps to a 1%, so round numbers, you're talking north of $10 million in annualized savings on a normalized basis, and I think the deployment or the rollout schedule, I don't know Dan if you want to speak to that a little bit. And as we've stated, as we look to exit the year at north of $500 million revenue run rate in the high single low double-digit EBITDA, if you look at 2023, that puts us north of $2 billion and pick your number between $160 million to $240 million of EBITDA. You may go ahead. You may go ahead."
