    "content": " We haven't seen anything significant directly in the markets that we operate in, but as we see prices rise in some of the discretionary spending categories as well as the inflation that we're seeing in fuel and other costs that affect our players, we're kind of taking a more cautious approach. And they -- we don't expect them to perform anywhere close to the Illinois market, and we're investing early to see what we can develop, and we'll have better kind of information and data probably at around kind of midyear 2023. We have seen a slight change in the acquisition environment where people are starting to realize that this significant growth that they were trying to price their businesses at going forward isn't a reality that we're going -- we had, obviously, substantial growth '18, '19, '20, '21, and -- but that can't continue at those levels. It's -- like I said, the type of equipment is so unique that there are not the traditional manufacturers that you see in the casinos nor even in the skill markets, and that's going to prohibit growth significantly. So we're, like I said, investing in the market, looking to see how the players develop, seeing if the -- there is real interest in a gaming entertainment and the types of facilities are somewhat similar to what you see in Illinois."
