    "content": " Considering the Omicron headwinds, perceived pent-up demand we experienced in the first quarter of 2021 as well as the fourth round of stimulus checks issued in March 2021, we believe 3% year-over-year growth further reinforces the strength of our business. As you\u2019re all aware, we announced a $200 million share repurchase program in November of 2021, as we find the opportunity to return capital to shareholders in the form of buybacks and attractive use of our significant free cash flow. Your line is open. Your line is open. When you think about Omicron this year and sort of last year\u2019s stimulus checks, that 3% growth really reinforces the strength of the business. Your line is open. Your line is open."
