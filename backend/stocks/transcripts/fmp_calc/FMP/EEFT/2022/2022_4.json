    "content": " The strong improvements in EFT revenue, operating income and adjusted EBITDA were the result of increased domestic and international withdrawal transaction trends from the lifting of COVID travel restrictions across the globe, together with the addition of and the good performance from the acquisition of Piraeus Bank's merchant acquiring business in March of 2022. epay revenue grew 9%, operating income grew 12%, and adjusted EBITDA grew 11%, driven by the continued expansion of mobile and digital and branded payments together with the continued growth of the digital distribution channel. To that end, we expect the first quarter adjusted EPS to be approximately $0.85 per share, which represents a 23% growth over last year, assuming consistent FX rates, interest rates and other unforeseen matters. So, when we say, kind of mid-teens, so we're thinking in that, kind of range of maybe 2014, 2015, 2016, maybe for a little bit like 17%, kind of growth rate over last year's total number yet. What we saw as we, kind of finished up the year and what we're expecting is that the EFT would see a travel recovery, kind of in about the, kind of 70-ish kind of percent range that the end of the year we would end up a little stronger than that as that recovery continued, and that's exactly what we did see. And I would like to also caution to, let's not forget, first quarter for the last 10 years has been our seasonally weakest quarter versus it's, kind of a perfect storm of all three segments tend to be weaker in the first quarter. One moment for our next question. One moment for our next question. One moment for our next question. One moment for our next question. One moment for our next question."
