    "year": 2022,
    "date": "2022-10-21 12:37:05",
    "content": " These strong double-digit improvements in all metrics were driven by double-digit constant-currency growth from all three segments, including a strong rebound in domestic and international cash withdrawal transactions in the EFT segments as the strong demand for travel continued following the lifting of COVID restrictions across the globe. The strong improvements in EFT revenue, operating income and adjusted EBITDA were the result of increased domestic and international withdrawal transactions, driven by improving trends from the easing of COVID restrictions across the globe, together with the addition of good performance from the acquisition of the Piraeus Bank merchant acquiring business in March of this year. epay revenue grew 18%, operating income grew 29% and adjusted EBITDA grew 24%, driven by continued expansion in mobile and digital branded payments together with continued growth of the digital distribution channel. As I conclude my comments, I'd like to reiterate that we are extremely pleased that each of our segments produced double-digit constant-currency growth across revenue, operating income and adjusted EBITDA in the third quarter. Taking into account the full FX impact on next year's results, including the accelerated FX declines we've seen in the latter part of the third quarter, we believe that this momentum will still allow us to produce mid to upper teens earnings growth rates for the full-year 2023. Ladies and gentlemen, as I reflect on this quarter and more broadly on the diversity of our business, I'd say that by any measure when you have all three segments producing constant-currency double-digit growth rates, it's an outstanding quarter and consistent with what I've been telling you the business has the capabilities to do."
