    "content": " Similar to the first quarter, the year-over-year revenue comparison was impacted by three items: the previously announced loss of a key German B2B customer in the fourth quarter last year; the India government's halting of certain digital games; and the shifting of promotional activity from the early part of 2021 year to the later part of the 2022 year. Our Money Transfer business continues to gain ground and deliver results, and I will reiterate my first quarter comments that despite seeing some of the early signs of inflation pressure on our transactions, we expect that the growth rates and the operating margins of this segment will improve in the second half of this year, as we lap some of the investments we made in our technology last year."
