    "content": " The growth in the first half was even better, with a 55% year-over-year increase, totaling BRL402 million in revenues. The gross margin for Q2 stood at almost 38%, a solid increase of 5 percentage points from Q2 2021, while for the first half the gross margin was 35.8%, up 5.6 percentage points from the year before. While the CPaaS business still generates 71% of our revenues, over half of our gross profit is already coming from SaaS, which actually makes us a SaaS company. For 2022, this business is expected to reach around BRL600 million in revenues, with a gross margin of approximately 23%, generated by almost 9,000 clients. This combination of solid organic growth with M&A positively impacted our adjusted gross margin, which went up almost 6 percentage points to reach 35.8% in the first half. For the second half of the year, we expect to continue to focus on integrating our M&As and improving profitability, as we add a full six months of Movidesk gross margins into our numbers. But again, as of now it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s important for us to emphasize that while we continue to see total revenue growth still at about 50% a year, we decided that that we need to focus on profitability and generating cash flow rather than simply growing. There was a reason, for instance, if you look our reported EBITDA of minus \u00e2\u0080\u0093 for the first half of minus BRL22 million versus the BRL9 million that we say, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the underlying recurring EBITDA for the first half that has to do with the fact that we need to do adjustments in the year now. If you're delivering a bit more higher here and you expect to start the growth faster yet, that's all true, but we have a revenue mix between first half of the year and second half in CPaaS due to natural seasonality."
