    "content": " We executed well, delivering our third consecutive quarter of more than 30% product order growth, driven by strength across our portfolio, including continued robust demand for our products and services, along with disciplined spend and supply chain management. Total revenue increased by $760 million to $12.7 billion, up 6% year-over-year, in line with our guidance range for the quarter. Annualized recurring revenue, or ARR, was $21.9 billion, an increase of 11%, with strong product ARR growth of 20%. For the full year of fiscal 2022, we are tightening the range as follows: we expect revenue growth to be in the range of 5.5% to 6.5% year-on-year, non-GAAP earnings per share is increasing to $3.41 to $3.46, up 5.9% to 7.5% year-on-year. You may go ahead. Ittai, that\u2019s something that we\u2019ve been alert to and watching for since we began building the backlog after three consecutive quarters of demand growth in the 30% range and revenue growth only in the 6% to 8% range. You may go ahead. You may go ahead. You may go ahead. You may go ahead. You may go ahead. Obviously, the ratable services fit inside there and the short term at $16.3 billion, growing 8% gives you a sense of what the path ahead looks that\u2019s both services and software, but it gives you a sense of what the path ahead looks like. And I think, historically, if you look back, you\u2019ll see we\u2019ve been pretty aggressive on share buybacks over the last several years with the dividend and share buybacks returning $76 billion since 2018. First of all, I\u2019m proud of what we were able to accomplish in Q2 despite the ongoing component demands or component dynamics, the product order growth, the revenue, the EPS, the ARR growth, the RPO growth, the balanced growth across the world."
