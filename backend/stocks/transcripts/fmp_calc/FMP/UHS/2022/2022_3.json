Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. I don't think it's realistic to get down to those levels, but I think it's not a stretch to say that we should still be able to get down maybe another $15 million-$20 million at least in the next quarter. Your line is open. Your line is open. I think we have said a number of times during the pandemic, AJ, that our experience has been that during periods of higher COVID utilization, the Behavioral business has clearly struggled more than the Acute business, there's really no benefit to the Behavioral business, there's no increased acuity, there's no increased reimbursement, there's just the challenge of having to isolate COVID patients from the rest of the patient population, often resulting in some closed beds, et cetera. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open.

Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open."
