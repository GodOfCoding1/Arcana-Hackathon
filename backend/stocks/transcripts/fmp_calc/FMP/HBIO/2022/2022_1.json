    "content": " In spite of global supply chain headwinds and delays in shipments to China, we had solid revenue growth with Q1 coming in at $28.8 million, up 7% over last year. These costs are now -- are over $1 million per quarter as previously reported but we now have much more prescriptive targeted areas to mitigate these costs and we expect COGS to begin improvement in the second half of 2022, as programs get implemented. Our reported revenue will be net of further portfolio rationalization activities, with the -- expected to prune -- where we expect to grow somewhere between $2 million and $4 million of low-quality non-strategic product sales to really improve our mix and help us make this business a much more leverageable platform business. As for adjusted operating margin, we expect continued improvement to range from -- in the range from 14% to 16% of revenue, gross margins to improve to 58% to 59%, driven by operating leverage on growth and continued cost of goods sold reductions."
