    "content": " And as part of this action, we've announced a global workforce reduction of approximately 5% to complete by the end of this year, with the severance-related costs in line with previously discussed expectations at approximately $1 million a quarter during the second half of this year. While preclinical margins are historically higher, the improvements in direct sales of niche cellular products we're seeing, as well as improving operating performance in the primary operations that manufacture our CMT goods and the portfolio actions to come, CMT margins will continue to improve."
