Quarterly revenue for Sypris Electronics increased 13% year-over-year, while orders jumped 110% and backlog climbed to $118.5 million at the end of 2022, up $64.5 million year-over-year and up $18.1 million sequentially. In a similar fashion, revenue for Sypris Technologies increased 17% year-over-year, while orders for the segment's energy products increased 71% during the period resulting in a 76% year-over-year increase in backlog at year-end. Q4 consolidated revenue was $29.7 million, an increase of 15.2% from the fourth quarter of last year, driven mainly by an increase in bookings in 2022 and an increase 17.9% sequentially as we recovered from supply chain issues in Q3. Consolidated gross profit was $4.6 million for the quarter, an increase of 4.3% from the prior year and up 133% sequentially on the growth in revenue over the prior quarter. Fourth quarter orders and backlog for energy products increased 71% and 76%, respectively, year-over-year, and we expect revenue from these products will increase in 2023. Revenue for Sypris Electronics was $12.5 million for the quarter, an increase of 13.2% from the prior year and 53% sequentially as it rebounded from the supply chain issues that impeded shipments in the third quarter. Revenue for Sypris Technologies increased 12.2% year-over-year to $69.3 million, and gross profit increased 5.4% to $8.6 million. Revenue for Sypris Electronics increased 14.5% from the prior year, though gross profit decreased 1.4% to $6.3 million."
