    "content": " Q2 consolidated revenue was $29 million, an increase of $3.1 million or 11.8% from the second quarter of last year, with both segments contributing to the year-over-year revenue growth. The revenue mix for the first half period for Sypris Technologies was favorable compared to Q2, in that revenue from our proprietary, energy, and other higher value-add products, including automotive and sport utility components, increased year-over-year, driving an improvement in gross margin. The outlook for Sypris Technologies remains favorable, as the current forecast for Class 8 production in 2022 shows a 17.2% increase from the last year, and OEM daily build rates are expected to increase 11% in the second half, over the first six months of the year. We are updating our outlook for 2022, with our revenue gross target remaining at 25% to 30%, while adjusting our full-rate gross margin increase to 25 to 50 basis points over the prior year."
