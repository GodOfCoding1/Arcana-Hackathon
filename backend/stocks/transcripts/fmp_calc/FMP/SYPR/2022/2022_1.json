    "content": " The combination of strong revenue growth and expanding margins resulted in a 113% increase in earnings per share for the quarter, increasing to $0.01 per share, up from the prior year loss of $0.08 per share. We expect gross margin to follow suit, expanding 200 basis points to 250 basis points in 2022, when compared to the prior year, while cash flow from operations is forecast to increase materially year-over-year, supported by strong earnings growth. Q1 consolidated revenue was $26.2 million, an increase of 30.9% from the first quarter of last year. Revenue for Sypris Technologies increased 30.1% to $17.2 million from $13.2 million a year ago, with a gross profit increase of $2 million. Revenue for Sypris Electronics was $9 million in Q1, an increase of 32.7% from the prior year and gross profit more than doubled to $1.4 million for Q1. Gross margin for SE improved to 15.3% from 9.5% a year ago with our outlook for higher volumes beginning in the second quarter, we expect overhead absorption and labor productivity to increase over the balance of the year from the levels reported for Q1 and contribute to improved gross margin for the balance of the year. And finally, we are holding to our outlook for a 25% to 30% growth in revenue and a 200 basis points to 250 basis point improvement in gross margin for the full-year 2022."
