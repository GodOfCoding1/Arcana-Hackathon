    "content": " Our fourth quarter 2022 adjusted diluted EPS of $2.33 exceeded the high end of our guidance range by $0.26 due to higher-than-anticipated revenue, especially at our Flow Control segment and to a lesser extent higher gross margins. Excluding all these items, SG&A expenses were up $14.5 million or 7% compared to 2021, primarily due to increased compensation expense related to wages and additional headcount as well as increased travel-related costs. In the fourth quarter of 2022, adjusted EBITDA increased 10% to a record $49.5 million or 21.3% of revenue, compared to $44.8 million or 20.5% of revenue in the fourth quarter of 2021 led by our Flow Control segment. For the full year, adjusted EBITDA was a record $189.1 million and a record 20.9% of revenue, compared to adjusted EBITDA of $159.4 million or 20.3% of revenue in 2021 due to strong performance in our Flow Control and Material Handling segments. Operating cash flow was $35.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2022, up 41% sequentially but down 42% compared to $61 million in the fourth quarter 2021. For the full year, operating cash flow was $102.6 million down 37% from 2021 due to the timing of working capital increases. The increase of $0.02 in adjusted diluted EPS in the fourth quarter of '22 compared to the fourth quarter 2021 consists of the following; $0.40 due to higher revenue partially offset by $0.29 due to a higher recurring tax rate; $0.05 due to higher interest expense; and $0.04 due to lower gross margins. Our interest expense increased 34% to $6.5 million in 2022, compared to $4.8 million in 2021 due to the increase in borrowing rates in the second half of 2022."
