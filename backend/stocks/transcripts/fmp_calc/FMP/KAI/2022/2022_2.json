    "content": " Second quarter '22 diluted EPS exceeded the high end of our guidance range by $0.28 due to higher revenues, better gross margins and lower SG&A than forecasted. Decreases in operating cash flow and free cash flow were driven by working capital increasing $17.7 million in the second quarter '22 compared to a decrease of $11.8 million in the second quarter of last year, a change of $29.5 million. As shown in the chart, the increase of $0.23 in adjusted diluted EPS in the second quarter of '22 compared to the second quarter of '21 consists of the following: $0.20 from acquisitions, net of interest expense on acquisition borrowings; $0.16 due to higher revenue; and $0.02 due to lower interest expense. First one here for Mike, as we look at the revenue guidance taking up the lower end of guidance in the $211 million to $218 million for the third quarter, I think at the midpoint, that would imply about $235 million in the fourth quarter for revenue. But experience tells us that, when you're running at a $266 million level, and of course, it was effectively a $276 million quarter if not for the currency issue, that's a very, very strong kind of demand."
