    "content": " The PK bridging study was a Phase 1 randomized, open label, crossover study in healthy adult subjects designed to evaluate the comparative bioavailability, pharmacokinetics and safety of GTX-102 administered as an oral spray compared to intramuscular betamethasone, which is expected to be the reference products for regulatory bridging purposes, as well as to an oral solution of betamethasone, which is available in Europe, but not in the United States. As I mentioned, our PK bridging study met all primary outcome measures, providing us with confidence that the expected final development step for GTX-102 will now be to conduct a Phase 3 safety and efficacy trial in A-T patients using the treatment regimen and a dosing range comparable to the one already shown to be effective in Dr. Zannolli\u00e2\u0080\u0099s studies. In terms of next step, following the receipt of the full PK data - study data set from our CRO, which is expected sometime in the first half of calendar 2023, we plan to request a Type B meeting with the FDA to confirm our proposed Phase 3 study design and the 505(b)(2) bridging strategy with the listed intramuscular form of the drug."
