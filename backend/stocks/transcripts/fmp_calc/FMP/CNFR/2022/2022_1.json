    "content": " As Jim noted, we were pleased to see our top line growth trends continue into the first quarter of 2022 with gross written premium of 9% to roughly $33 million. 87% of total gross written premium in the first quarter came from our commercial lines, which enjoyed particularly strong growth from our small business group. In fact, Michigan accounted for more than 28% of total gross written premium in the first quarter of 2022, and we see plenty of room for continued market share expansion in this state. Commercialized gross written premiums were up 5% to $29 million in the quarter, continuing a strong overall growth trend. Personal lines, which represented a growing share of overall business, at 13% of gross written premium for the quarter, we reported a 39% increase in personal lines premium to roughly $4 million. Notably, personal lines delivered profitable results for the first quarter of 2022, reporting a combined ratio of 85% for the period. Conifer's combined ratio was 112% in the first quarter, down from 129% in the same period last year. The loss ratio in commercial lines was 81%, substantially unchanged from the same period last year, while the loss ratio for the personal lines was 41%, down considerably from 111% for the first quarter in 2021. Overall, our current accident year combined ratio was 90% in the first quarter compared to 104% in the prior year period. Net investment income was 507,000 during the fourth quarter compared to 532,000 in the prior year period, while the company reported a net realized investment loss of 69,000 for the first quarter of 2022 compared to a net realized gain of 2.9 million in the prior year period. Overall, the company reported a net loss of $2.9 million or $0.30 per share for the first quarter compared to a net loss of 4.6 million or $0.48 per share in the prior year period."
