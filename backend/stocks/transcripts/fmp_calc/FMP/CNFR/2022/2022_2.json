    "content": " Personal lines, which represented a growing share of overall business at 14% of gross written premiums, we reported a 32% increase in personal lines production to roughly $5 million for the quarter. Conifer's combined ratio was 129% in the second quarter, compared to 113% in the same period last year, largely impacted by reserve strengthening in the quarter, as we significantly moved up our estimates for ultimates for 2020 and prior accident years by $9.5 million. The loss ratio on commercial lines was 95%, where much of the reserve strengthening efforts were focused, compared to 76% in the same period last year, while the personal lines loss ratio was 61% for the second quarter of 2022. Overall, the company reported a net loss of $8.4 million or 0.86 per share for the second quarter, largely impacted by our efforts to strengthen reserves in the period, compared to net income of $5.6 million or $0.57 per share in the prior year period."
