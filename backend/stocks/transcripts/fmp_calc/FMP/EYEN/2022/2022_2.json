    "content": " With my transition to Chairman, I will be able to continue to work with the Board and leadership team to help guide Eyenovia towards its long-term goals while also remaining involved in future innovation as we work to expand our technology across additional therapeutic areas and cement our place as the new standard of care in topical ophthalmic therapies with the Optejet device. I was wondering what your expectations are for the revenue per patient per year so we could kind of arrive at a potential market size in the U.S.\n Well, our market research has said that people -- with the Optejet specifically on average, a patient would probably fill that 3 times a year."
