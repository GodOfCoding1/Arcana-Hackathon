    "content": " As Dan mentioned, we generated record fee-related earnings of $834 million in 2022, an increase of 40% over 2021, which demonstrates that our strategic focus to grow FRE and diversify our earnings mix is paying off, and we earned $1.9 billion in distributable earnings despite a volatile exit environment. We raised $15 billion in new capital across 11 strategies in Global Credit in 2022, and we expect to have an active year fundraising for additional strategies in 2023, which should position Global Credit for further growth. And as I already went through a litany of things in terms of what we've done well, $145 billion of capital formation in the past 2 years, I think that we can continue to do that in terms of growing and looking, we'll continue to look at organic things. I do think you're going to see a significant uptick in our equity-based comp next year in 2023, both -- we've made some big grants in February, just a number of our key people and to ensure retention and make sure to reward people that have performed really well and then also bringing on Harvey, and that will also have an increase in our equity-based comp in 2023. Solutions pre '21 or so was -- for 5 years, was averaging about $30 million or so in fee-related earnings, had a very successful fundraise and growth in that business and stair-stepped up essentially doubled initially to $80 million."
