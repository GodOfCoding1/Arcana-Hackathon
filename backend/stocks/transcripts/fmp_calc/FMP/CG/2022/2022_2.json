    "content": "  I want to focus my remarks on 3 areas: first, fee-related earnings and overall distributable earnings have had a strong start to the year, highlighting an increasingly diverse business mix and better balance between FRE and performance income; second, our global investment platform performed well, and we continue to have a record level of net accrued performance revenues; and third, our global credit business took a major step forward in assets under management and earnings power, and we continue to see opportunities for further growth and performance."
