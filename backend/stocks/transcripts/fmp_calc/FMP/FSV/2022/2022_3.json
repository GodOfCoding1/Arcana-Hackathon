    "content": " Total revenues for the quarter up 13% over the prior year with organic revenue growth at 8%, just about evenly between our two divisions. EBITDA for the quarter was $95.5 million, a modest leap from 2021 reflecting a margin of 9.9% compared to an 11.1% in the prior year. Looking forward to the fourth quarter, we expect to again show some sequential growth in Q3 and year-over-year increases of about 15% against a strong fourth quarter in 2021. For the current third quarter, FirstService recorded total revenues of $960 million up 13% and adjusted EBITDA came in at $95.5 million up 1% relative to the prior year period. Highlighting our consolidated performance for the nine months year-to-date, we delivered revenues of $2.73 billion up from $2.39 billion in the prior year period, an increase of 14% which includes 8% organic growth. This strong topline performance growth EBITDA of $49.6 million, a 10% increase year-over-year. We incrementally continue to close our year-over-year margin comparison with the current quarter EBITDA margin yielding 10.4%, 30 basis points lower than the 10.7% in last year's Q3. At the end of the third quarter, we also announced new three year senior note facility arrangements with our two longstanding lenders, Prudential and New York Life simultaneously with the issuance of an additional $60 million of 10 year notes with a 4.53% coupon from New York Life. In terms of our outlook for closing out 2022, our consolidated revenues for the fourth quarter will see low-double digit to mid-teens percentage growth over Q4 2021 including the assumption of realizing roughly $70 million of hurricane work as Scott mentioned.
