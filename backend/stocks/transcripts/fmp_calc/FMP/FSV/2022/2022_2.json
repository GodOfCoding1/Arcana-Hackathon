    "content": " EBITDA for the quarter was $91.3 million slightly up versus Q2 of 2021, reflecting a margin of 9.8% compared to 10.8% in the prior year. Moving now to Century Fire, where we had a very strong second quarter growing by over 20% organically versus a year ago and up 10% sequentially compared to Q1, the robust growth was driven by sprinkler and alarm installation. On a consolidated basis, our Q2 results included revenues of $931 million and adjusted EBITDA of $91.3 million, up 12% and 2% respectively, and adjusted EPS of $1.12 down from $1.21 the prior year quarter. Revenues of $1.77 billion, an increase of 14% over the $1.54 billion last year, including 8% driven by organic growth, adjusted EBITDA of $153.7 million representing 3% growth over the $149.6 million last year with a margin of 8.7% down from the 9.7% in the prior year period and adjusted EPS at $1.85 relatively flat to the $1.87 per share reported during our same six month period last year. Starting with the FirstService Residential division, we reported revenues of $457 million, a 13% increase over the prior year period. EBITDA for the quarter was $50.5 million, 9% year-over-year increase with an 11% margin down 40 basis points from the 11.4% margin in Q2 of last year. Shifting over to our FirstService Brands division, second quarter revenues came in at $473 million 11% increase over the prior year period. This quarter, as Scott mentioned, we were down 10% organically on the top line compared to last year without a similar event to the Freeze, which together with our ongoing investments, resulted in lower restoration margins. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open."
