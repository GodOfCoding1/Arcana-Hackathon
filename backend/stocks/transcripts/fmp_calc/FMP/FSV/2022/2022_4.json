    "content": " Total revenues for the quarter were up 19% over the prior year with organic revenue growth an impressive 15%, boosted by particularly strong growth in our Brands division. Revenues for the quarter were very strong, up about 30% from Q4 of 2021, split two-thirds organic growth and one-third from tuck under acquisitions over the last year. Now under Century Fire, which had a very impressive fourth quarter, up almost 30% from the prior year with over 20% organic growth. During our Q4, we delivered consolidated revenues totaling $1.02 billion and adjusted EBITDA of $102.5 million up to 19% and 23% respectively with our margin increasing by 40 basis points to 10.1%. Adjusted EBITDA came in at $351.7 million, up 7% over the prior year and yielding a 9.4% margin compared to 10.1% in 2021. At FirstService Residential, for the fourth quarter, revenues were $442 million up 9% versus the prior year period. For the full year, revenues increased by 12% over 2021, including 8% organic growth, yielding an 8% increase in annual EBITDA. In the fourth quarter, the division recorded revenues of $578 million, a 28% increase, and EBITDA was up a similar 27% to $67.4 million with our margin at 11.7%, relatively in line with Q4 2021. For the fourth quarter, cash flow from operations before working capital was $86 million, up 30% and after working capital delivered $54 million, an increase of almost 70% over the prior year period. I think, you got to take a multi-year view on working capital usage across our businesses, and I think, because of the moving parts and the seasonality, and I think 2% of revenues, 20% of EBITDA on a multi-year or protracted period measurement basis is the way to look at it."
