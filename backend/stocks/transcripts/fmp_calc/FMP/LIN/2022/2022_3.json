    "content": " EPS increased 21%, excluding FX, while operating margins expanded 90 basis points when adjusting for contractual cost pass-through, all underpinned by $2.6 billion of operating cash flow, and a record ROC of 21.8%. Your line is open. Your line is open. First, the IRA I think came as a surprise to many people including many of the political leadership in Europe, and they have recognized that it has a galvanizing effect in terms of moving the pace at which change happens on clean energy in the US and obviously, are envious of that change given that European Commission requires time and a fair amount of work to kind of be able to get to its point of decision-making. And the fact that Europe also recognized that while they can talk about developing projects in Europe, they desperately need to ensure that they have processes in place to import significant amounts of clean energy and in this case blue, green hydrogen, ammonia, et cetera into Europe to be able to leverage and build infrastructure needed is the other change that I'm expecting to see in the near term. Your line is open. Your line is open."
