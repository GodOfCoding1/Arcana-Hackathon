    "content": " If we continue to see increased demand, it\u2019s possible that average loan balances will be up in the mid-single digits from the fourth quarter 2021 to fourth quarter 2022, up from our prior outlook earlier this year of low to mid-single digits. On slide 13, Wealth and Investment Management revenue grew 6% from a year ago, driven by higher asset-based fees on higher market valuations and higher net interest income from the impact of higher interest rates as well as higher deposit and loan balances. So, we\u2019re almost doubling that to kind of the mid-teens as we look throughout the year, both given -- due to the loan growth we\u2019ve seen and as well as the substantial move in rates. On inflationary pressures, I would say, and it\u2019s still early and still thinking -- things will still continue to evolve, but our own experience here is that the wage pressures that we\u2019ve seen today are not as great as they were in the fourth quarter of last year. And as earnings capacity grows, as NII grows and we go through the year, we execute on our efficiency program, there\u2019s -- and we\u2019re still operating under the asset cap, you -- there\u2019s -- I think you\u2019ll see us be prudent, but we\u2019ve got plenty of flexibility as we look through the rest of the year. But I think, look, the -- it\u2019s clear that on the investment banking side, some of the capital markets, particularly on the equity side, has slowed quite a bit this year, given some of the volatility we\u2019ve seen."
