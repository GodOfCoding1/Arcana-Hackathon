    "quarter": 3,
    "year": 2022,
    "date": "2022-11-07 20:41:03",
    "content": " Core business revenue was $56 million in the third quarter compared to $27 million in the same period the prior year, and $45 million in the second quarter of 2022, representing 110% growth year-over-year and 24% growth sequentially. Cost per test for the quarter was $63 versus $45 in the second quarter of 2022, largely due to the shifting mix away from COVID testing, to more of our core testing, including testing from Inform Diagnostics. On a non-GAAP basis and excluding equity based compensation expense, intangible asset amortization and restructuring costs and acquisition costs related to Inform Diagnostics, income for the quarter was $9.8 million or $0.32 per diluted share on 30.9 million weighted average shares outstanding. For our full year 2022, utilizing a 28% blended tax rate and a share count of 32 million, we expect net -- non-GAAP income of approximately $5.60 per share for our shareholders, excluding stock-based compensation, amortization of intangible assets, restructuring costs and acquisition costs to Inform Diagnostics, as well as any other onetime charges."
