    "content": " As a reminder, our core revenue includes our NGS business, contribution from our Chinese JV, CSI and Informed Diagnostics, and excludes NGS COVID testing from the CDC. Cost per test in the quarter was $45 versus $24 in the first quarter of 2022 due to largely shifting mix away from COVID testing to more of our core testing, including testing from Informed Diagnostics. For full-year 2022, utilizing a 28% tax rate and share count of 32 million, we expect net non-GAAP income of approximately $6 per share for our shareholders, excluding stock-based compensation, amortization of intangible asset, restructuring costs, and acquisition costs related to Informed Diagnostics. While the acquisition of Informed Diagnostics is accretive from an adjusted EBITDA standpoint on a standalone, we are anticipating heightened operating expenses due to integration costs associated with the transaction, aggressive investments in our organic business, such as the build out of sales to ramp on our West Coast oncology lab, as well as lower gross margins as the mix of COVID testing decreases in the coming quarters."
