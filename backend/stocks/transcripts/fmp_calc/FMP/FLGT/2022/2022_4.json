For 2023, our revenue guidance of $240 million, assuming 32% growth in our core business, driven by continued growth across all the areas of our diagnostics business, including expansion and oncological carrier screening through Beacon787 announced today. On a non-GAAP basis and excluding equity-based compensation expense, intangible asset amortization, restructuring costs and acquisition costs related to Fulgent Pharma, the loss for the quarter was $14.2 million or $0.48 per share on a 29.6 million weighted average shares outstanding. The expected 2023 revenues from these 3 areas are estimated as follows: $114 million from Precision Diagnostics, $113 million from Anatomic Pathology and the remaining $13 million from Pharma Services. For the full year 2023, utilizing an estimated 29% -- 28% tax rate and a share count of 31 million, we expect non-GAAP loss of approximately $1.25 per share for our shareholders, excluding stock-based compensation, amortization of intangible assets, restructuring costs as well as other onetime charges."
