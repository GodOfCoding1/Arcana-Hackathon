    "content": " We expect core revenues will be approximately $180 million in 2022, representing growth of 94% year-over-year, which is slightly better than the guidance we provided during the announcement of the acquisition of Inform Diagnostic only a little over a week ago. While acquisition of Inform Diagnostics is accretive from an adjusted EBITDA standpoint, and on a standalone basis, we're also anticipating heightened operating expenses due to integration costs associated with the transaction, aggressive investments in our organic business such as the build out and sales ramp of our West Coast oncology lab, as well as lower gross margins at the mix of COVID testing decreases in the coming quarters. If you combine the momentum that we're seeing within our core business, in addition to the contribution from Inform Dx, we feel very comfortable with achieving at least $180 million of core revenues in this year."
