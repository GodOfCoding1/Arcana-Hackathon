Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Number one is that we anticipate, most of the timing - negative timing that will experience to occur in Q3 and by just and we stated that was about $35 million of negative timing impact and also the destocking effect that we see, we believe is going to be most pronounced in Q3, and people will use the extended August shut down in Europe to or extend the August shutdown in Europe to destock and await lower raw material prices. Your line is open. Q3 is going to be depressed that sort of run annual run rate level because we're going to see the neg - the $35 million of negative timing flowing through and we're going to also have European August shut down, which is normal slowness in seasonality coupled with destocking. Your line is open.

Your line is open. Your line is open."
