    "content": " First quarter adjusted EBITDA of $178 million was similar to the prior year, but with an improvement in the quality of earnings as a specialty segments of our portfolio made up a larger share of our profitability. The benefits and the large favorable net timing variance in the first quarter of this year was mostly offset by about $20 million of headwinds, including lost sales from industry supply chain issues, and lower margin from volatile input costs. We'll continue to use the cash to grow the company and to return cash to shareholders, including via our share repurchase program, which as of the end of March still had $100 million of authorization remaining after another $50 million of repurchases during the first quarter. We expect to generate cash from operations of approximately $355 million and free cash flow of approximately $175 million, which we'll use to continue to provide value to shareholders by both growing the business in specialty and sustainable areas and providing cash returns. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. The full synergies between the Aristech Surfaces, as well as the PMMA acquisition were in total cost savings synergies were $60 million, is what we stated over the three-year period, the first three years, we're well on track to achieve those and we see greater -- a bigger pipeline than that $60 million in aggregate, where it's significantly higher is on the growth side. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open."
