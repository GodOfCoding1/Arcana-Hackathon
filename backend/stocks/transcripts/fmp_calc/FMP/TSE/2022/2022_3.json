    "content": " Further cash generation is anticipated in Q4, leading to expect a full year cash from operations of approximately $150 million, and including the estimated CapEx spend of $150 million, free cash flow of above breakeven. At the midpoint of our full year guidance range implies fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA of $45 million, which is an $82 million improvement over Q3 due to a number of factors. So that's kind of -- I mean, I realize there's some pluses and minuses in there, but I think we feel pretty good about that $350 million level of -- to get free cash flow breakeven, Frank. But in the event we do take all of those actions, the cash cost to us next year would be about -- would be under $20 million, it will only be between $15 million and $20 million. But what we said is, we would estimate that the cost -- aggregate cost synergies between the 2 is approximately $60 million that we would accrue by the end of the third year post acquisition. I was hoping you could give us a little bit more color on 2023 and particularly, as you think about some of the, I guess, the range that you've laid out for the fourth quarter, it then goes from $20 million to kind of $70 million. And if we were to kind of annualize that, it would suggest a range that is still kind of below the $350 million breakeven cash cost level that you've kind of noted. So just, as we think about the puts intakes for next year, can you maybe help quantify some of the incremental factors, at least that you have -- that you're kind of looking at beyond the $60 million of savings that would then -- that we would have to think about kind of incremental to the fourth quarter levels?"
