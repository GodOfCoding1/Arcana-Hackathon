    "content": " To give you some added perspective, a 10% volume increase would represent a recovery of about half the volume drop from the first half to the second half of  should come from a few areas: first, the end of the Asian arbitrage window, which we see closing in February based on the steep drop in natural gas and ammonia prices in Europe; second, and also a contributing factor to the end of the arbitrage window, we're forecasting flat volume growth in Asia in the first quarter and a 10% increase from this level for the remainder of the year. Your line is open. Your line is open. And then we get back to more of a normalized over the course of 2023, we'll get back to levels like we were in the first half of 2022, which is about a $35 million per quarter run rate in the business. Your line is open. Your line is open. And then as we described if we recover -- we think there's a 10% volume increase from this level from a number of factors, Asia recovery, also the end of this arbitrage pressure that we saw in Europe and North America -- and so a 10% recovery in volume from those levels at $30 million per quarter of adjusted EBITDA. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. So if we got -- so I guess if you -- going to the first part of your question, if you -- if we saw a recovery back to the first half '22 levels that would be an additional $30 million of EBITDA per quarter incremental to what we've already guided. Your line is open."
