Looking back at the consolidated GMV for C2B and B2B offerings in the second quarter of 2022, 33 out of the 43 city clusters grew faster on a year-over-year basis compared with the national average and 23 city clusters successfully outpaced the national average expansion speed of the recycling penetration rate, compared with the first quarter of 2022. And the non-GAAP measures, the increases were primarily due to, first, the increases in operation center and self-operated store-related expenses, which were in line with the increasing sales of prolonged consumer electronics and the addition of 103 self-operated AH stores compared with the second quarter 2021; and the second, an increase in personnel cost in connection with the company's growing business."
