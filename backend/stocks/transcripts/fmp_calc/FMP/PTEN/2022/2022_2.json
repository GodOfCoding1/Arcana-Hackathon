    "content": " Pricing for contract drilling is strong as leading as day rates for Tier 1 super spec rigs are in the low-to-mid $30,000 per day. At June 30, we had term contracts for drilling rigs in the U.S. providing for approximately $440 million of future day rate drilling revenue up from approximately $400 million at the end of the first quarter. Based on contracts currently in place in the U.S., we expect an average of 71 rigs operating under term contracts during the third quarter and an average of 46 rigs operating under term contracts over the fourth quarter ending June 30, 2023. And in kind of I guess follow-up there, if we kind of exit around 135, I guess it's kind of what you're saying here is thereabouts, and just kind of look at your contract coverage into the first half of 2023 which I had to do some math there, I think it's about 20% of that 135 rigs and contracted in the first half of next year."
