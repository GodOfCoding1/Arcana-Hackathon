    "content": " Our average adjusted margin in the U.S. increased by $1,720 per day in the first quarter and we expect further margin growth in the second quarter of an additional $1,100 per day driven by a $1,600 increase in average rig revenue per day. At March 31, 2022, we had term contracts for drilling rigs in the U.S. providing for approximately $400 million of future day rate drilling revenue, up from approximately $325 million at the end of the fourth quarter. For the second quarter in the U.S., we expect our average rig count to grow to 122 rigs, while average rig margin per day is expected to increase by $1,100 per day, driven by a $1,600 increase in average rig revenue per day. So the other question I had for you Andy is, what do you think happens from we get \u2013 we\u2019re getting closer to running out of super spec rigs, and then we\u2019re going to have to have a combination of much more expensive reactivations with more substantial upgrades on SCR rigs or whatever, Tier 3 rigs can be upgraded or we\u2019ll have to go to new builds, or we\u2019ll have to go to customers accepting lower spec rigs at lower price points. So if I was doing the math correctly on the guidance, I mean, you\u2019re basically at mid $16,000 a day type OpEx per day for Q2 and a quarter where you don\u2019t much reactivation cost at least non optically. I think it\u2019s going to depend on the quarter and depend on the number of rigs that we\u2019re working with fixed cost coverage, et cetera, or activations, but we think it\u2019s around 16,000 to 16,500 a day."
