    "content": " During the third quarter, our U.S. contract drilling backlog increased by 61% to $710 million as we signed 27 term contracts, including three-year contracts for five rigs with a major operator. Average rig operating costs per day increased by $1,690 during the third quarter due to general inflationary pressures including wage increases for both rig based and support personnel, as well as general cost inflation for repairs and maintenance. At September 30, 2022 we had term contracts for drilling rigs in the U.S. providing for approximately $710 million of future day rate drilling revenue, up from approximately $440 million at the end of the second quarter. For the fourth quarter, we expect higher downtime due to the holidays as such pressure pumping revenue is expected to decrease to $270 million and adjusted gross margin is expected to be $62 million. In our other operations which includes our rental, technology and E&P businesses revenues for the third quarter improve to $24.9 million, and adjusted gross margin improve to $11.5 million. I'll turn it back. I'll turn it back. I'll turn it back. I'll turn it back. I'll turn it back."
