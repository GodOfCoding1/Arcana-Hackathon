    "content": " Last year, our top priority was to finalize the design and protocol of VITESSE, the Phase III pivotal study of the modified Viaskin Peanut patch in children ages 4 to 7 with a confirmed peanut allergy diagnosis. Now in advance of initiating VITESSE, we completed a study called EVOLVE, which was a 12-week caregiver and patient user experience study with the modified Viaskin Peanut patch in 50 peanut-allergic children ages 4 to 11 years of age. Looking ahead to the remainder of 2023, we'll continue to keep you updated as appropriate on our VITESSE III -- Phase III trial progress in children ages 4 to 7 as well as our development plans for Viaskin Peanut as a potential treatment for -- in allergic toddlers ages 1 to 3."
