    "content": " Before we begin, please note that today's call may include a number of forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to comments regarding our clinical and regulatory development plans, the timing and results of interactions with regulatory agencies, our forecast of our cash runway and the ability of our products \u00e2\u0080\u0093 of our product candidates, if approved to improve the lives of patients with food allergies. While as of today, it is premature to assess the impact of the partial clinical hold letter on other previously announced VITESSE milestones, we do know we will not begin screening subjects by year-end. Once we've responded to it, what is it we're going to address the FDA's comments, then the agency has 30 days to respond to us, either lift the clinical hold or provide the supplemental comments and then the clock starts all over again."
