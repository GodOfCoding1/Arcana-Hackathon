    "content": " As we've said previously, we expect the flow of business into the non-admitted market to continue to be a significant driver of Ryan Specialty's growth, more so than rate. In Q4, we grew total revenue 14.9% period-over-period to $435 million, fueled by another solid quarter of organic revenue growth at 10.3%, reflecting ongoing tailwinds in much of the E&S market and continuing to win a substantial amount of new business. I guess, just thinking about the 2023 organic growth guide, it sounds like which being explicitly contemplated are some comp issues and project-related business like D&O, construction and also a net benefit from property."
