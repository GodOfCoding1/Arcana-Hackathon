    "content": " In Q1, we grew total revenue 24% period-over-period to $387 million, which was fueled by strong organic revenue growth of 20.1%, benefiting from the continued tailwinds in the E&S market and the market share gains that Pat and Tim noted earlier. And the flow and Tim can expand on this, but what we're seeing, what we saw in Q1 and what we've seen reflected in the organic growth numbers was a healthy amount of new business, a healthy amount of flow into the E&S market that we were able to take more than our fair share of."
