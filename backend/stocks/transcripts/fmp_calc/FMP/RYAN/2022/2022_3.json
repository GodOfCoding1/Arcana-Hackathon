    "content": " First, while the E&S marketplace remains a standout within the insurance industry, we began to see a deceleration in the growth rate of inbound flow towards the end of the quarter, which is backed by state stamping reports. Our Underwriting Management specialty posted another strong quarter despite dislocated debt capital markets and less M&A activity, resulting in less transactional liability business being bound while continuing to deliver solid underwriting results for our carrier trading partners. In terms of the E&S market, pricing remains firm in many classes of business, with the notable exception of public company D&O rates that Pat mentioned earlier and Cyber, where we are seeing a flattening in rate. In Q3, we grew total revenue 16.8% period-over-period to $412 million, which was fueled by another solid quarter of organic revenue growth at 13.7%, reflecting the ongoing tailwinds in most of the E&S market and continuing to win a substantial amount of new business despite the nearly 29% year-over-year comp. However, given current headwinds in public company D&O and macroeconomic headwinds impacting construction starts and M&A transaction liability activity, we are lowering our full year 2022 guidance for organic revenue growth to 14.5% to 16.0% from the previous guide range of 16.5% to 18.0%.

Like with some of the business that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s come into E&S, could that end up going back to standard lines even if the \u00e2\u0080\u0093 in the short term, even if the long-term growth outlook for the market is good. Please proceed with your questions."
