    "content": " Our performance in the second quarter again, demonstrated the strength of our business continuing the track record of success, we've established over the past 11 years, we grew total revenue 26% led by outstanding organic revenue growth of 22%. As we've said before, we expect the increasing flow of business into the non-admitted market to continue to be a significant driver of Ryan Specialty's growth, more so than rate. In Q2, we grew total revenue 26% period-over-period to $491 million, which was fueled by another excellent quarter of organic revenue growth coming in at 22.3% for the quarter, which reflects the continued tailwinds we're seeing in the E&S market, and as Pat and Tim noted, winning a substantial amount of new business. And recently, we've had a lot of those aspects of our growth engine like take the E&S market for example at a supercharged growth rate, that's not going to last forever. I think the biggest driver of our growth is winning competitively, in the marketplace because everybody's had the right factors and the exposure factors, but it's differentiated us and there's been some data published on this, is that we're growing faster than our peers and than our competitors I should say."
