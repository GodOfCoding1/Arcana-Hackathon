    "content": " To be clear, lower initial yields for the 20 amp-hour cell production in comparison to our previous 2 amp-hour cell builds was not unexpected as it represents over an order-of-magnitude increase in production volumes, including input materials, slurries, coated layers, et cetera. Overall, higher production volumes, lower initial yields, supply issues and hiring challenges together meant that a majority of our time and resources were focused on 20 amp-hour cell builds during the third quarter as we prioritized our partners' needs. While we did not make any EV cells during the third quarter due to our focus on the production of the 20 amp-hour cell format, initial cell builds have begun as of last week. The bad news is, well, it's going to cause us to focus more of our resources on the 20 amp-hour than we had originally planned and meaning there's a delay in getting the EV cell line up and running, but we hope over this quarter to make that transition."
