    "content": " We currently anticipate 20 Ah cell deliveries to our joint development agreement partners BMW and Ford will be made in August and September, we completed construction of our EV cell pilot line on time, and we made meaningful progress on the construction of our electrolyte production facility. While we still have technological challenges to overcome, the delivery of 20 Ah cells is a meaningful step towards achieving a full scale EV cell suitable for entering A sample validation phase and I want to give a shout out to our development team for their strong execution in making these deliveries on time. But I will say that to your comment, I believe it's primarily focused on supply of essentially sources of lithium-ion today, which makes sense because again, they are -- they tend to not want to source things in terms of next generation technology such as solid state, again, it's not something I can really speak to, I cannot think of any specific examples where I'm seeing any one particular OEM placing multiple bets."
