    "content": " In addition to achieving the high end of guidance, we are pleased to report our second quarter non-GAAP per share operating loss was reduced to $0.02 in the quarter. Annual recurring revenue or ARR ended the quarter at $28.7 million, up 19% versus the comparable year ago period. We're guiding for revenue of between $7.65 million and $7.85 million in the third quarter, representing year-over-year growth of approximately 25% at the midpoint. In the second quarter, our operating loss excluding non-recurring items and non-GAAP adjustments was reduced to approximately $250,000 a substantial sequential improvement. The second quarter marked the 26th straight quarter of record revenue, ending the quarter at $7.6 million, which was 26% growth year-over-year. Annual recurring revenue or ARR at the end of the second quarter of 2022 was $28.7 million, a 19% increase over ARR at the end of the second quarter of 2021. With revenues up 26% year-over-year, operating expenses in the second quarter of 2022 increased 10% to $8.3 million from $7.6 million in the same quarter last year. Sequentially from Q1 2022, operating expenses decreased by approximately $500,000, as a result of more effective marketing spend, lower non-reoccurring items and efficiencies across all departments, partially offset by a full quarter of BOIA related expenses in Q2 2022. On a non-GAAP basis, net loss in the second quarter was about $250,000 or $0.02 per share compared to a non-GAAP net loss of $650,000 or $0.06 per share in the same year ago period. The decrease in cash was related to operating burn of approximately $250,000, software capitalization of approximately $325,000, $410,000 for stock repurchase, $150,000 for tax payments related to employee share-based grants, $1 million for non-reoccurring items and approximately $600,000 from other working capital movements."
