    "content": " Despite some macroeconomic headwinds, the third quarter marked the 27th straight quarter of record revenue, achieving $7.7 million which was 24% year-over-year growth. In the quarter, we were able to drive both our GAAP and non-GAAP year-over-year operating expenses down on an absolute basis by approximately 13% and 12%, respectively, while increasing revenue by 24%. We are guiding for revenue of between $7.7 million to $7.9 million in the fourth quarter, representing year-over-year growth of approximately 20% at the midpoint. Annual recurring revenue, or ARR, at the end of the third quarter of 2022 was $29.3 million, a 19% increase over ARR at the end of the third quarter of 2021. With revenues up 24% year-over-year, operating expenses in the third quarter of 2022 decreased 13% to $8.1 million from $9.3 million in the same quarter last year and decreased from Q2 2022 by approximately $300,000. On a non-GAAP basis, net income in the third quarter was about $100,000 or $0.01 per share compared to a non-GAAP net loss of $1.9 million or $0.17 per share in the same year-ago period. The decrease in cash of $1.4 million was primarily related to software capitalization of approximately $300,000; $400,000 for stock repurchase; $100,000 for tax payments related to employee share-based grants; and $600,000 for nonrecurring litigation expenses."
