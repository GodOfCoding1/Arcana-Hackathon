    "year": 2022,
    "date": "2022-05-13 13:52:10",
    "content": " Based on this solid performance, we posted net revenue of $50.4 million, increasing 73% year-over-year and adjusted EBITDA of $14.4 million or 29% of revenue compared to $3.6 million or 12% of revenue in the prior-year period. With that as a background on the quarter, let\u2019s move to our four key strategic areas of growth, beginning with our first two growth levers, increasing our franchise studio base across all of our brands in North America, and expanding our brands and studio base internationally. On a consolidated basis, revenue for the quarter was $50.4 million, up 73% from $29.1 million in the prior-year period. Franchise marketing fund revenue of $4.4 million was up 79% from $2.5 million in the prior-year period, primarily due to strong systemwide sales and average unit volume growth. Cost of franchise and service revenue were $4.2 million, up 83% from $2.3 million in the prior-year period. On an adjusted basis for the first quarter, excluding the $9.5 million of noncash contingent consideration along with the $0.3 million related to the remeasurement of the tax receivable agreement according to our Up-C structure, adjusted net loss totaled $5.3 million compared to an adjusted net loss of $4.6 million in the prior-year period. Total 2022 revenue is expected to be between $201 million to $211 million, an increase of 33% from 2021 at the midpoint of our guided range. And we do \u2013 as I mentioned on previous calls, we do expect our SG&A to stay in that $65 million to $70 million range for the quarter, roughly 33% of revenue."
