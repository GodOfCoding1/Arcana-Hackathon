    "content": " Lastly, other service revenue was $10.6 million, up 90% from the prior year period, primarily due to an increase in credit card rebates on higher system-wide sales, and higher B2B and brand fee revenues. Adjusted net income for the third quarter was $8 million, which excludes the $16.3 million change in fair value of noncash contingent consideration, a $1.1 million expense related to our third quarter remeasurement of the company's tax receivable agreement liability, and a $3.7 million expense related to impairment of brand assets compared to an adjusted net loss of $5.8 million in the prior year period. So, as we look forward into the future, they will become a larger portion of our openings, and brands like Club Pilates and, let's say, StretchLab, even though has a lot of growth still up to come, you'll see less and less of those because the territories and the number of studios have opened up."
