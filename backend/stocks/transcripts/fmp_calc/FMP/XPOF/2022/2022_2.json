    "content": " Importantly, as we continue to open more studios and as our AUVs continue to grow, our profitability increases, driven by high-margin royalties from growing system-wide sales with an active pipeline of approximately 2,800 studios contractually obligated to open globally and only about a quarter of our conservative North American total addressable market currently penetrated. For the second quarter, we posted net revenues of $59.6 million, an increase of 66% year-over-year. Q2 adjusted EBITDA of $17.6 million, or 30% of revenue was up 112% from $8.3 million, or 23% of revenue in the prior year period. On a consolidated basis, revenue for the quarter was $59.6 million, up 66% from $35.8 million in the prior year period. Franchise revenue was $27.6 million, up 55% from $17.8 million in the prior year period. Equipment revenue was $12.4 million, up 160% from $4.8 million in the prior year period. Franchise marketing fund revenue of $4.9 million was up 49% from $3.3 million in the prior year period, primarily due to strong system-wide sales and average unit volume growth. Cost of franchise and service revenue were $4.5 million, up 45% from $3.1 million in the prior year period. Adjusted net income for the second quarter, which excludes the $31.6 million change in fair value of non-cash contingent consideration and $0.2 million expense related to the second quarter remeasurement of the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tax receivable agreement liability was $0.1 million compared to an adjusted net loss of $7.8 million in the prior year period. Based on current business conditions, our year-to-date performance and our expectations as of the date of this call, we are increasing our full-year 2022 outlook for revenue and adjusted EBITDA and reaffirming our guidance for studio openings and system-wide sales in North America as follows. We also continue to project North American system-wide sales to range from $995 million to $1,005 million or $1 billion at the midpoint, which represents a 41% increase from the prior year and the highest North American system-wide sales in our history. Total 2022 revenue will be higher than initially forecasted and is now expected to be between $211 million to $221 million, an increase of 39% from 2021 at the midpoint of our guided range. Adjusted EBITDA is now expected to range from $68 million to $72 million, a 156% year-over-year increase at the midpoint of our guided range. Please proceed with your questions.
