    "content": " The clinical profile we have seen to date includes; one, a rapid and sustained reduction in depressive symptoms; two, a well-tolerated safety profile; three, improvements in quality of life and overall health across domains of feeling, functioning and well-being that were reported by patients and continued post-treatment in the studies where we collected these data, or a short treatment course with potential to be taken as needed and a novel mechanism of action; and five, the potential for a flexible treatment approach in MDD and PPD that may provide optionality to health care providers and patients if zuranolone is approved. In March, we presented data at the ADPD 2022 Advances in Science & Therapy International Conference on Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases and related neurological disorders, showing that SAGE-718 was associated with improvements on multiple tests of executive functioning and learning and memory in patients with MCI due to PD in the open-label Phase 2 PARADIGM study Part A. Additionally in April, we presented data from the Phase II LUMINARY study that showed SAGE-718 was generally well tolerated and associated with improvements on multiple tests of executive function and learning and memory in patients with MCI and mild dementia due to AD at the 74th Annual Meeting of the American Academy of Neurology.
