    "content": " I would remind our listeners that certain matters discussed in the conference call today, including new products and operational and financial results for future periods are forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially, either better or worse from those discussed, including other risks and uncertainties reflected in our company\u2019s 10-K, which is on file with the SEC and other public filings. And I believe last month, we had even talked about on the last call, we talked about the idea of you folks are keeping more kits on hand and there was other attempts to speed up the process, but just maybe give us an idea of how quickly this can be done and also the feedback you\u2019ve been \u2013 a little more information on the feedback you\u2019ve been hearing from potential customers on how quickly the uptake will be on this."
