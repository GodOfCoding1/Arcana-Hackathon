    "content": " Coming into an uncertain 2022, I wouldn't have predicted that we would grow adjusted operating EBITDA by more than 9.5% for the year, and 8.8% for the fourth quarter, all while recycling was down $59 million for the year on a sharp drop in commodity prices. We expect to deliver adjusted operating EBITDA of between $5.825 billion and $5.975 billion in the year ahead, representing growth of just over 7% at the midpoint, which continues the trend of robust operating EBITDA growth that we've delivered since 2019. And in that scenario, I'm wondering if we should be thinking about yield that's above the 5.5% target that we're laying out here this morning as we think about the potential for the yield number to move higher over the year as we've seen over the past couple of years? And Jim, maybe just to expand on that last point, given the margin cadence over the course of the year to get the margin expansion that you're targeting for 2023, it looks like you're going to be exiting the year with margins up maybe closer to 100 basis points year-over-year in the fourth quarter, just given the seasonality and cadence. On the recycling side of the house, I think what's interesting is, if you look at the $240 million in EBITDA, 60% of that is really independent of commodity prices, and that really speaks to the fact that a big piece of it is coming from labor and labor improvements. The way that, I would answer the question, Michael, is if you look at our outlook for the year ahead, we're implying growth from the solid waste business of about $475 million and that rivals the highest levels of growth that we've ever seen in our history. But when you see OpEx, our guidance on OpEx moving the way it is for next year and the EBITDA improvement in Devina said what the strength of the solid waste business is we feel really good about how we're entering 2023."
