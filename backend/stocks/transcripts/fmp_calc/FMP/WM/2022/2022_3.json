Through the first 9 months of the year, capital expenditures have totaled $1,725,000,000 with just over $1.4 billion of that related to normal course capital to support the business and the remaining $322 million related to the strategic growth of our recycling and renewable energy businesses. Your line is open. Let me one add there, and that is to give you a little bit of insight into what we've done with these contracts, just to put this in perspective, if -- when the price drops from $110, and this is our bucket of commodities, dropped from $110 to $100, the impact on that is about -- on earnings, it's about $8 million, $8.1 million to be exact. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open.

Your line is open."
