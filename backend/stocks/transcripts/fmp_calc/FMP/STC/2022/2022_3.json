    "content": " As I discussed before, much of the efforts over the last 2.5 years have focused on fundamentally restructuring the company's operating approach to better position ourselves on our journey to becoming the premier title services company. After adjustments primarily from net unrealized gains and losses on equity securities and office closure and severance expenses, adjusted net income for the third quarter was $37 million or $1.37 per diluted share compared to $86 million or $3.17 per diluted share in last year's quarter. Compared with last year's quarter, total title revenues for the third quarter decreased to $120 million or 16%, primarily due to lower market activity driven by higher interest rates. Total international revenues decreased to $11 million or 20% compared to last year, primarily due to lower transaction volumes in our Canadian operations and weaker foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar. Consistent with the softer market, the third quarter revenues from our agency operations decreased $61 million or 15% compared to last year. On title losses, total title loss expense in the quarter decreased $5 million or 16%, primarily due to lower title revenues. Pretax margin for the third quarter was 4.8% or 13.1%, including purchase intangible amortization compared to 4.3% and 10.8%, respectively, in last year's quarter. Employee costs and other operating expenses as a percentage of operating revenues was 27% versus 21% last year -- sorry for the third quarter, employee cost was 27% and other operating 21% compared to last year's 24% and 18%, respectively, primarily because of lower revenues in the third quarter of 2022. Lastly, net cash provided by operations for the third quarter was $49 million compared to $107 million from last year's quarter, primarily due to lower net income in the quarter."
