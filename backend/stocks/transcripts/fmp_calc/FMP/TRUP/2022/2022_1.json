    "content": " Improvement in our trailing 12 month retention, coupled with expansion in our subscription adjusted operating margin, drove a 7% increase in lifetime value of a pet, which topped $730 in the quarter. Total revenue for the quarter was $206 million, up to 33% over year-over-year, driven by strong pet editions and continued high levels of retention in our subscription business along with continued growth within our other business. However, today with our large and underpenetrated market of just 2%, we are making a strategic decision to invest for growth and increase the embedded cash flow generation of our business, deploying greater sums of capital at a rate of return well in excess of our cost of capital over long periods of time is what drives value creation in this business. Following the first quarter of 2022, I'll reiterate that we continue to target growing subscription adjusted operating income by 25% for the year. When I look at certain markets, markets that we've been in longer, I can see that we could get to the point where 80% to 90% of hospitals in an area are actively recommending us, and that's what we're will be focused for in the years to come. The other difference as well we're seeing is because curbside is starting to pull back and people getting back into that typical workflow, it's a lot more normal for the team to start thinking about those conversations again. The one thing we've been doing, and it hasn't just been in a single quarter, we've been doing it for the last couple of years and you're kind of really seeing it in our numbers more, is really a conscious effort at that very disaggregated level to see price as accurately as possible."
