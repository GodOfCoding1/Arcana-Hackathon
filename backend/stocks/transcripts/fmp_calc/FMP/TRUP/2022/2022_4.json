    "content": " Total revenue for the quarter was $246 million, up 27% year-over-year and led by strong pet enrollment in our subscription business, in addition to growth in our other business. Within our subscription business segment, revenue was $158.6 million in the quarter, up 18% year-over-year. On a constant currency basis, subscription revenue would have been up 20% year-over-year or $161.1 million in the quarter. As a result, subscription adjusted operating income was $21.5 million, an increase of 6% over the prior year period. Total other business revenue was $87.4 million, an increase of 45% over the prior year period, led by growth in new pets. In total, adjusted operating income was up 11% over the prior year period to $24.8 million. We invested $20.3 million or 15% more year-over-year to acquire approximately 66,000 new subscription pets, excluding those added from acquisitions. We are planning to grow subscription revenue in the range of $700 million to $720 million, representing 19% year-over-year growth at the midpoint. Because of this, we expect to see a step back in adjusted operating margin sequentially in Q1 before building back towards our 15% subscription adjusted operating margin target by year-end as our pricing actions take hold.
