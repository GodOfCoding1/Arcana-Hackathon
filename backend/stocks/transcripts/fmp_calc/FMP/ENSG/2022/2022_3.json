    "content": " Given the improvements we continue to see in occupancy, skilled mix and reimbursement, we are raising our annual 2022 earnings guidance again to $4.10 and $4.18 per diluted share, up from the previously increased guidance of $4.05 to $4.15 per diluted share. Some additional highlights from the quarter include the following: GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.99, an increase of 19%; adjusted diluted earnings per share was $1.04, an increase of 14%; consolidated GAAP and adjusted revenues were both $770 million, an increase of 15%; GAAP net income was $56.2 million, an increase of 19%; and adjusted net income was $59.2 million, an increase of 14%. On the other front, I would just tell you the fundamentals behind our revenue, which is obviously occupancy, we feel really strongly about our continued progress that we've had through this last quarter, but also, more importantly, the six preceding quarters where we've had very stable, steady growth regardless of whatever COVID challenges we faced."
