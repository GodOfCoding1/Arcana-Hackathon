    "content": " Our 2023 guidance is based on diluted weighted average common shares outstanding of approximately $57.7 million, a tax rate of 25%; the inclusion of acquisitions anticipated to close in the first quarter of 2023, the inclusion of management's expectations for FMAP, grants, Medicare and Medicaid funding and reimbursement rates net of provider tax, with the primary exclusion coming from stock-based compensation. And so that, I think, as Barry mentioned, I think we're really excited for where we are and the relationships that we've made throughout the entire year with our manned care partners continue to be strong and as we continue to see that portion of the skilled mix build."
