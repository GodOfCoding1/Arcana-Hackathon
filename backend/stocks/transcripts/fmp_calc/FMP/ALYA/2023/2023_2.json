    "content": "  First, we take great pride in reporting the adjusted EBITDA that amounted to $9.4 million for this past quarter, which significantly exceeds consensus and is a good indicator of the potential of our platform; second, a revenue growth of 23% or $129 million, fueled by cross-asset utilization and the acquisitions of Datum and Vitalyst; and third, we are beginning to reap the benefits of a series of measures that we implemented in response to an ongoing global labor shortage. However, if we take into account the following: one, the negative impact of the U.S. dollar appreciation of several hundreds of thousands of dollars; two, the addition of the Datum expenses acquired on July 1 of $0.6 million; three, the increase in share-based compensation of $1 million, which is a non-cash item, mainly driven by the timing of business acquisitions; and four, an increase in variable compensation and commissions accruals, which are naturally tied to the overall improved company performance, so if we take into account these four factors, we can see that notable sequential net reduction in SG&A in the other categories of expenses."
