    "content": " Revenues for the quarter amounted to $130.8 million, an increase of 19.2% or $21.1 million compared to revenues of $109.7 million  for the third quarter of last year. In the U.S., revenues increased 47.9% to $48.9 million due again to the Vitalyst and Datum acquisitions, a favorable U.S. dollar exchange rate as well as organic growth also. As for our international operations, they also reported a strong quarter in terms of growth, increasing 24.6% to $4.4 million versus $3.5 million for the same quarter last year, and this despite negative currency impact. Now let's take a look at our Q3 gross margin, which increased by 38.8% or by $10.9 million to $39.2 million, up from $28.3 million last year. Total gross SG&A expenses in the third quarter totaled $31.2 million, an increase of $6.2 million or 24.8% compared to $25 million in the same quarter last year. On a sequential basis, expenses increased by $800,000 from $30.4 million for the second quarter driven by sequential increases in certain discretionary spending categories such as travel, business development, information technology, and communication costs. Overall, our third quarter adjusted EBITDA amounted to $10 million, an increase of 122% or $5.5 million compared to an adjusted EBITDA of $4.5 million during the same quarter last year. This added to a positive currency impact of our U.S. dollar debt and a positive post-closing adjustment of the Datum acquisition results in a sequential net debt reduction of $35 million, which combined with a growing TTM adjusted EBITDA amount results in a significantly declining leverage ratio from 5.4 times at the end of September to 3.3 times at the end of December."
