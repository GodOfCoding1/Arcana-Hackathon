    "content": " In Canada, revenues increased by 13.3% to $78.2 million, all due to organic growth in all areas of our operations, including continued growth from the two long-term contracts signed concurrently with our acquisition of April 2021. In the United States, revenues increased 44.3% to $44.6 million due to a combination of a few factors, including the Vitalyst acquisition, which contributed $8.4 million, strong organic growth of approximately 12% in constant currency and a favorable U.S. dollar exchange rate impact of $1.7 million. As for our international operations, they also reported a strong quarter in terms of revenues, increasing 32.7% to $3.9 million from $3 million for the same quarter last year. The increase was primarily due to $2.6 million in expenses from Vitalyst, the wage subsidies, which had been recorded against SG&A in the first quarter of last year, some increases towards pre-COVID spending levels in certain areas, as well as salary increases, which again came into effect at the beginning of the first quarter. However, excluding the impact of the forgiveness of $5.9 million in PPP loans recorded in the first quarter of last year, adjusted EBITDA would have amounted to $1.1 million, therefore, translating into a notable profitability increase year-over-year. Our net debt to trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA multiple has also been increasing over the past couple of quarters, but it must be noted that our reported trailing 12-months adjusted EBITDA of $22 million does not include a full-year impact of our two recent and profitable acquisitions."
