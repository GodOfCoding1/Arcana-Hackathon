    "content": " As I mentioned during our fourth quarter call, we set sales with the wind at our backs for the first quarter of this new fiscal year with the contribution of strong bookings, new logos and Alithya's latest acquisition R3D. While adding revenues from R3D obviously results in sequential growth from the fourth quarter to the first quarter, I would like to point out that R3D itself is also reporting strong organic growth both year-over-year and sequentially. Our accounting net loss of $2 million for the quarter must also give you in conjunction with a greater amount of business acquisition and integration costs, namely $4 million related to R3D."
