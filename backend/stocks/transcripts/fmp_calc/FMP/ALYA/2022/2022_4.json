    "content": " Part of that growth is also attributable to Alithya's acquisition of R3D in April 2021, with synergies reached through the completion of the company's administrative integration into Alithya's operations in Q3 and revenue generated by two long-term contracts signed with Beneva and Quebecor as part of that acquisition. Organic growth was also the name of the game in the United States, where Alithya experienced a 40% year-over-year increase in revenues, particularly as previously mentioned, and the manufacturing and health care verticals. In Canada, revenues increased by 63% to $74.2 million due to organic growth in all areas of our operations, a general recovery of DT levels, revenues from the R3D acquisition and finally, growth from the two associated long-term contracts with Beneva and Quebecor. In the U.S., revenues increased 39.4% to $41.3 million as we experienced strong organic growth in all areas, the general recovery of activity levels and revenues of $5 million for two months of the Vitalyst acquisition."
