    "content": " In Canada, revenues increased 80.2% to CAD72.1 million due to organic growth in all areas of our Canadian operations, a general recovery of activity levels and revenues of CAD15.4 million from the R3D acquisition, including intercompany revenues; and finally, growth from the two associated long-term contracts. When excluding R3D, the decline in gross margin percentage mainly comes from, A, an increase in subcontractors revenues relative to those from permanent employees, coupled with an increase in the average cost of subcontractors, explained in part by the tightening labor market; B, increased costs in certain customer projects; and C, decreased software revenues, which typically carry higher margins."
