    "content": " Many of themes from last quarter's call are still applicable today, starting with the macro dynamics at play, the Fed's response to inflation has had a significant impact on the credit market as intended, even with our sector leading leverage, the rapidly risen rates undeniably eat into earnings and slow what has also been a sector-leading FFO per share growth rate over the past five years. Just wanted to go back to that Midwest operator, Dave, I believe in sort of past discussions, you've talked about that roughly of that $5 million, $5.5 million contractual rent, there being maybe a couple of million dollar delta seemingly at risk relative to maybe where market rent would be based on facility level performance. Those are difficult assumptions to make right now and I think the closer we work with the incoming operator to look at historic, where, if we have assets in the area, what they've been doing on their turnaround with respect to labor and occupancy and trying to mimic that with the deals we're looking at, I think we just try to get to the best assumptions we can with the tenant, who has the more local knowledge and localized expertise to come up with a stabilized rent structure."
