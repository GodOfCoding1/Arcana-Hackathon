    "content": " From a household penetration standpoint, total Rao's increased by 260 basis points versus prior year to 14.6% as a result of year-over-year gains across sauce, frozen, soup and pasta. Household penetration growth for Rao's sauce was the fastest in the category, increasing by 210 basis points versus the same time last year to 11.9%. While we grew total frozen entrees dollar consumption by 7% in the quarter behind strong Rao's growth, we experienced significant supply chain headwinds on our frozen business during the quarter. On a year-to-date basis, sauce sales for the Rao's brand have grown 30%, roughly in line with consumption. When comparing total Rao's net sales growth relative to 2019, this was the third consecutive quarter where we grew at a 55% CAGR, reflecting remarkable strength and consistency considering the brand size of nearly $0.5 billion in net sales. Adjusted operating expenses of $32.5 million increased by $7.5 million or 30.2% over the prior year period, primarily due to increased spending behind marketing, R&D and G&A as we invested in our brands, talent and capabilities to drive growth for the long term. Our updated guidance reflects 16% organic sales growth year-to-date and confidence in our continued growth momentum through the balance of the year, including the benefit from incremental pricing on our Rao's sauce that just went into effect. So the sauce in our volume, and we see our volume growth is very, very strong on the Rao's sauce brand, up 23% unit consumption, unit velocity is up 7%. So we're very, very pleased with the growth that we've seen in the first half of the year, 16% net sales through the first half, 12% volume growth."
