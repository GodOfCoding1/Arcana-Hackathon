    "content": " Post quarter-end, Dynamic Product Tankers one of our shipping investments closed on the sale of three ships, which will be generating an additional $18 million in cash proceeds at our December 31 NAV in the March quarter. So for the next two quarters, we intend to declare a base dividend of $0.31 per share plus a supplemental dividend in an amount such that the base and supplemental combined will equal the prior-quarter's net investment income per share. Moving to the AINV's investment activity, new corporate lending commitments for the quarter totaled $271 million across 24 companies for an average new commitment of a $11.3 million. During the December quarter the fair value of AINV's investment in Merx increased by $3.4 million, or 1.1% as aircraft leasing fundamentals are showing minor improvements. At the end of December investments on non-accrual status totaled $14 million, or 0.5% of the total portfolio at fair value down from $28 million or 1.1% last quarter. Total investment income was $55 million for the quarter up 3.9% quarter-over-quarter, reflecting higher fee income and prepayment income, as well as higher interest income partially offset by lower dividends.
