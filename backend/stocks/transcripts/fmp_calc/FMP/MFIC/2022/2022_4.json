    "content": " At the end of December, net asset value per share was $15.10, a decline of 2.3% quarter-over-quarter, mostly due to losses outside of our first-lien corporate lending strategy. Post quarter end, Merx executed a significant transaction by selling its interest in a joint venture and repaid roughly $62 million to MFIC, which was applied to the revolver, reducing the size of MFIC's investment in Merx to approximately $199 million or 8.3% of the portfolio at fair value. Moving to our quarterly dividend, given the benefit we are seeing from higher base rates, the exit of lower yielding and nonearning legacy assets and the expected benefit from our new fee structure, which became effective on January 01, 2023, our board has increased MFIC's regular quarterly dividend by $0.01 from $0.37 to $0.38, which equates to a 10% dividend yield based on December NAV. In the December quarter, MFIC's new corporate lending commitments totaled $73 million across nine companies for an average new commitment of $8.1 million. Although no stock was purchased during the quarter, we believe MFIC's trading discount to NAV implies a loss rate significantly higher than our first lien corporate lending portfolio has experienced over the last 6.5 years. When we think about the exposure there, the good news from a software standpoint is oftentimes, the software itself is the different companies are targeting different underlying markets with different fundamentals and oftentimes, we're creating -- those deals typically are at an even lower LTV than our average LTV across our leverage lending portfolio, which is roughly 50%."
