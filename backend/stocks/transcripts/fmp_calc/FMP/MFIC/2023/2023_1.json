    "content": " In connection with today's changes, the BDC has elected to change its name from Apollo Incorporation to MidCap Financial Investment Corporation, which reflects fees investment strategy of primarily investing in loans originated by MidCap Financial. Adjusting for net paydowns post quarter end, including a $15 million cash paydown from Merck's and including the impact of the $30 million investment from MidCap Financial, which is expected to close in the next week, net leverage is currently approximately 1.45 times. So first, I'd say like, it's not really a shifted investment, it's really sort of a demarcation point where we think the investment strategy is the - really the story going forward as we exit out of non-core and sort of moving away from Merck's. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. By the same token, if there is - so we have a strong relationship with, especially if it came to our channel, and it's got $100 million, six times, I don't know, say, $750 million deal that is more core to ADS strategy, we could potentially do a portion of that in AINV as well. Your line is open. Your line is open."
