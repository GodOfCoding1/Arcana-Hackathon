    "content": " The highest growth over the past five years, this growth was mainly driven by improvements in consumer loans, which also increased by nearly 5%, partially offset by corporates' demand levels, which are still soft. Our solid performance in insurance fees after the renewal for an annual mortgage policy combined with higher financial advisory services were partially offset by the 15% year-on-year decrease in credit card fees, due to extraordinary revenues that were registered in 2021, coupled with a higher cost in the current business and cost increases on the reward programs. Gross operating income increased 2% year-on-year, mainly due to the growth in net interest income, driven by the performance of both our individual loans and deposits and interest rate increases.
