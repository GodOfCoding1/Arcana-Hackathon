    "content": " As shown on this Slide 9, commercial loans increased 3.4% year-on-year, driven by a high single-digit increase among mid market businesses and meet single-digit increase in government and financial entities. When we got to funding on Slide 10, total deposits increased 7% year-on-year and 9% sequentially, like the previous quarter deposits were driven by term deposits, increasing a bit more than 30% year-on-year on the back of a higher interest rate environment. As you can see on Slide 12, net interest incomes have a solid double-digit increase of 24% year-on-year and almost 9% quarter-on-quarter, Mainly driven by higher return volumes in loans and deposits, as well as the higher interest rates we've been discussing."
