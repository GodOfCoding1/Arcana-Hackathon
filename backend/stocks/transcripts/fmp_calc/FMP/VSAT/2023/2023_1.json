    "content": " I think just to go back to what I said before in response to Landon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s question, really the issue for us is just trying to assess all those different synergy opportunities, which ones have the greatest growth opportunities, where can we play, where can we be the most successful, and just make sure that we're focused on that, but there's definitely that's \u00e2\u0080\u0093 those are the two main threads, when it comes to the Tactical Data Links and kind of the satellite services, space services, mobility businesses that we're growing. So rather than \u00e2\u0080\u0093 one thing you can imagine as well, if I just sold a whole bunch of it for the life of the satellite at the beginning, maybe I'd be getting rid of risk, but on the other hand, my opportunity to sort of groom that base and identify the applications and the customers that placed the most value on it, or to use it in new markets where we can apply additional products and services to increase the value, that's what's really enabled us to grow the revenue and the margins on the existing satellites for the last 10 or 11 years that we've been doing this."
