We've done a ton of work on space sustainability, which is really, I think, is going to be a very big factor in how the entire LEO market develops, especially given filings for close to 100,000 new LEOs in the last few -- couple of quarters. Your line is open. There's -- the other thing that we're doing as well is people are doing sort of a similar thing, relaying among other NGSO satellites, and that's another area that we've been really successful in. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. What we do think is that a hybrid approach or a multi-orbit approach which you're seeing, I'd say, more operators kind of come to the conclusion that multi-orbit hybrid makes complete sense as One we can say that I think that's a lot more likely long-term solution. Your line is open. I'd also refer you to research that others have published, including there's an NSS study that was done by that calculated for the number -- for satellites that are, let's say, have the same characteristics in the roughly 600-kilometer of orbit, it's like low tens of thousands of satellites before debris starts growing without bonds, and you can't even maintain that many satellites in orbit because of the collision -- So it's a real issue."
