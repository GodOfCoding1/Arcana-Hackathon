    "content": " We believe the comprehensive steps we've taken over the past year will generate pretax annualized cost savings, totaling approximately $19.5 million, up about 3.5 times from the $5.5 million originally upon the completion of our plan in the second quarter of 2023. Now, our revenue by product line for the full year was as follows: CNC machining climbed 35% to $58.4 million or 36.2% of total revenue, reflecting our ability to drive strategic growth following the acquisitions we completed in the first half of 2021. For the full year, adjusted EBITDA totaled $24.9 million versus $34.4 million in 2021, primarily due to recurring public company expenses totaling approximately $7 million. In quarter four, our CapEx was reduced as expected to $2.2 million and totaled $13.2 million for the full year, which is slightly ahead of our annual plan, included payments from previous commitments made in 2021. Upon completing its first full year as the New York Stock Exchange listed company, Fathom further solidified its foundation to drive profitable long-term growth by launching a $19.5 million optimization plan, creating a premier NPI facility in Hartland, Wisconsin, increasing the company's investment in new technologies, revamping the sales team, and strengthening our core capabilities.
