    "content": " Tag sales declined 9% to $900,000 from $1 million and software and related consulting services was flat at approximately $500,000 in the quarter. For the six-month period revenue increased 20% year-over-year to $11.5 million from $9.6 million that included verification and certification services up 11% to $7.7 million from $7 million and tag sales up 12% to $1.9 million from $1.7 million, software and consulting revenue nearly doubled to $1.9 million. Six-month net income was $700,000 or $0.12 per share, which was down compared to the prior year because remember last year we booked a little over $1 million into our other income for our PPP loan forgiveness. The company generated $2.3 million in net cash from operations in the first half of 2022, up 40% from $1.6 million a year ago. And at June 30, our cash and cash equivalents balance had increased 18% to $6.4 million from $5.4 million at 2021 year-end."
