    "content": " However, despite the lending recessionary indicators increasing and potential negative impacts of the ongoing banking crisis, the employment market remains relatively strong and supportive of continued rent growth for many multifamily assets, although we do see a slower rate than we have seen over the previous 2 years. During the period ended December 31, we identified one additional loan, collateralized by a multifamily property and with an unpaid principal balance of $12.8 million as impaired due to monetary default and we individually evaluated that asset. We disclosed in the 10-K upon adoption of CECL on January 1, 2023 of this year, we expect that based on current expectations of future economic conditions, our general allowance for credit losses on loans held for investment, including future loan funding commitments, will be between $3 million and $4 million or 30 basis points and 40 basis points of the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s total loan commitment balance of $1.1 million as of December 31. As mentioned, we experienced $45 million of loan payoffs during the quarter and at quarter end, our total loan portfolio announcing principal balance of $1.1 billion."
