    "content": " Our manager is one of the nation's largest capital providers in the multifamily and seniors housing space, executing over $17 billion in transaction volume last year, and servicing over $50 billion -- a $50 billion portfolio, employing 600 employees in more than 30 offices nationwide. In order to continue growing our portfolio on a leveraged basis to fully deploy the capital we raised in Q1 of this year and take advantage of our manager's significant pipeline of loans, we are actively focused on executing a loan financing transaction to leverage newly acquired loans. I think from a borrower perspective, we've seen a bit more or anecdotally, a bit more of a return to longer-term holds in general, which would suggest folks trying to lock in permanent financing perhaps sooner than the strategy of the past couple of years, which for many has been focused on flipping assets by doing some rehab, not all the rehab, selling into a new party who completes the rehab and then they sell to a new party who hold the asset long-term. I think the number is probably somewhere closer to $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion with respect to the -- with -- because if you think about the rights offering and the capital we raised incremental with the term loan, that's been deployed on an unlevered basis, right? So I think that if we're able to -- I think we're going to be able to -- or I'd like to say we expect to be able to and have cautiously optimistic that we're going to be able to execute a transaction, whether it's a CLO, which I think is ideal, but there are other alternatives that we're speaking to folks about that would be perhaps as attractive."
