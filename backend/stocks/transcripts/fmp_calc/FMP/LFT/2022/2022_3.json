    "content": " Our manager is one of the nation's largest capital providers in the multifamily and seniors housing space, executing over $17 billion in total transaction volume last year and servicing a $50 billion portfolio and employing over 600 employees in 30 offices nationwide. Excluding the impact of exit and prepayment fees on loan payoffs, which were included in net interest income in our P&L, our interest income increased during the quarter by approximately $3.3 million, from $11.2 million in Q2 to $14.5 million in Q3. Based on our review of the asset and the current Chicago office market conditions, an additional reserve of $1.5 million was recorded for this impaired loan in quarter ended September 30, resulting in a total allowance for loan losses on our balance sheet of $1.9 million as of September 30, again, solely related to the Chicago office loan. We experienced $35 million in loan payoffs during the quarter, and at quarter end our total loan portfolio outstanding principal balance was $1.04 billion, which represents a 1% increase in portfolio size quarter-over-quarter and a 30% increase relative to third quarter of 2023. But that would -- that could still -- if we levered call it $100 million of capital, you're still -- that's call it $400 to $450 million of assets at the lower-end."
