    "content": " Could you -- that's really helpful kind of revenue color, but I was just curious on the peak versus off-peak performance because that was a trend that you saw really strong peaks and maybe offtake is not as strong and how you're thinking about as we exit the peak summer travel period. As we exit the summer, we will rely on more on business traffic and we have a high degree of confidence that, that's just going to be perfectly fine, and we're going to continue to accelerate as we go through the fourth quarter with October being an incredibly strong business month given where we see business trends today. The fact that we're 350 basis points already away from 2019 margins with whatever you think the CASM-ex number is going to ultimately get to however high inflation is, it's going to be meaningfully better than the 16% we have in this quarter, and that's going to go straight to the margin."
