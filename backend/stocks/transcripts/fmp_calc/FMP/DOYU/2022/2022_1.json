Second, the new games that belong to our platform in 2021 enabled us to continue to increase our MAU, partially offsetting the impact of terminating content rights for selected eSport tournaments. Despite a slow pace of the launch of new games last year, we were able to attract and retain users by offering them high quality gaming content within our collaboration with game developers and refining our customized operations for each game. For traditional eSports games, we have been hosting tournaments for professionals and amateurs, and are able to ensure a consistent supply of high-quality content, while remains the scalability of our platform traffic and increasing users' retention rate. Second, the MAUs impacted by our copyright strategy adjustment was generated by users who mainly view official tournaments other than streamers livestreaming content."
