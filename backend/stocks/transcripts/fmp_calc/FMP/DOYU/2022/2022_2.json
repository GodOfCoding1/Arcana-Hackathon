However, thanks to our high-quality streamers segmented and refined content such as self-produced tournaments, we retained old users and attracting new users during the quarter. Second, we collaborated with game developers to launch promotional activities to attract new platform users, partially offsetting a portion of the decrease in MAUs that resulted from our no longer purchasing certain copyright content. Based on users differentiating preferences and game features, we collaborated with well-known streamers, game developers and distributors to customize high-quality IP content shows, further enriching our content ecosystem by integrating livestreaming, video graphics and interactive communities. In the second quarter, we continued to enhance the diversified content system for our self-produced tournaments and increased investment in self-produced content with a focus on refining content and operations based on game categories. Operator, we are ready for next question.

Operator, we are ready for next question."
