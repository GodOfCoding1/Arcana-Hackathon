    "content": " We both retain our current user base and attracting new users by developing high quality content, while optimizing each game segment's rate of return by enhancing existing value-added services and launching new ones. However, we were able to stabilize traffic by increasing our investment in self-produced content and the combination of high quality tournament-related content and streamer content on our platform has helped us retain existing users and attract new ones. This type of content featuring programmers in entertainment oriented gameplay enhances community resonance and engagement in its gaming segments, attracting new users and re-engaging in-active users. Our total paying user count in the third quarter was 5.6 million with an average quarterly ARPU of RMB319 as we maintained our efforts to promote rational consumption we dynamically modified and fine-tuned our platform's teaching functions and operations, including canceling low ROI promotional activities for new paying users."
