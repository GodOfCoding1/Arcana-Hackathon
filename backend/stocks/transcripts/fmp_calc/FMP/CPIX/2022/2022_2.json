    "content": " Fueled by the initial Sancuso sales, our product portfolio of FDA-approved brands delivered combined revenues of $10.3 million during the second quarter 2022, a 14% increase of prior year period. As a result of the Sancuso acquisition, our total assets have grown to $93 million by the end of the second quarter, with $53 million in total liabilities and nearly $40 million of shareholders' equity. Net revenue by product for the second quarter of 2022 included $3.6 million for Kristalose, $3.4 million for Sancuso, 1.6 million for Vibativ and $1.2 million for Caldolor. Year-to-date product revenues totaled $7.5 million for Kristalose, $6.8 million for Sancuso, $4.1 million for Vibativ and $2.2 million for Caldolor. I'm pleased to report that since Vibativ's launch in late 2018, it has delivered a total cash contribution of $30 million to our business and therefore, has begun generating a return on our $25 million investment. As of June 30, 2022, we had $92.5 million in total assets, including $18.2 million in cash and cash equivalents; liabilities totaled $53.3 million, including $19 million on our credit facility."
