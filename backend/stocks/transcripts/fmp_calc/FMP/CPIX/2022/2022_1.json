    "content": " To support this transaction, we extended our bank line of credit for a new 3-year term and we expanded the facility to provide up to $20 million in capital, and that line was utilized to fund the Sancuso acquisition. Fueled by the addition of initial Sancuso sales, our product portfolio of FDA-approved brands delivered combined revenues of $11.2 million during the first quarter of 2022, a 6% increase over the prior year period. For the first 3 months ended March 31, 2022, net revenues from continuing operations were $11.2 million, a 6% increase over the $10.5 million in revenue recorded during the prior year period. Net revenues by product for the first quarter of 2022 included $3.9 million for Kristalose, $3.4 million for Sancuso, $2.5 million for Vibativ and nearly $1 million for Caldolor. I'm pleased to report that since the product's launch in late 2018, it has delivered a total cash contribution of approximately $29 million to our business and therefore, has now begun generating a return on our $25 million investment. A total of $34 million in new assets were added as a result of the acquisition, including approximately $21 million in inventory, $12 million of intangible assets and $1 million of goodwill due to the amortization of intangibles and the sale of inventory, the value of these assets totaled $16 million at the end of the first quarter. The financial terms of the Sancuso acquisition included a $13.5 million payment upon closing, up to $3.5 million in milestone payments and tiered royalties of up to 10% on net product sales. We are developing the final valuation of the Sancuso transaction, but on a preliminary basis, we estimate a total of $19 million in new assets added as a result of the acquisition, including approximately $5 million in inventory, $12 million of intangible assets and $1 million of goodwill."
