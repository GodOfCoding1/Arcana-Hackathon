    "content": " Our gross margins remained attractive in 2022, resulting in a favorable EBITDA and a total of $8.5 million in cash generated from operations for the year. Our balance sheet remains strong as we ended 2022 with $93 million in total assets, $20 million in cash, $57 million in liabilities and $36 million in shareholders' equity. For the three months ended December 31, 2022, net revenue from continuing operations were $9.1 million, a nearly 10% increase over the $8.3 million in revenue recorded during the prior year period. Net revenues by product for the fourth quarter of 2022 included $2.4 million for Sancuso, $3.8 million for Kristalose, $1.5 million for Vibativ and $1.8 million for Caldolor. With that in mind, I'm pleased to report that net revenues for the full year 2022 were $42 million, up 17% over the $36 million in revenue in 2021. Also, please note that the adjusted earnings calculations do not include the additional benefit of the $1.5 million of Vibativ and Sancuso cost of goods during the quarter, which was a $4.8 million benefit for the full 2022 year. As a result, and taking into account all of these items, total cash flow from operations was $8.5 million in 2022, a $2.2 million increase over the $6.3 million during the prior year."
