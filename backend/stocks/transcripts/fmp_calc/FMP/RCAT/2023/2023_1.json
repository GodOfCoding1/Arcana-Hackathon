    "content": " In summary, we have new products, new software capabilities, a new production facility and organic growth from Rotor Riot, Fat Shark and Teal Drones and expect the Skycopter, our least mature product to be very important revenue generator next year. I am very pleased to confirm that fiscal \u00e2\u0080\u009823 is off to a resounding start as revenues for the first quarter totaled $3.1 million, which represents 120% growth compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2022. A key driver of our cash burn in addition to building the Teal organization has been building inventory levels, which totaled $6.4 million at the end of the first fiscal quarter of \u00e2\u0080\u009823. And as I mentioned in some of my comments in my press releases that we are now going from PVT to mass production and ramp, which we take all the things that we learned from the PVT stage and now we basically fix any issues and problems and vendors and tooling that we want to do to automate production line so that we can really scale it as we \u00e2\u0080\u0093 if we get any of these RFPs we are going to have to start producing a lot of drones very quickly. Still cautious, but we did a lot of ordering and thanks to the Teal team and Dr. Evans for getting us to put orders in last year, we are in pretty good shape with our supply chain and chipsets to be able to continue to ramp Teal\u00e2\u0080\u0099s revenue from where it was two quarters ago basically zero to a $1 million to pretty dramatic revenue growth over the next few quarters."
