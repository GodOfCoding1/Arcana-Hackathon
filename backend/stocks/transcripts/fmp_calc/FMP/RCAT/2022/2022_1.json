    "content": " Our strategy to acquire synergistic drone technologies and platforms continued to move forward, as we completed our first full quarter of operations for Fat Shark, closed on the acquisition of Skypersonic in May, signed a Letter of Intent to acquire Teal in July and then close on that acquisition at the end of August. Our adjusted net loss in the first quarter of \u201822 -- 2022, excuse me, which excludes non-cash expenses related to derivative liabilities and stock-based comp, both to employees and service providers, totaled only $1.1 million in Q1 '22."
