    "content": " During the quarter, we leased approximately 203,000 square feet, which was in line with our expectations and about 7.5% more than the leasing we accomplished in last year's first quarter. Turning to our markets, Midtown's first quarter leasing activity of approximately 3.4 million square feet, excluding renewals, was the third consecutive quarter of leasing activity in excess of 3 million square feet, an indication of the recovery that is underway. Renewal activity reached a modest 500,000 square feet during the quarter, 55% below the five-year quarterly average as tenant interest continues to shift from short term renewals to new long-term commitments. Our New York portfolio is currently 90.8% leased on a same-store basis at share, up 40 basis points quarter-over-quarter and up 350 basis points year-over-year. During the first quarter, we leased approximately 27,000 square feet at a weighted average term of 4.6 years with initial rents of approximately $100 per square foot. During the first quarter, we executed 12 leases covering roughly 203,000 square feet of space at a weighted average starting rent of $67.67 per square foot and for a weighted average term of 7.8 years. The current quarter's lower weighted average starting rent and flat mark-to-markets were largely attributable to the 87,500 square foot renewal with Hilton, which represented a majority of second-generation space. And as Peter mentioned, this lease was for two base floors at 1325 Avenue of the Americas, so it had a disproportionate impact on this quarter's numbers, excluding this lease, weighted average starting rents would have been $78.78 per square foot and mark-to-markets would have been +6% and +1.7% on a GAAP and cash basis respectively."
