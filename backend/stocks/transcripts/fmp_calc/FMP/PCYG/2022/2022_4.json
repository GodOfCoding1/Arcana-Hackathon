    "content": " Simultaneously, we have controlled costs and increased productivity, reducing our annualized cash spend to approximately $11.8 million, or 66% of our annual recurring revenue. As we have said before, going forward on each incremental recurring revenue dollar over and above our fixed cash costs of roughly $12 million per year $0.80 to $0.85 will follow the bottom line. For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, GAAP net income was $1.1 million, or 24% of revenue, versus $480,000, or 8% of revenue. Fiscal year 2022 revenue was $18 million, down 14% from $21 million in the same period last year for the reasons I already discussed. Full year GAAP net income was $4 million, or 22% of revenue versus $4.1 million, inclusive of a $1.1 million gain on the forgiveness of our PPP loan in 2021. Since inception of the buyback program, the company has repurchased a total of $10.2 million worth of stock, retiring 1.71 million shares, hence reducing capitalization over 8.3% since 2019."
