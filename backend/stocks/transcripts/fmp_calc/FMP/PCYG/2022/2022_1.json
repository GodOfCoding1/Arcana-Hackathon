    "content": " We delivered another reporting period with solid results: 10% increase in recurring revenue, 80% gross margins, 71% increase in net income, doubled EPS, delivered over $1 million in cash. Recurring revenue for our SaaS business, which includes compliance and supply chain, was up 10% to $4.4 million. It should be noted that only a few short years ago, recurring revenue was only $9 million and 64% of revenue. Fiscal year 2022 first quarter revenue was $4.6 million, down 13% from $5.2 million in the same quarter last year. For the first quarter of fiscal 2022, GAAP net income was $947,000 or 21% of revenue versus $555,000 or 11% of revenue, essentially a double. At a modest monthly subscription rate, this opportunity could, and I say could, result in an additional $10 million to $12 million per year of recurring revenue, and that's on top of our existing $18 million in recurring subscription revenue after the mandate is in full force."
