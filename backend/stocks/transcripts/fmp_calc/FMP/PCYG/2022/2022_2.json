    "content": " It should be noted that consolidated revenue in the quarter reflects the absence of $1 million in non-recurring MarketPlace revenue in sunsetting vendor-based pricing which accounted for $650,000 annually in revenue and $200,000 in the quarter. Recurring revenue for our SaaS business, which includes compliance and supply chain, was up 7% to $4.3 million for the quarter and 9% year-to-date. Turning to the quarterly numbers, fiscal year 2022 second quarter revenue was $4.4 million, down 16% from $5.2 million in the same quarter last year. The decrease was due to $1.2 million lower revenue as part of our strategic plan, as I\u2019ve already discussed. For the second quarter of fiscal 2022, GAAP net income was $872,000 or 20% of revenue versus $1.6 million last year, which included the $1.1 million benefit for the forgiveness of our PPP loan. Excluding this gain, net income in the second quarter last year was $524,000 or 10% of revenue. Fiscal year 2022, year-to-date revenue was $8.9 million, down 14% from $10.4 million in the same period last year. Year-to-date, GAAP net income was $1.82 million or 20% of revenue versus $2.18 million inclusive of the $1.1 million gain on the forgiveness of our PPP loan. Year-to-date GAAP net income to common shareholders was $1.53 million or $0.08 per common share versus $1.88 million or $0.10 per common share last year, which again includes the impact of the PPP loan forgiveness."
