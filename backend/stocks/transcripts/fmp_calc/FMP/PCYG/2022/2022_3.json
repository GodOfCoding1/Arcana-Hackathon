    "content": " That means signed contracts in hand at March 31, 2022, that are billing monthly multiplied times 12, will generate $18.6 million of recurring revenue in the subsequent 12 months if we just stand still. If you take our annual recurring revenue exit rate, call it $19 million and at a certain growth rate, 10% to 20%, it is pretty easy to determine our likely revenue in the next 12 months since we are 100% recurring revenue with very little customer churn. Fiscal year 2022 third quarter revenue was $4.6 million, down 24% from $6 million in the same quarter last year. For the third quarter of fiscal 2022, GAAP net income was $1.1 million or 24% of revenue versus $773,000 or 12.8% of revenue. Fiscal year 2022 year-to-date revenue was $13.5 million, down 18% from $16.4 million in the same period last year for the reasons I've already discussed. Year-to-date, GAAP net income was $2.9 million or 22% of revenue versus $3 million, inclusive of a $1.1 million gain on the forgiveness of our PPP loan. Excluding this, year-to-date net income last year was $1.9 million or 12% of revenue. We are a SaaS company, 100% recurring revenue, 80% gross margins, a fortress balance sheet, including $21.3 million in cash and growing, little debt and reducing our capitalization."
