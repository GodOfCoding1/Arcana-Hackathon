    "content": " Starting with revenue, we ended the September quarter with an exit rate of annual recurring revenue of $19.5 million, meaning fiscal year-to-date revenue plus signed contracts in hand at September 30, 2022 quarter that are billing monthly multiplied times 9 will generate $19.5 million of recurring revenue for the balance of fiscal year 2023, absent any new contracts or anticipated growth. As we have said it before, going forward on each incremental recurring revenue dollar over and above our fixed cash cost of roughly $12 million per year, $0.80 to $0.85 will fall to the bottom line. For the first fiscal quarter of 2023, GAAP net income was $1.3 million or 27% of revenue versus $947,000 or 21% of revenue. Annualizing our cash from operations for Q1, call it $7.2 million reflects a 5-year compounded annual growth rate or CAGR of 27% since 2018. Since inception of the buyback program, the company has repurchased a total of $10.3 million worth of stock, retiring 1.73 million shares, hence reducing capitalization by almost 9% since 2019. Furthermore, as we've said, incremental revenue over our $12 million annual cash operating expenses is largely converted to incremental cash, 82% in the current quarter, in fact."
