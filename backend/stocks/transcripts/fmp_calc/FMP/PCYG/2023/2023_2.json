    "content": " We ended the December quarter with an exit rate of annual recurring revenue of $19.1 million, meaning fiscal year-to-date revenue plus signed contracts in hand at December 31, 2022, quarter that are billing monthly multiply times six, will generate $19.1 million in recurring revenue for the balance of fiscal year 2023, absent any new contracts or anticipated growth. With $300,000 in revenue per annum per employee almost twice the industry average, we must make difficult decisions short term to free up internal resources to prepare for onboarding thousands upon thousands of new traceability food suppliers. As we have said before, going forward on each incremental revenue dollar over and above our fixed cash cost of roughly $12 million per year, our goal is to push $0.80 to $0.85 to the bottom line. You can see this during the second quarter, a 9% increase in total revenue for the December quarter translated to a 45% increase in GAAP earnings and $1.5 million in cash from operations. Fiscal year 2023 second quarter revenue was $4.8 million, up 9% from $4.4 million in the same quarter last year. For the second fiscal quarter of 2023, GAAP net income was $1.27 million or 27% of revenue versus $872,000 or 20% of revenue. For the six months ended December 31, 2022, total revenue increased 6% to $9.5 million  from $9 million  in the same period of fiscal 2022. While total revenue grew 6% in the first six months of fiscal 2023, gross margin was 82% and net income grew from $1.8 million to over $2.5 million, an increase of 40%. If we have 10,000 suppliers if you will facilities in our current network people we currently touch that are likely to be covered by Rule 204 that is about $25 million a year of revenue within our existing customer set."
