    "content": " Our net leverage for the fourth quarter increased to 0.77 times from 0.71 times for the prior quarter, driven by $36 million of gross deployments, nearly all in first-lien loans, coupled with a decrease in valuations across our portfolio. Our three largest new portfolio company investments in the fourth quarter include, a $5.2 million SOFR plus 6.5% first-lien term loan and $5.2 million unfunded revolver to Integrity Marketing Acquisition, an independent marketer and distributor of life and health insurance products. GAAP net investment income was $8.1 million or approximately $0.11 per share for the fourth quarter, an increase of 6% from the third quarter and up 36% from the fourth quarter of 2021. Our gross investment income was $17.5 million for the fourth quarter, an increase of 9% from the prior quarter and up 39% from gross income earned in the fourth quarter of 2021. Total net expenses for the fourth quarter increased by approximately $1 million from the third quarter, primarily driven by an increase in interest and other borrowing costs, due to an uptick in our average outstanding debt balance quarter-over-quarter, and an increase in LIBOR and SOFR rates."
