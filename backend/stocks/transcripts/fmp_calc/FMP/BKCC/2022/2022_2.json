    "content": " Our three largest new portfolio company investments included the following: an $11.4 million SOFR plus 7.5% first lien term loan to InMoment, Inc., a provider of customer experience management software and analytical solutions. GAAP net investment income was $7.1 million or approximately $0.10 per share, up 10% from the prior quarter. The company's weighted average portfolio yield based on fair value increased to 9.1% as of June 30, up from 8.4% as of the prior quarter end. So, I would say, we also mentioned in the prepared remarks that we have about $50 million of deals which have either closed since the end of the quarter or approved pending close, not all of them might necessarily come to close, but I guess directionally I can point out that we are trending to a very similar deployment pace that we did in the second quarter."
