    "content": " Last year's quarter that ended June 30, 2021 does not include non-compensation expenses for GCA of approximately $13 million, which led to some of the increase when comparing this year's first quarter to last year's first quarter. All things being equal, it will grow faster if we weren't in the market environment that we are, but we still think we can continue to grow that business for the foreseeable quarters and years if market conditions stay at least where they're at. And probably on a percentage basis this fiscal year it will do a larger percentage of Corporate Finance than it did last year, mostly just because the M&A marketplace is much stronger I think in our fiscal \u00e2\u0080\u009822 and it's clearly tailed off into fiscal \u00e2\u0080\u009823. We have said on previous calls, I believe, that the revenues for that business is anywhere from 15% to 25% and expected to be towards the higher end of the range this year, but in previous years depending on just how strong the M&A markets are, it's been towards the lower end of the range. So if you take a look at some historical years in terms of how that business or how our non-compensation expenses have moved, I'd say, you're likely to see some pressure certainly in the second half of the year, on the $60 million we delivered this quarter."
