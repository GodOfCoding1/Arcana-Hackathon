    "content": " And as far as your question in fiscal '23, what we pointed out is, we still think fiscal '23 looks more like if you might a normal restructuring year and all of the new business that we've been hired on is going to have much more of a financial impact in fiscal 24, even fiscal 25. If you read or understand what potentially is existing, it might be forthcoming in Europe versus the U.S. Europe does feel like it's going to have more economic issues at least short-term than the U.S. Having said that, part of our problem in answering your question is the size and importance in brand and reputation that we have in Europe today is so much greater than it was 1, 2, 3, 4 years ago. And probably what that company does for a living geographically where they are, maybe the management team, their particular business plan, and I don't think we have really an answer that says, oh, x percent of our clients can get financing today and y percent can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t, here's what might happen a quarter or two quarters from now."
