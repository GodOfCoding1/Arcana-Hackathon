I would now like to turn the conference over to Christopher Crain, Houlihan Lokey's General Counsel. By now, everyone should have access to our first quarter fiscal year 2022 earnings release, which can be found on the Houlihan Lokey website at www.hl.com in the Investor Relations section. Before we begin our formal remarks, we need to remind everyone that the discussion today will include forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements, which are usually identified by use of words such as will, expect, anticipate, should or other similar phrases are not guarantees of future performance. We encourage investors to review our regulatory filings, including the Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2021, when it is filed with the SEC. During today's call, we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe can be useful in evaluating the company's financial performance. Hosting the call today, we have Scott Beiser, Houlihan Lokey's Chief Executive Officer; and Lindsey Alley, Chief Financial Officer of the company. Welcome, everyone, to our first quarter fiscal 2022 earnings call. We achieved $373 million in first quarter revenues, up 77% from a year ago. While our first quarter revenues were down from our exceptionally strong third and fourth fiscal 2021 quarters, $373 million in first quarter revenues were the best ever for what is usually our seasonally lowest quarter. On the expense side, we reduced our compensation ratio from last year's level while maintaining historically low non-compensation expenses as we slowly return to in-person events and business travel. For the first fiscal quarter of 2022, we reported adjusted earnings of $1.19 per share, up 112% from last year. And our core product offerings of M&A, capital markets and private funds advisory showed year-over-year growth. Our FVA business has done incredibly well over the last few years, growing its revenues at a 5-year compounded average growth rate of just under 10%. As previously discussed, Financial Restructuring is now operating at pre-pandemic activity levels, and we expect that levels of business to continue for the foreseeable future. However, an ever-increasing amount of corporate leverage, coupled with effects from the pandemic and continued disruption from technology, provides optimism for this business segment in the medium and long term. During the first quarter, we announced 16 newly promoted MDs, our largest class ever, and we hired 5 MDs mostly in Corporate Finance. Regarding our acquisition activity, we are excited to announce our commencement of a tender offer to acquire all of the outstanding equity of GCA Corporation for a total cash purchase price of approximately $591 million. They have significant operations in the U.K. and Europe, the Asia Pacific region and the U.S. Their primary focus is in technology and related sectors, but they also have expertise in a couple of additional core industries complementary to our existing business. In the meantime, we have started planning for a smooth and successful integration of our 2 businesses. Within the press release issued yesterday announcing the transaction, we provided a link to a summary of GCA that gives a snapshot of the company and the transaction that explains our strategic rationale for wanting to commence the tender offer to make this acquisition. Upon completion of the tender offer, Houlihan Lokey will have over 2,000 employees generating more than $1.8 billion in revenues on an annualized basis. We will have offices in 17 countries, and over 30% of our combined revenues will be outside of the United States. As a combined firm, revenues in our technology, media and telecom industry group will go from being under-weighted relative to the industry size to becoming our largest and most global industry group. In many regards, this transaction is similar to the dozen-or-so transactions we have completed over the last decade. It's a business we know well, run by a management team that has a similar culture and business philosophy as we do. GCA and Houlihan Lokey share a number of important cultural traits, including a collaborative entrepreneurial approach, independent thoughtful advice and a relentless focus on its clients. While we believe this is an exciting transaction for our collective clients, employees and shareholders, we also recognize the time and effort it will take to integrate these 2 businesses effectively. This is by far the largest transaction we've ever pursued, but we are up for the challenge, and we are focused on a successful outcome. Revenues in Corporate Finance were $210 million for the quarter, up 139% when compared to the same quarter last year. We closed 84 transactions this quarter compared to 35 in the same period last year, and our average transaction fee on closed deals increased. As a reminder, our Corporate Finance business was negatively impacted by the pandemic in the same period last year. Financial Restructuring revenues were $99 million for the quarter, an 11% increase from last year's first quarter. We closed 24 transactions this quarter compared to 29 in the same period last year, and our average transaction fee on closed deals was significantly higher. And unless something changes, we expect to see solid but significantly lower restructuring revenues for the balance of fiscal 2022. In Financial and Valuation Advisory, revenues were $64 million for the quarter, an 85% increase from the same period last year. We had 820 fee events during the quarter compared to 512 in the same period last year, and we continue to see an increase in revenues per fee event. Turning to expenses, our adjusted compensation expenses were $229 million for the first quarter versus $132 million for the same period last year. Our adjusted non-compensation expenses were $32 million for the quarter versus $30 million for the same quarter last year, an increase of 6%. This quarter, we adjusted out of our non-compensation expenses $1.1 million in acquisition-related amortization. We expect to see a significant increase in non-compensation expenses in fiscal 2022 as we begin to return to more normalized travel and operations, but we do not expect that to occur until the second half of the fiscal year. Our adjusted other income and expense decreased for the quarter to income of approximately $101,000 versus income of approximately $1.2 million in the same period last year. As a reminder, a portion of the deferred stock that we issue as compensation to employees vest during the first quarter of each fiscal year, which was adjusted for in order to get to a more normalized effective tax rate for the quarter. Our long-term target for our adjusted effective tax rate is between 27% and 29%, although we expect our tax rate for fiscal 2022 to be closer to the lower end of the targeted range. As of the quarter end, we had approximately $830 million of unrestricted cash and equivalents and investment securities. In our first quarter, we issued approximately 1.9 million net new shares to employees as part of their bonus compensation for fiscal 2021. And in our first quarter, we repurchased 1.4 million shares through either open-market repurchases or repurchases meant to cover taxes on vesting shares at an average price of approximately $76.04 per share. Given the length of the tender offer process, in the next quarter, we expect to be in a better position to answer questions that you will have regarding our integration strategy, the pro forma combined company financial profile, the accumulation and deployment of future cash, and the timing to achieve appropriate long-term targets. We believe this acquisition will be accretive to our shareholders at closing, and we look forward to sharing with you our plan to drive shareholder value through the combination of these 2 businesses. I wanted to focus on the GCA deal, acknowledging you said that you'd get more into some of the strategic rationale next quarter. So clearly, 2021 is great for M&A globally, and it looks like GCA is having a great start to '21. It looks like it could have more stagnant growth, but I just don't have enough of a time line yet to see that. Ken, I think its performance and growth has been similar to not only our firm but other investment banking firms over the last couple of years. There's been some volatility, obviously, with the pandemic impact, especially in calendar 2020 for them. They're having a very good year in 2021 as is, I think, most everyone else in the marketplace. And we think they're in a very good space clearly in technology, which is one of the leading, if not the leading industry, and they clearly have a lot of geographical diversity to continue to help their growth. It seems to me the attraction is an attractive asset class of technology, diversifies the business by geography. Well, in many regards, we look at it very similar to the other dozen-or-so deals that we\u2019ve done. Obviously, we mentioned this is a larger business in scale and scope. But we\u2019ve experienced almost every time whenever we\u2019ve acquired a business that eventually, we do get some revenue synergies. So all these things, we believe, combined would make both of the businesses stronger post deal. And that\u2019s kind of our expectations on the revenue synergies and, I\u2019d say, very similar to what we\u2019ve experienced with our past deals. Yes, I mean I think that's very specific guidance. And so you can take a look at kind of where we were a couple of years prior to entering into the pandemic, and that's not a terrible proxy. And I think as we sit here today, I don't think any of our comments from previous calls have changed in terms of the restructuring market and our expectations for fiscal year 2022. And just for my follow-up, also relating to GCA, I was hoping to better unpack, recognizing that the transaction is financially compelling, but it does appear to increase your gearing to more cyclical revenue streams. I know talking to many investors, I think a big part of their optimism and bullishness on the prospects for Houlihan is that balanced revenue mix. And it sounded like, Scott, you alluded to maybe them being a little bit less indexed to sponsor activity, although it does feel like they're pretty active there as well. In Corporate Finance, it's predominantly M&A, more sell side than buy side. And while, historically, they've not been focused on restructuring or valuation like our firm does, we think that is an opportunity just as we have those bankers and those capabilities. I do recognize your comment, yes, we are adding more, I'll call it, corporate finance activity statistically versus adding incremental restructuring or valuation revenues. But I do think it\u2019s important to know, when you go as deep as we would go with this acquisition in an industry space like technology, that benefits the entire firm. That benefits our restructuring folks, enables them to win technology transactions because of industry expertise that we might not have been able to do previously. So it\u2019s not like \u2013 I mean, yes, their corporate finance \u2013 their revenues are predominantly corporate finance. But one of the reasons we do transactions like this is so that, that revenue mix, given the industry depth that we\u2019re acquiring here, will improve for GCA and for Houlihan Lokey on a go-forward basis. If I could start on GCA, I guess, first, I wanted to ask a little bit about the structure of the transaction. Obviously, that's kind of key to success in deals in this space. And then, obviously, M&A activity in Europe and Asia have lagged the U.S., and it's been steadily improving in Europe, and we're seeing that rebound there. Asia is kind of continuing to lag, but there's clearly some pent-up demand there. I\u2019d say we have a very similar view for probably the last I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s 3 years or 10 years, which is there\u2019s a lot of growth potential in Europe, in Asia. Having said that, the U.S. has been the kind of the star of business recovery, growth, et cetera, for quite some time. So we like to be able to have access to do work in really all of those key geographies because we think there\u2019s opportunities not only in the United States, but clearly in Europe, clearly in Asia, and there\u2019s other places in the globe that we\u2019re still just touching on and would hope over time to eventually grow into some additional geographies. I will start with we've known some of the key people in the company for many years, so that's helped. As you said, we've not been able to do the typical in-person diligence that you would like, but we've done a lot of Zoom and telephonic diligence. And much like all of us in the investment banking business, we've all figured out how to do deals for our clients not in person and feel the same way here. And then just briefly on the FVA business, it continues to do very, very well. So first, I\u2019d say we\u2019re very optimistic overall about the growth profile of what\u2019s happening in the FVA. When you ask the question about repeat clients, I\u2019d look at it really 2 ways. Number of clients or potential revenues truly under contract that you can almost totally identify year-by-year, similar probably in 1/3 to \u00bd of that business. But if you really look at almost any of our clients, I would \u2013 you could argue it\u2019s a much, much higher number from a repeat standpoint, meaning we do a lot of work for the various financial sponsors. We may not know what that exact task is 3 months from now or 2 years from now, but a lot of the work that we do is I would put in the repeat category. So it\u2019s both growing by doing more work for existing clients, by adding additional clients as well as adding additional services over the last handful of years. So on GCA, understanding that you can't speak to the pro forma combined entity and we'll get more of that on the next quarterly call, but when we look at the profit margins, the operating margins of this business, they look like they run about half of Houlihan's low double digit maybe to teens. One, most, if not maybe all of the previous acquisitions we've done, those companies had lower margins than Houlihan Lokey. Two, much like the size that we were prior to going public, we had much lower margins than we're currently performing. And three, it's how they've historically operated. And we do think while it will take some time, but effectively by adding once again the incremental bench strength that we have combined with theirs, we'll be able to find more clients, do more work for clients with the higher fees and increase close rates. And when you think about geographic diversity, it's one of the things that you mentioned as the benefits around this deal. When you look across this business, firms that are geographically diverse have grown at a pretty substantially slower pace. And Houlihan previously had a very unique proposition where you were focused on middle markets, the 3 business units all came together really well and there was a clear, synergy is probably the wrong word, but clear benefits from being in these different businesses. And should we think that while the revenue outlook for 2021 is good versus last year, when you go back and look at some of the history, the outlook for 2021 revenues is basically just going to get them back to where they were in 2018. So I think you asked a couple of questions there, Brennan. We have said to ourselves, to our investors to many -- over many, many years that we've wanted to increase our non-U. We recognize in finance, finance is very much a global business. And we've continually poured, I would say, money, time and effort in growing our non-U. The fact pattern is, is the U.S. has just continued to grow as well, and we've been at roughly probably an 80-20 mix for quite some time. S. positioning, not so much that it makes the U.S. a statistical much, much smaller place, but actually, we think it gets us more consistent with really where activity is across the globe. And as we do more work and as we do work on larger deals, it's just more important to have some access in different parts of the globe. And in terms of the growth profile, once again, we've looked at the space that they're in. We think they will, with ourselves collectively, continue to be able to grow over the years. And well, like I said, we think they're doing well, we think the markets are doing well, we think we can continue to do well on ourselves. But caution everybody, we do know when we do make acquisitions, it does take some time for all of those potential synergies to kick in. And I think a couple of other things just to add, Brennan, we\u2019re not growing overseas for the sake of growing overseas. We think we have built, in all 3 of our product lines, a phenomenal platform here in the United States. Restructuring, I think, in particular, has shown an ability to take that overseas incredibly effectively. We have kind of a long-term view of how we\u2019re going to get there, and this is one step. It is a kind of long-term vision on taking that corporate finance platform to Europe, to Asia and just globally. And it\u2019s not just for the sake of growing, it\u2019s because our clients are insisting on it. Just another one here on GCA, but kind of a bigger picture just on kind of the M&A strategy for Houlihan. This is, I think, your largest deal, and you had alluded to several large deals a year ago or so. And if the right fact patterns present itself over the next quarter, next year, et cetera, we'll continue to pursue transactions. Many firms throughout the last few quarters on earnings calls, large bulge brackets and independent firms have been talking  and building out their capabilities, both in the middle markets, but more broadly, with sponsors. The market is more robust, so there's more activity and more deals for everybody to do. But I would say in terms of who do we see from competition, who do we compete against, what do we have to do to win, it's not dramatically different at least in the space and areas that we focus on from where it's been in the last year or 2. Well, I want to thank you all for participating in our first quarter fiscal year 2022 earnings call, and we look forward to updating everyone on our progress when we discuss our second quarter results for fiscal '22 this coming fall."
