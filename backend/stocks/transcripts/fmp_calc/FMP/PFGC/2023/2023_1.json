    "content": " All in, Vistar's net sales passed the $1 billion mark for the second consecutive quarter, growing nearly 29% compared to the prior year period. Total PFG gross profit increased 37.9% compared to the prior year quarter, including the addition of the Core-Mark business and the independent case growth, which I just mentioned. I guess the last thing I would say is, as we mentioned, we had some inventory holding gains, but the vast majority of all of our improvement was due to the underlying business performance, and couldn't be prouder of how the business performed across the last quarter."
