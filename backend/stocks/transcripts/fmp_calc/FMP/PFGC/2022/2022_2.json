    "content": " 11:59 At an enterprise level, net sales increased 87.6% in the quarter to $12.8 billion, driven by a full quarter of Core-Mark's sales results in addition to inflation-driven pricing and a continued recovery in the business environment. Total PFG gross profit increased 57.7% compared to the prior year quarter, including the addition of the Core-Mark business and the independent case growth, which I just mentioned. And then unlike with Reinhart where there were probably more differences, certainly more product differences, we've been able to get the integration around HR, finance, procurement faster than we were able to do that with Reinhart where we really needed to take a little bit more care So we're very pleased, and we're also very pleased just with the staffing and the management at Core-Mark. Vistar's continued recovery has been very helpful and the progress they're making has really helped drive a great quarter and margin improvement and improvements in labor were another big area that we talked about, and they'll continue to improve across the next 6 months."
