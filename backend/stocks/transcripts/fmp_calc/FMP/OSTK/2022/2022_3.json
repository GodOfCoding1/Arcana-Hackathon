Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021, and in our subsequent filings with the SEC. The slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC contain important additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures to the most comparable GAAP measures. Finally, to participate during our Q&A session, please use the registration link available under the Event section of our Investor Relations website. I believe that over time, we are well-positioned to take market share from competitors, many of which are closing stores and/or are currently struggling with liquidity and distracted by debt management obligations. In the meantime, we will continue to navigate the near-term, remain in confident that our longer term results will be better because of our efforts and our focus on profitability. Since its inception, Overstock is transformed from a small online liquidator to a general merchandiser, and more recently a 100% furniture and home furnishings retailer with a differentiated asset-light model and targeted customer base. High interest rates and various other economic factors are causing considerable stress and putting pressure on the housing market, a market which influences purchase behavior among our customers. Our business model is focused on growth, but not at the cost of profitability for us or our partners. We provide an efficient channel for our partners to drive growth even during times of significant uncertainty, as we efficiently serve the evolving home-related needs of our customers. Overstock shareholders need not worry about erosion to our earnings from high interest rate debt, nor about ownership dilution to pay large debt with looming maturity. Pelion Venture Partners continues to do an impressive job of managing this portfolio, allowing the Overstock management team to focus on our retail business. Our third quarter performance continues to be impacted by ongoing headwinds of high inflation, macro weakness and a shift in consumer spending preferences. The team managed at least to carefully stabilize the top line decrease, and importantly, deliver another profitable quarter, as I mentioned, our 10th in a row. With the focus on profitability, we ended the quarter with a healthy balance sheet and nearly $4 million in net cash. And we -- as we plan around economic uncertainty, our balance sheet is a distinct advantage and is allowing us to focus on executing toward our strategic vision. We will be opportunistic in evaluating future share repurchases, and we will diligently scrutinize M&A opportunities that might be a strategic and operational fit within our long-term business priorities and objectives. As an Overstock shareholder, I hope you will leave today's presentation feeling as confident as I am in Overstock's ability to navigate and eventually return to growth in the current business environment. While I'm certainly not pleased with another quarter of 30% plus year-over-year revenue decline, I am encouraged to see our home-only revenue decline seems to have at least leveled off. This is a good sign when you consider: one, of the pandemic drivers that were helping revenue last year; and two, the benefit we saw from the shift in our Customer Day event into Q3 last year. This year, we held our 2-day Customer Day in October, in conjunction with the launch of our new marketing campaign, and rebranded it as Overstock Day. Our home-only revenue trend has stabilized sequentially since July for the quarter and for the quarter it declined just under 30%, an improvement in trend relative to Q2. Last quarter, I shared with you our plans to launch new brand marketing following completion of our move to 100% home-related assortment. We are excited to have launched a new brand campaign earlier this month, centered around our refreshed vision of making dream homes come true. As part of our continued efforts to identify efficiencies, we conducted a strategic review of our organizational structure and made changes that better align our teams to eliminate redundancies in fixed cost. In October, Overstock employees came together for a semiannual event at our corporate campus in Utah. As we've shared with you in the past, the Overstock name has very strong name recognition, but our association with home is low. As noted, in June, we exited the last of our non-home categories, and transitioned to 100% furniture and home furnishings retailer. With that transition complete, we strategically refreshed our vision from dream homes for all to making dream homes come true to emphasize our purpose and inspire our employees, partners and customers. With our new vision in place, we created a brand campaign, launching a new commercial titled, \u00e2\u0080\u009cC'mon, Get Comfy\u00e2\u0080\u009d to coincide with our 2-day Overstock Day customer event on October 2 and 3. The ad spots which reinforce our vision that Overstock makes dream homes come true at any budget can be seen on broadcast and cable TV like HGTV, streaming TV, YouTube, and social media channels. Between them they have approximately 12 million followers across multiple social media platforms including Instagram, Facebook, Pinterest, YouTube, TikTok and Twitter. These ambassadors are a diverse and talented group of home experts, whose host -- who host popular TV shows on interior design firms and create home and lifestyle content. Over the coming weeks and months, you will see exciting content in social media posts from these brand ambassadors, highlighting how Overstock can make dream homes come true. Our reported EPS loss of $0.81 was driven by a noncash, non-operating expense associated with a change in value of our equity securities. The change primarily reflects dilution to our direct and indirect ownership interest in tZERO following the Series B Funding round, including the dilutive impact of tZERO issued equity awards. We reported adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.13, a decrease of $0.41 versus 2021. This excludes the impact from our proportionate share of the Medici Ventures Fund performance and changes in value of our direct investment in tZERO, including the change in value of our equity securities that I just referenced. We posted revenue of $460 million in the third quarter, a decrease of 33% year-over-year. Additionally, we faced headwinds from our strategic action to remove non-home products from our site. Our business continues to perform well relative to pre-pandemic 2019 levels, illustrating the operational progress we have made. Our customers recognize our improved assortment of furniture and home furnishings and have strong engagement with our mobile app, both of which have been key elements of our strategy. Gross profit was $107 million in the third quarter, a decrease of $49 million versus the prior year. Gross margin came in at 23.3%, a 60 basis point improvement versus the same period last year. The year-over-year increase was driven by operational efficiencies, partially offset by higher promotions and discounting. G&A and tech expenses decreased $4 million year-over-year, primarily due to a reduction in our cash incentive compensation, which is based on financial performance. It's important to note that our compensation and benefits expense increased versus last year, mainly driven by our enhanced equity programs. As a percent of revenue, G&A and tech expense was 10.5% in the third quarter, a deleverage of 290 basis points compared to the third quarter of 2021 due to weak top line results. In the third quarter, we delivered adjusted EBITDA of $15 million, which is a decrease of $21 million versus a year ago. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 3.2%, below our target of mid single digits. We control the controllables during a challenging macro backdrop with winning consumer sentiment, and navigated through a highly promotional environment. First, consumer sentiment toward discretionary spend has been weak this year due to high inflation and consumer staples. And third, our strategy to exit non-home products. As previously shared, this is the right long-term trade-off despite some pain in the short-term. While this slows our pace of new customer acquisition, our year-over-year change in customer retention rate is comparable to the average of other online furniture and home furnishings retailers as measured by third-party data. Orders for active customer was 1.62x in the third quarter, a decrease of about 4% versus last year and a decrease sequentially. We expect that over time our improved association with home, continued mix into mobile app, our platform with the highest frequency and enhanced loyalty offerings will help improve this metric. While active customers have decreased, we have been able to strategically offset a portion of this decline with an increased average order value, which is more typical of the home category and which I will discuss in greater detail on the next slide. This slide provides a recasted view of our business excluding non-home sales, which allows for a more direct comparison to our peers. As you can see on the left chart, at the end of the third quarter, our comparable home-related active customer base declined 29% versus the reported 33%. On a sequential basis, the impact of the non-home category removal has increased due to the cumulative impact of non-home customers exiting our ecosystem. We ended the third quarter with $428 million in cash and $35 million in long-term debt, a net cash position of $392 million with no significant debt maturities until 2030. Since the beginning of this year, we have returned $60 million to our shareholders via share repurchases and invested $50 million in tZERO Series B Funding round alongside ICE and the Medici Ventures Fund. Our current share repurchase program is authorized through December 31, 2023 and we currently have about 40 million available under it. Additionally, in this increasingly volatile landscape, our balance sheet provides us an opportunity to lean into strategic market share opportunities, as new and existing vendor partners realize Overstock will be a reliable channel into the future. However, given the revenue environment over the past 3 months, we conservatively chose to maintain a higher cash balance and pause repurchases. In addition, we continuously evaluate strategic M&A opportunities to accelerate growth. During the second quarter, we were in advanced stages of such a deal, the deal that made a lot of business sense in our asset-light business model. However, after thorough our due diligence, we ascertain that while the business case was good and targets operational model and its future investment needs, we're not currently aligned with our expectations. Rest assured, we will diligently scrutinize M&A opportunities to ensure that any potential transaction will be a strategic and operational fit with our long-term business priorities and objectives, know that we will continue to be prudent in capital deployment to deliver the best outcome for all shareholders. Next, I'll provide some key insights into our business and our strategic brand pillars. It is encouraging to see the projection for 33% of purchases to be transacted online, especially since the category is comparing against some strong growth from the prior 2 years. Longer term, we still believe that as the market matures, there is sufficient room for online penetration to move higher. As the fourth largest online retailer of home furnishings in the U.S., our Smart Value brand pillar is strategic focus and strategy focused on increasing the breadth and depth of our home SKU product assortment will help us capture market share. We believe such a strategy is unsustainable over the longer term, especially during volatile retail business cycles like the one we're in. As the outlook for the housing market is blurred by rising mortgage rates, we see the potential for increased home-based products -- projects that should support spend in renovation and home improvement categories like bathroom vanities where we have seen an uptick already this year. As we look ahead to our first holiday season as a 100% home-based retailer, our customers will be able to find everything they usually look for during this period. We are working with some of the top brands in the industry such as Dyson, KitchenAid, Calphalon, Hoover, Mr. Coffee and Wooster and many others. These brands, like we are now fully focused on home and are more willing to allocate inventory. Deep discounts, markdowns and clearance activities by our competitors has not impacted our ability to deliver smart value to our customers and maintain our targeted gross margins. Something that gives us confidence in our Smart Value proposition is the growth in the order mix of customers and income levels above $100,000. New customers acquired over the last few quarters are also exhibiting a similar trend, and in fact, the order mix of higher income new customers is tracking at the highest level since 2019. In a recessionary environment, real value on quality products becomes more important than ever. We are delivering that for our customers, while maintaining profitability, which in this economic environment is we think quite an achievement. I should point out that while we've seen growth in the mix of orders from higher income demographics, our Smart Value still resonates with our current customers. Importantly, we continue to see the mobile app grow as a percentage of sales and expect that to continue with the launch of our brand ambassadors. Anyway you look at it, as customers work to stretch their dollar, we are helping them make their dollars go farther. Successful execution of this brand pillar enabled us to deliver the second largest Labor Day company history, and the largest single day of sales in year-to-date 2022. As I've said time and again, our asset-light business model is good because we don't have an expensive internal logistics operation with a high fixed cost base or significant owned inventory on our balance sheet. I'm excited to share that we are working closely with UPS on a digitally led strategy, starting with a pilot in Q4 that will elevate our customer experience. We are launching a pilot program in which returns will now be possible through simpler home pickup options, right from the customer's doorstep that don't require reboxing of the product by our customers. Through this pilot, both of our organizations will have the opportunity to better understand customer preferences and enable us to serve up options that align with their day-to-day lives. During the third quarter, we made progress on our logistics and customer care operations to further enhance the customer experience. By the end of Q3, we were able to reduce large item home delivery times by 18% since the start of the quarter. We achieve this by diversifying our third-party, large item carrier network, with each new carrier needing to meet our high standards and service levels with which we visually monitor and enforce. Our mantra is sustainable, profitable market share growth. Other than limiting what we would be -- what would be inefficient marketing spend, our focus on profitability is not hampering the progress of any of our growth drivers. We continue to direct our strategies to drive sustainable profitable market share growth within our financial recipe card targets, even as the online market contracts. These include top line outpacing the market to deliver market share growth under various macro scenarios driven by our advanced technology, our unwavering focus on the customer and our inherently adaptable business model. Acknowledging these may fluctuate slightly from quarter-to-quarter and then Q4 is expected to be highly promotional, disciplined G&A and tech spending to deliver operational leverage. And we continue to do our best to deliver adjusted EBITDA margins in the mid single-digit range on an annual basis, something that will admittedly be difficult to do with the still hypercompetitive Q4 in front of us. Pelion Venture Partners has been a great choice to manage the Medici Ventures Fund, and as it actively helps advance the portfolio companies, respective businesses to create value for Overstock and its shareholders. Overstock invested alongside ICE, the Medici Ventures Fund and other investors. In February, Overstock committed to invest in aggregate an additional $15 million in Series B Financing. Following completion of this funding round, Overstock's combined direct and indirect ownership in tZERO is now around 54%. In 2018 XY Labs raised $22 million and with the tZERO listing, those shares are now available to trade in the secondary market. Together, Bitt and IDEMIA were able to develop a CBDC solution for offline payments to ensure low cost access with a variety of easy to use payment devices, and the best identity management verification available in full compliance with regulatory requirements. The project is moving to the next phase of growth, which includes onboarding Nigerian Trade and Exchange platform, sector specific tokens for grants and subsidies and programmable payments. Settlement has a high performance low code platform for blockchain application development that empowers engineering games to build, integrate and launch applications on Web3 infrastructure. Last month, Settlement closed and oversubscribed up round funding that was co-led by Molten Ventures and OTB and included other new investors. In August, the company was named the Ag tech solution of the year at the 2022 Ag Tech Breakthrough Awards. GrainChain pairs to security and traceability of blockchain technology with the efficiency and reliability of self executing smart contracts to ensure producers get paid quickly, has received immediately tradable titles or commodities, and lien holders and other payees are paid first. In August, Latin American marketplace, MercadoLibre announced the launch of its own token, the Mercado token. To wrap up, during the third quarter, we remained profitable, stabilized our top line decrease and improved our home-only revenue trend despite a weak consumer backdrop. Our balance sheet is healthy, giving us real flexibility in the current macro environment. Our focus on Smart Value is important, especially in times where consumers wallets are under pressure. The Overstock business model is agile and resilient, reacts well to jolts in the market and consumer behavior and can capitalize on opportunity to gain market share. Before we take questions, let me note that I recently hit my 20-year anniversary at Overstock. Your line is open. There were a second time day, second way day, we had our Overstock Day, target Walmart, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s special promotional days. Your line is open. The question I have is the good news or the silver lining in a dark cloud is that you've seen material improvements in supply chain, including the related costs. We talked briefly about supply chain, and then Adrianne can talk to how and if it's impacting gross margin. Domestically, it's still tough with high fuel rates, there's accessorial surcharges to get product to warehouses and to get products from distribution centers to customers. Jonathan, I will just add, our gross margin improvement year-over-year generally, Tom, driven by those operational efficiency, which we've seen things like efficiencies in our customer care organization, returns handling, merchant activities with our partners in negotiations. Your line is open. And then secondly, you mentioned sales trends improved in late third quarter. And it's highly promotional market with weird, tough macro times. I think you can -- we're in the planning process, I think you can expect us to give some more color on how we think 2023 to be when we announce our Q4 results. I will say well, I've said that our aim for the annual adjusted EBITDA mid single digits for the year. That won't be the case this year, because we're not quite there now in the fourth quarter is . Yes, on the sales trends as we transition from the third to the fourth quarter, Jonathan mentioned earlier, it is extremely promotional, highly promotional. Yes, and as you know, the fourth quarter started top, just like the second and third quarters where. So it's hard to know, the fourth quarter is going to come. You mentioned what happens if we continue to experience the whole business shrink next year, that's certainly not the intention. Your line is open. We are seeing more 100,000 plus income demographics shop at us. We don't think that's a trade down, because we don't think we're a trade down. We have that quality product, and customers at all income levels are looking for it. I would just add that as our mobile app continues to grow in the mix of our total business, that is a customer base that is in that category that Jonathan mentioned, the 100,000 plus that is also driving that. Yes, I would say mobile brings to customers. I think they're going to help our mobile app continue to be strong, and it's already our fastest growing channel. But there the focus in choosing them was more to get home centric ambassadors that would appeal to folks that are already in the home shopping market, the decorating market, the home improvement market. Your line is open. I guess I'm curious to what extent you expect this progress to be sticky, and perhaps create a stronger foundation for gross margin to expand from once the discounting normalizes, because it seems like the 22% long range target could have some upside potential in a more normal environment. And when our partners have excess inventory, they're able to take the cost down that we pay them and that allows us to keep this same gross margin. So while some of our competition that owns inventory when they liquidate and impact their gross margin, wherever we compete it's the same gross margin level. How we've always answered and how we still answer is as the market continues to penetrate -- to penetrate into online, migrate into online, we think it's important to keep our gross margins roughly where they are. When the market matures and that online penetration matures, we think that will be the time to take a look to determine whether it's time to do something with the gross margins. But don't expect that post this highly promotional period, we're going to start jacking up gross margins. The 22%, 23% range is really what helps us with our customer base  that one chart, we're in the quadrant with a lots of white space, there's a lot of room to grow there and that gross margin helps us do that. Now we'll note when the fourth quarter gets high promotional, sometimes our marketing percentage kicks up just a bit. Thank you, Rick, and thanks to everyone who participated in today's call. We believe our strategy of spending for growth, while focusing on profits is the right long-term and winning strategy."
