    "content": " Our active customer base declined to $7.4 million at the end of the first quarter, a decrease versus 2021, but an increase of almost 43% or 2.2 million customers versus 2020. The first quarter decline in active customers was driven by three key factors: Online penetration receded from the all-time highs experienced during peak pandemic restrictions, our strategy to exit non-home categories, as previously shared, this is the right long-term trade-off and macroeconomic and geopolitical events impacting consumer sentiment. As you can see on the chart on the left, at the end of the first quarter, our comparable home related active customer base would have declined 23% versus the reported 26% decline. During the first quarter, our ability to deliver leverage was impacted by higher share-based compensation expenses in a challenging revenue environment and adjusted EBITDA margins in the mid-single digits range, as we delight our customers and deliver on our vision of Dream Homes per All. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open."
