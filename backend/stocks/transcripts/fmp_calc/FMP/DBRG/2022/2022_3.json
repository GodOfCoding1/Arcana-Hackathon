    "content": " Starting with our third quarter results on Page 11, the company continues to see strong year-over-year growth driven by fundraising in our Investment Management business and realized performance fees. Consolidated adjusted EBITDA was $91 million during the third quarter, which is a 13% increase from the same period last year driven by continued data center acquisitions, including Houston area data centers at DataBank and CA22 Vantage SDC. Looking at the right side of the page, in line with our forecast, our annualized revenues decreased from $132 million last year to $114 million and annualized EBITDA decreased from $56 million last year to $47 million as a result of the successful recapitalization of DataBank, which lowered our ownership percentage from 22% to 13%. During the third quarter, we closed 2 realizations at very attractive valuations, generating strong proof points that we expect will catalyze: one, future capital formation as we go and raise new capital next year; and that generated over $20 million in net carry to our shareholders. We've raised over $6.8 billion year-to-date and over $3 billion in the last quarter alone around the DataBank recap, new investment strategies, new platform companies through our successful co-investment program. And at the same time, what's been awesome about what we've been able to accomplish in the last few quarters is we've taken that leverage from almost 9x down almost 6x in this quarter, and we're targeting our net leverage to 3 to 4 turns in March of next year."
