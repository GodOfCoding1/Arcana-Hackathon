    "content": " Operating expenses in the second quarter were up from $6.6 million in the prior year, primarily due to continued investment in the development of our beta 2 platform and necessary expansion within our internal teams. So to start with the simulator, for now the simulator is available internally for testing and with our close partners as we get to the end of the year, we're going to be looking at the opportunity that show this off more and we'll be really excited about that, including to a broader audience within the incredible network of hospitals and partners that we have today. I'll say always incredibly pleasantly surprised at the really positive reception that we've received overall and how deep a level of engagement these hospitals are looking for, both hospital systems that we're working with are incredibly excited about not just the potential to use our system down the road but actually the potential to work really closely with us and collaborate over the next 12, 24 months and then -- and beyond. Overall, what we're focused on right now is data to feedback, refining that design, getting to the next stage, which is verification and validation of our device, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be making some design changes after beta 2 based on the feedback that we received, again, all with the goal of making sure that the device that we're launching is exactly what surgeons need and hospitals need in order to provide better care for their patients."
