    "content": " Feedback on ergonomic changes introduced between beta 1 and beta 2 has been well received, with surgeons additionally excited for the improved visualization beta 2 provides as well as the enhanced sensing and motion capabilities, which enable the surgeon to move freely within the abdominal cavity, further expanding their access and ability to operate. The increase was primarily driven by a $3.6 million increase in personnel costs as R&D headcount increased nearly 100% compared to the prior year as well as increased professional fees, facility and material costs as we continue beta testing and development of the Vicarious system. Adjusted net loss, which represents GAAP net income or loss adjusted for the changes in the fair value of our warrant liabilities was $18.2 million for the first quarter, equating to an adjusted net loss of $0.15 per share as compared to an adjusted net loss of $5.2 million or an adjusted loss of $0.06 per share for the same period of the prior year. GAAP net income for the first quarter was $42.5 million due to a $6.7 million reduction in the fair value of our warrant liability for the period, equating to a basic and diluted net income of $0.35 and $0.33 per share, respectively, as compared to a net loss of $5.2 million or a basic and diluted net loss of $0.06 per share for the same period of the prior year. So from the beta 1 standpoint, the main feedback has been the incredibly positive enthusiastic feedback around beta 1's ability to actually perform the procedures in order to manipulate tissue, in order to give incredible access and visualization, and room for improvement around the ergonomics, which is why we're already testing a lot of these changes and a lot of these improvements with surgeons today, the feedback of which are already on early beta to ergonomic feedback, it has been incredibly positive."
