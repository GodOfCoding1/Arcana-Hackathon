    "content": " In 2022, our first full year as a public company, I'm pleased to share that we made significant progress toward our objectives of finalizing the Vicarious Surgical system, preparing for regulatory review and expanding our surgeon and health system relationships as part of early commercial readiness. Based upon the cost reduction initiatives that Adam touched upon, including a 14% reduction in force, our full year 2023 cash burn is now expected to be between $55 million and $65 million. With the Beta 2 system finalized, the design finalized, excuse me, and you're focused now on completing version 1.0 of the system, could you help us understand what the remaining steps are for you to finalize v1.0 and just keep that within the time lines that you've said here?"
