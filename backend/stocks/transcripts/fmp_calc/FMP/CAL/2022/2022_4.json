    "content": " Fourth quarter sales were $696 million, a record for the fourth quarter and an increase of 2.5% versus last year. Brand portfolio gross margin was 36%, a nearly 200 basis point increase versus last year due to a favorable sales mix toward higher margin businesses, including drop ship and owned e-commerce, as well as a reduction in ocean and air freight costs. For the full year, consolidated gross margin was 43.3%, 90 basis points below last year reflecting a 180 basis point increase in the brand portfolio and a 170 basis point decline in Famous. Full year net interest expense was $14 million and the weighted average interest rate was 3.8% Fourth quarter diluted earnings per share were $0.65 and full year diluted earnings per share were $4.52, another full year record for Caleres. As we've mentioned, we've made a number of operating and financial structural changes to the business over the past several years that we believe allow us to maintain earnings in excess of $4 per share even in the face of the current inflationary pressures, higher interest rates and an uncertain macro environment.
