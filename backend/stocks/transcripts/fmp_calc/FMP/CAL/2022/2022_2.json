    "content": " As we've been moving through August, we've seen that trend improve a little bit, which is nice to see, but there is still three to four more weeks that we have really getting through back-to-school and we did see the build in our back-to-school business coming really a little bit later than we had seen in prior years, who knows, I don't know whether the consumer was really enjoying those great vacation that they couldn't have in the last two years or they were not thinking about getting back-to-school as quickly or whether it was the impact on inflation and gas et cetera really on their overall sentiment in buying much more closer to need. Yes, the early read actually on boots for Brand Portfolio is very good and it's great also in our Famous business, as a percentage of the total and Jay's kind of looking it up, but I think we're about a third of our business in fall is in boots, we're seeing things that are not quite as casual as they had been, a little bit more dressed up, dressed up a little bit more on heel's and love also have continued to be pretty good in certain categories of boots."
