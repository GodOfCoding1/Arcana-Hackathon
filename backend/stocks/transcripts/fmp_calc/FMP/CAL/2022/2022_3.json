    "content": " For the third quarter and even with as the consumer navigates this challenging macroeconomic environment, we achieved record quarterly sales of $798 million, nearly 2% higher than the third quarter of 2021, with improvement once again driven by a 7.6% year-over-year increase from the brand portfolio segment and we delivered another strong return on sales, reaching more than 7% as the brand portfolio recorded robust third quarter earnings and Famous held its operating margin in the double digits, achieving 12.3% and all-in, this generated operating earnings of $57 million and earnings per share of a $1.15. Overall, Famous has delivered a strong performance during the first nine months, holding its powerful double-digit operating margin, while underscoring the strength of the Famous brand and while we recognize that there is uncertainty for consumers given the threat of mounting inflationary pressures, Famous is well positioned to compete and win even in a challenging market due to its leadership position with the family, its advantaged assortment of national brands, retail locations in key markets across the country with exceptional service by our team and enhance consumer experience in stores and online, supported by customer insights. Brand portfolio turned in an outstanding performance in the third quarter of 2022, achieving another period of year-over-year improvement across all key financial metrics and putting us well on our way to delivering a significant step up in the segment's overall annual earnings contribution in 2022. Let me start and then I'll kick -- I'll kick the ball around a little bit this morning with both Jay and Jack, but on this one, as it relates to our brand portfolio business, quite honestly, our trends going into the fourth quarter have continued to be as good, if not better than what we saw in the third quarter. Absolutely yeah 100% and I think I asked this on the last call as well and I know you don't specifically provide order book information, but as we look out through the first half of '23, can you talk a little bit about what you're seeing maybe how much dropship has increased as a percent of sales during quarters, so that the initial order book is not completely reflective of what is ultimately sold during the quarter and maybe you could provide a little bit of -- it might be a scale of two halves next year. I want to start on the Famous side, so the range of guidance in the fourth quarter, obviously that's below what you delivered in Q3 and I'm just trying to better understand that, how much of that the macro seems worse than what it was in the third quarter versus maybe the kids businesses, maybe a little worse just given that we're post back to school and I'm wondering maybe how boots are influencing kind of the trend that you're seeing right now, just maybe given kind of a warm start to the season although better weather in the last week. Well, let me start on that Mitch on some of the structural changes that I can really actually speak to it from a total company perspective and there's a couple of probably most the biggest significant areas with the really in the margin rate assumptions across the company, both in for Famous and for Brand Portfolio, we really believe that we are going to be able not to maintain things at the high level at Famous in '21, but somewhere between historical and those '21 levels, which is you're even seeing us do a little bit better than that today. We absolutely believe there is enough stickiness with as the structural changes that we've made, the way that we're approaching the business, the product creation capabilities we have and our focus on margin as I just said is absolutely going to allow us continue to make progress against that and I know Jay and Jack, as we move into '23 we'll certainly be sharing more with you about that and are really planning to do an Investor Day sometime in the first half of '23 where we share a little bit more where they'll share a little bit more of their outlook for the next couple of years."
