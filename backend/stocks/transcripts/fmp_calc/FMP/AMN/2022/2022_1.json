    "content": " Our Physician and Leadership solutions segment reached a new record with first quarter revenue of $180 million, up 28% year-over-year. Our Technology and Workforce Solutions segment reach another new high with first quarter revenue of 145 million, up 64% year-over-year. Adjusted SG&A excluding certain non-recurring expenses and stock-based compensation expense was $239 million this quarter, or 15.4% of revenue compared with $148 million or 16.8% of revenue in the year ago quarter. In the first quarter, Nurse and Allied revenue was $1.228 billion, 87% higher than prior year and up 14% sequentially. Physician and Leadership Solutions revenue in the first quarter was $180 million, 28% higher year-over-year and up 10% sequentially. Technology and Workforce Solutions revenue was $145 million in the first quarter, growing 64% year-over-year, and 23% sequentially. So we don't know -- they left the workforce, which aligns pretty well, but some of the public reports that we've seen,\n I think at the other end of that kind of metric spectrum is how many people are applying with us and coming in to travel, nursing or allied and as we first quarter certainly was a very high point, a lot of interest in the crisis assignments."
