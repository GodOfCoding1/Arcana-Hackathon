    "content": " Given that our stock currently trades at a significant discount to our net asset value per share, which was $15.89 per share at quarter end, we strongly believe that increasing the amount to be repurchased under our existing share repurchase policy is an efficient deployment of existing capital and should be very accretive to our current shareholders and net investment income, possibly providing higher returns to our current shareholders. During the quarter, we made 19 new investment commitments totaling $184 million across 10 new portfolio companies and 9 existing portfolio companies, while we had sales and repayments from 4 portfolio companies. As of June 30, the yield on our performing loan portfolio increased to a gross annual yield prior to leverage of 9.51% compared to 9.12% at the end of the first quarter of 2022 with a weighted average purchase price of 98% of par and an average investment size of about $15 million per portfolio company. As Michael mentioned, as of June 30, investments on non-accrual status were 1.5% and 3.6% of the total investment portfolio at fair value and at amortized cost, respectively, compared to 0.6% and 2.5%, respectively, at the end of the first quarter. Had the STATinMED transaction closed on June 30 as opposed to July 1, the pro forma investments on non-accrual status at quarter end would have been 0.5% and 2.4% of the total investment portfolio at fair value and at amortized cost respectively. As interest rates continue to rise above our floor levels, we expect an increase to our net interest income of about $0.13 per share for the next 100 basis point increase to the current base rate as of June 30 and $0.26 per share or a 200 basis point increase to the base rate, assuming no material changes to the investment portfolio or debt structure."
