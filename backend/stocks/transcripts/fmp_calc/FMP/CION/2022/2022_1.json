    "content": " We remain focused on first lien debt investments and we're able to keep the level of these investments at the end of the quarter, unchanged from a year ended 2021 at 92% which represents a significant increase from 82% of our portfolio at year-end 2020. As Michael will discuss in more detail shortly, during the quarter and subsequent to quarter end, we successfully increased our total debt capacity by $150 million by increasing the principal amount available for borrowing from JPMorgan by $100 million and borrowed an additional $50 million pursuant to an unsecured term loan. Despite challenging market conditions, we are pleased to have successfully increased our total available borrowing capacity by $150 million from 2 of our existing lenders, consisting of an increase in the total committed principal amount available for borrowing from JPMorgan by $100 million in March and the closing of a $50 million 5-year floating rate unsecured term loan in April. In spite of the high net inflows into the loan market during the quarter, market uncertainty impacted transaction activity as the total new market loan issuance was $149.1 billion, a 35% decline from the first quarter of 2021. At quarter end, we had 198 investments across 115 portfolio companies in 22 industries with a total fair value of about $1.7 billion, comprised of 93.9% in senior secured debt. As of March 31, our performing loan portfolio had a gross annual yield prior to leverage of 9.12% compared to 9.16% at the end of the fourth quarter with a weighted average purchase price of 98.06% of par and an average investment size of about $15.1 million per portfolio company. During the quarter, net investment income increased by $0.02 per share to $19.5 million or $0.34 per share compared to $18.4 million or $0.32 per share in the fourth quarter."
