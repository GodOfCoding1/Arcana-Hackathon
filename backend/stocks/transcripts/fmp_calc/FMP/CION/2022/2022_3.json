    "content": " We believe that the quality of our performing floating rate investments, which at September 30 accounted for 89.1% of our total portfolio, should further positively affect our net investment income in the coming quarters. As of September 30, the yield on our performing loan portfolio increased to a gross annual yield before leverage of 10.98%, up materially from 9.51% at the end of the second quarter of 2022 and 9.16% at the end of 2021, with a weighted average purchase price of 97.19% at par and an average investment size of about $15 million per portfolio company as of 9/30. As Michael mentioned, at September 30, investments on nonaccrual status declined to 0.4% and 1.7% of the total investment portfolio at fair value and at amortized costs, respectively, compared to 1.5% and 3.6%, respectively, at the end of the second quarter. As interest rates continue to rise, we expect an increase to our net interest income of about $0.12 per share to the next 100 basis point increase to the base rate as of September 30 and $0.25 per share for a 200 basis point increase to the base rate, assuming no material changes to the investment portfolio or our debt structure."
