    "content": " As has been the case each quarter for the past year, our fourth quarter net investment income of $0.43 per share outearned the $0.31 per share dividend we declared for the fourth quarter of 2022. As of December 31, the yield on our performing loan portfolio increased to a gross annual yield before leverage of 12.61%, up materially from 10.98% at the end of the third quarter of 2022 and 9.16% at the end of 2021, with a weighted average purchase price of 97.81% of par at an average investment size of about $15 million per portfolio company as of 12/31/22. During the quarter, net investment income was $23.9 million or $0.43 per share as compared to $25.6 million or $0.45 per share reported in the third quarter. For the full year, net investment income was $88.2 million or $1.56 per share compared to $74.3 million or $1.31 per share for the full year 2021. As interest rates continue to rise, we expect an increase to our net interest income of about $0.12 per share for the next 100 basis point increase to the base rate as of December 31 and $0.25 for a 200-basis point increase to the base rate, and that's assuming no material changes to the investment portfolio or a debt structure."
