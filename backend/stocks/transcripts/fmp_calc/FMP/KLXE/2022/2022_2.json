    "content": " During the second quarter, KLX generated $184.4 million in revenue, up 21% sequentially from $152.3 million in Q1, which was above the top end of our prior guidance. Likewise, we generated Q2 adjusted EBITDA of $17.4 million, increasing $12.5 million sequentially or 255%. However, as we telegraphed on our last call, the prior monthly revenue record did not last long, and we continue to see meaningful monthly improvements exiting the second quarter on an upper $700 million revenue run rate with adjusted EBITDA margins trending towards the low double digits. For the second quarter, revenues were $184.4 million, an increase of $32.1 million or 21% as compared to the first quarter. Adjusted operating income and adjusted EBITDA improved sequentially by $12.1 million and $12.5 million or 127% and 255%, respectively. The segment increased its revenue by 16% sequentially as compared to the first quarter, generating revenue of $60 million in Q2. Q2 adjusted operating income for the segment was $1.8 million compared to first quarter adjusted operating loss of $300,000 and adjusted EBITDA was $6.4 million for the second quarter compared to first quarter adjusted EBITDA of $4.2 million. The increase in cash was largely driven by $20 million of additional borrowings on our ABL facility as well as $5.3 million in share sales under our ATM program and continued monetization of $3.9 million in obsolete assets and non-core real property, offset by $14.4 million of semiannual interest paid in early May. We didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t explicitly guide on Q3 adjusted EBITDA guidance, but we did forecast sequential revenue growth as well as an uptick in margins to be 10% to 12% in the third quarter, which would imply that on a run rate basis, our net leverage ratio should continue to improve going forward."
