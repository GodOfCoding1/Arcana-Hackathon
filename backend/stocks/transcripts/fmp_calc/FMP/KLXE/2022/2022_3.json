    "content": " For the third quarter, KLX generated $222 million in revenue, up 20% sequentially from Q2, which was above our increased guidance range of 16% to 18% and well ahead of overall market growth in rig count and frac spreads. On a product line basis, drilling, completion, production and intervention products and services contributed approximately 26%, 52%, 12% and 10% to revenue, respectively, for the third quarter of 2022. The Rocky Mountains segment third quarter revenue of $66.5 million, increased by $13.4 million or 25% as compared with the second quarter. I'd say if you look at our asset base and product service offering, we've got numerous service lines such as our tech services, fishing, wireline, downhole tool business, which is materially less asset intensive, whereas the rentals business pumping, coiled tubing, et cetera, are more capital-intensive businesses."
