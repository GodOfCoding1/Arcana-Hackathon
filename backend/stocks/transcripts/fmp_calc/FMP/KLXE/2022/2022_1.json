    "content": " As we look at our Q1 exit rate, we exited the quarter on a high note, generating March revenue of approximately $58 million, setting a new monthly high since the closing of the QES merger in Q2 2020, a record that will not stand alone as we continue to work through the second quarter. With that said, March annualized revenue and adjusted EBITDA was just over $692 million and $46.5 million respectively and sets a new normal baseline as we work through Q2 and expect activity, pricing, and margin to continue to improve. For the first quarter ended March 31, 2022, revenues were $152.3 million, an increase of $7.3 million, or 5%, as compared to revenue for the pro forma fourth quarter. The Rocky segment, first quarter revenue of $43.3 million increased by $8 million or 23% as compared with pro forma in fourth quarter. The segment generated first quarter revenue of $51.9 million and was largely in line with pro forma fourth quarter results, experiencing an increase of only $1.7 million or 3% as compared to the pro forma fourth quarter."
