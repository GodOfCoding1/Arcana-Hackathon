In the quarter, we performed just over 142,000 surgical cases, nearly 14% more than 2021, resulting in net revenue of approximately $600 million or 16.4% higher than the comparable prior year quarter. More importantly, our recruiting cohorts continue to demonstrate strong year-over-year growth with first quarter recruits from our 2020 and 2021 cohorts, generating over 35% and 20% more revenue respectively in the current year quarter as compared to the prior year comparable period. Please proceed with your question. Please proceed with your question. Please proceed with your question. Please proceed with your question. Please proceed with your question. But to Wayne's point, I don't see that as a \u2013 it's not going to be something that, it's a detriment for us getting these done, and honestly, what we're trying to figure out is wherever we can instead of doing completely greenfield, how do we do brownfield, how do we find facilities that may allow us to cut time off that. Please proceed with your question. Please proceed with your question."
