    "content": " We continue our strong revenue growth, which is driven by underlying recurring business in new markets, we successfully launched new proprietary content studios and expanding our exclusive game roadmap, we continue to grow our total addressable markets, which we project to reach $21.5 billion by the end of the year, we're increasing our gross profit margin, our adjusted EBITDA margin, which are all driven by changing in our product mix, and of course, we showed solid financial flexibility with a debt-free balance sheet, and so the strong Q1 2022 performance sets the foundation for continued successful execution of our growth strategy."
