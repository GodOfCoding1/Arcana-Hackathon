    "content": " Our games and product development machine has been reinforced with top content partners and complemented with tier one customers, partnerships with leading companies like Bluberi and Galaxy Gaming, produced online-first games and deployed with blue chip operators in the U.S. and Europe, including our newly launched turnkey partners, the Netherlands and the Czech Republic. Your line is open. Your line is open. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re changing the number of proprietary games, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re putting more development resources behind them, so we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve established them again, as we outlined, in record time, we were able to re-group or re-establish two new studios around the resources that were in the company acquired through the U.S. acquisitions, and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re building around them, so more developers, more game production, more authentications in more territories, also separating between the EU and the U.S. production lines, and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the reason why we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re looking to increase both production and deployment, because deploying in regulated territories is not a trivial task, and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re streamlining that process so we can do more with the existing resources. Your line is open. Some U.S. games are accepted well - we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen some Atomic Slot Lab games received well in the U.K. and other territories, but generally speaking, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re trying to cater for each market, and if we get the benefit of transferability, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s great, but we assume that the players in each market sort of have their own tastes, especially when you talk about central Europe versus the U.S. Maybe one last one from me and then I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll pass the line. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open."
