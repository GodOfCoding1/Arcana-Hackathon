    "content": " We've been extremely busy growing our content ecosystem, alongside our ongoing development of market-focused proprietary titles led by our U.S. and Slovenia in-house game studios, we have also struck exclusive deals with Bally's Interactive's, which include the King Show Games and Gaming Arts titles, incredible technologies, and Sega Sammy Creation. First of all in terms of organic growth we're seeing good healthy growth across the board but as we are a dominant player in the Dutch market and that market over indexes naturally for us, it's also relatively new one so growth there is more apparent, but we are seeing good growth in our other markets as well. That's -- it's not something, we analyze it, we realize there's going to be a questions around that, but we are confident that we are going to go back to the 52%-ish, 53%-ish gross profit margins and the more proprietary content we're going to rollout this quarter and the beginning of next quarter in the U.S. mostly we will see the gross profits increasing. Also, we just need to remember that we always have a lag -- how to say a gap between when our -- when revenue will be derived from particular content we are building and investment we're doing in our technology and the capitalization rate that it's cost -- that it's starting at the period and the first period, then a couple of months later you can see the return."
