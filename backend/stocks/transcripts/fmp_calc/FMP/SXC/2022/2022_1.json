    "content": " Turning to Slide 4, the first quarter net income attributable to SunCoke was $0.35 per share, up $0.15 versus the prior year period, primarily driven by export coke sales. On the backdrop of the first quarter performance, we now expect to modestly exceed the domestic coke adjusted EBITDA guidance range of $229 million to $235 million. Finally, as I stated earlier, continued strength in commodity markets combined with our excellent first quarter results leads us to project full year results to modestly exceed our adjusted EBITDA guidance of $240 million to $255 million. Again, record starts the year looks like Domestic Coke adjusted EBITDA per ton was $79, logistics shipments higher than I\u2019d expected especially given some real delays. And the success we\u2019ve had in the export market, and then as you properly point out, we benefited from having some coal carry over from 2021 into 2022, and when you think about that kind of onetime benefit, it was slightly in excess of $10 million in the quarter."
