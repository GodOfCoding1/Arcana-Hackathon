    "content": " The third quarter net income attributable to SunCoke was $0.49 per share up $0.22 versus the prior year period, primarily driven by higher margin on export coke sales, as well as income tax benefits from foreign tax and research and development tax credits. Third quarter domestic coke adjusted EBITDA was a record $76.6 million and coke sales volume was 1,022,000 tons, the $11.5 million increase in adjusted EBITDA as compared to the same prior year period was mainly driven by higher margins on export coke sales, and higher energy sales pricing. Finally, based on the outstanding performance of our operating segments, aided by favorable export coke market conditions, we look to surpass the high-end of our full year, adjusted EBITDA guidance of $285 million for 2022."
