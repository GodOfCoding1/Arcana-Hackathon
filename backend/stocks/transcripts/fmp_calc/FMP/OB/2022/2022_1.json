    "content": " Lapping a very strong Q1 last year, our Ex-TAC gross profit was up 5% or 8% on a constant currency basis to $63.5 million, in line with our guidance, and our adjusted EBITDA of $11.6 million exceeded the guidance we provided. Now for Ex-TAC gross profit in Q1, which is the revenue we keep after paying traffic acquisition cost to our media partners, we\u2019ve reported an increase of $3 million or 5% year-over-year to $63.5 million. So with that context, we've provided the following guidance: For the second quarter, we expect Ex-TAC gross profit of $59 million to $62 million; on a constant currency basis, Ex-TAC gross profit would be $61 million to $64 million; for adjusted EBITDA, we expect $4 million to $6 million."
