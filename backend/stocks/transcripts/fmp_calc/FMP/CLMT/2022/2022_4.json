    "content": " With me on today's call are Todd Borgmann, CEO; Vince Donargo, CFO; Bruce Fleming, EVP Montana/Renewables and Corporate Development; Scott Obermeier, EVP of Specialty; and Marc Lawn, EVP of Sustainable Products and Strategy. As Montana Renewables launched operations and our specialty business led the company to a record setting full year adjusted EBITDA of $390 million, a new high for Calumet. As I mentioned on the last quarter's call back in November, the fourth quarter is typically the weakest for performance brands and we saw even more seasonal impact this quarter than we typically do as big box retailers focus on inventory control going into year-end. Despite these challenges, Montana still delivered $75.9 million of adjusted EBITDA in 2022 and we look forward to 2023 as the legacy specialty asphalt plant is fully operational and Montana Renewables is close to achieving run rate EBITDA with the pre-treater coming online in April. Last, it's difficult to talk about the ultimate potential of Montana Renewables with talking -- without talking sustainable aviation fuel or what we call MAX SAF. Just when we think about -- you have a lot of different funding mechanisms potentially at Montana Renewable, but there -- there's also a potential capital call that you have this year, that would require you to keep cash at that entity. No, I'm just talking about I believe the preferred instrument requires you to keep there's the way you distribute cash from Montana Renewable, you have a capital call potential for the year and you decide whether you're going to send money out to Calumet or keep it in."
