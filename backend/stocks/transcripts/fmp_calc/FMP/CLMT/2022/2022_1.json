    "content": " Even though we've expected to sell canola-based RD in the Canada for some time given our proximity, it's nice to know that 60,000 barrels a day of Canadian exported canola oil will be suitable for US markets too, as most of that production is close to the Great Falls than any other facility. So as we think about our specialty margins in terms of where we're at today, Todd had mentioned, during the first quarter with the run-up in crude, we did have some compression, but overall, we were pleased with how we executed against the run-up in crude, still delivered over $50 barrel."
