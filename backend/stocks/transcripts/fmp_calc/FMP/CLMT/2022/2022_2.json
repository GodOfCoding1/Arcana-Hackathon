    "content": " With me on today's call are Todd Borgmann, CEO; Vince Donargo, CFO; Bruce Fleming, EVP Montana/Renewables and Corporate Development; Scott Obermeier, EVP Specialty Products and Solutions; Marc Lawn, EVP Performance Brands; and Steve Mawer, our Executive Chairman. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. So if we simulated everything that's happened this year, and then assuming that we had the future refinery, the specialty asphalt refinery, 12,000 barrels a day, we would have made $40 million to $50 million of EBITDA year-to-date. That's a bit confusing, because historically we've said it's about $50 million -- we expect that smaller business to be about a $50 million run rate business as it serves the local market and kind of focuses on more specialty asphalt. It's an integrated business and obviously the larger volumes are coming from some of the fuel byproducts and the higher volume specialty solvents, lube oils, that really are benefiting from kind of high commodity margins and it looks like it's going to be that way for the foreseeable future."
