    "content": " We're also excited by our preclinical data, which indicates that ImmTOR or ImmTOR-IL may potentially transform the treatment paradigm for AAV gene therapy from a one-and-done to a low-and-slow, whereby patients could receive multiple lower doses of gene therapy, titrate up to a therapeutic benefit, and avoid the risk associated with high rate of doses of AAV gene therapy needed in a one-time only treatment model.
