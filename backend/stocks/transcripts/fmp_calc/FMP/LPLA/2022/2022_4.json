    "content": " And so I think that places that we've been historically focused on for the past, call it, four to five years has been typically around the advisory platform, right, 70%, 75% of new assets -- sorry, yes, new cash is going to those types of solutions, and we want to make sure that we're enriching the appeal of them. So we're excited about the potential opportunity and for it to continue to sort of grow share, if you will, in that overall mix of business, both with respect to advisory but we even think about it across a full spectrum of brokerage, because the more appealing we make this even at smaller accounts, where it's appropriate, and people feel that the plan is better served from that movement of brokerage to advisory, a lot of that would tend to move over to centrally managed solution. Maybe to add to that, if you're curious around why the trend or better growth in brokerage over the past three to four quarters, I think that's the evolving interest rate environment and advisers using solutions that may be more brokerage-oriented solutions, whether that be fixed income or whether that be annuities of which to help clients seeking higher yield or higher rates. I think it's a key part for our advisers and clients knowing that if the macro moves against us, and we're not at a leverage ratio, we're going to have to immediately pull back on investments or immediately pull back on being able to serve and support them and the host of capabilities that we have, recruiting and succession being an example."
