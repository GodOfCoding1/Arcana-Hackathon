    "content": " With respect to our new affiliation models, strategic wealth, employees and our enhanced RIA offering, we recruited over $2 billion in assets in the quarter and believe we are well positioned to drive continued growth across all three models. Looking at overall client cash balances, the end of the quarter at $67 billion, down $3 billion sequentially driven by client net buying activity of $20 million, which is the highest quarterly level we have ever seen. Your line is open. And I think with respect to that second category, we continue to look through the entire ecosystem from smaller growth-oriented deals like the binding scattered good ample that you saw us do in the second quarter all the way up to if there were a more opportunistic opportunity to create value, deploy our capital in a way that makes sense relative to other options and alternatives that operationally, we can consume that acquisition and execute on it well fits inside our strategy, then we would be interested in certainly exploring those opportunities in. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. And I think you'll see that we still sit in sort of that 52% to 53% range of assets now in advisory, and that probably hasn't continued to trend up as much as we would have expected, a little bit because of the macro, probably more because of some of the larger bank or enterprise solutions that we brought on, just have a higher mix of brokerage assets than typically independent advisers that we recruit new. We see opportunities in returning capital to shareholders that we've talked about today, increasing the buyback in Q4 at $150 million and then pivoting to a $250 million -- roughly $250 million per quarter next year. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open."
