    "content": " Actual results might differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements as a result of known and unknown risks, uncertainties, and other factors, including those described in our public releases and reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including, but not limited to, our most recent annual report on Form 10-K. For the fourth quarter of 2022, we delivered total revenue of $83 million, of which roughly 55% was derived from our RCM offering, TruBridge. Recognizing that evolution, you'll notice that we've slightly changed the presentation of our revenue streams to better reflect the three distinct business units that we see within CPSI; TruBridge's RCM business, the combined acute and post-acute EHR business, and our nascent high-potential patient engagement unit. On that topic, bookings for the fourth quarter totaled $24.7 million, driven by continued strength in our RCM business with the EHR business unit closing out strong with its best bookings performance of the year driven by net new hospital client wins. In looking at the individual components of RCM bookings, cross-sell bookings were up 98%compared to the fourth quarter of last year, while bookings from outside of our EHR customer base increased to 7.6 times the prior year amount as the strength of HRG's sales force has made this a core competency. Our gross margins of44.6% for the fourth quarter were down 520 basis points year-over-year due to the increase in our RCM services business, whether through acquisition of HRG or through organic bookings driven growth, the lion's share of 2023's topline gains came from high touchpoint lower margin service lines causing a heavy shift in revenue mix that pulled gross margins down."
