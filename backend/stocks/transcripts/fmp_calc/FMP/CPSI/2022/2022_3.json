    "content": " With respect to bookings, total CPSI bookings of $20.5 million were down 30% versus the third quarter of 2021. As we continue to build on the cross-sell opportunity within our CPSI customer base, we're encouraged that cross-sell bookings increased 30% sequentially and greater than 3.5x those of the third quarter of 2021. With respect to the third quarter results, total revenue of $82.8 million increased 18% year-over-year and benefited from our acquisition of HRG in March of this year. Gross margin of 45.9% in the quarter represented a decrease of 440 basis points year-over-year, which can be attributed to 2 primary factors: first, the inclusion of HRG's lower-margin services-intensive revenue, which was acquired earlier this year; and second, the implementation delays that we experienced at 2 sites for GRH impacted the top line for that business unit whose revenue comes at an incremental margin meaningfully higher than that of our corporate average. EBITDA of $13.3 million increased 9% year-over-year and translated to an EBITDA margin of 16.1%, down 140 basis points versus the prior year quarter."
