    "content": " And we see a lot of demand now Dan from central labs, like we mentioned last quarter, Ambry Genetics, but we're having more conversations with really Tier 1 labs that are very well known in the U.S., where our menu offering and the fact that our platform is fully scalable, could enable them if you like to enter a new market, such as HRD, but as well operationally be more effective so that they could have better gross margins. And I think there was a lot of questions around how we would penetrate some of the more centralized elements in the U.S. And I would say pretty confidently now, if you look at our pipeline and you look at some of the announcements we hope to make over the back half of the year and into 2023, we feel quite good about that thesis, evolving to not just be decentralization, but actually powering up some of the top specialty and central labs in the U.S. And again, if you think about some of the comments that Tejas made around labor pressure and other margin pressures, one of the easy ways to get gross margin savings is to move to SOPHiA, right, on the bioinformatics side. But certainly, relative to Jurgi's comments, we're quite excited about the multitude of ways we'll be able to monetize this move, and it's a pretty material, I would say, upgrade in the business strategy for us moving again just from an insight player to a true data player, which is, I think, on a long-term basis in terms of our positioning, a very compelling proposition. And so I would not always expect that level of ASP improvement probably on a net new basis, but more so on legacy stable business as we think about sort of two steps for SOPHiA, sort of our recurring revenue, which is our core base where we talk to you about the net dollar retention, where we've got very high level of visibility and we keep growing that base over time."
