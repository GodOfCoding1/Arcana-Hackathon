    "content": " Second quarter revenue grew approximately 15% year over year to $11.7 million from $10.2 million in 2021 despite significant headwinds on FX which negatively impacted our growth by approximately 1,500 basis points due to a material depreciation of the euro, Swiss franc and Turkish lira against the U.S. dollar in the period. R&D expenses for the second quarter of 2022 were $9 million, an increase from $6.4 million in the second quarter of 2021 which underscores our continued investment in technology and product development, particularly as we prepare for the initial deployment of CarePath later this year, and an increase in share-based compensation. And then one last one, and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m sure we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll get to another piece, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve also, I would say, from your model of Turkey relatively conservatively for the rest of the year, and so we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve tried to take that into consideration as that piece of our business is -- as maybe Jurgi will talk to later -- was a bit challenged in the quarter."
