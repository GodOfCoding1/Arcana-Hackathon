    "content": " The major expectation was for SOPHiA to deliver on its top line growth commitment, while the three questions were: One, while successful so far in Europe, is SOPHiA GENETICS' decentralized model compatible with the US market; two, would SOPHiA GENETICS be able to demonstrate that their anonymized genomic profile data collected in the course of their clinical business would have value beyond clinical, especially to biopharma; three, could SOPHiA GENETICS show that their AI and machine learning algorithms would be applicable across multiple modalities beyond just genomics. Regarding our execution against this pillar, paired with the momentum building with our partners, be that Microsoft, MSK, Qiagen and AstraZeneca, I feel more than excited today that these are the elements that will enable SOPHiA to do what we set out to do 11 years ago, to harness data from the global community to generate actionable insights that contribute meaningfully to patient care and patient outcomes that contribute meaningfully towards our customer success and that deliver outstanding performance for SOPHiA GENETICS in 2023 and beyond."
