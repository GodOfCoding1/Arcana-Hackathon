    "content": " There are many moving parts this quarter, but the key takeaway is that the proactive steps we took in the second half of last year to create a much more efficient operating model and drive increased adoption of our Encompass solution resulted in a materially better business profile, which directly improved cash flow from operations and our unit economics. Fourth, I'm going to illustrate the margin expansion we saw in Q4 2022 versus Q4 2021 of our internal Medicare business by leveraging the Encompass solution on the more efficient operating model we built in the second half of 2022. Included in our Q4 2022 reported financial statements is a lookback adjustment related to business sold in 2021 and prior with $266 million reduction to revenue and $187 million reduction to adjusted EBITDA, which can be seen on Slide 10. Excluding the impact of the LTV look back adjustment made this quarter and normalizing for the exit of our non-Encompass BPO Services, our Q4 2022 revenue would have been $302 million, and our adjusted EBITDA would have been $85 million, which is depicted in the last comps on their respective graphs on Slide 10. On a full year 2022 basis, excluding the Q1 through Q4 lookback adjustments, and normalizing for the exit of our non-Encompass BPO Services, our revenue would have been $797 million, and our adjusted EO would have been $42 million, which is illustrated on Slide 11. In comparison, we have a meaningfully positive year one cash flow profile of $275 for each of the sale completed under the Encompass solutions model, representing a change of $555 in cash per policy on a year-long basis. Based on the successes from our 2022 exit run rate performance, a more efficient operating model, enhanced commercial relationships, followed results from our Encompass solution and our planned 2023 strategic initiatives, we expect to be able to achieve our guidance ranges that Vijay mentioned earlier."
