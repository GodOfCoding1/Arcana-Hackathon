    "content": " Through the first quarter, we remain on track to deliver on our annual guidance, and in particular, cash flow breakeven by the first half of 2023 as we generated $54 million in cash flow from operations in the first quarter, which was up 75% from last year, reflecting significant growth in our membership volumes that continues to generate cash commissions. Over the course of this year, we will unpack more on our Encompass strategy and results as we believe this will be an important growth driver and improve the cash flow profile of our business, while helping drive quality member growth for our carrier partners. With these results, we are reaffirming our full year guidance range with revenues between $900 million and $1.1 billion, and adjusted EBITDA between $110 million and $150 million, all with the goal of achieving positive operating cash flow on a trailing 12-month basis by the first half of 2023. As mentioned earlier, strong submission growth was driven by both an increase in agents in the first quarter of this year relative to last year, combined with continued growth of our external channel. We collected a record $335 million of cash commissions during the quarter, an 83% increase in cash collections relative to Q1 of last year. Strong cash collections, combined with our highly efficient funnel, led to positive operating cash flow of $54 million in the first quarter, a 75% increase in cash flows from last year."
