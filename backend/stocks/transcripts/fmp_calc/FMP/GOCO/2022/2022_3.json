    "content": " As a result, you will see the significant change in cash dynamics of the respective models moving from a negative $350 year one cash flow to positive $260 year one cash flow on a unit basis or a $600 improvement in year one cash on a unit basis. This is already evident in our Q3 results with cash flow from operations improving by $136 million year-over-year, of which $114 million was driven by the Encompass Connected deferred revenue. Our commission revenue of $87 million was down 50% from prior year, which is a direct result of our strategic decision earlier this quarter to reduce the number of agents to focus on quality, tenure and improved customer acquisition costs. Normalizing cash flow for the Encompass deferred revenue, we added cash flow from operations loss of $19 million, which compares favorably to a $40 million loss a year ago."
