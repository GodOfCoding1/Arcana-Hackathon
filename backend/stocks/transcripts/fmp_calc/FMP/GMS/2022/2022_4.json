    "content": " Looking at Slide 3 and going into more details of our fourth quarter results, we grew net sales 38%, with just over 40% gross profit growth, as our teams continued to do an outstanding job passing through higher pricing across our product portfolio. As expected, as we saw supply chain improvements, particularly in steel, we brought down inventory and drove significantly improved free cash flow of $191.6 million, which was 124% of adjusted EBITDA, compared with 80% of adjusted EBITDA a year ago. During fiscal 2022, we experienced double-digit year-over-year growth in complementary products each quarter, with full year net sales growth of 28% as a result of both price increases and higher volumes. Organically, fourth quarter Wallboard sales grew 26.5% year-over-year, comprised of a 24.9% increase in price mix and a 1.6% increase in volume. Ceiling tile and grid fourth quarter sales of $148.9 million increased 22.7% year-over-year and 24.7% on a per day basis, comprised of a 20.9% benefit from price and mix, and a 3.8% increase in volume. Organic sales in ceilings grew 17%, with 19% of price and mix and a 2% decrease in volume, as declines in Canadian sales due to timing of certain larger projects offset increases in the U.S. Fourth quarter steel framing sales of $276.9 million increased 93.3%, or 96.3% on a same day basis, as steel price and mix increased 101.8% with volumes down 5.5%. Complementary product sales of $371.8 million for quarter grew 27.9% year-over-year or 29.9% on a same day basis, as we benefit from positive contributions from acquisitions as well as strong pricing across the category. Our gross profit of $412.8 million increased 40.5% as compared with a year ago, principally due to our successful pass through of product inflation, continued strength in residential market demand and incremental gross profit from acquisitions, gross margin percent for the quarter came in better-than-expected at 32%, as steel prices remained higher than initially anticipated. Based on the continued strength we expect in near-term residential demand, we currently expect to generate year-over-year organic sales growth in the low 20% range, or approximately 30% total net sales growth inclusive of our already completed acquisitions."
