    "content": " Returning to e-commerce growth after absorbing the pandemic gains early in the year, notching a 21% Q4 digital comp and creating the baseline for future growth, building deeper and stronger connections with our core consumers, powered by our loyalty initiatives at Schuh and J&M, which we will expand to Journeys this year with the launch of its new loyalty program Journeys All Access and making continued major investments in marketing and consumer insights to drive sales, build awareness and elevate our brands. In summary, fourth quarter adjusted operating income was $51 million, a 7% operating margin compared to $66.4 million or 9.1% last year and 8.8% pre-pandemic. However, the sales decline in what is traditionally one of our lowest volume quarters will result in roughly 400 basis points to 500 basis points of SG&A deleverage given our high fixed cost base resulting in a Q1 earnings per share loss, including roughly $1.5 million of interest expense and a basic share account of around 11.9 million shares. Taking all this into account, we expect fiscal year 2024 sales to range from flat to up 2% or down 1% to up 1%, excluding the 53rd week and adjusted earnings per share to range from $5.10 to $5.90 per share with our best current expectation for sales and earnings per share near the midpoint of the range or roughly flat to last year."
