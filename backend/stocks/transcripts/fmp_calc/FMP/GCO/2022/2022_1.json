    "content": " First, revenue and operating profit exceeded pre-pandemic levels, increasing 9% and 125% respectively over Q1 fiscal 2020, two years ago, even with our stores open for a little less than 90% of the possible operating days in the quarter given closures primarily in the UK and Canada. However, looking back at how our business has changed since fiscal 2020, ecommerce has become a larger percentage and our licensed brands segment has become a larger piece of the total as well due to the acquisition of Togast and strong Levi's sales. Higher revenue in excess of pre-pandemic levels combined with SG&A that remains well-managed, led to significantly higher operating income versus fiscal 2020 and Q1 adjusted earnings per share of $0.79, compared to $0.33 in fiscal 2020. In terms of the specifics for the quarter, consolidated revenue was $539 million, up 9% compared to fiscal 2020, driven by continued strengthen ecommerce, up 144% versus fiscal 2020 combined with strong results from Journeys and licensed brands compared to pre-pandemic levels. Overall digital sales increased to 25% of our retail business compared to 11% in fiscal 2020, led by Journeys' penetration improvement, Schuh's ability to capture loss  store sales online, and J&M's double digit improvement compared to fiscal 2020. I think that that is largely some of the drivers that give us the opportunity going forward and fortunately, the strength of Journeys and licensed brands were able to even overcome the time that we need for those businesses to recover and deliver a very strong first quarter performance."
