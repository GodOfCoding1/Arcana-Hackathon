    "content": " And revenue growth, better-than-expected gross margins and expense leverage resulted in an operating income increase of almost 70% over pre-pandemic levels and record EPS of $2.36 compared with $0.85 last year and $1.33 two years ago, all on an adjusted basis. Digital sales, which come with double-digit operating margins, increased 11% year-over-year and 79% compared to fiscal '20. Next, increasing gross margin by 210 basis points versus last year, driven primarily by higher full-price selling and price increases while being flat with fiscal '20 in spite of the changing mix of our business and some freight expense pressure. Direct sales held onto most of last year's very strong gains as Journeys increased social media and digital advertising, driving an almost 30% increase in online conversion versus two year ago results. In addition, J&M's apparel business, highlighted by printed woven shirts and knits increased by over 30% versus two years ago, endorsing efforts to position J&M as a modern lifestyle brand with broader consumer reach. J&M's gross margin was up 230 basis points to fiscal year '20, benefiting from strong full-price selling, which also drove the release of slow-moving inventory reserves. Finally, Licensed Brands gross margin was down 150 basis points to fiscal year '20, as we experienced 740 basis points of pressure on Q3 margins from additional logistics costs, which more than offset margin improvements in the business. In summary, third quarter adjusted operating income was $45.2 million, a 7.5% operating margin compared to $26.7 million or 5% for fiscal year '20. Based on the strength of our performance this year-to-date, current Q4 visibility, and expectations for a more normal holiday selling season, we expect fiscal year '22 sales to grow 9% to 11% compared to the pre-pandemic fiscal year '20."
