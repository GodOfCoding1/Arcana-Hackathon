Diving a bit deeper into the building infrastructure market, we note that roughly 44% of the 68% of gross revenue that was building infrastructure was residential in nature, including for-sale housing, multifamily housing and mixed-use developments. Gross revenue for the six months ended June 30, comprised of roughly 71% building infrastructure, 12% transportation, 13% power in utilities and 4% other emerging markets. Again, diving a bit deeper into the building infrastructure market for the six months, we know that likewise, roughly 44% of the 71% of gross revenue that was building infrastructure was residential in nature, of which 49% was related to for-sale homebuilding activities."
