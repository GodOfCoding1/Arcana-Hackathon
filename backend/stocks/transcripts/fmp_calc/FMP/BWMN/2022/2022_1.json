    "content": " Within the first week, we've already realized over a $1 million of revenue synergy from this acquisition through a new traffic study engagement with one of Bowman's long-standing quick service restaurant clients. Gross revenue in the first quarter continues to be concentrated on our building infrastructure market at just under 74% followed by power in utilities at 14.5%, transportation at 7.5%, and emerging markets at 4%. While down slightly this quarter over the last year, were confident between the McMahon acquisition and the upcoming spending we expect to begin later this year and next, and the infrastructure bill this trend will quickly reverse course, and the transportation will increasingly become a more meaningful component of our revenue over the next year. As compared to Q1 2021, gross revenue for the first quarter increased 65% or $20.7 million to $52.5 million from $31.8 million. Of the nearly $21 million increase, $7.6 million was from acquired revenue and $13 million was organic representing a 41% organic growth rate on gross revenue. Of the nearly $19 million increase in net revenue, 8.6 million was from acquisition, and the remaining 10 million was organic representing a nearly 36% organic growth rate year over year. As indicated in yesterday's release, we're increasing our outline for top-line guidance to net revenue of $185 million to 200 million and increasing our adjusted EBITDA guidance to $25 million to $29 million."
