    "content": " Adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter increased 21.7% or $13 million to $74 million, with the increase driven by a strong performance in fresh fruit. Adjusted net income was $8.9 million, and adjusted diluted EPS was $0.09 in the quarter versus breakeven in Q4 2021, with the increase driven by higher adjusted EBITDA, offsetting higher interest expense versus the prior year. We take all that the analysis for you back to about $363 million and then what we've done for the purposes of looking at the forecast for 2023, we reallocated the head office costs that was previously absorbed by the Fresh Vegetables division, and you take that off and that gets you back to somewhere around the $350 million."
