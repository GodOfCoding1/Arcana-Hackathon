    "content": " The significant increase in adjusted EBITDA was driven by a strong performance in our Fresh Fruit segment, offset in part by the ongoing recovery in our Vegetables business and a specific challenge in our Diversified Americas segment in the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter increased 26% to $73 million, with the increase driven by a strong performance in the Fresh Fruit segment. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. And then, I just wanted to -- I know you are not guiding for 2023, just given where we are, but like just since -- it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s since mid-November, like, is there anything you can share on performance like quarter-to-date across the divisions, like, it sounds like Fresh Vegetables is going to be a little bit weaker than you anticipated. Your line is open. I think if we look back over the last year, I have said a couple of times on the call, our three segments from Fresh Fruits and our two Diversified businesses, you stand back and you say they have performed pretty solidly, other European business on a like-for-like basis. Our Fresh Fruit business, given our market position and given our diversity of sourcing our shipping capacity, our infrastructural capacity, our management capacity within that division, I think, we are feeling pretty good that those three divisions can continue to perform and we can hopefully build our profitability by bringing even more so the two groups -- two legacy groups together."
