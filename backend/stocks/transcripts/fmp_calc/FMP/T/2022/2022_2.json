    "content": " While we maintain expectations that 2022 industry postpaid phone demand levels are unlikely to replicate 2021, the strength we experienced in the first half of the year, coupled with better ARPU trends, give us confidence in our raised service revenue outlook and expectations for an improved EBITDA trajectory. Our outlook reflects the following expectations: $3 billion-plus lower device payment versus the first half of the year due to timing, nearly $2 billion lower capital investment versus the first half of the year as we reach our $24 billion expectations for the full year. But overall, given the strong growth we had in the first half of the year, our overall device payments for the year are higher than we anticipated, which candidly, this is a very good -- it's a very good situation because we think this is attractive growth, and we feel really good about it."
