    "content": " We have a very process-driven organization that's very focused on delivering what we ask them to do, and that's a great strength, but sometimes that means that people are very literal about looking at a number and saying, I will get you that number and maybe don't \u2013 raise the point that says, if you gave me a little bit of flexibility, I could do something a lot more efficiently or effectively for the next two years. Operator, we can move to the next question. And because of the good job of marketing the slate for the movies, I think what we're seeing is evidence that they say, well, gosh, I'm now into it two, three weeks, and I know there is another one coming next month that I want to see I'm sticking around. And so, I think, it's just the classic approach to managing any SVOD service, although we're playing to our strengths and how we're tiering the content, and we're using theatrical maybe a little bit more heavily than other services might use because that's one of our strong suits. Operator, we can move to the next question. Operator, if we can move to the next question. Operator, if we can move to the next question. And I will tell you it's one of the areas where, frankly, over the last couple of months, we're really pleased with the team's execution and how we've been working that data set and that customer base to put the right attractive offers in place and one of those things were because we have a relationship with the customer. So it just \u2013 it all comes together in a way that's really goodness, and that's what you're seeing work through the numbers. In fact, I think, we're doing some things right now that are improving our performance overall because our focus on the market and how we're thinking about the integrated customer experience and, really, what we're now starting to do took us maybe a little too long to get there. And I would submit to you, you can plow through the numbers and see that it's being done in the right way across the board where these are growing products that they're growing in the right way with the opportunity for high-value subscribers that are highly satisfied, sticky with long and service lines, and I feel really good about that in terms of building the franchise."
