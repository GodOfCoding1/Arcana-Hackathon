    "content": " Overall, we finished the third quarter 2022 with total revenue of $11.1 million, which includes core lung diagnostic testing revenue of $9.2 million, reflecting very strong lung diagnostic revenue growth of 102% year-over-year and 26% growth over second quarter of this. With a comprehensive suite of tests, all with Medicare coverage and the ability to offer diagnostic solutions across the continuum of care, we believe we've just begun to scratch the surface of this $29 billion market opportunity and we have both the team and the products to drive continued test volume and revenue growth for the remainder of 2022 and beyond. Most importantly, this was driven by growth from our five core lung diagnostic tests with revenue of $9.2 million from record lung diagnostic test volumes of approximately 6,500 versus 4.5 million from total volumes of approximately 3,800 tests for the third quarter of 2021. We have a few others in the works Andrew that we haven't disclosed and we'll look forward to providing updates when appropriate and when we can here in the coming weeks and months, but we're really shifting focus to continue publishing really strong data, demonstrating that these tests perform exceptionally well in a real world environment and population, empowering physicians to go out and positively impact those patients early, and so you'll start to see more information from us with private payers as we also progressed into 2023. One moment for our next question, please. One moment for our next question, please."
