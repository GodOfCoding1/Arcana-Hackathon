    "content": " While this falls short of our previous guidance of 8,000 homes, we feel this is prudent given today's capital markets environment, where financing rates have climbed much faster than acquisition cap rates and where the securitization market is going through a period of price discovery. When we look back to March of this year, we're financing at rates just over 4% and buying homes at an implied price to FFO multiple of 11x, which is very accretive. So for example, if you're buying at a 6 cap and home prices were to decline by 5%, that's a 30 basis points increase in your acquisition cap rate or if rents or NOI went up by 5%, that's another 30 basis points or if the Fed pauses or slows down, again, financing rates maybe come in a little bit. So it's something -- it is interesting to kind of think about it from a private market perspective because if we could buy homes, let's say, the 6 cap and we can grow that NOI at 5% or 6%, we've been doing that over the long term, obviously, much higher now. Yes, the way we would think about it is if you look at the cost to maintain, which includes everything that we're expensing and capitalizing, that's up about 21% and about 40% of that is related to inflation, whether it's labor or materials. I think into next year, again, I'm sticking my neck out here, my best guess is that's probably -- that again, moderates maybe to about 5%, right, from what we're seeing."
