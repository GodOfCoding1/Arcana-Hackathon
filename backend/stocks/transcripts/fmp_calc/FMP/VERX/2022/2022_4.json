    "content": " This is the highest year-over-year revenue growth that we have delivered as a public company and we closed the fourth quarter with adjusted EBITDA of $20.8 million, up 8% from last year. GRR was 96%, up slightly from 95% last year and average annual revenue per customer increased 16% from last year's fourth quarter and exceeded $100,000 for the first time in our history. With capitalized software spend included, R&D spend was $22.5 million for the fourth quarter and $83.9 million for the full year, which represents 17% of revenues for each period, reflecting our ongoing investments in new product development and enhancing existing products to address customer needs. Accordingly, for the first quarter of 2023, we expect total revenue in the range of $131 million to $133 million, which would represent 15% year-over-year growth at the midpoint and adjusted EBITDA in the range of $19 million to $21 million, which would represent an increase of approximately $1 million at the midpoint.

We have the most differentiated set of capabilities between our chain flow, the LCR-Dixon PLUS Tools that we've added, the depth of integrations and now this customer reference-ability, I can't emphasize that enough, having the largest customers in Europe working with our software has really given us a further differentiation, because it's a small community of tax players and so they really want to talk to who else you're doing business with in the region, and that has helped us.
