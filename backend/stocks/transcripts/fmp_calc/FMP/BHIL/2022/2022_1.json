    "content": " As Matt mentioned, we continue to build upon the momentum achieved last year with first quarter consolidated revenues of $92 million, nearly 200% increase year-over-year, led by growth in the ingredients segment with reported revenues of $66 million, up nearly 400%. Looking further at our segment performance, proprietary revenues in the ingredients segment were $14 million, which increased 161% over the prior year, driven by strong sales demand for specialty meal and oil products. Some of these customers, by the way, are prospective customers who have never used soy before, never used soy oil, and Benson Hill is marketing a Non-GMO Project Verified high-oleic, low-linolenic soy oil, which we believe strongly is a great alternative to the sun that's going to see some really significant shortages in the latter part of this year and forward. But as Dean mentioned in his comments, we will expect that -- given the sales cycles and that this is the first full commercial year that the Ultra-High Protein soy portfolio is online, that we'll see some pretty material pickup over the duration of the year, particularly on the protein side. Well, I think what -- from an ingredients perspective, importantly, this proprietary revenue number and the growth that we're seeing there over the duration of the year is going to be an indicator of how our proprietary products and innovations are continuing to gain traction in the space."
