    "content": " As we announced on February 2nd, we expect 2023 will be another year of strong growth, with a 40% to 50% increase in proprietary revenues, to a range of $100 million to $110 million, as we continue to shift the mix away from non-proprietary commodity soy in our closed-loop model. Well, the reduction from a previously published expectation of proprietary ingredients revenue of $350 million to revised $300 million or greater of proprietary revenues reflective of this more targeted strategy, and having reduced the expectation for some of the flour, flake, and lower margin oil product categories."
