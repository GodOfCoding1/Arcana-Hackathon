    "content": " At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Bath & Body Works First Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. I would now like to turn the call over to Ms. Wendy Arlin, Chief Financial Officer at Bath & Body Works. Good morning, and welcome to Bath & Body Works first quarter earnings conference call for the period ended April 30, 2022. As a matter of formality, I need to remind you that any forward-looking statements we may make today are subject to our Safe Harbor statement found in our SEC filings and in our press releases. Joining me on the call today are Executive Chair of the Board and Interim CEO, Sarah Nash; and Brand President, Julie Rosen. Bath & Body Works is an incredible company with a customer-first focus, along with strong product innovation and development capabilities that include a mostly North American and highly agile supply chain. Our execution is excellent, and our strategy of delivering affordable luxuries to our customers is more relevant than ever. Looking ahead in 2022, we are continuing to plan prudently and use our agility to chase winners. We are accelerating investments in the business to drive our long-term growth, while at the same time, our team continues to successfully navigate the inflationary environment. Long term, we continue to see exceptional opportunities to capitalize on Bath & Body Works existing strength and extend the brand's global potential. Since taking on the role of Executive Chair and earlier this month stepping into the Interim CEO role, I have been spending time gaining even deeper knowledge of our team and our capabilities. This is a strong organization, and one that operates with tremendous speed making us nimble and allowing us to deliver products relevant for our customers. We look forward to speaking with you today about initiatives we have underway or are accelerating, all designed to ensure we continue to advance our customer-centric culture, increase our data analytics across the business and with our 60 million customers and leverage our store and digital capabilities to transform Bath & Body Works to be a true omni-channel business. And you'll hear from Julie Rosen, our Brand President, about an example of a successful change to the upside with our Butterfly launch from the first quarter. On a broader level, our ability to leverage our relationships with the world's preeminent fragrance houses, our manufacturing partners and our raw material suppliers, along with our world-class logistics enables us to achieve best-in-class innovation and manufacturing. And this allows us to deliver to our customers what they want, fashion, trends and newness in fragrance, forms and packaging that bring them to light at an accessible price. We remain highly focused on innovation, and our product pipeline is full. We have an ability to develop and launch products within 12 to 14 months, which is also best-in-class for an innovator in the sensed personal care sector. With our pipeline, we are launching new fragrances and products every four to six weeks, and expect to maintain this pace going forward. Importantly, we are also focused on new business opportunities and the acceleration of new product lines for personal care and home, leveraging our stores and digital presence to test and launch these new lines. This business delivered close to $400 million in net sales in 2021, and we expect can more than double its size over time. The beauty, personal care and home fragrance markets continue to be strong and growing. In short, and as I said at the start, Bath & Body Works has exceptional opportunities to leverage our existing strength and extend the brand's global potential. Before I turn the call over to Wendy and Julie to speak about our first quarter performance, I'd also like to take this opportunity to touch briefly on our approach to environmental, social and governance matters, all of which are also core to the Company and how we operate. In addition, we have always included ingredients that are important to our customers. We completed a restage in aroma therapy at the end of February with a new packaging and formulation made without parabens, sulfates or articles without compromising our Fragrance authority. Select fragrances and forms launched with new formulation in the first quarter, and we will continue to expand in the second quarter. Beyond the products themselves, we are also continuing to migrate to PCR packaging for soaps, sanitizers, body care and aroma therapy with a target to expand to 45% of our assortment by year-end. As we migrate to PCR packaging, our bottles will be made with 50% better for Earth materials with the goal to eventually get to 100%. Earlier this year, the Board of Directors amended the charter of the Nominating and Governance Committee to include a commitment to have at least 50% of the Board be diverse and to provide that the initial pool of candidates for any Board vacancy will consist of at least one woman and one person of color. We're applying the same commitment and actions to our hiring throughout the organization, and we are making sure that associates, particularly our diverse associates feel welcome, heard and invested in. We now have eight inclusion resource groups that cultivate an inclusive environment, provide professional development, shape the culture of our company and actively encourage community volunteerism. It is thanks to our dedicated and committed team that following on the last two years of extraordinary growth, the Company started the year continuing our momentum and achieving better-than-expected sales and earnings results. We exceeded our sales and earnings guidance for the first quarter, as Sarah noted. In the quarter, we increased net sales by 2%, excluding the estimated first quarter 2021 sales benefit of $50 million related to government stimulus payments. The Company's net sales in the first quarter of '22, is on top of 53% net sales growth between fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2021. In the United States and Canadian stores, first quarter sales were $1.059 billion, an increase of 1% compared to last year. First quarter direct net sales were $317.5 million, a decrease of 9% compared to last year. The decline is partially due to last year's strong results, as well as our customers utilizing our convenient, omni focused option of buy online, pick up in stores. Our international business, which is a key opportunity for us, continues to drive strong growth for our business. Looking ahead, in 2022, we are accelerating investments in capabilities in the business to support long-term growth. These investments and macro pressures, which we outlined in detail in our commentary released yesterday, could cause this year to vary from our three- to five-year growth algorithm. However, we remain committed to that algorithm, including targeted sales growth and profitability. We, like many other companies, are continuing to experience increased costs in raw materials, transportation and wage rates. We are forecasting incremental pressure versus our initial estimate, and we now estimate that our full year inflation impact could range between $225 million and $250 million or about $75 million higher than our initial estimate. Thus, we expect that the loyalty program will drive sales and customer retention, deepening our relationships with our customers over the long term. Equally as important, we believe that over time, our loyalty program will further increase data-driven analytics and marketing, which will support personalized communications and offers. As we discussed last quarter, we are also investing to establish separate IT capabilities for the Bath & Body Works business. We recently decided to accelerate this work, hiring Accenture to assist us, and we now expect that the separation component of the project to predominantly be completed by next year. Completing separation on this accelerated basis will, in turn, enable us to more quickly build additional technology capabilities to support long-term growth. We are excited to work with Accenture to not only complete our IT separation, but also to truly transform into a data-driven organization, which will allow us to further strengthen our customer connection and capture new market opportunities. For the second quarter of 2022, we expect sales to be up in the low single-digit range compared to the prior year, consistent with our first quarter trend, excluding the stimulus benefit from last year. For the full year, we are forecasting sales to be up low single digits compared to 2021. First, our single fragrance launch in the quarter, Butterfly, was a huge success. Highly inspired by the women in our lives, we wanted to celebrate International Women's Day, Women's History Month, and Mother's Day. As with any new fragrance product, launches are customer tested for initial smelling and wear. For Butterfly, we worked across our fragrance teams, concept and design, MP&A and supply chain, customer insights, marketing and PR and fields and customers to promote and build demand through impactful marketing of social push and in-store and online preview. We not only test fragrance with customers, we also test the packaging with both customers and associates. For Butterfly, we also launched this early in a small group of stores, which, along with our nimble supply chain allowed us to read feedback, react and read order as soon as the products hit all stores. I'd also like to note again that our new product launch time line of 12 to 14 months is best-in-class in the industry, and Butterfly is an excellent example of our capabilities. Butterfly was the number one fragrance for the total company in April, and it was also the number one fragrance in all forms to week of launch. I'd also like to highlight the repackaging of her most beloved fragrance, Japanese Cherry Blossom, in the first quarter. Japanese Cherry Blossom was recognized in March by Women's Wear Delhi as one of the top fragrances of all time, what a huge honor. Japanese Cherry Blossom was launched in 2006, and this was the fifth time we updated the packaging to make it more modern and aesthetically pleasing. Additionally, as we discussed last quarter, we've established a separate and dedicated team focused on innovating into new categories and businesses, and we are pleased with the team's continued progress. As part of their efforts, we continue to explore and test new and next product ideas. We plan to test a new personal care line, including safe care and hair care in the back half of this year, which Sarah mentioned. We're very excited to launch, test and learn on these growth opportunities, and our omni-channel model positions us well to do this. And finally, I'd like to touch on the reformulations that Sarah mentioned earlier. We have been diligently working on taking paraben, sulfate and dives out of our formulas and expect to be 35% complete by the end of the year. In closing, we continue to focus on maximizing our performance by leveraging the strength of our brands, maintaining close connections to our customers and delivering compelling products and experiences at a great value. Wendy, just two quick ones for you on the expense line. On the tech spend, so $25 million higher that you're pulling forward, $100 million total. And then on the other side of the cost, the CEO transition costs and retention, I think that is around $50 million, if I'm doing the math right. So on the technology spend, as you mentioned, we are pulling forward about $25 million into this year as we accelerate the work to get separated and move on to transformation. No, I was -- just sorry, a quick follow-up on the tech spend for next year. I think, Alex, I'll take the question and then I'll turn it over to Julie, maybe for some color or commentary. So in terms of pricing, pricing is something that we are continuously testing in this business. One of the advantages of our business is that we have a very robust testing program, a very consistent testing agenda. Every weekend, we're out in our stores, testing different pricing. We have ticket, and then we also have our sharp price points or multiple deals that we're running any given day. So we use that testing to look at both of those factors and at the end of the day, give our customer offers that they respond to, but also maximize our margin dollars at the same time. We've got AURs planned down slightly year-over-year in the second quarter, and we're really doing that to resonate with our consumer when the consumer is feeling a little pressure right now. I think that any time we invest in products, we're always looking at pricing. So as we're reformulating our formulas to be better for you, we will be taking those forms up $1 as they enter into our store. We launched our new scent control heaters, which have high, medium and low settings, and they performed well above expectations. Our customers have been asking for this feature, and we've really been working hard on delivering those in stores. I think what this shows, this product is a great example of our customer is smart and they understand the price value equation of our products and spending $12.50 for the scent control heater was didn't even deter them at all from buying it. So not only were the scent control heaters doing well, but our decorative heaters, which are also at times higher-priced heaters. So again, as long as we have the right price value equation, they're very smart, and they go along with us. So our -- as you mentioned, our profitability algorithm is low to mid-20s in terms of EBIT percentage. The first is, obviously, we want to continue to grow sales. And as we continue to grow sales, we should get leverage in the business and we'll experience that over time. As we've laid out in our sales growth algorithm, we see future growth in all components of our business. So in other words, none of those channels hurt us in terms of maintaining that overall profitability rate. The other thing that it's an important lever for us to pull as Julie just mentioned and I mentioned, we're always continuously looking at pricing. So as we said in our prepared remarks, at the end of Q2, our forecasted inventory levels are higher than they would normally be in any given second quarter. And the biggest thing to go that went behind that is we wanted to pull some production into the second quarter to make sure that we mitigated any risk of disruption and also to make sure that by having some of our core production pull forward, our supply chain will have more agility going into the holiday period for us to read, react and chase into winners. So when we see what the customer wants, we can chase into it and develop or chase into more winners. And just to add to that, Wendy, this read on react is a competitive advantage for us. So we were able, in this last quarter, to read and react and order about 10% of our total production on this four- to six-week chase time line. So Butterfly, as Sarah and I both talked about, was a great example of delivering early, reacting and getting back into many units across all categories. Really, it hit on the mindset that was transported and our customer in March was ready to be transported. So we are very adept at being flexible and fluid and getting in and out of what is and isn't working, and that's a winning formula for us. Wendy, if I'm not misreading it, and I might be, it looks like inventory dollars may have come in lower than guidance, but the units were in line. And then maybe the same question go forward, just how you're thinking about the -- for the rest of the year, I mean raw materials versus supply chain pressure on transportation. I think I got all that, Simeon, but you're probably going to have to repeat some of it. So in terms of inventory, if there wasn't any major call out, a lot of it was just -- it was components coming in a little bit favorable than what we expected because some of that's in transit. And at the end of the day, it was just a little bit better than forecast. In terms of inflation, transportation, that subject, we did mention that we are continuing to see pressure in inflation. As we look at around the $250 million of inflation, about just under half of it is raw materials. And I know we talked about this in the last call, but we continue to see pressure on all of our raw material inputs. And also internationally, you're seeing some growth there. First, we're going to go to Sarah and then Julie can add on. And as I said earlier, the health of our customers is very strong. An ability to bring our customer in at a much lower price point, but have them choose to fill up their basket with other items. So we haven't seen in a strong or a large diminution in the basket at all, just a slight variance. Again, 65% is made in Columbus, 85% is made in North America. So, as Julie will elaborate, that's what enabled us to chase through millions of units in a highly successful launch of Butterfly across 25 categories. So our customer is loyal, she trust us, and she's coming in repeatedly to see what's new in our stores. So just to give you a little bit context on unit sales, unit sales were up low single digits. And so just to give you a couple of color areas where we saw this, soap were up against last year. And we were in a much stronger inventory position than we were last year, and we believe the business is starting to stabilize and the customers coming to us. So, as Sarah mentioned, we believe that we are a used up business. We also have some great innovations in soap, and I think that they're responding to that as well. It helps her decorate her house, as well as we are seeing strong acceptance to our foaming core restage soap. And the other thing to mention, I know we talked about wall flowers, but unit sales are up there as well. So in AUR, so we're thinking for the full year, we'll have AURs about flat which would imply a slight increase in the fall season. And as you know, that's an area where we're extremely agile. But as of right now, we're planning the full year roughly flat. In terms of SG&A growth, we tend to -- obviously, our biggest -- about 2/3 of our SG&A is store selling, and so that will flex with sales. And so, I think the easiest way to model our SG&A expenses is really to look at it as a percent, as we grow sales, we will try and leverage that over time. I'm just wondering, as we look into the back half, if you look for the increases to moderate, if that's assumed in the guidance, we're getting mix leads, some reporting companies are saying, they're looking for freight to moderate in the back half and others are saying that it's not going to moderate at all. I'd also like to understand where we are in price increases in terms of what inning we're in, given the fact that while material costs continue to rise. So I'll take the first two parts of your question, and then we'll turn it over to Julie on the fragrance market. And as I mentioned, of our roughly $250 million of pressure that we've quantified, roughly 4% -- sorry, 40% of that is transportation. And the increases we're feeling are, in particular, in surcharges in our parcel network. If rates change over the course of the year, then those costs will either go up or down, but that is -- our current estimate is assuming the fact that exists today. So, I wouldn't say we're ever in a certain inning. That's something that, over time, we'll continue to test and expand pricing as appropriate. I mean one data point is that, if you compare our overall pricing now to pre-pandemic, our AURs are up over -- well, approximately 20% over that time period. So, this is something that we're continually looking at, and that will be part of this business' agenda forever as we continue to do business. Well, I follow a lot of companies in the beauty industry and the fragrance category had very strong growth during COVID, but has been sustaining that growth here in the post-COVID environment. We absolutely are seeing great new learnings and new old active spaces, which is very exciting. So when we have things like JCB, which we repackaged, which has been with us since 2006, it continues to be a top 10 fragrance. The great thing is we can have something like Butterfly, which is a new face space for us, which was a fruity floral also be in the top 10. We make sure that we're balancing by season, and we're also doing a big test in men. So there is a men's how high is high test, where we're testing 16 fragrances. We need to lean certain ways, Garmont, pumpkins in fall, but we're also opening up new spaces, which is very exciting, and it's very exciting that our customers coming along with us. Thank you, everyone, for your continuing interest in Bath & Body Works."
