The decrease in rate was predominantly driven by over 500 basis points of cost inflation, 140 basis points of technology and transition expenses associated with our separation from Victoria's Secret and 70 basis points of pressure from store wages, which was partially offset by leverage on sales growth and AUR increases. Our plan assumes a full year SG&A rate of approximately 26% with deleverage primarily driven by increased store wage rates, technology and -- technology, partially offset by the benefits of our cost optimization work. Our first priority is investing in the business to drive profitable growth by significantly improving the customer experience, supporting advancement in existing and new product categories, investing in new off-mall stores and remodel improving our fulfillment capabilities, completing our IT separation and standing of critical new technology capabilities.
