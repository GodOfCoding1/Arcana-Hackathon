    "content": " While the computer backup business remains the larger of our two cloud service offerings at the moment, our strategy and increasing investments center around capitalizing on the approximately $100 billion total 2025 market opportunity for B2 Cloud Storage based on projections from IDC and company analysis. We're continuing to cultivate our relationships with developers, which we define as customers that are using B2 cloud storage as the storage back end for their SaaS e-commerce or other business. Fiture's system integrator recommended a single solution, Backblaze B2 Reserve our capacity-based cloud storage solution, which includes free transaction calls, no delete penalties and free data migration. Year-over-year this reflects planned expenses from higher investments in both sales and marketing and R&D as we continue to increase investments to pursue the large market potential for B2 Cloud Storage, as well as increased G&A expenses chiefly related to public company cost. And the two examples that I highlighted for customers on -- in the prepared remarks, they chose Backblaze B2 for a number of reasons, including performance and compatibility with their offerings and the ability to access it from a cloud as opposed to having it be on-prem et cetera."
