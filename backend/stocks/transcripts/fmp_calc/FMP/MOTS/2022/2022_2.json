    "content": " One aspect of our commercial strategy, which I've referenced in the past, is the land and expand approach, or the targeting of hospitals within a health system following approval at the flagship center to use the Pure-Vu EVS. We've spent much of the past 2 years networking with, educating and training some of the top hospitals and physicians in the country, which we believe positions us well within many of their health systems to secure evaluations of the Pure-Vu EVS at network hospitals. And then two, because we updated our EVS system, with the removal of the reusable loading fixture that we talked about in the past, we're now able to use this device for rescue procedures that's enabling new procedures that we weren't getting in the past. That's a nice thing with making it a real world consecutive design as patients aren't successful with a standard of care, we can show the ability to convert that to a successful high quality exam with Pure-Vu, looking at not only avoiding that repeat procedure, but ideally getting secondary endpoints around detection rates and other things as well."
