    "content": " If we're being conservative, and women only get four boxes of Phexxi per year, each 1% market share equals $298 million in Phexxi sales. So when women get six boxes of Phexxi per year, each 1% market share equals $447 million in Phexxi net sales. The doctors who are writing Phexxi perhaps for breastfeeding women, or for cancer patients, or for women who just can't use hormones are now expanding their mind to say, \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou know what I need to broaden who I think the Phexxi woman is\u00e2\u0080\u009d And the biggest lever for that was this analysis we did that showed that on -- based on per active sex that 99% of the time Phexxi prevented pregnancy. Coupled with Saundra's continued relentless pursuit of them, I can't say I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d blame them, they're fortunate\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\n Well, and the one thing Yale just to add is that we have heard from a lot of these offices that we have consistently been talking to and reaching out that there is a huge push from certainly the Democratic side to make sure that they're leaning in and stepping up for women."
