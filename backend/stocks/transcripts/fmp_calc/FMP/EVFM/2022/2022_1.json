    "content": " I mean, look, one of the things that our new Chief Commercial Officer had said after being in the field is that there's nothing more frustrating when we go in and we talk to doctors, they say, yes, they are going to write Phexxi, they write it, and then the patient calls back an hour later and says they can't get it, because their plan won't cover it. Now, to really build on our base of Phexxi for contraception -- and the one thing Ram, I think that we've discussed this with you is that, no matter what contraception a woman's on, she is still at risk of getting chlamydia and gonorrhea. So one thing that we do know is that we would like to increase the size of our sales force, I wouldn't say dramatically, but I would tell you that on the high side 25, and on the low side 15, and we're doing an analysis to really make sure that we are going to be able to address all the appropriate targets. From additional resources, I also would say that, you know, I think Jay indicated a little bit and I want everybody listening to understand, it's not like we're going to go crazy, we don't think that we have money trees around here or won the lottery. I will tell you that when I've talked to, and we've already done diligence with doctors who do IVF, and they say the number one question they asked women when they're having challenges to get pregnant is, have they ever been treated for chlamydia, 60% of the time, it's asymptomatic."
