    "content": " I mean I think the idea of having a very quantified in near real time, meaning just you're getting information about the month that has just finished indication of the health of the consumer that you lend to and with different sort of slices and dices available for a lender is really powerful because it's not something a lender's done in the past. I think if you wanted to just look at kind of wallet share, which is a different sort of cut on things and you take out the captives, meaning the OEMs doing lending programs themselves outside of the captive, I think we have about in those 27 dealers, about 20% wallet share outside of the capital loans. But having said that, I think we feel happy that we're adding future capacity right now, and when the clouds part a little bit and there's a little more clarity, I think we'll have a much larger number of lenders on the platform that are ready to go, and perhaps, have been lending at a very small level for a while out of caution."
