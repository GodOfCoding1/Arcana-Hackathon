    "content": " Today, Sanjay and I will discuss a variety of topics, including credit performance, loan funding, lending partners sentiment, and some of the actions we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re taking right now to make sure Upstart\u00e2\u0080\u0099s future is bright. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m definitely not a macro forecaster, in Upstart does not try to hold within it skills, kind of a crystal ball about the next phases in the economy, what I was trying to state though, is that we try to build in what you would think of as some form of market consensus, where the market thinks the economy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to go with a degree of conservatism sufficient for, banks and investors and credit unions, et cetera, to feel comfortable in the platform. And then part of this goes back to your question on balance sheet in some sense that the markets would like a signal of confidence in the way that the loans are currently being priced and in the macro assumptions that they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve talked about and, using our balance sheet to some extent as a signal, I think can provide a lot of comfort to the funding market. Having said that, we came to the conclusion that having sort of a litmus test that thou shalt  not use the balance sheet at all, doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t make sense, particularly when you see reaction to the supply side of our business happen in ways that almost a contrary to facts to us, meaning credits generally performing well. We don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t intend to become a large balance sheet lender, but at the same time we think it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s important to stay to the community out there that we we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to do the right things for the business."
