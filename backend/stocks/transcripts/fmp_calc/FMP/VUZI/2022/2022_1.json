Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to the Vuzix' first quarter of 2022 ending March 31 financial results and business update conference call. Our first quarter total revenues for the 3 months ended March 31, 2022, decreased 36% over the prior year's period to $2.5 million. The decrease was primarily the result of reduction in smart glasses sales versus Q1 of 2021, a quarter, which was our strongest first quarter to date from selling smart glasses and a period, which is typically the slowest quarter revenue-wise of our fiscal year. Sales and marketing expense for the 3 months ended March 31, 2022, was $2 million as compared to $1.3 million in the 2021 period, a 55% increase over the prior year period, due primarily to increases in salary expenses from new hires and a $0.3 million increase in trade show expenses, which rose as a result of our return to attending trade show events in person post the broad COVID lockdowns of 2021. General and administrative expenses for the 3 months ended March 31, 2022, was $5.5 million as compared to $6 million for the 2021 period, a decrease of 10% versus $6 million in the prior year's period. Cash used in operations, after adding back noncash operating expenses, which primarily consists of stock compensation expenses, but excluding changes in our working capital, totaled $5.7 million for the first quarter of 2022 as compared to $3.8 million in the 2021 period. During our first quarter of 2022, the company repurchased 36,685 shares of our common stock at an average cost of $6.84 under the $25 million common stock repurchase plan approved by our Board of Directors on March 2 of this year."
