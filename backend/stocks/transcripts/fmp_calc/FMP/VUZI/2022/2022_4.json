    "content": " Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Vuzix's fourth quarter and 2022 full year ending December 31 financial results and business update conference call. We are seeing increased deployments in warehousing and logistics, expanding health care from existing ISVs and multiple new customers, further engagements with blue-chip customers early in their deployment cycles, further expansion of our sales channel in specific regions, increased SaaS revenue from our Moviynt acquisition, additional and larger engagements from defense firms, paths to production for multiple U.S. defense firms, signing of new agreements by OEM and white label firms, development of contracts and initial deployments of ultralight based products and more. The current geopolitical environment also bolsters the need for U.S.-based suppliers such as Vuzix to offer solutions for outfitting U.S. defense forces along with their humvees and aircraft with heads-up display, optics and waveguide technology that are made in the U.S.A. We believe our OEM offerings will help Vuzix foster business relationships with key defense contractors that will continue to yield follow-on and new OEM programs over the course of 2023 and beyond. Strategically, we believe that Moviynt's underlying technology and architecture can be packaged into APIs that could be used by Vuzix ISVs and the likes to enhance their current software offerings and help expand existing markets and open up new markets for smart glasses across warehousing and logistics. For the year ended December 31, 2022, Vuzix reported $11.8 million in total revenues as compared to $13.2 million for the prior year, a decrease of 10% year-over-year. For the 3 months ended December 31, 2022, Vuzix reported $2.9 million in total revenues versus $3.3 million in the prior year's fourth quarter."
