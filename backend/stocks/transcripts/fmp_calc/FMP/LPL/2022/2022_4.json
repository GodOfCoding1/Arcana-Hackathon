    "content": " The company plans to keep reducing cost and improving operational efficiency through LCD TV capacity downsizing in China, intense production adjustment in large OLED fabs in Korea, and close monitoring of real demand changes and market inventory. The company expects about KRW1 trillion cost reduction in Q1 from the large scale business rationalization underway from Q4 such as active inventory control, LCD TV downsizing and OLED TV production adjustments. With soft demand for premium TVs last year due to economic slowdown as well as the downward revision of demand outlook, asset impairment of approximately KRW1.3 trillion was recognized for OLED business to ensure proper accounting. And now about the CapEx, I did explain about the principles earlier in the briefing and that is that for last year and this year we will be maintaining the minimum ordinary investment, so as to that will be necessary to maintain the production facilities and also maintain the investment for the order-based businesses for which demand and revenue are pretty much fixed. And also given that it is not clear when there is going to be recovery in the demand, we will keep closely monitoring the market and try to continue to differentiate OLED in the high-end TV market, so that we will be able to increase our market share from the current high 20% level to over 30%."
