    "content": " But I also think we have to focus on the long term and make sure that what we're doing for our customers, our homeowners and our service professionals is something that's going to keep them around working with us for a very long time. I think there's kind of a view out there that digitally native brands, Amazon, everyone, they're kind of taking share just through organic direct traffic rather than consumers utilizing intermediary sites. And as those intermediaries are adding value, and that's validated by the behavior we're seeing on the people who want the end result of that traffic, meaning the folks who are paying for our ecommerce traffic or performance marketing traffic and increasingly eager to engage with that audience, as we're helping them make decisions and divine  intent. I think, Dan, that speaks to Joey's comment about the need to focus more beyond services where there are attractive market opportunities available to Angi in ads and leads, and that can be driven through real focus and prioritization, given what we see in the broader market."
