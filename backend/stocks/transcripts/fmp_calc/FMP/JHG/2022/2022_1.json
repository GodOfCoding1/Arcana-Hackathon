    "content": " Excluding Intech, net outflows are disappointing at $6.2 billion, driven primarily by outflows in equities and the institutional redemption in the balanced strategy that we communicated to you all in the last quarter's earnings call. In looking at the first quarter highlights in the US intermediary channel, the SMA channel had $800 million of net inflows coming primarily from the concentrated growth strategy. The adjusted comp to revenue ratio was 42.5%, which is in line with the guidance we've given and less than the 44.2% ratio in the first quarter of last year. So, the buyback at $200 million that we've announced \u2013 $200 million that we've announced today, it's pretty consistent with what we've done over the prior year, just a little bit more last year. And as I say, again, just looking at what we see now in terms of performance fees, again, if we cut them today, the positive performance fees from our segregated accounts, from our SICAVs which were very strong in Q2 last year, from our absolute term funds, from our OEICS would not fully offset that $60 million."
