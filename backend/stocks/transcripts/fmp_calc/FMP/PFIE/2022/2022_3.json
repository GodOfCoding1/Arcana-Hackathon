    "content": " This call contains forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, statements regarding the company's expected growth and strengthening of the legacy business, increased inventory purchasing and planned launch of new products, the focus of reduction of emissions, the continued collaboration with customers, anticipated well completions, the availability of company resources to make beneficial investments in 2023 and beyond and the company's future financial performance. In the third quarter, we continued to see increased demand for our products and solutions, enabled by our strong market share and our customers' ability to focus capital on drilling and completing programs, retrofits and upgrades, our legacy business experienced one of our strongest quarters in company history. So it's a bit of a different dynamic than what we've had historically for our business, but what we're hearing from the suppliers where things are challenged right now, which is more of those system components, the Microchips, microprocessors, electronics, that type of stuff."
