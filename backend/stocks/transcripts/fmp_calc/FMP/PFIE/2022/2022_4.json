    "content": "   Operator: Good morning, everyone, and thank you for participating in today's conference call to discuss Profire Energy's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2022 Operating and Financial Performance for the Period Ended December 31, 2022. This call contains forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, statements regarding the company's expected growth, increase in operating expenses, revenue diversification success, the planned research and development of new products, growth in our customer base in the natural gas market, the availability of the company's resources to make the beneficial investments in 2023 and beyond, and the company's future financial performance. Our diversification strategy, which accounted for 6% of revenue in 2022 compared to less than 1% in the previous year, should also continue to gain further acceptance across non-oil and gas markets. The sequential and year-over-year increases are primarily due to the increased global consumption of oil and gas, ongoing historically high energy prices and strong growth across our diversification efforts."
