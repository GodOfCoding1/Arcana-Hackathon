    "content": " We believe that we are at the beginning of a ramp that over coming quarters will lead back to Auto Insurance client spending levels seen prior to the inflation challenges of the past couple of years and then, to further strong growth from there, as the share of marketing budgets and consumer shopping, represented by digital media, continues its relentless march up into the right. The significant positive inflection we are seeing in insurance combined with the continued strength of non-insurance client verticals is expected, to drive strong total company revenue growth and rapid expansion of both adjusted EBITDA and cash flow in the March quarter. Please state your question. Please state your question. Please state your question. Please state your question. Please state your question.
