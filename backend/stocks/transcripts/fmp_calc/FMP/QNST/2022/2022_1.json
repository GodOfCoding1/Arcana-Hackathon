    "content": " The raise is driven by one, specific indications from auto insurance clients of budget increases in the January to June period, two, stronger than expected momentum in our credit driven client verticals, and three, the acceleration of growth initiatives across the business, including QRP. And so we do know from our clients that we have been cut the least, and we have been told by all of them, and we know for a bunch of them just from the numbers that we have gained share as well, we have been cut some and you can see it in the guide that we expect to lose somewhere in the neighborhood of $10 million next quarter in revenue from the impact of auto insurance client budgets, relative to where we might be in a normal 10% down scenario. So we're generally conservative anyway, but we were very conservative for QRP because again, a new business still in the early stages, I would say that while we have pretty substantially increased our expectations for QRP in a revised outlook, it is still at the low end of the range that we actually think we're going to hit. We are aggressively expanding in life health and some of the \u2013 even smaller ones like pet motorcycle RV, and home insurance \u2013 home services, excuse me, you've heard me say before we're in four or five of our verticals are kind of at pretty good scale, we're in another call."
