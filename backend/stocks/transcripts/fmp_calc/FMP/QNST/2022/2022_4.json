    "content": " We expect a positive inflection in auto insurance marketing budgets and revenue in January as one, carrier combined ratios reset for the new calendar year; and two, consumer shopping for insurance increases in reaction to the higher rates. We expect business dynamics and results for fiscal Q1, the current quarter ending in September, to be similar to what we saw in the June quarter with a little added conservatism in auto insurance as carriers enter the heavy weather season and with a little lower EBITDA mainly reflecting that auto insurance conservatism, but also the impact of routine annual increases in employee compensation coincident with the beginning of the new fiscal year. That's why we refer to February and March rather than the first -- last quarter because the quarter was a little bit skewed by kind of a monster January so typically -- and that is consistent with what we typically see a big step function increase in January as combined ratios for the new year reset and there's kind of greenfield opportunity, new budgets, a whole new world to go after. Second of all, the new housing market has slowed because of increased mortgage rates, which usually means consumers choose to invest in their current home than buying a new home, and so when you combine those factors with the fact that their home improvement verticals we're in, are largely not purely discretionary and the fact that home improvement by definition is leveraged to homeowners, who are prime consumers and prime consumers are in some of the best shape they have been in financially for 20 years according to all the commercial banks. And then just my second question here, just going back to the guide here with the declining revenue in the first quarter guidance, but in the full year to go -- plan to go flat, I was just wondering if you could kind of talk about your conviction in that early calendar year '23 rebound, and then just tied to that, it seems that this is now like the second or third time that carriers have had to reprice policies in an effort to improve the combined ratio, so I'm just wondering what you might be hearing from them that may lead you to believe that they're going to get it right this time? This is not our first auto insurance rodeo and we -- nor is it for our clients and everybody knows that combined ratios are going to reset in January and that rates are going to be higher and then historically we all know that's meant -- I meant bigger marketing budgets, aggressive consumer shopping, and therefore super cycle, which has led to outsized growth rates every time this happens. The carriers that went first and most aggressively for the rate increases for the most part, and gotten those rate increases through, there have been some state hold-outs, particularly in the Northeast where some of the states have not allowed as bigger rate increases as the carriers feel like they need given the environment, but in general terms, I think that at the end of the day, historically, sometimes when states hold out they eventually give in, because they have to have -- their citizens have to have auto insurance and if they don't allow carriers to price the auto insurance in a way that allows them to make money and the auto insurance just won't ride in those states and you have a whole another problem. And I was a couple of minutes late getting on the call because there were 3 events today, and so if -- I apologize, if you talked about this that the auto chip shortage seems to have thrown a wrench into a lot of things and it would seem like it's probably changed the mix of new cars versus used cars and it seems like we're still waiting for that to work itself out. I do know that what we've been told by clients and what clients has stated publicly, including in some written releases over the past month or so is that used car pricing has been a big -- has had a big negative impact on the economics, and so -- because a lot of these policies, I guess, have these replacement causes and then when they go to replace a vehicle with a similar vehicle, that similar vehicle cost 20%, 30% or 40% more than it did before and that has been called out specifically by some of the public carriers as one of the primary drivers of the combined ratio issues that they're having. I would say, our enthusiasm has not diminished at all for that project that product in this long-term opportunity and we would expect it and we are making -- still making good progress, just not as rapid progress as we were before given what's going on in insurance and we still would expect as insurance comes back that pipeline and progress will accelerate once again and we think again that's one of the biggest new opportunities both in terms of impact on our clients in the channel as well as impact on us that we've ever worked on."
