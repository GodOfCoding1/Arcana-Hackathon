    "content": " Although gross profit of 77.3% in the quarter was a sequential improvement, it drove an EBITDA margin headwind versus prior year of approximately 200 basis points, primarily driven by increased input costs in our supply chain related to raw materials and manufacturing overhead as well as shipping costs. In the second quarter, we saw an increase in professional fees spending versus prior year, primarily related to the digital initiative Herbalife One, noted earlier, which accounted for approximately 40 basis points of EBITDA margin pressure. In other words, people who typically would have gone after a weight -- what we would traditionally call a weight management product, a high-protein, low-calorie product, for example, are increasingly going to sports nutrition solutions as an alternative there, whether it's a part of their fitness environment or their lifestyle, they're looking for products that are designated as sports nutrition products, the line is blurring between the 2 categories."
