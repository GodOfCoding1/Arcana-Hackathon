    "content": " So that's also some of what we're seeing and what makes us believe that when you think of this as a layered business, right, the cohorts think of them as layers, right, the foundation being strong and some of the layers above it, collectively not being as strong, we think that in-person events can reengage some of the cohort that came in through the pandemic, but also we have to bring in new layers, and that's the key. So if we just assume that the channel and our distributors and the business markets behave the same way that we're currently seeing because of the comps, the first half of this year comping over what was still a lot of demand in the first half of 2021 versus how it compares against the second half of 2021 with the same run rate that we're seeing over the past two months, you will see back half -- you'll see it flat in the back half from a net sales perspective, and that should imply some growth in the fourth quarter. And it's not just limited to the U.S., but it's really seen in the markets that had the most growth during the pandemic, which is why you're seeing the most impact in the U.S. because it had 50%, 60% growth for a few quarters from the pandemic, and now we're giving some of that back because the group that came in at that time are the ones that are underperforming."
