    "content": "  Operator: Good afternoon, and thank you for joining the Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call for Herbalife Nutrition Limited. On the call today is Michael O. Johnson, the company's Chairman and Interim CEO; Alex Amezquita, the company's Chief Financial Officer; and Eric Monroe, the company's Senior Director, Investor Relations. On today's call, we will be making some forward-looking statements. These GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations can be found in the earnings press release and the slides that we will be reviewing on today's call, both of which can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website. I will now turn the call over to Chairman and Interim CEO, Michael Johnson. Thanks, Eric, and good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us on the call today. As interim CEO, my focus will be in two key areas: first, to rebuild sales momentum at Herbalife Nutrition; and second, succession management. Since I left the CEO role in 2020, the progress we have made broadening our product portfolio, investing in our technology platform and embarking on the transformation of our operational capabilities is truly remarkable. At the same time, we've had to navigate an unprecedented time in the world as global economies are impacted by the onset, persistence and aftermath of a global pandemic. However, over Herbalife Nutrition's 42-year history, in my nearly 20 years of the company, we have overcome many similar challenges, including recessions and periods of economic uncertainty. As you know, I am extremely familiar and respectful of our incredibly capable leadership team that we have overseen in our strategies. I have been working closely for over a decade with our CFO, Alex Amezquita, Chief Operating Officer, Mark Schissel, and of course, my good friend and Executive Vice Chairman, John DeSimone, among others, in this great management team. Let me turn the call over to Alex, who will give you details of our quarter. First, third quarter volume points of $1.6 billion were down 10.7% compared to the prior year, which was above just the midpoint of our Q3 guidance range. However, the significant strengthening of the U.S. dollar during the quarter as well as the geographic mix of revenue resulted in net sales down 9.5%, which was below our expectations. Second, despite the net sales shortfall, focused expense management efforts in the quarter contributed to adjusted EBITDA above our Q3 guidance range and adjusted EPS near the high end of our range. Third, we experienced a softening of sales through a result of the current economic backdrop as well as the significant off-cycle pricing actions that took place in June for many markets around the world. Fourth, significant strength in India buoyed a global softening of key metrics for active sales leaders and new member counts. Fifth, while we focus on protecting the bottom line in the near term, we continue to invest for our future growth, including our Herbalife One platform we referenced last quarter. And sixth, while we anticipate trends that emerged in the third quarter to persist into the fourth quarter, we are not able to forecast in an environment with such rapidly shifting consumer behaviors and volatility in the world at large. As such, the company is withdrawing fiscal year '22 guidance. Despite hitting our volume projections, the strengthening of the U.S. dollar during the quarter drove a 600 basis points currency headwind to net sales compared to prior year. Reported net income of $82 million resulted in adjusted EBITDA of approximately $183 million, which was above the high end of our guidance range. Adjusted EBITDA margin in the quarter was 14.1%, exceeding expectations. Reported EPS of $0.83 resulted in adjusted earnings per diluted share of $0.91, which was near the high end of our EPS guidance range. During the third quarter, as previously communicated, the company strategically reduced $50 million of our outstanding debt. We ended the quarter at 3.5x gross debt to EBITDA, which was above our target leverage ratio of 3.0x. Drilling into net sales, where we benefited from 10.3 percentage points of pricing from the combination of our CPI-linked price increases we implemented primarily in the first quarter as well as the 10% global price increase most markets implemented in June. Moving to margins, where adjusted EBITDA of $183 million resulted in an adjusted EBITDA margin of 14.1%, which outperformed our margin expectations for the quarter. EBITDA benefited 270 basis points from the significant price increases we've taken this year, while geographic mix of revenue and other was a headwind of 50 basis points, largely due to the continued strength in India. Although gross profit of 78.0% in the quarter was a sequential improvement, it drove an EBITDA margin headwind versus prior year of approximately 200 basis points, primarily driven by increased input costs in our supply chain. Within SG&A, we experienced an approximate 120 basis point headwind related to promotional spend. Recall, in 2021, our distributor promotions were significantly disrupted because of the pandemic. During the third quarter, we benefited by approximately 40 basis points of EBITDA margin expansion due to the efficiencies and targeted strategic improvements, leading to favorable margin impact even after absorbing the impact of annual merit increases. As mentioned earlier, currency had a significant impact and led to an additional 80 basis points of headwind on EBITDA margins. For the quarter, average active sales leaders of approximately 482,000 was 5% under last year and slightly improved from Q2. Excluding India, active sales leaders declined 2% versus the second quarter. While the Q3 metrics slightly improved as a whole compared to the second quarter trends, excluding India, new distributor and preferred customers joining the business declined single digits sequentially compared to the second quarter of '22. For example, in both Mexico and Korea, we have implemented promotions around new distributor sign-up kits. And while early, we observed positive results and observed a month-to-date sequential increase in October over September, up 91% and 21% in Mexico and Korea, respectively. The Asia Pacific region had another quarter of growth, up approximately 10% compared to the prior year. The region was led by continued strength in India, which grew 37%, and Vietnam, which was up 30%. As one of our more price-sensitive regions, we will continue to monitor the impact that price increases have had on APAC volume from an elasticity perspective. The EMEA region saw a 9% decline in local currency net sales, which was materially amplified by 14 points of currency pressure in the quarter, resulting in reported net sales of down 23%. And as I mentioned earlier, during the third quarter, we strategically reduced our debt by approximately $50 million as we remain prudent with cash, given the difficult macroeconomic backdrop. Given the persistence of this difficult macroeconomic landscape, the company plans to reduce debt by an additional $50 million in the fourth quarter, reallocating funds that were previously earmarked for share buybacks to reduce our debt. While our cash generation ability remains strong, year-to-date, for 2022, we have generated approximately $299 million of operating cash flow. As Michael started out on the call by saying, over our 42-year history, we have overcome numerous macroeconomic challenges. And while we are not satisfied with this quarter's results, we do remain confident that the resilience of our business and the strategic actions we are taking will help us significantly emerge from the current macroeconomic environment. Your line is open. Obviously, any time there's a change at the top, it can be a little bit disruptive to culture. We have spent all morning on the phone with our leadership in the field, our management team and our employees. And I'm trying not to - I got to be careful talking about my own receptivity in here because it sounds a little egocentric, but the reception has been extremely warm. I've maintained a relationship with management here because we are friends, too. After 20 years working in a company, you don't just build professional relationships, you build personal relationships. Bringing my professional relationship back inside this time allows me to expand on the personal relationships I have and create, hopefully, an energy and a motivation that will lift the top line sales of this company to where we want them, to serve all of our stakeholders, our customers, our employees and especially our shareholders so they can benefit from the hard work of the team in the field. So while it usually is disruptive, I think this has actually a little different pace to it, a little different feel. I mean, I get the macro is tough and there's the lockdown in China, conflict in Ukraine, inflation pressures, you name it, but these aren't new issues per se. Yes, so it's a good question. So while a lot of the headlines aren't necessarily new, we've been dealing with the pandemic, the fallout of the pandemic, the issues around the supply chain, all of those are largely new. As you know, largely, we've been focused on active sales leaders and the introduction of new distributors and preferred customers as key KPIs throughout the year. And so what appears, and again, this is just Herbalife Nutrition data, I'm not suggesting this is broadly, but perhaps is that these macroeconomic conditions, or I should say, the change is impacting consumer behavior beyond the ability for us to forecast. Again, we're seeing productivity down, which suggests a reduction in buying behavior, whether that's a swapping out for other goods, whether that's just simply supply - saving dollars for energy purchases and other critical nondiscretionary purchases is unclear at this moment as we're looking through the data. But clearly, there has been a shift through the quarter and our inability to really forecast these shifts just leads to our inability to forecast how Herbalife Nutrition is going to behave in that environment. Just in terms of the campaign to bring in new distributors, I was wondering if you could just maybe offer some specifics there in terms of what that entails. So clearly, with inflation and just how the world has been reacting to really unprecedented levels of pricing even in mature economies like the U.S. and Europe, where we're seeing high single digits, you're having actually real inflationary costs of maybe double digits. So for example, figuring out ways for new member kits to be either a 3-for-2, not passing along price increases on a very select part of the portfolio to encourage demand in a part of the market where we want to encourage growth. Please stand by for our next question. Your line is open. I guess permanent is an open-ended word anymore, but I'm the permanent Chairman of the company, been voted by the Board to take the role of Chairman. So we, as a Board, are looking for someone who has got heart and wants a brain connected to it in order to drive this opportunity, both fundamentally with the numbers, have a keen sense of margin in their perspective, but also someone who's volume aware, who knows how to harness and frankly, let loose, I guess harness is the wrong word, let loose distributor innovation, distributor entrepreneurialism in the field, cut through some of the red tape that companies gather over the years. Someone who has a passion for nutrition, somebody who has a passion for product, somebody who has a passion for our distributors and help them build their businesses every day and someone who wants to build an employee environment that is spectacular. And bringing that passion in, making people feel very good about working in a place that brings a special opportunity to people in terms of an economic opportunity as well as a nutritional opportunity is someone that is going to be unique. Now obviously, we have to get the right strategic initiatives in place. So currently, these current macroeconomic challenges are still faced with things like a tight labor market, are still faced with a pricing transition that's affecting consumer sentiment. Those are all significant headwinds, obviously, to almost any business. Historically, our distributors have had the mantra or have had the motivation to get out there and help people find an extra income opportunity at times when they were looking for. So the motivation, our model being a push model where distributors get out there and have certain motivations at time to create that extra sale. Recessionary times, people looking for extra income, those types of - that type of environment actually could benefit us. There's a lot transitioning in the moment, and it's hard to - that's why we withdrew guidance. But I just want you to simply take away, recessionary times do not necessarily mean that there isn't an opportunity for us to grow. We could potentially grow in those environments, provided we get the right strategies and we get the right motivations out there in the field. And then I just wanted to circle back to India for a moment, if we could. So one of the great things about what we do as a company, when we find things that are working in one place, we really do a deep dive to understand those things and try and get that best practice or whatever that activity might be going on in other regions. And particularly, there's some strategy around the preferred customer models, which are fairly uniquely one of the many things that are going right in India. Now while we are doing those things, it is probably important to note, India more or less is a self-contained economy. And while we can look at those best practices and try and replicate those in other places, it really is a combination of things that are happening in India. And it's also the fact that right now, that economy, more or less being closed, still has a lot of the backdrop for continued success that is pretty unique and not really being experienced anywhere else in the world right now. So again, while we definitely are going to look towards those specific strategies, it really is a combination of things happening in India that is really promoting the continued outperformance there. Please stand by for our next question. Your line is open. Good afternoon, last quarter and the quarters before, we talked about there was the pandemic cohort who was not engaging, your longer-term distributors were still putting up good metrics. We're not seeing a material difference from them at this point and the productivity comments that we've made and just generally the trends of pre-pandemic, pandemic, and I'm not quite sure if you say post-pandemic quite yet, but really all cohorts are trending in line. And then if we look at the kind of the macro headwinds that you're talking about, the tight labor market, the pricing transition, those are certainly things that are going to be with us probably in a non-transitionary way for the next couple of quarters, at least. Yes, so clearly, some of the promotional activity that we were talking about on new member growth is going to be a big focus for us. The strategies that go beyond those key metrics, we're actually meeting with key leadership next week to continue to drive and understand what we, the company, can do with distributor leadership around the world in specific strategies to address that. I think we're all focused on really understanding the sort of the landscape that we're in, and we're really going to think about what are the strategies we could do to help Herbalife Nutrition to be successful in that. Yes, so yes, so likely it will be same what we did in the third quarter, paying down the revolver with that $50 million. But to answer your question, the $50 million will likely be against the revolver this quarter. Please stand by for our next question. Your line is open. Michael, I know you've been sort of through starts and stops with this company over time. Tomorrow, I get on a plane with all the executives here and we're heading to Cairo, Egypt, our Founder's Circle and Chairman's Club, 60, 70 distributorships. They're -- as I said earlier in the call, I've created lot of friendships in that group. And I'm not going to say I'm going to trade on the friendships, but I'm going to trade on other business instincts. And I think we can get growth back, hopefully, sometime next year. And I'm going to play on that like we played on it for 20 years because it's real, and you see it impact and change people's lives. So to get growth back, that's my number one goal in here. And if we don't get the growth back, you won't see me on this call. And I feel it from the distributors, I feel it from the team, and we are highly, highly motivated to move forward, so no timing, but a heck of a lot of energy and a heck a lot of desire and a great team to pull it off. My second question was I mean, if I'm just sort of listening between the lines here, it sounds like some of the pricing that you took over the summer, combined with the macro environment, has sort of driven those productivity declines to sort of getting worse month, month-to-month through the third quarter. Now what's challenging is those results, whether it's due to the pricing increase, whether it's due to the macroeconomic conditions, the results are the same. Further, I think as you go region-by-region and market-and-market, that's going to vary. It's probably different in Asia Pacific, so on and so forth. But to sort of quantify the specific amount of demand elasticity that we've seen in the third quarter, we don't have the data to really suggest with any precision. It's really something that we show up every day, helping people get healthier and provide the opportunity to earn a little more money. My brother sent me a little saying that was in a framed - in a frame and it said, \"The first wealth is health\", and this company creates that opportunity. Now today, we have opportunities and challenges that are never - like never before, but this is an incredibly resilient business, and we're working closely and we'll continue to work closely, as we mentioned, in Cairo with our distributors to make sure that we improve our trends and deliver a better return. We've got a great company here in a world-class leverageable distribution channel, supported by global megatrends that will provide a catalyst for growth for years to come. So thanks very much, and as I always say to the team, let's go Herbalife. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call."
