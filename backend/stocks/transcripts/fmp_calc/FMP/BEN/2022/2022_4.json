    "content": " Adjusted revenues decreased by 4% to $1.53 billion, and investment management fees, excluding performance fees, declined 5% from the prior quarter, both primarily due to lower average AUM, which decreased 5% from the prior quarter. Adjusted revenues of $6.5 billion increased by 2% from the prior year benefiting from six months of Lexington and increased performance fees, offset by lower average AUM, which declined 2%. Adjusted operating expenses were $4.2 billion, an increase of 5% from the prior year including the impact of our acquisitions and increased performance fee compensation, partially offset by expense savings. Compared to the prior year, fiscal year adjusted net income declined 3% to $1.9 billion, adjusted diluted earnings per share was $3.63, also a 3% decline. From a capital management perspective, we were able to close the acquisitions of both Lexington Partners and O'Shaughnessy Asset Management, make several minority investments and returned $773 million to shareholders in dividends and share repurchases and ended the year with $6.8 billion of cash and investments of approximately level with the year earlier. Your line is now open, please go ahead. And it also simplifies our company operations by doing -- by operating this way by having this discipline, not just as the market deteriorated, but frankly, over the last three years, it's enabled us to continue to invest in wealth tech alternatives, SMA customization, distribution, all the things that we spend quite a lot of time talking about. Your line is now open, please go ahead."
