    "content": " Adjusted EBITDA on a consolidated basis was $3.8 million compared to a loss of $5 million in the prior year's quarter, an $8.8 million improvement. And as I mentioned in my opening remarks, we reported positive operating income of $2.5 million versus a loss of $4.9 million in Q1 of fiscal 2022 representing again the first quarter of positive operating income in 16 quarters. On the top line, while total first quarter revenues of $62 million declined $15 million from the prior year, as expected due to our transition to a fully franchised business model, core revenue improved by nearly $1 million due to higher average royalty rates. On an adjusted basis, first quarter consolidated adjusted EBITDA was $4 million compared to a loss of $5 million in the prior year's quarter."
