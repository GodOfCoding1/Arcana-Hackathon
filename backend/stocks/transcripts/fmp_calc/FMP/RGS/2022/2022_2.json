    "content": " Our systemwide revenue, which includes total sales at franchise and company owned salons, increased $43 million from prior year, driven by an improvement in comparable same store sales of 22%. I also want to be clear, this isn't a model that calls for any major shifts or additional change, but rather what EBITDA looks like assuming the exact platform and infrastructure we have in place today, assuming we at least maintain our current store count, get back to 2019 sales levels, as this is a pre-COVID sales level that we've demonstrated being able to achieve, and assuming we complete the rollout of Opensalon PRO. Taking our current franchise salon count to 5,553, if these salons get back to within 10% of 2019 levels, resulting royalties are $76 million. This is a great tool that is intended to provide data for us to analyze each of our brands and drive marketing strategies, enable our franchisees to run their salons in a more streamlined way with real time access to their business on the go, allow stylists to focus on what they do best which is hair, and provide a differentiator to our customers, making it easy for them to book and pay. The combination of our fiscal 2021 initiatives and getting back to 2019 sales levels has a potential to drive a $38 million EBITDA business at the midpoint of the range provided, with incremental sales and net salon growth adding potential upside. And as I said, now that it's actually been working for the last several months in franchisee businesses, there has been feedback of things that we could be doing better to ensure this meets their operational needs, it is meeting exactly what it is they're expecting, things from back office tools and for greater integration there, things as it relates to checking in and the nuances between appointments and queue times."
