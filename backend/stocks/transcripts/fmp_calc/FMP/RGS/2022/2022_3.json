    "content": " For reference, these businesses impacted our adjusted EBITDA by contributing a loss of $4 million during the quarter and a loss of $13 million year-to-date. Total revenues of $65 million declined to $36 million from the prior year as expected due to the 98% of our salons now franchised compared to 87% in the prior year, and the transition away from our product distribution business. On a year-to-date basis, adjusted EBITDA loss of $4 million is an improvement of $52 million, from a loss of $56 million in the fiscal 2021, nine-month period. Our core franchise business achieved adjusted EBITDA of $3 million, a $10 million improvement compared to a loss of $7 million in the prior year. The company-owned segment recorded an adjusted EBITDA loss of approximately $3 million, including a charge to increase the inventory reserve by approximately $1 million, which is a $10 million improvement in adjusted EBITDA for the same period last year. We reported an operating loss of $25 million during the quarter, which includes two non-cash impairment charges related to goodwill and inventory totaling to $23 million. Excluding these non-cash impairment charges our reported operating loss was $2 million, a $17 million improvement when compared to an operating loss of $19 million in the prior year. In the third quarter we used $10 million of cash from operations, which is a $2 million improvement compared to our cash use in the second quarter, and a $4 million improvements from Q3 of 2021. Adjusting both, the second and third fiscal quarters for one-time cash outflows in each quarter, our cash use in operations was approximately $7 million in each quarter."
