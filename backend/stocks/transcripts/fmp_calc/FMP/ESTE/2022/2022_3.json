    "content": " Our adjusted net income per share was $1.30 and adjusted EBITDAX was $346 million, which was 15% higher quarter-over-quarter. From a production standpoint, we are pleased to surpass the high end of our third quarter guidance range by approximately 5% with company record production of 94,329 barrels of oil equivalent per day, which was comprised of 41% oil, 32% natural gas and 27% natural gas liquids. Given the recent strong results from our drilling program, we are raising our fourth quarter guidance by about 2% with production expected to range from 98,000 to 102,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Yes, as we pay down more debt, if there's nothing on the acquisition front, I think probably we'll pay down some of the term-loan, but we like having that dry powder available right now, we're pretty close to being half paid down on the total $1.2 billion of commitments."
