    "content": " DARZALEX continues to redefine the treatment of multiple myeloma with strong sales for the first half of the year as we reported $3,842 million in net sales by J&J, an increase of 37% over the first half of 2021, resulting in DKK 4,024 million in royalties to Genmab. Today, we have five, and that provides us with expected recurring revenue growth of 53% in 2022, and there's a clear path to potentially expand the number of approved products with Janssen's BLA and MAA for teclistamab, and most excitingly, our planned submissions for epco later this year."
