    "content": " Retention remained very strong at 71% during the first quarter even as we grew our renewal rates, which makes us confident that we can continue to capture both the market rent growth that has already occurred, and which will work its way into our rent roll as activity picks up into the spring, as well as the additional market rent growth that will occur over the course of the year. Average effective monthly rent per home for the quarter increased 3.1% compared to the prior-year period, which also represents a substantial improvement compared to the 50-basis point year-over-year growth achieved in the fourth quarter. Over the coming year, we are focused on growing and geographically expanding our portfolio, capturing significant market rent growth as our portfolio turns, executing value-add renovations, launching our new resident-focused brand and culture, and weaving ESG into every aspect of our business as we execute our internal infrastructure transformation ahead of internalizing property-level operations."
