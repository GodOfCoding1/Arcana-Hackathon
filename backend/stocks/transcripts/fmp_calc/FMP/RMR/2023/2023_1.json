    "content": " For the first quarter of fiscal 2023, we reported adjusted net income of $8.7 million or $0.51 per share, and adjusted EBITDA of $26.4 million, with both financial measures being in line with our quarterly guidance. Which, by the way, conversely presents opportunities at the same time because when the marketplace is so negative and sort of assumes the worst, as we get further along into 2023 and into 2024, especially as there's so much debt that comes due in the industry around office buildings, it does present an interesting opportunity, not just for ourselves, but others in the marketplace that might take a slightly contrarian view for certain office properties, very specifically."
