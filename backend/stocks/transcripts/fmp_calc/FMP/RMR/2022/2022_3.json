    "content": " We are pleased to report another strong quarter of financial results with adjusted net income of $0.59 per share and adjusted EBITDA of $29.4 million.representing sequential quarter increases of 18% and 14%, respectively. RMR arranged almost 5 million square feet of leases on behalf of our clients this quarter, more than doubling the previous quarter's activity with a weighted average lease term of approximately 19 years and average roll up in rent of almost 26%. Almost 80% of this quarter's leasing activity was executed at ILPT-owned assets, highlighting the continued robust demand for industrial and logistics properties and supporting our recent focus on acquiring well-leased and attractive industrial assets. During the quarter, DHC repaid $500 million of 9.75% debt, sold an additional 10% equity interest in its existing Boston life science property joint venture and is making progress towards regaining compliance with its debt covenants. In the third fiscal quarter, we reported adjusted net income of $9.8 million or $0.59 per share and adjusted EBITDA of $29.4 million, both representing significant sequential quarter increases in each metric finishing above the midpoint of our guidance. Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we expect to generate between $50 million and $52 million of revenues based on the current enterprise values of our managed equity REITs as well as our expectations of continued increases in construction management fees."
