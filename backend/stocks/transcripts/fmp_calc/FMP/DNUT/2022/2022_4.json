    "content": " Growth was strong across the world, especially to end the year as we sell double-digit organic revenue growth in all three segments in the fourth quarter with performance accelerated in the U.S. Krispy Kreme business, market development and in retail in the UK. These efforts led to more than a 20% increase in e-commerce revenue in the fourth quarter compared to a year ago, and led to a 260 basis point increase in sales mix of e-commerce to 18.3% for the company as a whole during the quarter. As Mike said, we saw strong growth across all of our reporting segments in the fourth quarter with net revenue up 9% year-over-year, the $405 million organic revenue, which excludes the impact of acquisitions and changes in foreign currency grew 12.5%, an acceleration from the summer trends driven by pricing, our premium seasonal innovation, the growth of delivered fresh daily doughnuts sold in grocery and convenience stores and e-commerce. However, net income would\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve increased over the prior year, if not for one time, overwhelmingly, non-cash expenses of $12.4 million related to our previously announced optimization of our poorer performing Hubs without Spokes in the U.S. We do not expect significant expense moving forward relating to these efforts. Adjusted net income for the quarter increased 27% to $20.4 million, and adjusted diluted EPS in the fourth quarter was $0.11, an increase of 38% or 63% in constant currency. In the U.S. and Canada business segment, total revenue increased 11% in the fourth quarter to $277 million. And organic revenue growth was 12%, an increase on our third quarter performance with strong growth in fresh doughnut sales, both on and off premises, explaining a 15% increase in trailing 12-month sales step up to $4.6 million. This reflects both a 10% increase in door served to 5,700 and a 10% increase in average weekly sales per door to $580 in the U.S. for 2022, reflecting both successful pricing and the addition of specialty doughnuts previously only seen in our doughnut shops. DFD door sales continue to benefit from the addition of more specialty doughnuts like the crowd pleasing Biscoff range and Valentine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s doughnuts we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve sold recently in the U.S. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re also rolling out more fresh cabinet displays in grocery stores, which typically lead to a 30% to 70% increase in DFD sales per door, less than a $10,000 investment. Total revenues in the fourth quarter increased 11% to $35 million, even with a 13% impact from FX headwinds and a franchise acquisitions. Adjusted EBITDA in the fourth quarter for market development increased 11% to $12.3 million, despite a roughly $1 million negative impact from FX headwinds. Our 2023 guidance includes modest headwinds from foreign exchange for the year based on current exchange rates, a roughly negative 1% impact on revenue growth and approximately $3 million hit to adjusted EBITDA. Each 1% move in the U.S. dollar index is a little over $1 million impact on adjusted EBITDA on an annualized basis as roughly half of our pre corporate expense adjusted EBITDA is outside the U.S. From a cost of goods sold perspective, we are more than 90% covered on our major commodities such as sugar, wheat, and edible oils for 2023 at an average increase in the high single digits. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open."
