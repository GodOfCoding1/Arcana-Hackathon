    "content": " Despite robust organic revenue growth, adjusted EBITDA in the quarter declined modestly to $47.4 million, due to significant foreign exchange headwinds of $2.7 million, cycling a very tough margin comp in the UK, as they were reemerging from COVID in the second quarter of 2021 and in the US from our vaccine promotion and investments in the consumer through brand-building promotions. Adjusted EBITDA in the second quarter declined modestly in the US and Canada due to weaker performance in our Hubs without Spokes, cycling a banner quarter from our vaccine promotion a year ago and modestly higher promotional activity to help consumers with Acts of Joy and delayed price increase to the beginning of the third quarter. In the second quarter, our Krispy Kremers have once again shown that our beloved brand and our omnichannel approach drives, even in a challenging consumer environment, with net revenue growing 7.5% year-over-year to $375 million. Adjusted EBITDA was $47.4 million in the second quarter, down 10% from a year ago. In the US and Canada business segment, total revenue increased 8.5% in the second quarter to $251 million and organic growth was 6%. All these factors combined to increase sales per hub in the US and Canada to $4.4 million on a trailing 12-month basis in the second quarter, that compares to the $4 million for 2021 and $3.6 million a year ago. Hubs without Spokes in the US underperformed in the second quarter, with revenue growth in the quarter 5% lower year-over-year than the Hubs with Spokes, thus highlighting the importance of the omnichannel model. Adjusted EBITDA for the US and Canada in the second quarter, decreased 8% to $26 million, with margins declining 180 basis points to 10.4% as we cycled a strong quarter from the vaccine from actually a year ago. This 29% increase in international points of access from a year ago, allowed us to leverage our 37 international hubs to grow international sales per hub to $9.8 million on a trailing 12 month basis, up from $9.1 million at the end of 2021, and $8 million in 2020 even with the FX headwinds. International adjusted EBITDA for the quarter declined 17.5% to $20 million, as gains in Mexico Australia and New Zealand were not enough to offset a decline in the UK. Total revenues in the second quarter increased 6.5% to $30.9 million, even with a 7% impact from FX headwinds and franchise acquisitions. Adjusted EBITDA in the second quarter for Market Development increased 6.5%, $10.5 million despite a negative $600,000 impact from headwind \u00e2\u0080\u0093 FX headwinds. After investing $22 million in capital during the second quarter, which represents below 6% of revenue, we do expect annual CapEx to be approximately $10 million lower this year due to a shift to lower capital points of access and benefits from a decrease in spend internationally due to the dollar strength. While we don't provide quarterly guidance after softer organic revenue growth in the UK and the US in May and June, we have seen a strong start to the third quarter with 10% organic growth quarter-to-date helped by recent price increases and strong LTOs such as our ice-cream truck doughnuts in the US, which have so far been enough to offset another summer heat wave in the UK. Well the first thing to say is that, Stat I just referenced to Bill in terms of 9% volume growth in the US shows that fundamentally we're selling more doughnuts every quarter than the quarter before in the prior year because we're making it more available and people -- that's the number one reason given why consumers may not think that at Krispy Kreme they can't get it."
