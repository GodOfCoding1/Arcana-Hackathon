    "content": " As a result of these factors, we're lowering our sales growth range to 10% to 16% given this combined with temporary costs we now anticipate that adjusted EBITDA will be in the range of $145 million to $160 million. Your line is open. But yes, in building HVAC Q2, the biggest driver there was between $5 million and $10 million of product that we produced completed and customers didn't pull or take shipment at the end of the month or at the end of the quarter that in itself would have had a big impact in the quarter from a data center revenue growth and from a margin and an earning standpoint. Your line is open. Your line is open. So there really good visibility, I would say, for the second half of the year and building HVAC and CIS, well north of a $20 million in data center backlog. Your line is open."
