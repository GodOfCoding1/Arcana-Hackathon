    "content": " Lastly, air cooled product sales increased 15% or $21 million, primarily due to strong demand in the off-highway and commercial vehicle markets. We are also holding our outlook for fiscal '23 adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $190 million to $200 million, representing an increase of 20% to 26% versus the prior year. So as you already mentioned, we're holding guidance but we're very confident in our ability to hit that top end of our range -- with regards to PT or Performance Technologies, we expect that they'll have another good quarter with both sequential and year-over-year growth. And as we go into next year, I think we're good from a working capital standpoint, a little too early to give you guidance on that side but we would expect as revenue and earnings grow, we'll do our best here to continue to manage working capital down to where we were for quite a long time ."
