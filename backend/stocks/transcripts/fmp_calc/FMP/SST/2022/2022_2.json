    "content": " And kind of, as I mentioned, we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t necessarily need up markets or down markets, we can take advantage of our spread in most markets, but we do look for some level of stability that allows us to figure out the ad verticals that are going to be most profitable for us, and also the buy side and sell side places that are going to increase our spread the most. And our guidance is also combined with as we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve mentioned, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re seeing some pretty good pockets of opportunity on the subscription side to go in and acquire customers at larger scale while maintaining our cost to acquire our goals. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re basing our kind of a forward looking advertising on what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the quarter so far, but we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re also leaving ourselves room for increased customer acquisition on the subscription side. And I think everybody on the call knows how that works on the customer acquisition side, because we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re paying upfront for the subscribers, that typically is going to come into negative EBITDA for this year, and then increase the growth for next year."
