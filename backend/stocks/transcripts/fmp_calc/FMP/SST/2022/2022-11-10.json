    "content": " With our accelerated customer acquisition also comes increased in quarter marketing expenses, our Q3 marketing spend was $22 million versus an estimated $19 million when we reported in August. We spent close to $22 million on subscription customer acquisition marketing in the quarter versus our guidance forecast of approximately $19 million, which represented a $5 million increase in marketing spend year-over-year. Adjusted EBITDA was $29 million versus $37 million last year, representing a 46% margin on gross profit. As part of our guidance, we are assuming that we will deploy approximately $100 million of advertising spend to acquire traffic to our owned and operated sites at a spread of approximately 40%, slightly higher than what we saw in Q3. I think even just the real testament to RAMP and the business that we built, we still saw actually an expansion in our spread between RPS and CPS on the O&O side this past quarter, maintaining that $0.04 spread and actually going up a little bit if you go out to the decimals to 38%."
