    "content": " We knew pretty much we had to hunt and over the last couple years, heavily invested in products that are not just going to be complimentary to what we are doing, but it will clearly help us diversify into other application markets and most importantly get us the system sales capability that we are really active and making it very sticky. So a few specific examples in the health and wellness area with having our Helios sense of engineering excellence, working together with innovation teams we are bringing products in out to the market over the next few quarters that will clearly diversify above and beyond the health and wellness industry more into the specialty vehicles area and other applications that we clearly laid out in our analyst day. What we expect over the next year as we continue to, to develop a very focused or execute our very focused augmented strategy in terms of having center of excellence, diversifying, and really closing in on the system sales application, we feel we can leverage Ted hydraulic segment with electrification and get to the a $100 million number as we outlined in our press release. One is organic application that we are, you know, just continuing to execute our manufacturing strategy with center of excellence and in the region for the region leveraging our faster brand from Europe into North America and then coupling our system sales application where we can do a system within the Damon footprint and leveraging their engineering capabilities to do more into the diversified markets and couple in other products in the hydraulics and electronics within the Damon four walls to get into the applications and markets they're currently serving."
