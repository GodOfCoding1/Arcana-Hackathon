Diluted EPS improved to $0.94 up 34%, while diluted non-GAAP cash EPS improved to a $1.18 up 19% for the first quarter over the prior-year period, reflecting higher sales, operational efficiencies, and strong operating leverage. first quarter hydraulic sales of $137.1 million were up 15% over the prior-year period and benefited from improved demand and market share gains in the Americas and EMEA, despite the $4.5 million headwind from foreign currency exchange rates.
