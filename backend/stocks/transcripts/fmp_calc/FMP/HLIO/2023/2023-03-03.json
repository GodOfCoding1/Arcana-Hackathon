    "content": " We delivered top-tier margin with solid earnings for the full year of 2022 while navigating supply chain challenges, FX impact and the ongoing softness in our health and wellness business in the fourth quarter. Combined with our organic growth entertainment acquisition, we expect to reach our $1 billion revenue milestone with top-tier margins on a run rate basis ending 2023, not including any additional acquisitions this year. They have an exceptional value-added manufacturing process with approximately $30 million in full year revenue in 2022 and a healthy margin profile, the acquisition is immediately accretive -- now turning to Slide 5. Even with the contraction in our health and wellness market that we have seen since the boom cycle through 2021, combined with our other businesses and recent flywheel acquisitions, we believe we can grow revenues to $910 million to $940 million this year. We anticipate Q1 '23 revenues to grow sequentially over Q4 '22 by mid-single digits and ramp through the year, exiting the fourth quarter north of $250 million on the top line. Importantly, we still see a path to deliver our original target at our last Investor Day to achieve a 3-year CAGR of approximately 22% growth in non-GAAP cash EPS at the midpoint of our expected range for 2023 of $3.95 to $4.10 per share. We have been able to acquire high-quality portfolio of flywheel acquisitions, advance our technologies through tireless innovation of industry-leading products and solutions, make significant progress implementing our manufacturing and operating strategy as we diversify revenues and markets while protecting our business and margins, all which has accelerated our growth."
