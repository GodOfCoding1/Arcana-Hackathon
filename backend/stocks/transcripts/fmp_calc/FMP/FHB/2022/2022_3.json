    "content": " This is just that's a volatile part of having large corporate customers is somewhat volatile about $100-plus million of that was title companies, which you just can't predict what the balances are going to be at the end of the quarter. We're not really sure what to anticipate other than I think if you look back historically, there's usually a pretty strong correlation between rates and cap rates. So I think it's just something that we're going to pay attention to, but I think location, sponsorship, and I think the way that we underwrite in terms of being a cash flow lender, that gives us a lot of confidence in the portfolio as we move into 2023. No, we're really looking at dollars, and that's why we try to give the guidance of $113 million to $114 million for the quarter, which we're still very comfortable with for Q4. I think, to Bob's point, we're going to have a little bit expense this quarter that related to kind of the cure period and the conversion that will go away. As we look at that pretty robust road map, and from a cost perspective and bringing back down to that, we're going to be doing that in really a thoughtful way to not overspend in any one period, but there's a lot on our plate, and that's what the customers want."
