    "content": " Turning to slide four, period end loans and leases were $13.3 billion, an increase of $371 million or 2.9% from the end of Q1. Excluding PPP loans, total loans and leases increased by $434 million, 3.4% compared to the prior quarter. Excluding PPP loans, total loans and leases are up $474 million or 3.7% in line with our full year outlook of mid-to-high single-digit growth, which remains unchanged. Turning to slide five, deposits increased by $331 million or 1.5% to $22.6 billion at quarter end. Compensation related expenses increased by $1.7 million as we saw the full quarter impact of merit increases, a reduction in capitalized salaries related to the core project and the hiring of temporary help to support us through the May system conversion. Looking ahead to the second half of the year, we anticipate that expenses will be between $113 million per quarter and $114 million per quarter, slightly higher than our original outlook. Certainly, we are comfortable with the guide that Ralph gave of $113 million to $114 million for the next two quarters, but we will have to wait till later in the year to get a really an outlook for 2023. Moving over to leverage loans, as you know, I mean, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a -- there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not a common definition for that and so we are trying to piggyback off of, I think, the OCC definition, which is 6 times debt commitments, not outstanding debt commitments to EBITDA and using that metric we have $39 million at quarter end and all are past rated."
