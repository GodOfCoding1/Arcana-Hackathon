    "content": " Our ongoing potentially registration and labeling Phase 2 trial of BA3011 is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of BA3011 monotherapy and in combination with nivolumab in AXL expression patients with refractory non-small cell lung cancer that have filed either ALK, EGFR or PD-1 inhibitors. Taken together, our preliminary observations in non-small cell lung cancer and our Phase 2 sarcoma study data, our lead CAB-ADC asset BA3011 has the potential to be a best-in-class therapeutic treatment for patients who have failed frontline regimens with an estimated total global commercial opportunity of approximately $4 billion."
