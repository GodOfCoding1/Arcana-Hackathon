As a reminder, your call today is being recorded. I would now turn the conference call over to your host, Charles Lynch. Thank you, Allen, and good morning, everyone. With me this morning are Mark Ordan, Chief Executive Officer and Marc Richards, our Chief Financial Officer. These forward-looking statements are based on assumptions and assessments made by Pediatrix' management in light of their experience and assessment of historical trends, current conditions, expected future developments and other factors they believe to be appropriate. Any forward-looking statements made during this call are made as of today, and Pediatrix undertakes no duty to update or revise any such statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Important factors that could cause actual results, developments and business decisions to differ materially from forward-looking statements are described in the company's most recent annual report on Form 10-K, its quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and its current reports on Form 8-K, including the sections entitled Risk Factors. In today's remarks by management, we will be discussing non-GAAP financial metrics. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measures can be found in this morning's earnings press release, our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and our annual report on Form 10-K and on our website at www.pediatrix.com. With that, I'll turn the call over to Mark Ordan. However, our revenue was impacted by both payer mix and our ongoing transition to R1 as our RCM partner. As a result, our adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was slightly below the expectations we shared on our last call with a differential primarily in revenue. We're pleased with our RCM function today but in retrospect, the speed with which we transitioned from our internal team to R1 gave rise to a revenue impact that setback our Q1 results and to a lesser extent, our Q2 results. I want to stress that this impasse, I speak off and which Marc will further detail is related only to our RCM transition and not to any change in pay relationships or behavior. By that I mean that our front-end activity is moving well, which is significant given that that area was meaningfully impacted in the early stages of this transition. Its impact should affect 2022 alone, and we see no effect therefore beyond this year. On clinical labor, we reported in Q1 that we had not seen any material change in clinical labor costs but was certainly aware of the tough environment around us. In Q2, our clinical salary costs were roughly 3 million above our forecast. While this is much smaller, a much smaller change in cost trend and other providers have discussed, I'm calling it out only given the tough labor environment we're in. Our G&A expense declined significantly compared to last year, and versus our internal projections and we believe that we will continue to find enhanced operating efficiency without taking away from our dedication to care. And finally, our strong cash flow enabled us to fund the repurchase of 3.3 million of our shares. The confluence of all the factors I've described thus far, leaders who expect that 270 million and adjusted EBITDA, for 2022 does remain achievable, but we now point to a range of between $260 million and $270 million for the year. All of our efforts are focused on women's, children's and baby's health, and on our amazing affiliated clinicians who provide care, as well as the research, education, and quality and safety improvements required to be the leaders in their vital field. On July 1, we formally changed our name to Pediatrix Medical Group to underscore this complete focus. I discussed last quarter that additions to our team under Dr. Jim Swift, our Chief Operating Officer, and we're now fully underway in our growth plan between now and the end of 23, we anticipate we will expand from our current footprint of 21 clinics across three markets and Tuesdays between 40 to 50 clinics across eight to 10 markets in a half dozen states. On the No Surprises Act as I mentioned earlier today, we haven't seen any notable change in payer behavior related to out of network cases, we are still waiting for HHS to finalize the tools, guidance, the details of the arbitration process. That said, we're certainly not sitting idle, our managed care team alongside our partners, and R1 have built a really robust capability to manage this arbitration process in a thoughtful data driven way. Here again, we're much better prepared for this process than we could have been on our own. Before I turn to call to Marc, I want to thank our affiliated clinicians, our operators and our support team for all their hard work and dedication to this organization. In my now two years at Pediatrix, I am really awestruck by what our people do for families across the nation. At the top-line, the decline in our same unit pricing was measurably less than we reported in Q1 when you exclude the contribution from CARES dollars in both periods. The revenue impact from the RCM related matters Mark discussed, which we bucket as a component of pricing was less than half the magnitude of the first quarter. Payer mix, which can fluctuate quarter-to-quarter represented a headwind in Q2 versus a modest tailwind in Q1. Looking at RCM, our transition to R1 created an increase in accounts receivable and related reserves, which unfavorably affected our revenue in the first quarter and to a lesser degree, the second quarter of this year. This AR build up continued beyond March, followed by a significant improvement in cash collections towards the end of the quarter. All told, you'll see in our press release in our 10-Q filed this morning that both our gross and net AR declined modestly for the quarter and DSOs came down by one day compared to March 31 to 58 days. We're certainly pleased with this direction, but DSOs at quarter end are still higher than normal. As of today, we view our RCM activities as bifurcated. As Mark noted, we are now running normal billing and collecting activity related to current patient services. Separately, we're also working the more aged AR and will continue to do so through the remainder of the year. For modeling purposes, our 22 outlook reflects adjusted EBITDA in the first half of the year by 116.2 million. Additionally, within our outlook, we expect our adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter to Increase in the mid-single digit percent range compared to 73 million in the third quarter of 2021. Lastly, we remain in a strong financial position. We generated $82 million in operating cash flow in the second quarter, up about 11 million year-over-year, funded 64 million in share repurchases, our normal CapEx and a small practice acquisition. At quarter end, our total debt of 800 million was effectively unchanged from March 31. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Mark. Hey, good morning, you mentioned that you saw some improvement in collection towards the end of the second quarter. Hey, Tao, it's Marc Richards. I mean, that's certainly the goal here in the third and fourth quarter, we'd expect improvement through the third quarter and into the fourth quarter. As you know, historically, our DSOs sit right around 50 days. In terms of pricing and could you give us an update on what kind of rate you are seeing, out there in terms of either Medicaid and commercial rates. I know that some states have increased their Medicaid rate, I think commercial payers are often more open to higher rate growth recovering inflation, any commentary you could provide it will be much appreciated. Hey, Tao, it's Charlie. As Mark Ordan mentioned, we're still in effectively business as usual related to managed care renewals and contracting. And as I've said in the past, our general view related to overall same unit, peer pricing, excluding the impacts of payer mix, or as we've seen in the first half of this year, some of the RCM matters, something in the modest range of 1% plus one to 2%. If we had done so much of the work internally, we have a terrific Head of Marketing and a marketing team. Hey, good morning, guys. Mark, just on the guidance, maybe without going into quarterly guidance any color or qualitative comments you can make for us to consider as we model Q3. As I said, 270 is certainly achievable because of -- I would say that the most major setbacks that we had was from the transition from R1 and the cost, it hits the revenue line item. But I look at it as a cost that was incurred in Q1 and to a lesser extent in Q2, and we'll see how much of that we can recover, we've been working hard and we have a terrific team doing it, to know what that will shake out to by the end of the year. And then payer mix certainly fluctuates by quarter and then this quarter, it had a negative effect on us. But we can't say, we're in that range will fall and again, depending on how we recover from the transition efforts that we described, that will have a major effect on where we end up. Brian, specific to your question on Q3, we expect quarter-over-quarter when looking back to Q3 of 21, growth quarter-over-quarter in the low single digits. Okay, that's very helpful. And then I guess, Mark, since you touched on payer mix. I mean, we saw this obviously, during the last recession. No, we're not seeing that. As a matter of fact, payer mix. And I know from other organizations, same thing payer mix can really fluctuate a lot. No, I would think of a component of that loss in the first half of the year, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s gone. Some of it of course, is still recoverable and that's what we're parsing out right now. As I said, I called it out this time, because I didn't want people to think that we're not focused on the fact that we're in a tough labor environment. Obviously, we don't forecast what is going to be but we had solid gains in volume for the quarter. And then on the labor side, you have a lot of different businesses, you've been expended different businesses, it would you say the labor is more difficult in any specific part of the business. I mean, last time that we have a terrific recruiting arm and they integrate it. So we've done a very good job of keeping pace with turnover, and there's no particular area that's driving the increase in costs and the increase in costs are relatively modest, but I thought worth calling out, nonetheless. Hey, good morning, guys. Now, the component of that is denials and timely filings. So at any point in time, to the extent bills haven't been set out, at that point in time, it's a timing issue. If those bills are not set out, under the correct timing is dictated by your payer contracts, that money has been lost. And that plays into, just from based on experience, that is what effectively plays into the buckets of AR and we will reserve against them as they flow through. And then to follow up on Kevin's question on the sort of the salary costs about $3 million above the forecast, I was under the impression that most of your physicians which are under multiyear contracts with both fixed and variable components. Pito, it's, keep in mind, we've got in the 1000s of clinical providers across the organization. So as pleased as we are, with our general turnover rates there is still turnover, it's relatively modest, but there is. So as we looked at the second quarter and dug into, you know, those individual practices, et cetera where there was a financial call out. The majority of instances were related to that modest level of turnover and open position that hadn't yet been filled in the like, and thus, the need for either existing clinicians in that practice to take extra shifts on call overtime, and the like, prior to refilling that position. So in each one of those instances, obviously, there's been a work plan. And we do think that there's recapture there with some cost saving, but that is a general tone of how we saw in the quarter. And, again, as Mark mentioned, roughly $3 million run over versus our internal forecast is relatively minor. If I understand your question correctly, we continue to be overwhelmingly in network less than 5% of our -- we are less with over 95% in network. And as I said, we haven't seen any, any pattern or change in behavior. While we wait for clarity from HHS, but I'm not sure that I answered exactly your question. I guess the question is, as people are thinking about, different recessionary risks here. And from an absolute standpoint, in terms of the percent of our patient volume, as measured by gross charges on either the two sides, government or non-government, which is how we look at it, where we stand today, the government component is very comparable to where it's been over the past couple of years. And actually, even for this quarter is maybe 100 bps or more lower than where it kind of topped out a call it about four years ago. And during that period as we view it, it is likely that employment growth through the middle and latter stages of economic expansion prior to the pandemic had a favorable role for us. I don't know if we've ever had a perfectly clean view on that Whit because generally, and even going back to the initiation of the exchanges, oftentimes, we would be submitting a claim to the same carrier, whether it was exchange program or not. But that said, in general, any kind of contracts we had that covered that were under the existing contract we have with the payer. So they had an exchange program or a normal insurance program, our contracts were comparable. I think, Whit we will get back to you on that. By my recollection, we didn't. I'm just trying to, obviously, think about like if the subsidies go away, what the potential headwind could be if there is a headwind. And then really a final question, just on the G&A target 250. On the first, we wouldn't comment on that, there's normal negotiating processes with all of our payers, we have over 500 contracts. And our G&A targets, yes, we're comfortable with what we've laid out. But kind of given the inflationary environment and other current market conditions with rising rates, et cetera. I guess, just to kind of rephrase this, what's your mindset when it comes to M&A and investments like Brave, are you kind of looking at areas to supplement growth on the urgent care side more technology, investments, et cetera. We were excited to grow in any area where it fits our core business, and where it's accretive. So in many of our subspecialties, we're actively looking at ways to increase footprint. Certainly in primary and urgent care, you mentioned Brave we acquired outright of NightLight of Orlando and NightLight of Houston. And as we mentioned, which I think is very important. And when we think is a strong use of capital, that's where we put our capital. So I'd say we had an RCM team, big RCM team, and in the move from RCM team to R1, I'd say with hindsight, which is always handy. That's what I mean, by more abruptly than I wish we had. So I think we did it, we did it pretty well, but not as well as I wish we had. Having said that, importantly, we're at a point. We're at a point today, where we have a very solid RCM function. And as I mentioned, in addition to that we have an arbitration capability that we would never have been able to match on our own. So as Marc rightly pointed out that the other side of the RCM effort right now is collecting as much as we can, from the earlier month to recover as much as possible. But I think that it was a very good transition, a very good move to transition to R1. We're disappointed by the turbulence and by the fact that had we -- we believe that we kept people on our team longer, it would have been a better transition and less costly for us. We are overwhelmingly in network, so we haven't seen the increase in arbitration, the only areas where we're out of network, and we have had arbitration, we've been very pleased with the results. But we know that one of these days there will be a -- there will be some final ruling, and things will settle in and we will need to have a process to settle these in arbitration. And just my last area, just quick question is on the push for the pediatric urgent care centers. Obviously, you've known some of them for a little while now. And maybe parents were saying, \u00e2\u0080\u009cHey, I'd go to a pediatric urgent care center, because I want to keep my kids away from, places where they might catch COVID from adults.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Are you seeing any change in the demand profile as we progress through the pandemic? We weren't basing our decision on what we saw at the time was a COVID bump like any acquisition, you look not only at what's going on at the moment, but what's going on -- what went on historically. So no, we continued to be very pleased with the P&L of these of these operations and the economic opportunity and our thinking about it hasn't changed. If there are times when there's a upward blip because of a COVID, which obviously, for all reasons, you don't want another COVID. But obviously, that's not the driver of our reason to do this. Our reason to do this is, as it's always been that we are in our major markets, the largest employer of pediatricians, we have an enormous impact on what happens in pediatric care in our markets. Well, the arbitration process right now is only where we are out of network. And I would say that we have the arbitration process, which many people don't know, is a case-by-case process. So you could imagine how laborious a process like that could be, if it ever became significant. And I think we have that today with thanks to our partnership with our team, our managed care team and R1. My assumption is that if you're out of network, almost definitionally, it's because you'd be above the median in network rate. It varies payer by payer and contract by contract, so I don't have that. And gentlemen, we have no further lines in queue at this time. Great, well, thank you all, for your understanding, your support and we look forward to updating you on our progress as we move forward. Ladies and gentlemen, that will conclude your conference call for today."
