    "content": " We also recorded $10 million in revenue related to related funds from the CARES Act during the first quarter that favorably impacted adjusted EBITDA by about $6 million, which relates to applications we submitted to the periods in 2020 when our operations were disrupted during the COVID pandemic. I'm also pleased that despite headwinds across the health care industry, particularly labor cost pressures and for physician groups like ours, the uncertainties surrounding surprise billing rulings, we remain comfortable with our outlook of at least $270 million of adjusted EBITDA for 2022. As our first quarter results relate to our outlook of adjusted EBITDA for the year, as Mark noted, we're maintaining our underlying expectations for 2022 of revenue in the range of $2 billion and adjusted EBITDA of at least $270 million. Within that outlook, we expect our adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter to be roughly comparable to or slightly higher than the prior year's $66 million, with growth in adjusted EBITDA reaccelerating in the second half of the year."
