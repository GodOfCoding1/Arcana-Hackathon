    "content": " Mark Richards will give additional details underpinning our preliminary 2023 outlook, but at a high level, this outlook contemplates a similar headwind to the adjusted EBITDA that we experienced in 2022, related to our RCM transition activities or roughly $15 million. In terms of our quarterly earnings progression, we anticipate that our first quarter adjusted EBITDA will represent 16% to 18% of full year adjusted EBITDA, which is largely due to the normal seasonality of our financial results but also to our outlook for the impact of ongoing RCM transition activities. Finally, we do not anticipate any additional CARES funds in 2023, which in 2022 contributed $6.7 million in adjusted EBITDA, mostly in the first quarter of last year. No, that is solely related to our expectation of the flow through of revenue impact of the AR process, as we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve talked about, the last few quarters, any kind of incremental costs that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re incurring or believe we might incur on additional staffing is embedded within our outlook for G&A for this year, that sub 12% G&A that Marc referenced. And if you're asking about 2023, as Mark said, we just \u00e2\u0080\u0093 we think that the $15 million drag in 2023 will be largely in the first half of the year and ramp-up \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and ramp-up as we approach the end of the second quarter, into the third and fourth quarter. Yes, I think, what we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve focused on in the last number of years and that we reported on this is really around the build out of our organic growth team, which really paid often dividends in terms of, sourcing opportunities with our hospital partners and also sourcing opportunities internal to us that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re all around ambulatory services."
