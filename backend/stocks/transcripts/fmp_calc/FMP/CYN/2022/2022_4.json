Yes, we -- fairly consistent in terms of the EAS offering that we have been touting since the IPO to Lior's point earlier to really see EAS as that umbrella that captures all of the value that we bring to customers ranging from vehicles that drive themselves to various assets throughout their business that give them additional data insight, let them see more about the work that they're doing, learn more, automate that and provide the types of value propositions that would be expected from this data revolution and automation. We've knocked over that first domino per se with USC, and we are seeing that absolutely have a positive impact from the feedback that we're getting, from the request to come on site and see demos and we're setting up hopefully more exciting opportunities to enable customers, certainly all over the United States potential customers to have streamlined and easier opportunities to come see the vehicles at work at various facilities."
