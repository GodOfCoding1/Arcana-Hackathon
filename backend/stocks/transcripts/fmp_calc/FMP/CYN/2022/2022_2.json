    "content": " These forward-looking statements can be identified by terms such as anticipate, believe, expect, future, planned, outlook and will and include, among other things, statements regarding the company's continued development of the Enterprise Autonomy Suite or EAS, and its components, expectations regarding sales and/or revenues, growth strategy, ability to deliver sustainable long-term value, ability to respond to the changing environment and operational focus. Another example of the impact, Cyngn's Enterprise Autonomy Suite has on material handling or 3PL customers can be seen in a case study we released last month, which quantified the value that our industrial autonomy technology brings Global Logistics and Fulfillment or GL&F, for whom we deployed autonomous stockchaser at their Las Vegas facility beginning in late 2021. G&A expenses also increased by $1.1 million, which was also related to increased stock based non cash compensation expense, costs incurred for additional personnel and professional services to support our status as a public company and higher occupancy costs related to the renewal of the company's lease that expanded the square footage of our Menlo Park offices. We reported a net loss of $4.6 million for the second quarter of 2022, compared to a net loss of $2.1 million in the prior year quarter as a result of increased operating expenses. Net loss per share on a basic and diluted basis was $0.15, based on approximately $30.7 million weighted average shares outstanding for the quarter ended June 30, 2022. Net loss per share on a basic and diluted basis was $0.29, based on approximately $28.7 million weighted average shares outstanding compared to a net loss per share on a basic and diluted basis of $3.83 based on approximately 1 million weighted average shares outstanding in the prior year period."
