    "content": " Our strong momentum in North America continues, where sales were up 12% year-over-year, FX adjusted, of course and that's driven by continued high demand for 5G solutions in Networks. Overall, we continue to see very good momentum on market share gains in Europe, with Networks showing double-digit growth despite sales being affected, of course, by the invasion of Ukraine and Russia impacted sales by SEK1.2 billion -- or lost sales by SEK1.2 billion during the quarter. And from the quarter 3 report then, we will report in the new structure with the 4 segments: Networks, Cloud Software and Services, Enterprise and Other and we will provide a restate also for -- from first quarter 2021 until second quarter '22 and also the full year 2020 in this new structure and we will do that in September, well in time for the Q3 reports. So organic growth of 5% despite then a couple of items that B\u00c3\u00b6rje touched on, the suspended business volume in Russia, that's SEK1.2 billion in top line drop due to that; and also the IPR revenue which is SEK0.9 billion lower year-over-year. Well, before starting with the Q&A, I would like to mention that we are planning for a Capital Markets Day on December 15, we'll come back with more details where and venue, et cetera and lay out but we will focus, of course, on describing our strategy as well as the opportunities for growth that we see going forward. And I would say, we should also remember the gross margin impact from IPR, that's -- we're going to make sure we get the right deal rather than optimize an individual quarter's performance. Because I think that's the most important part of enterprises, is that we need to build a not necessarily direct but rather an indirect multichannel go-to-market structure and that's why we're focusing our attention on right now, while we maintain the growth rate of Cradlepoint and drive product development in Dedicated Networks. Firstly, in terms of what you're saying about the sort of investing in product and, therefore, getting a better price and gross margin, even with cost inflation, clearly, that's the strategy that has worked well for you guys over the last 5 years."
