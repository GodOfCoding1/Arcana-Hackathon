    "content": " And here it's interesting to see that we're already working very intensively with front runner customers, basically to develop the APIs, but also to bring them to the market and our customers recognize that this will be a very important monetization engine for them going forward, so they can start to monetize the network investments that they're making. Gross income grew by some SEK 3.4 billion in spite of the lower IPR revenues that I mentioned and growth of gross income really comes from sales increase in networks, given footprint wins we have and Vonage contributed SEK 1.2 billion to the gross income number. Key reasons there for that decline being then first of all, again, for the third time, the lower IPR revenues, it's about 1 percentage point on gross margin, but we also see supply chain cost in Networks, as we have talked about before. And the increase here is mainly related to adding Vonage, consolidating Vonage into our numbers because Vonage impacted SG&A by SEK 1.8 billion, and that in itself includes intangible amortizations, which are then, of course not included in our EBITA metric, we will come to that, but also one-offs. And gross margin, 44.4%, that's impacted, again, by the lower IPR revenues, of course of which Networks record 82% as you know, but also some increased cost of components and supply chain investments there. The existing Vonage business to boost that and continue growing that; and secondly the synergies from Vonage offerings into Ericsson's global footprint of customers; and then thirdly, of course, what B\u00c3\u00b6rje really talked about the network API side of the business where we can create an entirely new market. And I think on the big picture also, I think it's good to remember the 15% to 20% EBITA that captures all of this actually and as you know, we said in fourth quarter 2021 that we will reach that point, that range within two to three years."
