    "content": " As we also said during our Capital Markets Day last month, we expect and plan for overall mobile networks market to be flattish in the next few years and the lower now predicts a slight growth outside of China. But the margin and gross margin, of course again excluding restructuring charges, while supported by IPR declined still by 200 basis points then to 41.5% year-over-year, primarily due to the business mix shift that we talk about in the networks, but also related to this previously announced charges for contract portfolio exits in Cloud and Cloud Software & Services. So next, when it comes to gross margin for Networks, we are specific now in the guidance for the first quarter, where we say that given this change in business mix resulting from market share gains and what we have explained now and earlier, we expect to see a range of gross margin in networks between 40% and 42% in the first quarter. And then just broadly speaking, do you think that networks can longer term return to a 44% to 46% gross margin range, which you saw in previous quarters towards that an artificially high level of gross margins as a result of a particularly favorable business mix, which is not expected to prove the longer term just in broad terms. But what I can say is that when you look at the guidance, we've given for Q1 on gross margin in Networks, and you can there see that we expect a decline in the US quite substantial as well as a growth in new market share contracts."
