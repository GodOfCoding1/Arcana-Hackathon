    "content": " Despite mortgage originations of just $179 million during the fourth quarter, 90% of which were either purchase or construction, residential real estate loans increased more than 20% both year-over-year and sequentially annualized through the retention of approximately 80% of the 1-to-4 family residential mortgages generated by our team of mortgage loan originators. As noted in yesterday's earnings release, during the fourth quarter, we reported improved GAAP net income available to common shareholders of $49.7 million, and earnings per diluted share of $0.84, and net income of $182 million, and earnings per share of $3.02 for the full-year. For the fourth quarter of 2022, non-interest income of $27.8 million was down $2.9 million year-over-year, primarily due to lower mortgage banking income which decreased $2.3 million due to reduction in residential mortgage originations consistent with the industry in general, and the retention of more loans on our balance sheet. So, I think if you were just to roll the resi mortgage back to 50%, and look at that, assuming we had done that last year, we would have had a loan growth of about 8% or 9% because we put more resi on, and that bumped us up to a little over 11%, but that's market-dependent based upon what's going on with what consumers want. But I would say to the extent that we see -- if we did see deposit growth, let's say, and fund growth were within that $150 million per quarter kicking out of the CD portfolio, I think we would continue then in that case to leverage the wholesale parts. Of course we have some other levers that we can pull, but I think, today, we would be, to the extent if we needed more than, let's say, that $150 million per quarter plus the slowdown in CDs, we would be -- we would continue to leverage those wholesale parts."
