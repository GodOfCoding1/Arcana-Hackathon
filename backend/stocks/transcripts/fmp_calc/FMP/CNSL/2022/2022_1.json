    "content": " Overall, consumer broadband revenue in the first quarter was $65.9 million, up approximately 1% after normalizing for our Ohio sale. Data and transport totaled $57.9 million in the recent quarter, up 1.4% year-over-year, primarily driven by growth in dedicated Internet services. Carrier data and transport revenue was $33.5 million, up roughly $200,000 year-over-year, benefiting from our carrier team's ability to win additional new business and the timing on the pricing reductions from the tower contract renewals. Our Q1 carrier revenue was solid, and as a reminder, we still estimate revenue pressure in the tower contract negotiations to be in the range of $10 million to $12 million in 2022, establishing a new run rate for carrier fiber to the tower revenues."
