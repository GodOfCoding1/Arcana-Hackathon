    "content": " Looking forward to the next three years, we plan to build fiber to an additional 1 million locations, which will transform the company to more than 70% fiber passings by 2025. $5.6 million lower wireless cash distributions as previously discussed, approximately $7.8 million higher voice erosion across all customer channels, approximately $3 million for inflationary impacts from energy and fuel costs and $2.5 million for normalization of New Hampshire property tax rebates which we received last year. Consumer fiber revenue was $21.6 million, up $6.1 million or 40% year over year and we have added over 12,000 consumer in fiber gig plus connections during the quarter. Consumer fiber revenue, ARPU was $65.61 in the quarter, up $00.66 sequentially, driven by speed mix as customers continue to take higher speeds of our fiber services. Data services revenue was $56.8 million in the third quarter, down 1.3% year-over-year, primarily driven by the loss of a large customer, combined some delayed decision making by customers and prospects. As discussed on previous calls, with respect to the fiber to the tower contracts, for full year 2022, including the effect of churn and pricing step downs, we had expected to see revenue reductions in the range of $10 million to $12 million. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $8.7 million, primarily due to higher marketing costs related to our customer fiber product expansion, coupled with the non-recurrence of certain property tax rebates in the third quarter of 2021. I think, as -- the unit economics as we rolled out the fiber plan, we were expecting kind of high-teen, low 20% IRR, again with the -- for your question with the cost of passings going up modestly, which is still really strong competitive advantage compared to anybody else that we're competing for capital for or equity holdings for."
