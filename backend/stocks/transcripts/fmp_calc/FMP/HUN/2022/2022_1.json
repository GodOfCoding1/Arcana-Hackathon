    "content": " If I were to take $2 billion and just buy in shares at our market cap today, you're kind of looking at a 25% improvement in our stock price if nothing happens on multiples or anything else over the course of the next year or 2 versus over the course of the next 8 years, investing in a facility that when it comes on stream, who knows where the markets are going to be and I just kind of look at that from my conversations with shareholders and just kind of looking at the numbers, I'd be very hard-pressed to see us actively pursue -- aggressively pursue a greenfield investment in an MDI plant."
