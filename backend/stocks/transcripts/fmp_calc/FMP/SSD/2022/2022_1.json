    "content": " Within the North America segment, net sales increased 46% to $438.7 million, primarily due to the four price increases we implemented in 2021 to offset rising raw material costs. In Europe, net sales increased 16.2% to $51.5 million, primarily due to product price increases, which were partially offset by the negative effect of $3.7 million in foreign currency translation related to Europe's currencies weakening against the United States dollar. On a segment basis, our gross margin in North America increased to 49.7% compared to 48.5%, primarily due to the continued benefit of the aforementioned price increases, which contributed to lower overhead and labor costs as a percent of sales partially offset by higher raw material costs as a percent of sales. Now turning to our first quarter costs and operating expenses, total operating expenses were $106.5 million, an increase of $12.5 million, or approximately 13.3%. Our first quarter research and development, and engineering expenses increased 8.7% to $15.9 million, primarily due to personnel and compensation related costs, including investments related to our growth initiatives. General and administrative expenses increased 10.7% to $53.8 million, primarily due to personnel, legal and professional fees not associated with the acquisition of ETANCO. In North America, income from operations increased 85.9% to $135.7 million, primarily due to higher gross profit, which was partially offset by higher operating expenses and cash profit sharing mainly for favorable operating performance. As discussed earlier, we implemented four product price increases in 2021 in an effort to offset these costs, and as a result, we estimate the cumulative top line impact from these price increases will be approximately $300 million in 2022."
