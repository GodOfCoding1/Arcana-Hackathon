    "content": " Moving to our Gathering and Processing segment on Slide 7, G&P segment adjusted EBITDA decreased $36 million compared to fourth quarter 2021, as the benefits of higher volumes were more than offset by lower natural gas liquids prices, which averaged $0.78 per gallon for the quarter as compared to $1.05 in the fourth quarter of 2021. Your line is open. Your line is open. So our face plan is we're going to have mid single digit growth in our system, have good discipline so that we get high return projects, continue to add EBITDA, and at the end of the day look for those other opportunities like you mentioned in low carbon. It's a nice way of saying we want to make sure we get good high returns that are really going to hit the bottom line every year consistently, because we've continued to grow this partnership year-after-year and obviously a big outcome of that is returning a lot of capital to our investors. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open."
