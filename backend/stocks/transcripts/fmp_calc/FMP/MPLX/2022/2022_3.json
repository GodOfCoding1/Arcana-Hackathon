    "content": " Based on the strength and continued growth of our cash flows, today MPLX announced a 10% increase in the partnership's base distribution in addition to the $315 million of unit repurchases completed through the first nine months of the year. Working with our partners, we are progressing our natural gas strategy with the expansion of the Whistler pipeline to 2.5 billion cubic feet per day, along with laterals into the Midland Basin and Corpus Christi markets, driven by increasing Permian natural gas production, interest for Whistler's additional capacity has been high, and we continue to expect it to come online in the third quarter of 2023. Quarterly records on adjusted EBITDA and DCF, year-to-date $3.7 billion of distributable cash flow and the business also continues to generate cash, both in excess of our capital and our distribution running at about $730 million year-to-date. It's certainly an avenue for us to return capital, but we want to be opportunistic as we think about that as well, which is partly too, you've seen us maybe carrying some cash on, on the balance sheet from quarter-to-quarter. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. But we're also in a position where we've got the financial flexibility to do that and look at return of capital as well across a number of different tools, right, whether it's the permanent, whether it's repurchases."
