    "date": "2022-11-11 03:09:04",
    "content": " Strong sales and margin continued to produce solid cash flow, ending the quarter with $219 million in cash, which enables us to make investments to improve our operations and pursue strategic acquisitions such as Martin Door, which we completed in October. Adjusted gross profit rose 45% to $151 million for the third quarter of 2022 compared to the third quarter of 2021. our third quarter results were driven by continued solid performance from our Western operations, operational improvements in the Southeast, improvements in scrap, improved labor efficiency and pricing actions, which outpaced material and wage inflation. Adjusted selling, general and administrative expenses increased 26% in the third quarter compared to the prior year, driven by the SG&A from our recent acquisitions, the expansion of our new South operations and increased labor and distribution costs and an increase in marketing spend."
