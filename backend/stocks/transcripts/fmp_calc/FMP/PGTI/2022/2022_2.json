    "content": " As Jeff mentioned, we were able to deliver strong growth again this quarter through increased volumes previously implemented pricing actions and process improvements, which have proven successful in offsetting rising costs in a volatile operating environment. Gross profit for the second quarter was $165.1 million, a 70% increase from the prior year quarter, reflecting increased volume and pricing, partially offset by labor and material cost headwinds. Second quarter gross margin was 40.6%, 660 basis points higher than the prior year quarter, and 310 basis points higher than the first quarter of 2022, driven by price increases, manufacturing process improvements and unit growth. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 45% in the second quarter compared to their prior year, driven by the SG&A from our recent acquisitions, the expansion of our New South operations increased distribution, cost increased marketing spend and an increase in reserve for uncollectable accounts. Adjusted EBITDA was $78.3 million, 119% higher than their prior year quarter, resulting from pricing actions to offset inflationary pressures, increase volumes and improved manufacturing performance. Initial indications for the second half of this year, based on the results thus far in July are showing continued operational improvement, increased sales and strong profitability as we navigate the ongoing inflationary environment and the impact of changes in interest rates."
