    "content": " This includes organic growth of 17%, reflecting the strength of our existing brands, while our latest acquisition, Anlin Windows & Doors, added another $32 million and closed a record quarter, performing above our internal acquisition model estimates. First quarter gross margin was 37.5%, 280 basis points higher than the prior year quarter, driven by price increases, manufacturing process improvements and continued unit growth. So, if you really look at the performance sheerly in Venice, the turnaround we've seen over the last four months is really driving a lot of that volume because again, the backlog is still there, but our lead times are down and our average sales per week is up probably almost 25%. If you look at our new construction business, it's growing, and we actually are now -- what our dealer base is telling us they've ordered product, and now they're waiting to install that product for other portions of a home that needs to be installed first, where there's trusses, which I've heard is the biggest issue in new construction right now is actually getting the trusses, block concrete, cement, all those are much more prevalent now, at least for our builders that we serve here in Florida. Any thoughts around how you think about these different initiatives resulting in organic growth rates over the next couple of years as well as, like I said, for NewSouth, -- just kind of curious as you continue to execute the new store strategy, what that might represent in terms of growth for that unit as well. I guess one last one, just to think about -- and just to think about gross margins and SG&A, you've been operating in around 25%, 26% SG&A rate and trying to push the gross margins to the high 30s over the last few years."
