    "content": " Adjusted EBITDA of $115 million, decreased 34.6% year-over-year, primarily due to lower revenues and higher loss rates compared to the prior year period, partially offset by lower costs in the current year period. Consolidated adjusted EBITDA of $115 million was down 34.6% year-over-year in the third quarter, with a 33% decrease for the Rent-A-Center business, and a 26% decrease for Acima. Adjusted EBITDA during the third quarter was $63.6 million, with an adjusted EBITDA margin of 12.6%, which decreased 130 basis points year-over-year. Moving to the Rent-A-Center segment, revenue decreased 5.4% in the third quarter compared to the prior year period, with same-store sales down 5.3%. Adjusted EBITDA margin decreased 670 basis points year-over-year to 16.2%, primarily due to lower revenue and higher loss rates, both driven by the worsening macroeconomic environment since the prior year period. For the Rent-A-Center business segment, we expect portfolio value will finish in the fourth quarter down low to single mid-single digits compared to the prior year, with modest growth in deliveries offset by higher returns, reflecting the pressure on customers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 discretionary income. Your line is open. I'd say, well, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got like 2% help going into next year when you think about - maybe 1.5 is better because it'll take a few quarters to normalize at the beginning of the year. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. I suppose pure numbers being higher than our competitors, or another way to think about - and when I say pure numbers, I'm talking about, well, for the quarter and then there's like a 10% difference in two-year stack comp against our competition. Your line is open. Your line is open."
