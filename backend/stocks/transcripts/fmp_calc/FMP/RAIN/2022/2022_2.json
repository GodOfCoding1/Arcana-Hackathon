    "content": " We are pleased to share updates today on our two ongoing clinical trials, the MANTRA Phase 3 registrational trial in patients with liposarcoma, and the MANTRA-2 tumor-agnostic basket trial in advanced solid tumor patients exhibiting MDM2 gene amplification. We continue to anticipate commencing two additional trials before year-end, both the MANTRA-3 trial in Merkel cell carcinoma, and the MANTRA-4 trial, evaluating the combination of milademetan with a checkpoint inhibitor, Roche\u00e2\u0080\u0099s atezolizumab in patients with p53 wild-type advanced solid tumors that exhibit loss of the gene CDKN2A. Rain continues to focus on the clinical execution of our milademetan program, and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re thrilled with the rate of progress thus far, particularly with enrollment now completed in our registrational Phase 3 MANTRA trial five months earlier than previously guided."
