    "content": " First and foremost, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re getting closer to the release of results from our pivotal MANTRA trial, the registrational Phase 3 study of mila in patients with specific subtypes of liposarcoma. Therefore, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll notice that after Rain\u00e2\u0080\u0099s initial indication for mila and liposarcoma tumors, which exhibit genetic uniformity, and driven by where the initial data existed at the time of licensing the program, both of our other near-term priority indications represent large market tumor-agnostic basket trials, the MDM2-amplified MANTRA-2 study and the CDKN2A loss MANTRA-4 study. And good afternoon, everyone. We expect shortly to start our second tumor-agnostic basket study, MANTRA-4, which will be a Phase 1/2 trial designed to enroll 30 patients with wild-type p53 advanced solid tumors that also exhibit loss of the CDKN2A gene. And good afternoon, everyone. And I think you said you have seen activity below 12 copy number, maybe if you could talk about which patients in the study did have activity with the lower cutoff and how we should think about the overall market size perhaps going forward with the eight cutoff. So we\u00e2\u0080\u0099d like to remind everybody that in the MANTRA trial design, patients may receive milademetan as the first-line metastatic therapy if those patients previously received an anthracycline around the time of surgery."
