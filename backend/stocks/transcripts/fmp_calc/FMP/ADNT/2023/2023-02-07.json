    "content": " And finally, given the lower volume and sales at our unconsolidated JVs, and to a lesser extent, Adient's restructured pricing agreement announced last quarter within our Keiper JV equity income was lower year-over-year by $ 3 million all in all a quarter very much in line with our internal expectations driven from the continued strong execution and performance of our global team. Important to note the re-calendarization of production in China out of the current quarter and its significant impact on equity income and to a lesser extent consolidated results in China given our favorable customer mix, we expect Adient's Q2 EBITDA to fall short of the 212 Q1 result just announced today, largely driven by the drop in equity income which is forecast at less than $10 million in Q2 versus the $27 million for the quarter just completed."
