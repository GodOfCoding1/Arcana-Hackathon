    "content": " I'm pleased to report that in the fourth quarter of 2022, TELA Bio continued to deliver strong revenue growth and sales of $11.6 million, up 39% over the prior year, and full year 2022 revenue of $41.4 million, representing 41% growth from 2021 overall. With 40% of reported OviTex cases performed robotically and 20% laparoscopically in the fourth quarter of '22, we expect these two new larger pieces will allow for even broader usage of our products going forward. As Tony mentioned earlier, revenue for the fourth quarter of 2022 increased 39% year-over-year to $11.6 million, during which OviTex revenue grew 29% year-over-year and OviTex PRS grew 72%. And to Tony's point, that we now have two additional GPOs that will be either in mostly full effect for the year or full effects of the year is going to have a great impact because the new sales reps coming in both the ones that are annualized from last year and the new ones that we hired this year, we'll have a lot of new ground to tell as far as getting new sales. And then, Tony, I think we said last quarter, three new products, and you mentioned the two larger OviTex LPR, but that's not the second-gen hernia or PRS devices."
