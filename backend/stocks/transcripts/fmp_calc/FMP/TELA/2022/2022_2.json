    "content": " On today's call, I'll describe how we plan to continue growing revenue and taking market share, update you on the progress of our sales force expansion, discuss the signing of the Premier contract and what that means for our business and review our latest clinical news. As I've described before, TELA's revenue and market share capture can be thought of as the product of five factors: one, the size of our sales force; two, per sales rep productivity; three, the number of products in our portfolio; four, GPO and supply chain access; and five, clinical data. Please go ahead and ask your question. So in many ways, I think, this is a clear signal that OviTex has sort of gotten beyond that niche complex opportunity, which is high priced, low volume, and now we're being viewed as a more complete provider capable of doing everything from the most simple inguinal robotically to the most complicated open ab walls, which puts us very much on a level playing field with our competitors. Please go ahead and ask your question. Please go ahead and ask your question. Please go ahead and ask your question."
