    "content": " While we are pleased to see further revenue growth, I continue to believe we haven't seen the full potential of our products as hospitals are still contending with staffing shortages, reduced operating hours, resulting in postponed surgeries and health care professionals taking longer than usual vacations during the summer after having put them off last year due to COVID. So we're seeing a couple of dynamics, something that occurred in the third quarter that we wouldn't expect to see in the fourth quarter is that a lot of physicians, and we confirm this anecdotally at a couple of our cadaver labs, a lot of physicians who had not taken vacations last year because of COVID took more extended vacations this year, two to three week vacations, which reduced procedures. And we're well-positioned as that rolling backlog slowly resolves itself to be very well situated, taking share and being in the right place at the right time with the data that we have at the natural repair product in the face of all the headwinds around plastic feels pretty good that we're in the right spot."
