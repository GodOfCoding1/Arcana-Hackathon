    "content": " In the Products segment, revenues were $306 million, a decrease from the prior year as strong performance from the anthrax franchise, NARCAN and TEMBEXA were offset by lower ACAM2000 sales, and adjusted gross margin was $190 million or 62%, both decreases over the prior year, reflecting lower sales volume and a less favorable product mix. For the full year 2023, we are guiding to the following; total revenues of $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion; Anthrax MCM sales of $260 million to $280 million; NARCAN nasal spray sales of $290 million to $310 million, taking into account our assumptions regarding impact of over-the-counter NARCAN across all customer channels; smallpox MCM sales of $235 million to $255 million; other product sales of $165 million to $185 million; CDMO services revenues of $115 million to $135 million; adjusted net loss of $30 million to $80 million; adjusted EBITDA of $75 million to $125 million and adjusted gross margin of 41% to 44%."
