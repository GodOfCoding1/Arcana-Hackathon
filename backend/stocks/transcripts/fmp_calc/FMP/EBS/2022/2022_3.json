    "content": " In prior years, the government has exercised its procurement option in Q2 or Q3, and we expected the same timing for this year, reflecting the government's failure to exercise the option to date we're adjusting our 2022 forecast for ACAM, which Rich will discuss in his remarks shortly. In the Products segment revenues were $186 million, which while down significantly from the prior year also reflect strong ex US sales of ACAM solid NARCAN deliveries and continuing contributions from our anthrax franchise. Other product sales plus C&G revenues of $167 million to $172 million, CDMO revenues of $100 million to $110 million, adjusted net loss of $100 million to $70 million; adjusted EBITDA of $0 to $30 million; gross margin of 33% to 34% and adjusted gross margin of 39% to 41%, which reflects the add-back of the $58 million onetime inventory step-up related to the TEMBEXA acquisition. Your line is open. I think as I included in my prepared remarks it's pretty obvious that ACAM2000 provides the government with a vaccine that is easy to administer with a single dose, domestically manufactured, cost-effectively stockpiles, and even by the government's recent words including the Assistant Secretary for Prepared Response, they referred to ACAM as the first line of defense to vaccinate Americans in the event of an accidental or intentional release of smallpox. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open."
