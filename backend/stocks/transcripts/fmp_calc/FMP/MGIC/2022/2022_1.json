Revenue in Israel reached $51.8 million, up 26% compared to $41.2 million in the same period last year, accounting for 34% of our growth in the first quarter. Our non-GAAP gross profit for the first quarter of 2022 was $38.9 million, up approximately 23% compared to $31.7 million in the first quarter of last year. R&D expenses, on a non-GAAP basis in the first quarter of 2022, totaled $3.2 million compared to $3 million in the same period of last year as well as in the previous quarter. Our non-GAAP net income for the first quarter increased approximately 26% to $12.9 million or $0.26 per fully diluted share compared to $10.3 million or $0.21 per fully diluted share in the same period last year. Given our current business momentum and growing pipeline and despite the expected headwind resulting mainly from the current devaluation of the new Israeli shekel and the euro versus the U.S. dollar, negatively impacting our prior annual revenue guidance by approximately $9 million or approximately 1.9% of our growth and the impact of the Jewish holiday season of Passover, which took place this year during April versus March in the prospective period last year."
