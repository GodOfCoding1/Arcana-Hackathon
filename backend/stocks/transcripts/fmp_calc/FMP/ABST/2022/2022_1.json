    "content": " Turning to the business, while we have observed the effect of the ongoing chip shortages and supply chain issues which impacted some of our partners and customers, we continue to see steady growth in activations across our cloud-hosted products and reported approximately 13 million active endpoints this quarter. Our enterprise and government business posted one of its strongest quarters, with year-over-year ARR growth of 16.9%, reflecting strength across both the Absolute and NetMotion product lines. Adjusted revenue was $49 million for Q1 Fiscal 2022, up 15% from the prior year on an as-if-combined basis for Q1 Fiscal 2021. Looking at the underlying business activity for the quarter, total ARR came in at $187.4 million in Q1, an increase of 17.1% year-over-year on an as-if-combined basis. We continue to see the gross margin profile for fiscal 2022 remaining consistent with the overall level for fiscal 2021, with a similar dynamic as our investments in sales and marketing and R&D that we expect to increase as a percentage of adjusted revenue in the second half of the year, as we've indicated previously. In closing, we also wanted to reiterate that our adjusted revenue growth rate guidance for fiscal 2022 and our other year-over-year growth metrics presented on an as-if-combined basis are calculated based on the combined company fiscal 2021 financials and does not include any adjustments for purchase accounting or GAAP-to-IFRS conversions. Not only did we continue to deliver balanced year-over-year growth of 17% in ARR, 15% in adjusted revenue and profitability with an adjusted EBITDA margin of 26%, but we did so while also accelerating the NetMotion integration."
