    "content": " Net $ retention was at 107% in Q2 versus 109% in the prior quarter, consistent solid enterprise and government NDR results were impacted marginally by education, net $ retention that came down sequentially as the pace of expansion with existing EDU customers slowed marginally from the year-ago, surge of COVID-related education buying, as I mentioned a moment ago. Overall, we're bullish on the combined business as we move forward and while the prior year Q3 fiscal 2021, was the Company's highest ARR and revenue growth rate quarters in years. Great, glad to see the progress in the quarter. And I'll pass the line, thanks. Great, glad to see the progress in the quarter. And I'll pass the line, thanks. Big part of the guidance and for our view of Q3 is what we had talked about previously, and then I just mentioned a moment ago, which is when you look back at Q3 of last year, you're really talking about the highest level of Company growth in ARR and revenue in many, many quarters, and that was awesome. So we're really barely scratched the surface on cross-selling and sharing customers and solutions between the two selling teams partially because purchases by design, I'd say mostly by design, we were running them parallel in the first half of the year, and we're just now starting to have those products touch one another, so you'll see more of that as we go forward."
