    "content": " While it was a small part of the overall SA business when we acquired NetMotion, cloud deployments are growing quickly and we expect Cloud to be a material driver of new Secure Access ARR this fiscal year, as well as an efficient delivery vehicle as our OEM partners are bringing SA online. New customer signings were a strong $4 million, up from the prior quarter's $2.8 million and down modestly from last year's $4.7 million, which included a very large deal in Secure Access and a large new education customer. The decrease in the adjusted EBITDA margin from prior quarter and prior year is a result of increased headcount from hires made throughout Q4 that are now fully loaded into the Q1 numbers, along with approximately $1 million in extra costs, approximately 200 basis points of margin associated with the company kick-off, which is in the sales and marketing line. However, given our recent growth in the enterprise space, and the increasing activity in the Secure Access product line with a higher mix of Secure Access in the coming quarters, we are leaving both of our adjusted revenue and adjusted EBITDA outlook for the full fiscal year ending June 30, 2023, unchanged."
