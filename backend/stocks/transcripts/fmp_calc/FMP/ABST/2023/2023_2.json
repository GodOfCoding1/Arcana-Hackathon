    "content": " Q2 was a solid quarter, we delivered stable growth to increase ARR to $225 million, representing a 15% increase year-over-year, driven by growth of 18% in enterprise and government, with wins across key verticals including health care, transportation and public sector. Adjusted revenue was $57.7 million for Q2 fiscal 2023, up 9% from the prior year, reported revenue in Q2 was negatively impacted by approximately $1 million attributed to a reduction in the contract length of our secure access offering. Turning to guidance, we expect continued strength in our sales pipeline and higher levels of secure access renewals result in an acceleration in both our adjusted revenue and adjusted EBITDA for the remainder of the year on a year-over-year basis and compared to our Q2 performance. As a result of these factors, we also have slightly moderated our ARR growth assumptions for the remainder of fiscal \u00e2\u0080\u009823 to reflect the macro factors we've described, and now expected to accelerate only slightly above our 15% year-over-year performance in Q2. And while our guidance doesn't call for a Rule of 40 on a revenue adjusted EBITDA basis, we believe ARR Rule of 40 is still achievable given our expectation of improved ARR growth for the remainder of the fiscal year. I don't, I guess the way I would rephrase that is with an eye on what's going on in the economy around us, we're taking a position and managing the business in a thoughtful way that says if we continue to see through the second half the contract terms on SA are looking like they did in this past quarter that we've sort of thought that through."
