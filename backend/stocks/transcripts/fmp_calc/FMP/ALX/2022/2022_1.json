During the quarter, we completed an important 49,000 square foot renewal with Microsoft in the base of 555, resulting in a significant 19.8% cash mark-to-market, as well as a new triple digit rent lease with a global private equity firm in a 7,000 foot square foot suite in the building's tower. , one thing we're seeing at Penn 1 specifically is that our existing tenants in the district are utilizing the facility to their benefit as it relates to folks coming in for short term projects from out to town, or if they're reconstructing their space in one of the buildings are coming into our co-working facility to, to park themselves there, to operate their business while they're rebuilding, we're even seeing cases where new leases were designing, where tenants want a home."
