    "content": " We define uniquely high-quality businesses through 5 very specific economic criteria: one, recurring and predictable revenue streams; two, long-term secular growth tailwinds; three, products that account for critical but small portions of larger value streams; four, significant free cash flow generation with high returns on tangible capital; and five, the potential for opportunistic consolidation. We're pleased with our first quarter performance in fire safety, though I'll reiterate how modest the first and fourth quarters typically are in this business and I'll caution investors against reading too much into annual variations in our Q1 and Q4 Fire Safety results. In conclusion and looking forward, combining our expectations for: one, increasing acres burned; two, increasing retardant use per acre; and three, our strong growth in our international markets, we expect to deliver high to mid-single-digit annual volume growth in our Fire Safety business. First quarter revenue more than doubled year-over-year, while our adjusted EBITDA loss improved from $4.6 million in the first quarter of 2021 to $3.3 million in the first quarter of 2022. And as such, as Haitham mentioned, I'll reiterate that we're encouraged by developments in the Oil Additives business and believe that we'll see upside in 2022 relative to our historical performance as well as to our expectation of roughly flat revenue and adjusted EBITDA. So I can't -- don't know that I would say it's going to be one region versus another where we're seeing general growth both in our traditional businesses around the world, Northern and Southern Hemisphere and the addition of new customers as the wildfire problem continues to grow around the world."
