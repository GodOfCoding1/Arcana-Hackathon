    "content": " Assuming the 2023 fire season is also on trend, it's reasonable to apply this mid-teens CAGR to the $141 million of adjusted EBITDA we recorded in 2021 compounded over two years to imply a 2023 consolidated adjusted EBITDA. At a very high level, this framework suggests that consolidated adjusted EBITDA of approximately $180 million is a reasonable expectation for 2023, again assuming an on-trend fire season. As discussed, fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA in our Specialty Products business came in several million dollars shy of our expectations, due primarily to inventory destocking actions resulting in plant shutdowns by our customers towards the end of the quarter. It's as simple as pick your EBITDA and then subtract the uses of cash that Chuck walked through, which are comprehensive, cash interest expense, cash taxes, CapEx and a modest increase in net working capital to the extent the fire season is on trend, they're doing no more to within that."
