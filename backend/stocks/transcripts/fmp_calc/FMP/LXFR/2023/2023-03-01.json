    "content": " Furthermore, we incurred in excess of $1 million of costs associated with the defense of a legal matter relating to the disposal of magnesium powder waste materials in 2018, which has been disclosed in our Form 10-K. We expect this higher rate of expense to continue throughout 2023 and into early 2024. Elektron sales of $64.9 million, increased 1/3 from the prior year, driven by our sustained push to pass through inflation, and a $5.4 million uplift from volume and mix, the best performance of 2022. Elektron's EBITDA expanded by 28% to $11 million, helped by incremental volume and mix and effective cost pass-through as well as foreign exchange. Gas Cylinder sales of $51.8 million rose $1.8 million or 4%, led by a $3.6 million uplift from volume and mix, also the best performance of 2022."
