    "content": " First, we delivered 14% year-over-year sales growth in the first quarter, driven by an 8% uplift from the SCI acquisition, as well as our success in passing through cost inflation. Sales in the general industrial end market increased 28.4% for the quarter, driven by strong Elektron performance, supported by action to offset rising cost inflation. First quarter sales of $97 million increased $11.8 million or 13.8% from the prior year, including $7.1 million of incremental SCI sales, which accounted for 8.3% growth in our total revenue. Quarterly revenue also benefited from $9.4 million of price, which accounted for 11% of our total sales increase and offset rising material in labor costs, as well as other supply chain disruptions. Elektron sales of $54.6 million grew 11.4% from the prior year, driven by general industrial demand and strong performance of magnesium powders using countermeasure flares."
