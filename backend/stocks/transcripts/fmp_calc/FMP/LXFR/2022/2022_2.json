    "content": " Firstly, regarding our financial performance we delivered more than 10% year-over-year sales growth in the second quarter continuing the double digit percentage gains also realized in Q1. In the defense, first response, and healthcare end markets, sales decreased by 4.8% largely due to lower replenishment orders for flameless ration heater which we attribute to lower levels of U.S. troops deployed in the field, a trend we expect to continue throughout quarter three. Elektron revenues of $63.4 million rose 20.8% from the prior year, driven by our firm efforts to pass through input cost inflation, as well as strong demand in our aerospace, automotive, and industrial end markets. And during the second quarter, we took advantage of the broader weakness in the equity markets to repurchase $2.2 million in shares, accelerating from $1.5 million in quarter one, and adding to last year's $6.4 million of repurchases."
