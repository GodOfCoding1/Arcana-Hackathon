    "content": " NIC also signed our largest ARR contract for the quarter, a new four-year arrangement with the state of New Jersey for digital motor vehicle titling solution, which we estimate will generate transaction-based revenues of approximately $5 million per year. Your line is open. Your line is open. That's pretty exciting stuff, particularly with -- when I mentioned a deal between NIC and VendEngine and something I've said internally is these are both acquisitions that we've brought on in the last year and in different parts of the business and to see that coordination already and to be able to leverage the relationships that NIC has got those deep state relationships as well as those enterprise contracts, it's pretty exciting stuff. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. I think right now, it's about 17% of their total revenues, maybe 19% outside of COVID, and I think that's trending towards maybe down in the 15% range as we're starting to grow some of these other state interactive government services revenues, payments revenues and some more products going through their systems. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. So they're really growing off of this 8% growth, we think, is really pretty impressive this quarter, given that it's off of a very strong base that was established over the last couple of years."
