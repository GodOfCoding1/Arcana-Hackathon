    "content": " In the fourth quarter, we signed 153 new payments deals worth more than $4.7 million in estimated annual recurring revenue across Tyler divisions, other than digital solutions. For the full year 2022 we signed 571 new payments deals with more than $13 million in annual recurring revenue, many of which we were able to pursue because of the new capabilities that came to us with NIC. In addition, another revenue headwind that is factored into our guidance is the shift of two of our digital solutions state enterprise agreements from the gross to the net model for payments resulting in a 10.5% million reduction in revenues, although with a positive impact on margins. In the midterm over the next five to seven years, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve talked about annual organic revenue growth in the 8% to 10% range, with consistent long term margin expansion of at least 50 to 100 basis points a year beginning in 2024 excluding the impact of merchant PCs from payments expansion. Your line is now open. As we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve talked about some of the factors that give us confidence that we do return to margin expansion in 2024, particularly around the wind down of some of the bubble costs as we exit our first data center we think that this year, actually, we sort of reached that inflection point where the impact of declines in licenses are offset by the current stream of recurring revenues from subscriptions. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. We talked about those as being a little less than 100 basis points of impact and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s to be expected, because we continue to move more customers into the public cloud and while we still operating our two data centers and so the duplicate costs expand this year, and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve talked about an expectation in the first half of 2024 that will be out of the first data centers and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll start to mitigate. Your line is now open. If you look generally across Tyler, I think for next year on a sort of an overall weighted value average, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re expecting north of 90%, 91% of deals next year to be in SaaS with a significant increase on the public safety side, still less than half on the public safety side. Your line is now open. And then I guess, Brian, from a free cash flow perspective, when you think about the lag or the delta between operating margins and free cash flow for this year, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s obviously a little bit higher than in previous years, given some of the items you mentioned around tax and expense or capitalization versus some R&D expenses. Your line is now open. And so I would expect that still going forward, the majority of the business comes to us through the gross model where we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re paying the merchant fees which is why we wanted to sort of give you the apples to apples comparison of the margin impact of a couple of 100 basis points, if all of those net ones were on the gross model, and you took the merchant fees out of the revenue side. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. Your line is now open."
