    "content": " Among the team significant accomplishments during the second quarter, Arch reduced total indebtedness by $136 million or 42%, ended the quarter in a net debt positive cash position of about $95 million, reached the targeted funding level for a recently established thermal mine reclamation fund of $130 million inclusive of the July payment and deployed more than $280 million via dividends and convertible security settlements under capital return program. As indicated, we estimate that this rail and logistical shortfall reduced our coking coal shipments by around 200,000 tons from previously communicated levels for the quarter, which as you well know had a -- had significant implications for our Q2 cash generation. The one thing in terms of the cadence to keep in mind, as I mentioned, the liquidity levels that we are targeting, call it $250 million to $300 million have sort of a base liquidity, but then as we look at what we are going to pay as a dividend next quarter, we would like to have most of that on the balance sheet at the end of this quarter as well."
