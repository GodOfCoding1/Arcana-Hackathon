    "content": " I'm pleased to report that the Arch team delivered another strong operating and financial performance in Q4 with adjusted EBITDA of $256.5 million due in large part to our core metallurgical segment that had significantly improved sales volumes, unit costs, and cash margins. We also strengthened the balance sheet, repaying more than 70% of our indebtedness, returning us to a net cash positive position less than one year after completing our Leer South growth project and increasing the balance in our industry-first thermal mine reclamation fund to the initial target level of $136 million. Finally, we relaunched our capital return program, deploying nearly $900 million over the last year, which included almost $515 million in quarterly dividends and avoiding the dilution of approximately 2.9 million shares through buybacks and the settlement of more than 90% of our convertible debt. I'll discuss the capital return activities for the year in more detail shortly, but discretionary cash flow for the fourth quarter was $116 million and consistent with the capital return formula, our Board has declared a dividend of 50% of that amount, or $3.11 per share."
