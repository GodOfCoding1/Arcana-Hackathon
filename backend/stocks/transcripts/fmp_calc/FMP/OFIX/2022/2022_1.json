    "content": " Starting with our first quarter performance, total revenue in the quarter was $106 million growing approximately 1% over 2021 on a reported basis, and 2% on a constant-currency basis. Starting with revenue, as Jon mentioned, total net sales in the quarter were $106 million, up 1% on a reported basis and 2% on a constant currency basis when compared to the first quarter of 2021. International total net sales of $24 million were up 14% in constant currency over the first quarter of 2021 as both of our business units had increased orders from stocking distributors, as well as contributions from new products. Net cash provided by operating activities was an outflow of $8 million in the quarter, down $10 million compared to an inflow of $2 million in the first quarter of last year, primarily due to the recruitment of the 2020 Medicare Advance beginning in the second quarter of 2021, and the increase of inventory to the new product launches over the prior year, the buildup of raw materials to protect our top-line, and to support their distribution."
