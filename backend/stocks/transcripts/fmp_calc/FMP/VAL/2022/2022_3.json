    "content": " Adjusted EBITDA increased to $76 million from $29 million in the second quarter and adjusted EBITDAR, which adds back one-time reactivation costs, increased to $94 million from $54 million in the second quarter. Day rates also continue to trend upwards with average day rates for benign environment jackup fixtures signed in the third quarter 2022 up nearly a $100,000 per day, with several recent fixtures above $120,000, as compared to approximately $70,000 per day in the fourth quarter2020 when active utilization was below 80%. Recently, we executed a sales agreement on 40-year old jackup VALARIS-54 for $28.5 million, which is expected to close in March 2023 upon completion of its existing contract. Revenues were $437 million compared to $413 million in the prior quarter, excluding reimbursable items, revenues increased to $415 million from 385 million, primarily due to higher utilization for floaters and higher average day rates for both the floater and jackup fleets. Floater revenues increased primarily due to the impact of reactivated rigs returning to work as VALARIS DS-4 and DS 9 started contracts early in the third quarter, following VALARIS DS-16 and DPS-1, which commenced contracts during the second quarter. Jackup revenues increased primarily due to more operating days for VALARIS Viking and 107, which experienced some idle time between contracts in the second quarter and higher average earned day rates for the fleet. Excluding reimbursable items, contract drilling expense decreased to $316 million from $334 million in the prior quarter, primarily due to cost associated with the VALARIS DS-11 contract termination and increased cost of certain claims in the second quarter, as well as lower reactivation costs, which decreased to $18 million from $24 million in the second quarter. Other income decreased to $30 million from $149 million in the prior quarter due to gain on sale assets of $135 million primarily related to the sale of jackup VALARIS 113, 114, and 36 in the prior quarter. We anticipate that contract drilling expense will be in the range of $345 million to $355 million as compared to $337 million in the third quarter, primarily due to more operating days for the floater fleet and mobilization costs for several harsh environment jackup following contract completions. Full year adjusted EBITDA is expected to be just below the lower end of our prior guidance range of $130 million to $150 million, primarily due to timing of reactivation costs for the VALARIS DS-17. Moving now to capital expenditures, third quarter CapEx was $53 million of which $23 million was maintenance CapEx and $30 million was related to enhancements and upgrades, primarily for reactivations, contract specific upgrades on reactivated rigs, and steel replacement for VALARIS 92. ARO EBITDA decreased to $17 million from $31 million in the second quarter, primarily due to an increase in out-of-service time related to the planned maintenance on certain rigs, which resulted in lower revenues and higher contract drilling expense during the third quarter. ARO's fourth quarter EBITDA is expected to increase to approximately $24 million to $26 million from $17 million in the third quarter, primarily due to higher revenues resulting from those rigs returning to work and a full quarter of revenues for VALARIS 141 following its contract startup in August. As Anton mentioned earlier, we recently executed a sales agreement for the 40-year-old jackup VALARIS 54 for $28.5 million, which is expected to close in March 2023 upon completion of its existing contract."
