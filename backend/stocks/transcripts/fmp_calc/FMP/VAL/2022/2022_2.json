    "content": " This 540 day contract with Equinor offshore Brazil has a total contract value of approximately $327 million, including an $86 million upfront payment to cover mobilization, capital upgrades and the contribution towards our reactivation costs. During the quarter, we recorded a gain on asset sales of $135 million, primarily related to the sale of jackups VALARIS 113 and 114, each of which have been stacked for more than 6 years for a combined $125 million. As mentioned on our first quarter conference call, reactivation costs for the 4 floaters reactivated to date are expected to average $40 million to $45 million per rig. However, given the improving market and lack of available supply, the economics of returning a preservation stacked rig to work are meaningfully improved as evidenced by the DS-17 contract which has a total contract value of $327 million, including $86 million prior to contract commencement to cover mobilization and capital upgrades as well as a portion of the reactivation costs. And adjusted EBITDAR, adding back onetime reactivation costs was $54 million compared to $31 million in the prior quarter. While adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter was slightly higher than our prior guidance of approximately $25 million, there were a few large one-off items that impacted our second quarter results that I will discuss shortly. Excluding reimbursable items, revenues increased to $385 million from $291 million primarily due to a $51 million fee related to the termination of the VALARIS DS-11 contract as well as higher utilization and average day rates for both the floater and jackup fleets. Excluding reimbursable items, contract drilling expense increased to $334 million from $305 million, primarily due to more operating days for the floater fleet, increased costs related to certain claims in costs associated with the VALARIS DS-11 contract termination. General and administrative expense of $19 million was in line with the prior quarter and onshore support costs which are included within contract drilling expense in the income statement, increased slightly to $30 million from $29 million. Second quarter other income included a gain on sale of assets of $135 million, primarily related to the sale of jackups VALARIS 113, 114 and 36 as well as additional proceeds received in the second quarter on the sale of a rig in a prior year compared to a $2 million gain on sale of assets related to the sale of jackup VALARIS 67 in the prior quarter. We anticipate that third quarter contract drilling expense will be in the range of $335 million to $345 million as compared to $362 million in the second quarter, including approximately $31 million of onshore support costs. Enhancements and upgrades include $8 million of reactivation costs and $38 million of contract or region-specific upgrades, including $22 million for Valaris DS-11 which was impaired following the contract termination. Contract drilling expense is anticipated to be $1.35 billion to $1.38 billion, inclusive of $105 million to $110 million of reactivation expense, approximately $20 million of which is anticipated in the second half of the year, primarily related to the reactivation of Valaris DS-17. We continue to estimate G&A expense of $80 million to $85 million which combined with $120 million to $125 million of support costs included within contract drilling expense, provides total onshore support costs of approximately $200 million to $210 million in 2022, unchanged from our prior guidance. Our 2022 adjusted EBITDA guidance is lower than our prior guidance of $160 million to $190 million, primarily due to increased costs related to certain claims, reactivation costs for Valaris DS-17 which was not contemplated in our prior guidance and delayed contract commencements, partially offset by the net impact of the Valaris DS-11 contract termination. In terms of our value drivers, our updated guidance translates to expected full year 2022 operating margin, exclusive of onshore support and G&A expense of $300 million to $320 million for the active fleet for $410 million to $430 million when adjusting for onetime reactivation costs of $105 million to $110 million. We expect that 2022 capital expenditures will be $200 million to $210 million which is lower than our prior guidance of $225 million to $250 million, primarily due to the removal of any remaining CapEx for the Valaris DS-11 2000 upgrade following the contract termination partially offset by CapEx for VALARIS DS-17 as we reactivate the rig for a contract that is expected to start in mid-2023. Capital expenditures for the second half of 2022 are expected to be $100 million to $110 million, including approximately $55 million to $60 million of maintenance CapEx and $45 million to $50 million of enhancements and upgrades. While second half 2022 CapEx is expected to be in the range of $100 million to $110 million, we anticipate receiving approximately $90 million in upfront payments from customers over the remainder of the year, related to capital reimbursements and mobilization fees. ARO EBITDA increased to $31 million in the second quarter from $22 million in the prior quarter, primarily due to an increase in utilization in the second quarter. ARO's third quarter 2022 EBITDA is expected to decrease to $16 million to $18 million, primarily due to lower revenues as a result of out-of-service days related to planned maintenance for certain rigs and higher contract drilling expense associated with this maintenance."
