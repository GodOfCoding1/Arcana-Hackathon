    "content": " In addition to our stack fleet, we have options to take delivery of newbuild drillships, VALARIS DS-13 and DS-14 by year-end 2023 for a shipyard price of approximately $119 million and $218 million, respectively. Excluding reimbursable items, revenues decreased to $413 million from $416 million, primarily due to lower utilization and lower average day rates for the harsh environment jack-up fleet but partially offset by an increase in utilization for the floater fleet. Excluding reimbursable items, contract drilling expense increased to $333 million from $316 million, primarily due to an increase in operating days for the floater fleet, which have a higher per day operating cost, as well as higher reactivation cost, which increased to $21 million from $18 million. General and administrative expense increased to $24 million from $19 million in the prior quarter, primarily due to higher personnel costs and professional fees. Onshore support costs, which are included within contract drilling expense in the income statement, increased to $33 million from $30 million primarily due to higher personnel costs. General and administrative expense is expected to increase to $25 million to $27 million from $24 million in the prior quarter, primarily due to higher professional fees and higher compensation costs. In the second half of the year, we expect EBITDA to move materially higher as the DS-17 starts its contract with Equinor in Brazil, rigs complete legacy contracts enrolled to higher day rates, utilization for our North Sea jackups improves and we execute just one special periodic survey project versus five in the first half of the year. Fourth quarter CapEx included $20 million for maintenance CapEx and $33 million for enhancements and upgrades, primarily for reactivations, contract-specific upgrades on reactivated rigs and steel replacement for the VALARIS-92. Enhancement and upgrade spend is expected to be approximately $140 million to $170 million, including approximately $80 million to $90 million of reactivation and associated contract-specific CapEx, primarily related to VALARIS DS-17. First quarter CapEx is expected to be $65 million to $75 million comprised of $25 million to $30 million for maintenance CapEx, and $40 million to $45 million for enhancements and upgrades including $25 million to $30 million of reactivation and associated contract-specific CapEx primarily related to VALARIS DS-17. ARO EBITDA increased to $29 million from $17 million in the prior quarter, primarily due to higher utilization as certain rigs returned to work following out of service days for planned maintenance. ARO's first quarter EBITDA is expected to decrease to $21 million to $23 million from $29 million in the fourth quarter, largely due to higher planned maintenance costs and higher expected bareboat charter expense in the first quarter. Our total liquidity increased by $104 million during the quarter, primarily due to positive cash flow from operations of $155 million, partially offset by CapEx of $59 million. On a full year 2022 basis, our total liquidity also increased by $104 million, primarily due to positive cash flow from operations of $128 million, which included the $55 million CARES Act refund I just mentioned; net Asset sale proceeds of $150 million, primarily from the sale of jackups VALARIS DS-13 and DS-14; and the $40 million of shareholder note receivable repaid by ARO. So when you think about your balance sheet, when you think about protecting your cash, when you think about the demand factor for these rigs being activated, you mentioned some upfront costs being borne by the customer base order magnitude of $27 million, seems like a very low percentage given still the capital risk, and the balance sheet strength that your customers have. What I will say is the contracts that are available in the market, whatever flavor they are, whether it's recouping more of the -- recouping more of that, those economics over the term of the contract with day rates north of kind of $400,000 a day and contract tenures in the three-year range, it's an attractive opportunity that generates cash under the initial contract, whichever form of contract that you're looking at."
