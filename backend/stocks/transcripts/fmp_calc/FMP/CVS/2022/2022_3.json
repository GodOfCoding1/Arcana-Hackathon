Our cash flow from operations was $9.1 billion in the third quarter and $18.1 billion year-to-date. Adjusted operating income of $1.5 billion increased 39.6% year-over-year primarily due to the impact of higher COVID costs in third quarter 2021, the COVID pricing actions we took this year and strong underlying performance, partially offset by incremental investments to support growth in the business and net realized investment portfolio losses. Adjusted operating income of $1.4 billion declined 18.9% versus prior year, driven by decreased COVID-19 diagnostic testing and vaccinations, continued pharmacy reimbursement pressure as well as increased investments in the segment's operations and capabilities."
