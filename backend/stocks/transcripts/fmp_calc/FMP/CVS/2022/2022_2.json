    "content": " In pharmacy services, revenue grew nearly 12% compared to the prior year and delivered adjusted operating income of $1.9 billion. During the second quarter, revenue of $42.8 billion increased by 11.7% year-over-year, driven by pharmacy claims growth, growth in specialty pharmacy and brand inflation, partially offset by the impact of continued client price improvements. Adjusted operating income of $1.9 billion grew 5.7% year-over-year, driven by improved purchasing economics, reflecting increased contribution from the products and services of our group purchasing organization and membership growth. Specifically, during the second quarter, revenue of $26.3 billion grew 6.3% year-over-year, reflecting increased prescription and front store volume, including increased sales of COVID over-the-counter test kits in cough, cold and flu products. Adjusted operating income of $1.9 billion declined 9.1% versus prior year, partially due to a $125 million gain from an antitrust legal settlement recognized in the second quarter of 2021, as well as lower COVID-19 vaccine volumes. This increase reflects both the second quarter performance and an improved outlook for the retail LTC segment, as well as strong second quarter underwriting results in the HCB segment, tempered by $140 million to $180 million of lower net investment income contributions over the remainder of 2022, given the uncertainty and volatility of the current capital markets. We are raising full year retail LTC guidance as follows: revenue increases to a range of $101 million to $12.7 billion, adjusted operating income guidance increases by $575 million at the midpoint to a range of $6.54 billion to $6.64 billion.
