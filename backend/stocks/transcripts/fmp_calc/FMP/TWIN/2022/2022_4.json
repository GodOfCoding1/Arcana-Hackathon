Foreign currency exchange was a net negative $5.1 million impact to sales in the fourth quarter, and negative $8.5 million for the full year. For the 12 months of fiscal \u00e2\u0080\u009922, sales finished ahead of the prior year by $24.3 million or 11.1%. Spending on marketing, engineering, and administrative costs for the fiscal \u00e2\u0080\u009822 fourth quarter increased just $600,000 or 3.5% compared to fiscal \u00e2\u0080\u009821. Including the small restructuring benefit, the operating profit for the quarter was $7.8 million, compared to an operating loss of $5 million in the prior year fourth quarter. The full year operating income of $11 million, which includes a $3.3 million gain on the sale of our Swiss facility, is $23.3 million improved from the fiscal \u00e2\u0080\u009821 operating loss of $12.3 million. Turning briefly to the balance sheet, inventory was up $12.1 million for the year, driven primarily by supply chain imbalances, although we did see a decrease of $4 million during the fourth quarter, thanks to the improved operational throughput noted."
