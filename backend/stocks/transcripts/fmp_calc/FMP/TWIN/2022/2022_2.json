    "content": " And why we had seen a trickle of spare parts orders last, I would say, the first quarter of this fiscal year and in fiscal '21, the -- that activity has clearly picked up in the last couple of months. But really in that November time frame and into early December, the increase is particularly anything related -- a lot of our -- obviously, steel, whether it's forgings, castings, parts that we outsource, steel prices went up dramatically. The question is, will it come sooner, because it's one of these things that you -- for the past, whatever, however many years, you would evaluate the cost increases coming in over your fiscal year. But that's what we're looking at is to get back to the -- certainly north of 25%, in the 26%, 28% range for the rest of the year. And Josh, it's -- some of the increases coming in, it's not -- what we've implemented is, I would say, somewhat broad-based and surcharges on everything. Well, we -- I would say, anecdotally, we have been told by several customers in different regions that they like to rebuild, let's just say, in that 25% to 30% range of their fleet. I don't want to predict it but it's certainly -- when you're coming off of several quarters of no new units going into North America, you know that this rebuild activity is signaling that they're going to be ordering new units soon for new rig construction. So if a rig is $1 million to $1.2 million and there's probably -- I'm going from a year ago, so we're going to have inflationary pressure in there."
