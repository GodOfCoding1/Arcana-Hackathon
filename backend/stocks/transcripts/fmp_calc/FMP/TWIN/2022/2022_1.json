    "content": " On the bright side, orders in the first quarter continued their elevated pace and were driven by strong aftermarket demand, demand across all product end markets, with the exception of some land-based oil and gas new units, but aftermarket rebuild parts for North American oil and gas continued at an elevated pace. Adjusting for these benefits, gross profit would have been 24.0%, still a significant year-over-year improvement, reflecting a more favorable sales mix driven by aftermarket activity in the North American oil and gas market and the positive impact of targeted cost reduction activities. So in general, I would say that it all comes down to wherever supplier it is or who's moving the product, all labor-related all seems to be getting better. I don't think it's going to - it's - at least in our supply chain, I don't think it's necessarily going to get worse it's actually starting to get better and more - at least more predictable, if that helps. So I think - so it's - if they were building new vessels, I think that would help our market even more, but a lot of what's happening and to your point, is very cost prohibitive to build a new vessel but you're seeing a lot of repowers. Although there are - there are shortages around the world, but it just seems when you're looking for employees in the U.S., it's just the landscape, it seems a little bit scarcer. But I think it's sort of critical for what your next 2 years looks like if you just get rebuild and flat line versus you could be up 10%, 15% this year and then 20% next year would be the way that would be awesome for Twin Disc."
