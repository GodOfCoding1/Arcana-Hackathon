    "content": " Excluding the impact of purchase accounting and transaction-related costs, our consolidated combined ratio increased about 6 points in the fourth quarter and about 1 point in the full year compared to the same periods in 2021. Excluding the change in ULAE and purchase accounting effects, our consolidated current accident year net loss ratio improved by almost 2 point in both the quarter and the full year. While we recognized net favorable prior accident year reserve development of $5 million and $37 million in the fourth quarter and full year, respectively, this level of favorable development was lower than the respective prior year periods, largely due to our response to the loss severity trends in our HCPL book in the quarter. Our consolidated expense ratio excluding the change in ULAE, purchase accounting impacts, transaction-related costs and onetime expenses increased about 2 points in the quarter and about 0.5 point in the full year. Excluding a 2.7 percentage point unfavorable impact from onetime expenses and purchase accounting adjustments related to the NORCAL acquisition, the full year 2012 combined ratio was relatively flat as compared to 2021. The segment accident year loss ratio for the quarter was relatively flat and the full year improved 1.4 percentage points compared to 2021, exclusive of purchase accounting and the change in ULAE. The expense ratio for the quarter was 25.6% and 25% the year, after excluding purchase accounting, various onetime items and the ULAE change, the expense ratio increased 3.4 percentage points for the quarter."
