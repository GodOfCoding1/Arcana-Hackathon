    "content": " Excluding NORCAL, our top line declined, reflecting our dedication to disciplined underwriting and our specialty P&C segment and the impact of our lower participation in Lloyd\u2019s Syndicate 1729 beginning with the 2021 underwriting year. The consolidated current accident year net loss ratio also reflected a higher ratio in our worker\u2019s compensation insurance segment driven by the continuation of intense market place competition and resulting renewal rate decreases, partially offset by the impact of favorable claims trend on our current year loss estimate. As it relates to prior accident years, we\u2019ve recognized just over $5 million of favorable development in the quarter, the majority of which came from our specialty P&C and worker\u2019s compensation insurance segment. The workers\u2019 compensation insurance segment produced income of $1 million and a combined ratio of 99% for the quarter ended March 31, 2022. The calendar year loss ratio increased slightly to 67% in 2022, reflecting a higher current accident year loss ratio, while the current accident year loss ratio increased 1 point to 72% compared to the first quarter a year ago, the ratio improved compared to our full year 2021 ratio of 74%. The decrease in the first quarter of 2022 accident year loss ratio compared to the 2021 full year reflects the impact of favorable claim trends, partially offset by renewal rate decreases driven by the competitive marketplace. The underwriting expense ratio increased in the first quarter from 31% in 2021 to 32% in 2022, largely due to higher general expenses from team member compensation, business-related travel and the early termination of a real estate lease."
