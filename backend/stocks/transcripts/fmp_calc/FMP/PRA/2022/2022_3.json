    "content": " Excluding the impact of purchase accounting and prior year transaction related costs, our consolidated combined ratio improved 1 percentage point from the third quarter of 2021 driven by improvement in our standard physician business. Excluding the change in ULAE, our consolidated current accident year net loss ratio improved by 2.5 points as compared to the third quarter of 2021. Our consolidated expense ratio, excluding the change in ULAE and transaction related costs in the prior period, was about 4 points higher than the prior year quarter, driven by the buildup of NORCAL's DPAC amortization post-acquisition and a reduction in net premiums earned compared to 2021 and certain onetime expenses. The current accident year net loss ratio for the quarter exclusive of purchase accounting and the ULAE change, improved approximately 4 percentage points driven by lower claims frequency in Standard Physician book. The Workers' Compensation Insurance segment's third quarter combined ratio decreased to 100.5% in 2022 compared to 106.3% in 2021, reflecting a lower loss ratio, partially offset by an increase in the expense ratio. Our expense ratio increased during the third quarter, largely due to higher general expenses from team member compensation and an increase in business related travel with the full return to normal business activities and events this year  I'll finish with the Segregated Portfolio Cell Reinsurance segment."
