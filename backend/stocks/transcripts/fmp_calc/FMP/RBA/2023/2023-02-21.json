    "content": " Turning to our Auctions & Marketplace Segment, A&M services revenue increased 11% and our A&M take rate or A&M service revenue as a percentage of total GTV came in at a robust 14.4% for the quarter, up approximately 70 basis points compared to the prior year period. Also for modeling purposes, we expect quarterly interest expense to be between $62 million and $66 million starting in the second quarter of 2023, subject to the expected closing of IAA, and based on an anticipated total debt amount of $3.3 billion and a blended interest rate of between 7.3% and 7.8%. And maybe the second question, with IAA's result out tonight as well, you know the combined EBITDA for 2022 looks \u00e2\u0080\u0093 like it's closer to $1 billion versus I think the $950 million in the S-4, and most of the outperformance comes from the Ritchie side. So it's more of a cautionary tale just to say, look, just don't \u00e2\u0080\u0093 you know if you're thinking of modeling, you may not want to model at that kind of level in the short-term future, because we're looking at that as a way just to say, look, let's, yes we do have great data to compete effectively, but we don't think that's something that is going to stay at that level for at least the short-term future."
