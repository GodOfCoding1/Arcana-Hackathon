    "content": " I mean, kind of the general supply environment out there is so tight and no -- not a very clear end in sight, even though we obviously know there will be an end at some point, when the supply chain catches up, that's in sharp contrast to the initiatives our teams are taking on, both on the growth initiative side, the way we're executing in order to really make the most of the environment as it is. And the other side, we're already seeing the benefit of Rouse for example, with Ritchie Bros. Marketplace-E, so just as a reminder, that is a reserved auction that we run, it's not about listing a bunch of assets, it's about those assets, transacting, and we call that transaction kill rate. And then the second thing with the marketplace, when we look at a potential partner and think about Rouse, SmartEquip and Ritchie Bros. Financial Services, they're very complementary to an auction transaction, but the unique thing that they each have is an ability to generate revenue outside of that auction transaction. And the same thing with insights and parts and services and other things that we would look to buy inside of the marketplace will have a similar characteristic, where they really complement what we do today inside of auction, but also will have an ability to generate a revenue stream outside of just Ritchie Bros. at the same time."
