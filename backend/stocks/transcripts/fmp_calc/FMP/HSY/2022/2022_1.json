    "content": " In the first quarter saw a little bit of that incremental inflation, but as we look forward, despite the hedging that we have in place, we're still going to have some incremental exposure, particularly to the commodities impacted by the events in Eastern Ukraine \u2013 or Eastern Europe, sorry. That was part of the plan to spend more in the first quarter in part to offset some of the elasticity due to price increases there, which I think we've done a good job of because that business is growing strong double-digits, but we'll see that begin to moderate as we get to the next couple of quarter. So can you just help a little bit with based on the incremental inflation you saw in the first quarter, you've widened your expectation for growth margins changed, is we're kind of looking at this kind of moving even past the fiscal year. And at the same time, we\u2019re still seeing a lot of interest in some of the at-home behaviors where people haven\u2019t totally returned to some things like restaurants and some activities, frankly, not as much because of COVID a little bit more because of some of the price pressure of inflation. Boy, I\u2019d say, my first answer to that question is the resources to sustain and grow are in supply chain building capacity to really be able to drive against the very strong demand."
