    "content": " But we're very meticulous about our power sites and the contracts we sign and we spend a lot of time making sure we have really high quality contracts that give us kind of as close to we can, as we can get to fixed rates in the utility or in the electricity business, it's really hard to get truly a fixed rate. In fact, one of the ones is gotten to the point where we've asked for, actually have one of our power providers in Jamestown, actually to give us an additional 20 megawatts of maybe uninterruptible power for this but it's going to go anywhere from that to we're talking to one extremely large potential customer that would really be kind of that anchor tenet for us similar to how Bitmain came in for us on Bitcoin that because that can really springboard us into more traditional like HPC applications, but we're getting a lot of interest and I'm feeling really good about that."
