    "content": " In GP Solutions, we raised $3 billion for Dow Fund V during the quarter and through August 1st, we've raised the subsequent $200 million to take the fund to approximately $10 billion. Now moving on to fundraising, we raised $3 billion direct lending strategies during the second quarter, of which wealth constituted $1.9 billion. Subsequent to the end of second quarter, we closed an additional $2 billion across direct lending and more broadly, we continued to expand the distribution for all of our direct lending products flow. Having already surpassed Fund V's target size by $1 billion as of August 1st and with additional capital expected to close this year, we anticipate the launch of Fund VI towards the end of 2023 with fees turning on in 2024. All of this is in line with our expectations and what I noted on our earnings call last quarter and in February, we continue to be on track with reaching our 2022 goals of $1.3 billion of revenues and an FRE margin of 60%. Permanent capital grew $9.9 billion to $95.5 billion, an 11% increase from last quarter and a 68% increase from the second quarter a year ago, driven primarily by deployment in direct lending, capital raised in Dial Fund V, as well as the addition of our real estate business when compared to a year ago. So as it relates to the $6.4 billion of AUM not yet paying fees in direct lending, it would take us less than two quarters to fully deploy this based on our average net funded deployment pace over the last 12 months. These milestones included achieving $1.3 billion of revenue this year and a 60% FRE margin, as well as milestones for 2023, which included doubling our 2021 revenues to $1.8 billion, hitting $1 billion of after-tax distributable earnings, and raising $50 billion of fee-paying AUM during 2022 and 2023 combined. Your line is open. I've talked about last quarter, if we raised, let's say, $1 billion as an example and we pay, let's assume $20 million to $25 million in placement costs for that, and that's blended across again, different wirehouse and wealth platform costs, that would over time, equate to roughly $30 million or $40 million of annual management. Your line is open. Hello, thanks very much. Your line is open. Your line is open. Great, thank you Alan. Great, thank you Alan. Your line is open. Your line is open. Hello, thanks very much.
