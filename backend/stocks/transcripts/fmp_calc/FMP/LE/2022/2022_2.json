    "content": " Additionally, we were pleased that our U.S. e-commerce business supported a 2% increase in AUR compared to last year and 16% compared to 2019 driven by lack of customer resistance to price increases taken to offset higher product costs. For the second quarter, as compared to last year, which I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll remind you, was a record-setting quarter for sales, total revenue decreased 9% to $351 million, exceeding our guidance range of $335 million to $350 million. Revenue for our third-party business continues to be very strong, increasing to $27 million or 43% compared to the second quarter last year. As previously announced, during the second quarter, the Board of Directors authorized a repurchase of up to $50 million of the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s common stock through February 2, 2024, the conclusion of our fiscal year 2023."
