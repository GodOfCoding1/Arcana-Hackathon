    "content": " For the quarter, sales grew 17% to reach $2.2 billion driven by a 10.1% comp; in-store sales grew by 36% over last year; digital sales represented 39% of total sales; restaurant-level margin was 25.2%, an increase of 70 basis points year-over-year; adjusted diluted EPS was $9.30, representing 25% growth over last year; and we opened 42 new restaurants, including 32 Chipotlanes. Our pricing power is strong and the brand is resilient, our culinary and food with integrity commitment is a key point of difference, our restaurants are staffed with terrific people despite a difficult hiring and retention environment, and our people are still getting up to speed on running a growing multimillion-dollar digital business as well as a growing multimillion-dollar in-restaurant business. And then what we're talking about is, obviously, a lot of the people that have joined our company over the last two years, they really haven't experienced the front line and what it means to grow that in-restaurant business, while also growing the digital business."
