    "content": " This trial has the potential to significantly broaden the future application of MAP's sirolimus across many different tumor types, including about 12,000 new advanced cancer patients on an annual basis in the U.S. alone. As mentioned on our first quarter earnings call, we did see a significant bolus of patients in the first weeks after product availability some of which carried over into the second quarter as many patients successfully continued on FYARRO therapy. In the second quarter, we've continued to see good progress in our ongoing in PRECISION 1 tumor agnostic trial as a number of open sites increases along with access to patients both in cancer centers of excellence as well as in the community setting."
