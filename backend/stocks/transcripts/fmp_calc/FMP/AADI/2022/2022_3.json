    "content": " Going forward from January 1, Brendan will assume leadership of the company as we continue to gain momentum in the commercialization of FYARRO and PECOma, advance our registration-directed PRECISION 1 trial and prepare for the potential commercialization of FYARRO patients with TSC1 and to inactivating alterations which is one of the larger targeted oncology indications. This allows us to further extend our cash into 2025, not only getting us through the continued commercialization of FYARRO and PEComa and the completion of the PRECISION 1 trial but also enabling us to continue to evaluate strategies for broadening FYARRO indications beyond PEComa and TSC1 and 2 in activating alterations. In the third quarter, we've continued to see good progress in our ongoing PRECISION 1 to our agnostic trial as the number of open sites increased along with access to patients, both in cancer centers of excellence as well as in the community setting. While we've achieved many corporate milestones, our focus continues to remain on the patients we serve and we're encouraged by the impact FYARRO is having on people's lives and look forward to furthering its potential benefit to patients in need."
