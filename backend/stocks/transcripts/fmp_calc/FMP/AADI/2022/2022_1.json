    "content": " It is an exciting time at Aadi Bioscience, and I'm thrilled to share results today from Aadi's first partial quarter as a commercial stage company as well as early insights regarding the launch of FYARRO in PEComa. Taken together, this series of focused activities should augment enrollment into the PRECISION 1 trial by targeting both academic and community-based oncology practices and by rapidly identifying appropriate patients with TSC1 or TSC2 alterations, who may benefit from trial participation and expediting their enrollment into this study. Indeed, as reported in the Journal of Clinical Oncology, a high percentage of patients with a known inactivating TSC1 or TSC2 alteration that is 9 of 14 or 64% and in the AMPECT registrational study of patients with advanced malignant PEComa achieved a partial response or a complete response with impressive durability. Looking forward, I'm confident we are well positioned to continue to execute successfully, both on our FYARRO commercial launch, building on the momentum of our first partial quarter that we reported today, and on the R&D side, our continued execution of our PRECISION 1 tumor-agnostic trial. Brendan, would you like to take that, please? Brendan, would you like to take that, please?"
