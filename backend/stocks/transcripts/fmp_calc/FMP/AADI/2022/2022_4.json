Next will be our Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Loretta Itri, who will provide insights on our clinical developments and plans for 2023. Before we get started, a quick reminder that statements made on the call today will include forward-looking statements. Actual events or results could differ materially from those expressed or implied by any forward-looking statements as a result of various risks, uncertainties and other factors, including those set forth in the Risk Factors section of our annual and quarterly reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission which can be found at www.sec.gov or on our website at www.aadibio.com. In addition, any forward-looking statements made on this call represent our views only as of today, March 28, 2023 and should not be relied upon as representing our views as of any subsequent date. As we said before, this past year was a transformational one for Aadi. The top line accomplishments of 2022 began early in the year with the successful commercial launch of our first product, FYARRO for the treatment of advanced malignant PEComa, a rare form of sarcoma with no prior standard treatment. Upon launch, FYARRO was added to the NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines as the only preferred treatment regimen for malignant PEComa, and we received a permanent J code for FYARRO soon after, facilitating payer coverage and reimbursement. This launch was closely followed by the initiation of our Phase 2 registration-directed trial PRECISION 1, a study in patients with solid tumors that have TSC1 or TSC2 inactivating alterations in the mTOR pathway. As we progressed on both the commercial and clinical fronts, we announced the completion of a pipe financing of $72.5 million, extending our runway into 2025 and supporting our ongoing operations and further expansion of our initiatives. Beyond these advancements, we are pleased with the continued adoption of FYARRO for patients with PEComa. We achieved $5.2 million in sales for the fourth quarter, which represents growth of 23% over Q3. We are encouraged by the acceptance in the market of FYARRO as a leading treatment option and at the end of the year, we had more than 120 unique ordering accounts, up 34% from the prior quarter with a reorder rate of more than 85%, underscoring the positive clinical experience conveyed by healthcare providers who are increasingly viewing FYARRO as the standard of care for their PEComa patients. He brings a rich history of success in clinical development and operational expertise to the role, currently serving as the Chief Medical Officer of Avenzo Therapeutics following his role as CMO at Turning Point Therapeutics acquired by BMS last year. We are enthusiastic about what has to come in 2023 heading into another year of solid execution, thanks in no small part to our team here at Aadi whose hard work is what made our achievements possible and this continued dedication is what will drive our progress in the future. The continuing commitment of our team and our maturing partnerships with the leading next generation sequencing companies, have played a strategic role in affording access to patients. This has been an important factor in enabling us to routinely identify eligible patients, particularly in community-based practices. We appreciate our partnerships with U.S. Oncology, Tempus and Foundation Medicine as we work to identify patients who qualify for the trial. As presented at the recent Society for Gynecologic Oncology Annual Meeting just a few days ago in Tampa, Florida, a sub-analysis of the data from our pivotal AMPECT trial revealed excellent activity for nab-sirolimus in patients presenting with malignant uterine PEComa. Our clinical team has been hard at work building relationships in the GYN oncology community, interacting with clinicians in the field to consider the options made available by nab-sirolimus in treating these patients. As we have previously mentioned, we continue to evaluate additional indications for nab-sirolimus beyond sarcoma and TSC1 or TSC2 inactivating alterations, either as a single agent or in combination. We are also progressing well in our clinical collaboration with Mirati as we evaluate the combination of adagrasib and nab-sirolimus in KRAS G12C mutants, non-small cell lung cancer and other solid tumors. As you may recall, we presented preclinical data on the combination of KRAS inhibitors and nab-sirolimus last fall at the AACR-NCI-EORTC meeting that lays the foundation for our partnership on this combination strategy to treat non-small cell lung cancer and other solid tumors with a KRAS G12C mutation. We had a solid fourth quarter and end a year of strong performance with approximately $172.6 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, including proceeds from the completion of our $72.5 million financing last fall. Turning to our financial results, FYARRO net product sales amounted to $5.2 million for the fourth quarter and $15.2 million for 2022. As is typical at the end of the year, there was some inventory billed at the specialty distributors in the quarter, and we expect this will normalize in the first quarter. For the year, R&D expense amounted to $32.7 million as compared to $19.7 million last year. Selling, general and administrative expenses for the fourth quarter were $11.1 million compared to $9.7 million in the same period in 2021. For more information on our financial performance for 2022, a detailed discussion of the results reported on this call will be provided in our 10-K to be filed later today. As you've heard today, 2022 was a transformational year for us, one that will set the foundation for the advancements that lie ahead in 2023. I would say what we've seen, and I think we've mentioned this before, is early on in the launch of FYARRO in PEComa, we were seeing patients, we were kind of meeting patients where they were in their treatment plan in progress with therapy. And what we've seen after being on the market and physicians being more comfortable and knowing more about the drug as we've moved, we're moving closer to first line, and as we do that, we expect that that's going to have a positive impact on duration. So I'd say we're probably still a ways away from guidance, but certainly very happy with the progress that we're seeing. So as far as the -- a meaningful and what we've said is it will not be single digits, so it'll be patients in the double digits. So from a reimbursement perspective, which I think is your first question Ahu, so what we're seeing from a lives covered perspective is that we're north of 85% of commercial lives covered at this point. My question was, how many patients re-prescribed or how many physicians re-prescribed FYARRO. The best measure we have is really the number of ordering institutions which you can loosely correlate to patients, and that's a launch to date number. And my second question is on the SGO presentation on the relevance of TSC1 and TSC2 alterations in endometrial cancers, could you maybe elaborate more on the relevance, like the maybe percentage of patients who are, who had the TSC1 and TSC2 alterations in endometrial cancers? Okay, so I'm going to do is, I'm going to turn that first part of your question on the SGO data over to Loretta. So off the top of my head, I can't recall the incidence rates of TSC1 and TSC2 mutations. It is -- of the different tumor types it's one of the higher, I would say, in the range of 3% to 4% of endometrial cancers expressed TSC1 and TSC2 alterations. But as you may be aware, there was literature to suggest that PEComa's that occurred in patients with endometrial cancer had a relatively unfavorable response. So I think we have shown rather definitively or at least in the best collection of patients of this type, that the effect of FYARRO in PEComas occurring in endometrial cancer is quite good. The -- like Loretta said, we don't have enough information at this point on the sort of copy number high versus low in the relative TSC1 and TSC2 incidents, but that is an area we continue to look. And if you would recall, we did have endometrial cancer patients and this was not PEComa, but endometrial cancer patients on the EAP data that we had disclosed in ASCO 2021. And at least one of them, I mean, it was a small number, but at least one of them after many lines of therapy had responded and done very well and went on for a long period of time when we did the cutoff for the ASCO data, which was I believe over six months. We as I believe I may have mentioned in my prepared remarks, we are very aware and our sites report that they are having continued problems relative to staffing related to the COVID pandemic. However, we have been able to continue accruing patients onto the trial as we planned. At this time we haven't really spoken about the timing of data from that, but as Scott mentioned and Loretta mentioned, the timing of the initiation of the trial is in Q2 at this point and that's the information we have from Mirati. It is a Phase 1 trial where, because it's a combination the dose needs to be worked out and so I think we can understand that that takes the usual amount of time for figuring out a combination. So I don't think we expect any results this year, but it's possible we might get something next year. As you can see, we're very excited about 2023 and looking forward to sharing more information later in the year."
