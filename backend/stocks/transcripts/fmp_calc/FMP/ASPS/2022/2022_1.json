    "content": " Beginning in the first quarter of 2022, Moody's Analytics forecast that REO acquisitions will begin to grow, reaching a high in the fourth quarter of 2025 that is more than 70% higher than the first quarter of 2019, a quarter in which Hubzu generated $32 million of revenue. If Hubzu's revenue maintains its strong correlation to Moody's forecasted REO acquisitions, Hubzu's revenue growth would grow from $8 million in the first quarter of this year to over $50 million per quarter when fourth quarter 2025 REO acquisitions become sales. But when it comes back during the first quarter, I think of 2020, we generated -- Michelle, correct me if I'm wrong, something like $28 million, $32 million of revenue in Hubzu alone . With that, you still expect your $8 million a quarter in Hubzu to actually start ramping by the end of the year or... As I talked about in the prepared remarks, Raj, when your inventory is actually declining, your revenue outperforms sort of the inventory decline."
