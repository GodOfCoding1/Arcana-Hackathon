    "content": " As we look to 2023, we anticipate revenue growth, margin expansion and positive adjusted EBITDA, driven by a continuing recovery of the default market, sales pipeline growth and wins, a lower cost base and scale. This slide is similar to the one that we shared with you last quarter and illustrates that in a normal pre-pandemic default market, Altisource could generate $42 million of adjusted EBITDA and $247 million of service revenue with upside from sales wins and a deteriorating economic environment. Good mortgage rates and cost of living remain high or unemployment increase, we would expect foreclosure starts, foreclosure sales and REO volumes to exceed 2019 pre-pandemic levels and support further growth for our servicer and real estate segment. Based upon our progress we are making with our late 2021 and early 2022 product launches, converting sales wins to revenue and 2022 and early 2023 cost reductions, we anticipate sequential revenue growth in the first quarter and both sequential and year-over-year revenue and adjusted EBITDA growth for the year. In our servicer and real estate business, we anticipate revenue and adjusted EBITDA growth from market tailwinds, sales pipeline and wins and scale."
