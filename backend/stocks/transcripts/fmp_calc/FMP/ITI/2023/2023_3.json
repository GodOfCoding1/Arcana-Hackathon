    "content": " For the fiscal 2023 third quarter, Iteris reported record total revenue of $40.7 million, representing a 27% increase year-over-year. In the fiscal 2023 third quarter, product revenue increased 44% and year-over-year to a record $22.9 million, demonstrating continued market share gains. Fiscal 2023 third quarter total service revenue was $17.8 million, representing a 10.5% increase year-over-year. Notable new customer agreements include a combined $1.8 million in orders to extend our managed services activities for the Virginia Department of Transportation, a $1.3 million subscription agreement for clear data from the Utah Department of Transportation, a $1.3 million task order for the second phase of a project to develop and support a smart county plan for the San Bernardino County Transportation Authority, $1 million task order from the Florida Department of Transportation District 7 for arterial performance monitoring and management activities, $1 million combined -- a series of awards worth a combined $1 million for a subscription agreement for ClearGuide, including ClearGuide SPM from various agencies in the US and Canada and a clear data subscription for a non-disclosed value from a confidential commercial customer. Demand for our products and services continues to be strong as evidenced by a record backlog of $112.2 million, which was up 22% over the prior year third quarter. Adjusting for the net increase in component costs of approximately $2.4 million quarter-over-quarter, the gross margins would have been 35% or up 30 basis points compared to the same prior year quarter. Our service revenues increased 10.5% to $17.8 million compared to $16.1 million in the prior year quarter, primarily driven by stronger software and managed services revenue. With the expectation that fourth quarter parts purchased in the broker market will continue to decrease, this will further improve our working capital, and we would expect our ending cash balance this fiscal year to be in the range of $12 million to $14 million, as the profitability improves -- continues to improve and improve -- and our circuit board redesigns continue to progress. Lastly, we spent $134,000 in purchases of property and equipment in the third quarter, and we still expect the full year CapEx to be less than 1% of revenues, reflecting our asset-light business model. Given these dynamics for the fiscal 2023 fourth quarter, we anticipate revenue to increase approximately 18% year-over-year, EBITDA margins to improve more than 900 basis points on a sequential basis and net cash flow to be in the range of $1.5 million to $3.5 million."
