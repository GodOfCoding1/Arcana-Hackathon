    "content": " Record net sales of $56.1 million grew by more than 30% over Q2 of last year, led by an increase of nearly 70% in direct-to-consumer or DTC sales. While we will make up some of it, versus the original budget, we have reduced our full year net sales guidance to a revised range of between $235 million and $242 million, with the remaining projected net sales for the second half of 2020 expected to be weighted more towards the fourth quarter than the third quarter. During the second quarter, we continued the quarterly cadence of strong topline growth with net sales growing 30.7% to $56.1 million, up $13.2 million from the same period last year. Subscription sales continued to strengthen during the second quarter, growing 74.3% over the second quarter of 2021 to $9.7 million. Our non-subscription DTC sales also continue to grow during the quarter, increasing $7.7 million or 67.3% year-over-year to $19.2 million. In terms of our B2B business, sales during the second quarter were $27.2 million, an increase of 5.1% or $1.3 million over the same period last year. While we continue to see growth among our existing B2B and professional customers, the Russia-Ukraine conflict continues to impact a historically significant customers' business within that region, which we believe has adversely impacted our business by as much as $6.9 million during the second quarter of 2022. Our SG&A expenses during the second quarter of 2022 grew $6.2 million or 50% to $18.5 million, representing 33% of net sales. Adjusted to exclude the impact of depreciation and stock-based compensation, SG&A expenses during the second quarter of 2022 increased $3.5 million or 29.7% and to $15.3 million for the quarter, representing 27.2% of net sales. Comparatively, SG&A, excluding depreciation and stock-based compensation for the second quarter of 2021 was $11.8 million or 27.4% of net sales. We also incurred $1 million of incremental costs during the second quarter of 2022, which we consider public company in nature, including higher insurance premiums related to D&O coverage, professional and legal fees, board costs, and audit-related fees. As expected, during the second quarter, marketing expenses were $17.3 million or $12.2 million higher than the same period last year, driven primarily by our planned investment in marketing as we launched our healthy aging campaign. Adjusting for the $10.2 million investment in marketing during the second quarter of 2022, marketing was 12% of net sales compared to 11.8% for the second quarter 2021. Research and development expenses were $1.7 million during the second quarter, up from $1.1 million during the prior year as we continue to advance the development of our pipeline and strategic initiatives and new products, such as our Collagen line, Gut Health Kit, OneDraw device and our new Daily Greens Plus product, which launched in July. Adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter of 2022, excluding special items, was a loss of $1.4 million, a decrease of $7.2 million compared to the $5.7 million reported during the prior year. Looking at year-to-date results for the first six months of 2022 Net sales increased $23.4 million or 26.7% and to $110.7 million, led by an $18.3 million or 50.1% increase in our DTC sales, of which $7 million was attributable to the continued growth and our DTC subscription sales. During the first six months of 2022, SG&A expenses grew $12.6 million or 53.3% to $36.1 million or 32.6% of net sales. Adjusted to exclude the impact of depreciation and stock-based compensation, SG&A expenses during the first six months of 2022 increased $8.8 million or 40% to $30.8 million or 27.8% of net sales. Comparatively, SG&A, excluding depreciation and stock-based compensation for the first six months of 2021, was $22 million or 25.2% of net sales. Marketing expense during the first six months of 2022 increased $13.7 million or 147.7%, driven primarily by the $10.2 million investment into our 12-week healthy aging campaign, aimed at increasing brand awareness and driving new customer acquisition, which ran the majority of the second quarter of 2022. Excluding the $10.2 million of incremental advertising spend and stock-based compensation, marketing costs during the first six months of 2022 was 11.1% of net sales, 50 basis points or 4.7% higher than the first six months of 2021. Operationally, during the first six months of 2022, we used $7 million of cash in our operating activities, primarily driven by marketing and advertising spend and growing our inventory, including raw materials by $11.2 million to support our continued growth new product launches and protect our supply chain."
