    "content": " Today, I'll discuss our full year and fourth quarter 2022 results, update you on the progress we've made against core growth strategies shared during the IPO process, provide our outlook for 2023, including financial targets for the year, I will also share a few comments related to our longer term positioning, including the expansion of our vertical operations with the new world-class facility that will add new capabilities and bring capacity online to fuel efficient long-term growth. On the top line, we delivered another record quarter with sales of $63 million, growing 27.7% over the fourth quarter of 2021, which was our strongest quarter last year. We believe a number of factors helped maintain our sales growth trajectory despite increasing inflationary trends that continue through year-end, including first our best of breed science backed offerings that support health and performance are inherently more resilient in maintaining wallet share than many other discretionary items, especially as awareness of the benefits of a healthy lifestyle and consumerization of healthcare is accelerating on a global scale. In addition, our guidance for adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS includes the following assumptions: marketing costs of between 14% and 15% of net sales, appreciation of approximately 2.5% of net sales, interest expense to be approximately 1% of sales, and estimate full year adjusted tax rate of 27% and diluted weighted average shares outstanding of 54 million as of December 31, 2023."
