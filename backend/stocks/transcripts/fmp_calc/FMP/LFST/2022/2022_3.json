    "content": " This was driven by lower-than-expected revenue and higher-than-expected employee health benefit costs that impacted center margin in the quarter by $1.3 million, or 70 basis points. Adjusted EBITDA grew 44% year-over-year to $15 million, or 7.1% of revenue, up 90 basis points, driven by center margin growth, combined with generating leverage in G&A. Fourth quarter center margin and adjusted EBITDA are below prior expectations due to lower revenue as well as the higher-than-expected costs associated with our employee health benefits representing $3.3 million of impact to adjusted EBITDA or 170 basis points, of which $2.6 million will impact center margin, or 135 basis points. While we are seeing early indications of improvement in utilization driven by the top, middle and bottom funnel actions I spoke about on our last call, those gains were offset by a decrease in capacity from clinicians as they continue to take elevated levels of time off in the third quarter versus prior periods. First, at the top of the funnel, in terms of attracting new patients, we did 4 things: one, built out our boots on the ground primary care referral team; two, made enhancements to organic search traffic; three, focused on improving internal referrals between our clinicians; and four, began conversations with enterprise referral partners about potential multistate collaborations. So as far as the fourth quarter goes around the holidays, so we plan for the number of what we refer to as adjusted business days -- basically, the number of days that clinicians are working and how those days look in terms of how many visits they're seeing on those days, to mirror what we saw last year in the fourth quarter."
