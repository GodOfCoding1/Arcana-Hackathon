    "content": " We now expect 2022 revenue and Center Margin toward the bottom end of our previously guided range of $865 million to $885 million and $240 million to $255 million, respectively, due to removing slightly more than one business day from each June, July, and August as a result of the incremental clinician time off with no other changes to our guidance assumptions. We've now rolled out OBIE, our online booking and intake experience platform to nine states through the end of the second quarter and have seen a substantial improvement in cancellation rates of online bookings in those markets, driven in part by better patient and clinician matching. First, at the top of the funnel, we are adding to our boots on the ground primary care referral team through a redeployment of planned investments towards this initiative as well as focusing on enhancing our internal referrals between our clinicians to ensure patients have access to the full suite of specialist at LifeStance. In terms of growth, the Company delivered solid growth in the second quarter with revenue of $210 million, up 31% year-over-year, driven by growth in our clinician base. We are not right now going to our clinicians and asking them to give us more time, but focus very narrowly on ensuring the time they've already given us is filled to the fix capacity, which ensures that they are happy with their workload, they continue to maintain flexibility, and we're able to drive both their incomes to the levels that they're hoping to achieve as well as drive revenue for the Company."
