    "content": " We believe that the EMU volumes largely returned to 2021 levels in March, as the impact from Omicron subsided, but the reduced number of patients coming through the EMUs in the first half of Q1 will limit the number of patients implanted with the RNS System in the second quarter. Given what we saw in the first quarter of 2022, we believe that we remain on track for our 2022 revenue guidance of $45 million to $48 million, as well as meeting our 2022 target of approximately 10% growth in centers implanting our RNS System. Your line is open. And overall, the backlog of patients that we're hearing from our customers at the epilepsy monitoring units has continued to grow, and we're anticipating that those numbers of patients coming through will continue to increase through the course of the year, providing an opportunity for us to be able to grow the business in addition through \u2013 in addition to the efforts that we're doing on the commercial side. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open."
