    "content": " Initial implant revenue in the second quarter of 2022 was $8 million, compared to $9.2 million in the prior year period. We believe as we continue to build traction, a higher percentage of patients coming through the EMUs are being treated with RNS therapy, and that we will benefit in future quarters from increasing EMU volumes of those patients work through the diagnostic process. In summary, we continue to believe there is a meaningful and growing backlog of epilepsy patients who have been just, who have deferred treatment since the start of the pandemic, have seen another COVID spike we expect the number of patients going through the EMU diagnostic process to incrementally improve but the operating environment continues to normalize in the second half of 2022. We experienced a decrease in initial implant procedures in the second quarter, primarily due to the reduced number of patients going through the EMU diagnostic process in the first half of the year. As Mike mentioned previously, we expect operating expenses for the core RNS business will be roughly flat sequentially in the third and fourth quarters given the steps we are taking to focus on our highest priority efforts and reduced expenses in the second half of 2022."
