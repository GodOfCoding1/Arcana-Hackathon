    "content": " Starting with our fourth quarter performance, total revenue for the fourth quarter was $12.8 million, representing growth of 16% compared to the prior year period and 15% compared to the third quarter of 2022. This was primarily driven by increased adoption of our RNS System, evidenced by strong initial implant revenue of $9.8 million, representing growth of 15% compared to the prior year period and 7% sequentially. As expected, in the fourth quarter, replacement revenue was $1.4 million, which represents a decline of 44% compared to the prior year period. NeuroPace's revenue for the fourth quarter of 2022 was $12.8 million, representing growth of 16% compared to $11 million for the fourth quarter of 2021 and 15% sequentially compared to $11.2 million in the third quarter of 2022. Gross margin for 2023 is expected to be between 69% and 71%, potentially a slight improvement from the 69% generated in the fourth quarter, which was our first full quarter with DIXI Medical revenue contribution. Your line is now open. And the early -- I'm going to call them more anecdotes than broad spread evidence, but the early anecdotes are consistent with that hypothesis where we're able to get better insight into what is happening in the flow of patients through the epilepsy centers, how many patients are coming through the Phase 2 studies that lead to therapies like the RNS system implant, and then being able to use that to provide more sales opportunity -- selling opportunities to be able to get a higher percentage of those patients moving on to the RNS System. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. Your line is now open."
