Any forward-looking statements included in this earnings call are made only as of the date of this call. At this time, I will touch briefly on our published financial results then turn it over to Dr. Young to provide an update on our drug development activities, which will be followed by Q&A. During the three months ended March 31, 2022, we spent cash on our clinical trials and in our operations of $1.8 million. For the three months ended March 31, 2022, we reported a net loss of $3.2 million or $0.20 a share, compared to a net loss of $2.1 million or $0.14 a share for the same period of 2021. Our net cash used in operating activities during the three months ended March 31, 2022 was $1.8 million, compared to $2.2 million for the same period in 2021. While we experienced increased GAAP costs related to our clinical trials and operations, we continued to make use of equity incentives to reduce our cash outflow in compensating our executive team and certain other employees, and were able to utilize some of our prepaid expenses this quarter in our clinical trials. During the three months ended March 31, 2022, we incurred research and development expenses totaling $2 million, compared to $1.5 million for the same period in 2021. During the three months ended March 31, 2022, our G&A expenses totaled $1.2 million, compared to $700,000 for the same period last year. Today, I plan to highlight what we\u2019ve accomplished in the first quarter of 2022 in our drug development programs and share what you should be expecting over the next nine months. Let\u2019s go to our first slide, Slide 3. Processa is a drug development company, focused on improving the quality of life and/or survival of patients who have an unmet medical need condition. This means that Processa is giving each of our investors, which includes the Processa staff five independent opportunities or shots on goal to have a blockbuster drug. More importantly, we are simultaneously developing all five drugs at various stages, but all are now going through our development process. To remind everyone, Slide 4 describes the criteria that we have used to select the five drugs in our pipeline. We have next generation capecitabine, which we are rebranding of what we previously called 6422. We have moved closer to obtaining key data to assist us in our discussions with the FDA, the design of our pivotal trials and our NDA submission. For next generation capecitabine, which we previously defined as 6422 program, we have amended the Phase 1B protocol to better understand the de novo formation of DPD associated with next generation capecitabine and began enrolling patients in the amended protocol. For 499, we\u2019ve expanded our outreach to identify potential ulcerative NL patients in order to complete enrollment for our interim and final analysis in a more timely manner. For 12852, we\u2019ve enrolled five patients for our gastroparesis trial so far. And for 3117, we began developing assays to determine if we could identify potential biomarkers that would predict response to 3117 versus gemcitabine. As we have previously stated, the market for next generation capecitabine in colorectal cancer is about $1 billion market. From our Phase 1b trial to-date, we have seen a decrease in the non-cancer killing metabolites that caused dose limiting side effects and we have seen an increase in the potency for 24 to 48 hours. The amended protocol determines, one, the PCS6422 regimens that will inhibit metabolism and increased potency for all seven days of chemotherapy, and two maximum tolerated dose for next generation capecitabine. This slide summarize what we\u2019ve accomplished in the first quarter of 2022 and what to expect from Processa over the next nine months, the next generation capecitabine. One, we\u2019ve amended the Phase 1b protocol, we will be defining the PCS6422 regimens that will inhibit the formation of the non-cancer killing metabolites that cause dose limiting side effects and increase the potency of cancer killing metabolites during all seven days of next generation capecitabine chemotherapy. Two, we\u2019ve already begun enrolling patients in the amended protocol. Well, in mid-2022, we should have identified a dosage regimen for PCS6422 and completed our initial evaluation of using an individualized personalized treatment approach for next generation capecitabine. By the end of the year, we hope to preliminarily identify the maximum tolerated dose of next generation capecitabine and the dosage regimen to be used in our Phase 2b or Phase 3 trial. As you may recall, this is a $1 billion rare disease market in which natural healing of the open ulcers during the first one to two years after onset occurs in probably less than 5% of ulcerative NL patients. There are no FDA approved treatments and no standard of care, because all off-label treatments have limited efficacy given their dose limiting safety profile. PTX works in closing the ulcers of some patients, but side effects limit the dose that can be administered. Although, COVID has had a major impact on our enrollment, we have expanded our remedial patient identification enrollment efforts in Q1, such that we have one patient in screening now, one patient in pre-screening and five patients have been identified that require a pre-screening evaluation to determine if they meet the basic requirements prior to moving into the screening procedure. Well, in mid-2022, we expect to have enrolled five to 10 patients in the Phase 2b trial to be used in our interim analysis. At the end of the year, we hope to have the top line data from the interim analysis reading out, and we hope to have completed enrollment for the trial. Other 5-HT4 agonist, and the only drug approved to treat gastroparesis metoclopramide has serious dose limiting side effects with black box warnings and limited use. Because of the higher potency and greater selectivity for the 5-HT4 receptor, PCS12852 in preclinical and clinical studies requires a much, much lower dose of PCS12852 and has less side effects than these other drugs. We expect a complete enrollment of the study in the September, October timeframe with top line readout of the change in gastric empty rate by the end of the year. This is a drug similar to gemcitabine, a cancer drug, which maximum sales of approximately $1 billion and used for a number of cancers as first or second line therapy. In Q1, we began developing assays for specific biological molecules that we will be evaluating as potential biomarkers for PCS3117. Thus, giving us away to select patients to be treated with PCS3117 preferentially over gemcitabine. We expect to have developed our roadmaps for the development of PCS3117 for a number of different cancers and targeted populations, such that we can meet with the FDA at the end of this year to discuss the next clinical study for PCS3117. In conclusion, you can see that we have successfully moved next generation capecitabine, PCS499 and PCS12852 forward, even with COVID having a serious effect on enrollment for PCS499. And lastly, we expect that our interactions and collaboration with the FDA will provide us with more insight into which development path for each drug has the highest probability of demonstrating an FDA approvable benefit risk profile. Your line is live. So if you\u2019re talking about timeframe, shorter in terms of timeframe, there are the subpopulations, for example, third line therapy pancreatic cancer, first line  there are, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re evaluating. That\u2019s the roadmaps we\u2019re developing for each different type of cancer and we\u2019ll evaluate the time it takes the cost and everything, and then develop a plan and go to FDA regarding PCS3117, hopefully, work something out so that we can take the program that would be most likely to get approved in the shortest time, not just the shortest time, just also the most likely to get approved. Wanted to ask also about next gen capecitabine, if we\u2019re expecting some interim data by mid this year. I can tell you what we will be looking at, and again, I don\u2019t know results yet, but I can tell you what we\u2019ll be looking at. We\u2019ll be looking at to see if the potency across the all day \u2013 all the dosing days of next generation capecitabine, if the potency has increased for capecitabine. The second thing we\u2019ll be looking at, and this is not in any order. The second thing we\u2019ll be looking at is to look at the metabolism to those non-cancer killing cell metabolites that are dose limit \u2013 cause dose limiting, because they\u2019re side effects. What we expect to see is we expect to see a pattern, which we\u2019ll be able to predict what regimen will result in high potency, low side effect metabolites. And if I may ask a third question, wanted to see if you could give us an update on PCS499 and if the efforts that you\u2019ve made towards increasing enrollment have proven fruitful. So they had a choice, go out and see their physician on a regular basis for the study and be exposed to COVID, which they\u2019ve been living with us also for years. And have they\u2019ve been vine or stay home, wait till the COVID got less COVID issues and then go out. The second thing is we expanded some of our efforts, as I said, we \u2013 in the \u2013 when I gave a talk, the remedial \u2013 we\u2019ve done some remedial things like contact more patients, contact other physicians, contact groups, et cetera. We\u2019re only starting to see now the patients starting to come in, patients starting to contact us saying, I think I have an ulcer. And of course, now we\u2019re going through a pre-screen to make sure it is an ulcer versus an erosion. And I think that\u2019s really helped, we have a better process in place to identify potential patients and then get them through the pre-screening and then into the study. Your line is live. I don\u2019t know the number off the top of my head, but it\u2019s a small percentage at pass. So patients would call in, and say, okay, I have NL, I\u2019ve been told I have NL and I wanted to be in the study. And then they would come in and we\u2019d say, well, you don\u2019t have an ulcer. That\u2019s why at the end of the third quarter, we put in this pre-screening procedure where we could actually take a picture of their ulcer \u2013 of their \u2013 what they think is an ulcer. And with that in place, we\u2019ve been able to weed out those patients who really don\u2019t have ulcers. So it\u2019s kind of hard for me to say, what the percentage is, because we changed the process in the middle to take better patients into this actual screening process. So 12852 we\u2019ve had \u2013 I mean, we\u2019ve had five patients already. We\u2019ve had a lot of patients come in and a lot of those patients all most everyone has got the paresis, it\u2019s some fail because of other reasons, because they had other comorbidities. How much again, I think 499 will be hurt more of 12852 will hurt be hurt less because there\u2019s so many gastroparesis patients. But I think if COVID comes back a little heavy, then we\u2019re going to be delayed a little bit. So we\u2019re planning to meet with the FDA end of the year, sometime in December. In terms of the assays, let me reword how we\u2019re looking at this. So we don\u2019t know if they\u2019re \u2013 we call them biomarkers because they\u2019re potentially biomarkers, but they\u2019re just macromolecules that will be measuring and then seeing if they can be used as biomarkers. So I\u2019ve got to be careful because some people when I say biomarkers, they think it\u2019s already been identified as a biomarker and that\u2019s not true. Your line is live. We\u2019ve been involved with rare drugs, super rare drugs, ultra rare drugs before. We still have to prove safety and an efficacy statistically, but they previously with other drugs for us and other people. Hopefully, it is a low response and if it\u2019s a low response, then close to zero response it is, the smaller number \u2013 the smaller sample size. We just don\u2019t know yet, and we won\u2019t know that until the interim and the final analysis but because it\u2019s blinded. Hopefully, you can understand that where we\u2019re coming from in this and that we think there will be some very key milestones coming out and being reported in the next few months, as well as through the end of the year. We really see some multiple near-term milestones that will have a major, major impact on these programs both now, but also guide us better into what we should be doing for the Phase 3 programs."
