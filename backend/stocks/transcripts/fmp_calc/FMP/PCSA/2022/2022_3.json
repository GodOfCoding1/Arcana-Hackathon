    "content": " For 12852, the proof-of-concept Phase 2A trial in gastroparesis patients has been completed with the results showing that the change in gastric emptying rate after 28 days of treatment on 0.5 milligrams of 12852 was statistically better than placebo treatment at a p-value less than 0.1. Our press release this morning announced that upon completing our proof-of-concept Phase 2A trial in gastroparesis patients with only six to nine patients in each treatment group, the trial showed that for six patients receiving 0.5 milligrams for 12852 compared to eight patients receiving placebo, the gastric emptying rate was significantly different at a p-value less than 0.1. Remember, however, given this is a proof-of-concept study with only six to nine patients per group, we are only looking for a strong trend in symptom efficacy in order to guide us in the Phase 2B 12-week efficacy/safety trial that we plan to initiate in 2023. At least from the tox data that we've seen and the other data we've seen in healthy volunteers and constipation patients who've actually received up to 5 milligrams of the drugs, the safety data says 0.5 milligrams and 1.0 milligrams are equally safe, not really much difference, but we could go higher."
