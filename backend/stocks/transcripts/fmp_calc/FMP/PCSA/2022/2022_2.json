    "content": " During the 6 months ended June 30, 2022, we spend cash for our 3 clinical trials and in our operations totaling $4.1 million. As I noted, our net loss for the 6 months ended June 30, 2022 was $8.4 million or $0.53 per share, compared to a net loss of $5.3 million, or $0.35 per share for the same period of 2021. For the 6 months ended June 30, 2022, we incurred $5.2 million in research and development costs, an increase of $2.1 million when compared to the same period of 2021. Our net cash used in operating activities for the 6 months ended June 30, 2022 decreased by $300,000 to $4.1 million compared to $4.4 million for the same period in 2021. 1 of the 3 drugs in clinical trial Next Generation Capecitabine or 6422 has been delayed, because we had to jump through a number of FDA and clinical site regulatory hoops actively modify the protocol based in our first interim analysis. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d like to remind you that we have 3 drugs in clinical development, 6422 or Next Generation Capecitabine, 499, and 12852; and one drug 3117 with an IND, but we will not be initiating the clinical study until we have completed our development plan and met with the FDA to agree on a program. Secondly, with the study for each of the 3 drugs, reading out over the next 12 months, starting with 12852, then 6422, and finally 499, and the anticipated positive news flow, we believe the value of Processa will increase."
