    "content": " As David mentioned, full year 2022 adjusted net income was $209.7 million or $5.02 per share and fourth quarter adjusted net income was $49.4 million or $1.20 per share. We've got good demand and good pipeline but I expect, based on what we know today, Brady, that we'll probably start out with a mid-single digit here in the first quarter and then accelerate a little bit, a little bit, emphasis on little, in that 6%, 7%, maybe 8% range. And as we've said over and over again and I don't want to say it had nausea and maybe we do but the markets we're in should give us some insulation, right, even if it's a pretty difficult overall economic slowdown, we still expect our loans will grow and it just becomes a magnitude of how much. But I think when you get to the back half of this year, Brady, those are the kind of numbers come third quarter, fourth quarter, we should be able to generate given our base economic assumptions of what's going to happen this year. Thanks for the question, Michael. Our expectation heading into the first quarter is that as the Fed hits the terminal rate, we'll see the deposit cost pressures abate and we'll be able to, especially as the curve points a little bit further down in both the brokered and the FHLB arenas, we'll be able to selectively take some different tenors of deposit there. Thanks for the question, Michael."
