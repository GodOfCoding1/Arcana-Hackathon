    "content": " In Q4 2021 through the first 6 months of this year ended June 30, 2022, we recorded $385 million of fire-related costs including approximately $95 million of inventory write-downs. Revenue declined 45% primarily reflecting supply chain constraints as well as marketing inefficiencies due to cost inflation that caused Zulily to reduce marketing spend, which affected customer acquisition and retention. Adjusted OIBDA declined $27 million primarily due to sales deleverage, which was partially offset by reduced marketing spend and higher product margins driven by pricing actions and higher mix of its factory direct business. For the three months ended June 30, 2022, we generated $107 million of positive free cash flow, which benefited from a second payment of $100 million in insurance recovery related to Rocky Mount fire. Regarding the lease -- sale leaseback transaction that David mentioned, we completed the transaction related to Ontario, California fulfillment center in Q2 and received aggregate consideration of $340 million, the composition of which is detailed in our earnings release issued today, and we also have a slide deck posted at our website. Our leverage ratio is defined by the QVC revolving credit facility, was 2.3x as of June 30, providing ample cushion to the relative -- and relative to the 4.5 maximum net leverage covenant in our credit facility and was further improved by the aforementioned $443 million of debt repayment completed after quarter end."
