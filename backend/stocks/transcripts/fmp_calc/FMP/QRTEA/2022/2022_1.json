    "content": " Zulily revenue declined 38%, and continue to experience top line pressure primarily due to supply chain challenges and reduced marketing efficiency attributable to cost inflation and privacy changes in our advertising partners. Overall customer counts declined in comparison to the strong growth we experienced in 2021, reflecting the impacts of supply chain disruptions, lower product availability and the Rocky Mount fire and macro factors that David had already discussed. Gross margin declined 170 basis points, primarily due to lower product margin and the deleverage and fulfillment costs, which was partially offset by lower inventory obsolescence. Revenue of $232 million declined 38%, primarily reflecting supply chain constraints, as well as marketing inefficiencies that were caused by cost inflation and privacy changes, which caused Zulily to reduce marketing spend, affecting its customer acquisition and retention. Adjusted OIBDA declined $24 million, primarily due to sales deleverage, partially offset by reduced marketing spend and higher product margins, driven by pricing actions and a higher mix from its factory direct business."
