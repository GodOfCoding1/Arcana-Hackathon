    "content": " As we laid out in the 2022 Investor Day, our free cash flow in 2022, was burdened by several discrete items, including approximately $150 million to $200 million in working capital headwinds from payables catching up to prior year inventory purchases. Adjusted OIBDA declined $26 million, primarily due to lower project -- product margins, higher marketing expenses, and deleverage of fixed costs.
