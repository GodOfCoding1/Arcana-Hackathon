Your line is open. Your line is open. You asked a little bit of \u00e2\u0080\u0093 you hinted at Eastern rail providers, and in both Eastern railroads, Norfolk Southern and CSX are also performing better than they have in 2022 and we're confident in their plans and continue to see really significant opportunities in that part of our network to grow highway share conversion back to intermodal as this year goes on. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Certainly, there's a handful of markets out there where I think truck spot prices may be applying some pressure at the customer level around their mix of highway and intermodal and we'll watch that and we'll try to adapt and we'll talk to our rail providers and look for ways to take cost out of our systems so that we can be competitive, but at the same time, we're going to be disciplined about our returns and our margin profiles and everything about our business that has been the case forever at J.B. Hunt. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Those are our three priorities, but before I turn it over to John, I want to make sure that I say, we are so proud of that over 37,000 employees that have delivered really over the last three years, but even in the fourth quarter, a little bit of noise there, but I'll tell you the effort that our people have made through 2022, our customers notice, our customers trust us, and every day we work very hard to be their trusted provider."
