Looking out for the remainder of the year, we're not going to put a specific forecast on valuations, but have been carefully monitoring the portfolio of companies and feel reasonably good about where they stand right now in terms of cash on hand and ability to continue to move forward and grow their businesses in this environment. So the impact we're talking about, that I specifically called out was in our markets business in leasing, where we had higher level of volumes and larger average deal sizes in the second quarter, as compared to a year ago in that quarter."
