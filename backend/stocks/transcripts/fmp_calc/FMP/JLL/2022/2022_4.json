    "content": " The full year adjusted EBITDA margin declined 370 basis points to 15.0%, with fee revenue growth more than offset by approximately 190 basis points from lower equity earnings, 140 basis points from higher travel, entertainment and marketing expenses, 80 basis points from incremental investment in our people and platform, and 30 basis points from our changes to commission structures within Capital Markets. The Markets Advisory fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA margin declined 230 basis points from a year ago to 17.4%, primarily due to lower leasing fee revenue investments and talent to match growth in our business over the past year and incremental T&E and marketing expenses. Despite full year fee revenue growth of 8% within Markets Advisory, the adjusted EBITDA margin declined 110 basis points to 16.0% on the same factors impacting the movement in the quarter as well as investments in our technology platform. The fourth quarter Capital Markets adjusted EBITDA margin contracted 440 basis points from a year ago to 19.3% on lower fee revenue, higher commission expense from the change in our compensation mix to more commissions from cash bonus, higher T&E expense, an increase in our multifamily loan reserve, and incremental investment in headcount to drive future growth over the past several quarters."
