    "content": " On today's call, Vic Grizzle, our CEO; and Brian MacNeal, our CFO, will discuss Armstrong World Industries' second quarter 2022 results and rest-of-year outlook, along with some notable progress on our growth initiatives. Although negatively impacting the EBITDA margin was the increase in SG&A expenses which was driven by investments in selling expense to support company-wide growth initiatives, in addition to increased incentive comp expense, the decrease in WAVE equity earnings was driven by higher steel cost inflation, partially offset by favorable price. And just given the inflationary impacts that you're seeing, given the steady, I guess, volume growth, you got the price increase in July, I'm just kind of curious, I know you don't provide quarterly guidance per se but if you could help frame the slope of the EBITDA recovery in the second half of the year to get to the midpoint of your guidance, that would be helpful. But as you step back and look at kind of first half, second half, it's clearly getting that price over inflation and then the volume piece where we don't see the headwind in the second pier from a shipment standpoint from the inventory destock that happened through the first four months of this year."
