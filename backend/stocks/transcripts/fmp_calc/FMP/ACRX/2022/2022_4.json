    "content": " In addition to the 15% royalty on net commercial sales and the $116.5 million in sales-based milestones in our agreement with Alora, we're able to leverage our invested time and resources working with the Department of Defense, the single largest customer for DSUVIA through a 75% royalty on DoD net sales. The study results show that the inherent risks of the currently used products, Heparin, which has used 43% of the time in patients and Citrate, which is used in 28% of patients lead physicians cannot use anticoagulants, which again, is below the international standard of care, and the remaining 29% of patients are undergoing CRRT. We expect our cash operating expenses in 2023 to range from $16 million to $20 million, which include costs related to a planned launch of Niyad under an EUA, initiating the single registrational study for Niyad and the PDUFA fee for Fed Sera for which an NDA submission is expected in the second quarter of this year. And part of -- just to give you an example of the quantitative market research we just completed that started, I think, in the fourth quarter last year with results in the first quarter this year to continue to show the FDA the elevated use of CRRT in the hospitals from a post-COVID standpoint, pre and post, if you really want to consider it post right now."
