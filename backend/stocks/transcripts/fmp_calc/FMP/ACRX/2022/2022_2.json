    "content": " We're pleased to report another quarter of commercial unit sales volume growth for DSUVIA, the fifth consecutive quarter since focusing our commercial efforts on procedural suites and specifically on specialty settings such as plastic and cosmetic surgery, ENT and oral maxillofacial surgery. Two years after achieving Milestone C approval, a key gateway to having DSUVIA approved for use across all the U.S. Army SKOs, we believe we're finally making good progress in DSUVIA's broader adoption within the U.S. Army."
