    "content": " And while we're eager to concentrate resources on our pipeline, we've made very good progress focusing our commercial efforts for DSUVIA into procedural suites over the last three quarters. Year-to-date, we've had a number of publications about DSUVIA specifically for its use in plastic and cosmetic surgery, providing further real world evidence of the many benefits both to patients and the overall healthcare system that can be experienced when administering DSUVIA and the procedural suites setting, as well as other settings. So we're maintaining primarily a virtual sales team today, which is more efficient cost structure and has been very responsive to communications and educations for DSUVIA, but it's not enough and that not enough factor is the point where we believe for our shareholders for DSUVIA for the education of health care practitioners, it has to come with a larger effort, an effort that we can't do well while we're also concentrating on the recently acquired late-stage development pipeline. So from a prestigious suite standpoint, that's the movement all procedurals -- painful procedurals are really sort of moving in that direction and we believe DSUVIA is just the perfect opportunity to create a non-invasive analgesic that can really address the unmet need in that market."
