    "content": " As previously disclosed, we're in active discussions with larger, more resourced commercial organizations to potentially partner DSUVIA to build upon our success and maximize DSUVIA's value. While they're not typically as large as the Army or with the potential of the Army, it's nice to see the additional branches starting to utilize or inquiry for DSUVIA based off of their addition or membership of the Joint Deployment Formulary because of DSUVIA's availability to all military branches. We're excited about the progress made with our pipeline of assets, the efficiency and our cost structure, the strategic direction for DSUVIA as well as the multiple catalysts \u00e2\u0080\u0093 potential catalysts over the next year, and we will remain focused on driving long term shareholder value."
