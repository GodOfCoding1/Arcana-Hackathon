    "content": " Our net revenues for the third quarter totalled $45.1 million, a decrease of $21.7 million or 32.5% compared to 66.8% -- compared to $66.8 million reported in the third quarter of last year. Earnings before income taxes for the third quarter totalled $3.6 million, a decrease of $2.2 million or 37.9% compared to $5.8 million reported in the third quarter of fiscal 2021. Net earnings totalled $2.6 million compared to $4.3 million, a decrease of $1.7 million or 39.5% from the third quarter last year. While our third quarter revenues are down significantly from the third quarter of last year, they are up over pre-COVID levels, primarily due to our increased publishing division sales and the impact of our UBAM division's increased consultant count. Our UBAM sales declined 35% to $41.4 million in the third quarter of fiscal '22, primarily due to the anomaly that last year was. While we didn't expect to increase sales 80%, 50% or maybe even 10% to 15% this year, last third quarter was a disaster as far as inventory levels. I did notice what you said, too, about the 6.7% versus the 5.5%, but that sort of brings me to the question, if you look at the fiscal year-to-date for the sales from 2 years ago versus this year for the first 9 months, it looks like it was up about 28% from 2 years ago for the first 3 quarters added up."
