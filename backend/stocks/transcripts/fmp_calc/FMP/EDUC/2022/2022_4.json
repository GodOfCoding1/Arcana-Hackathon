    "content": " So for some fiscal year 2022 highlights, our net revenues for fiscal year 2020 totaled $142.2 million, a decrease of $62.4 million or 30.5% compared to $204.6 million reported for fiscal 2021. Our UBAM sales declined 35% to $17.6 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal '22, primarily due to the anomalies of last year was with the pandemic. Now you've heard me say this in the last couple of calls that I just want to make sure everyone is clear and understands the inventory levels that we're seeing now was from inventory that was purchased in February, March to April of fiscal -- the first quarter of fiscal 2022. First, I will make a complaint, which has nothing to do with the earnings, but has to do with the fact that if you're going to report at the end of the day, the ensuing conference call should be either the end of that day or the beginning of the next day, it should not be 24 hours after you report, it would have been theoretically just for these report, today after the close and have the conference call at 4:30, this is especially so as you're going to report news which might be unsettling to the market. If we're going to compare the increase in sales, we'll bring that up 20% to $36 million relative to the sales we had in the last year. So that going forward, assuming sales are flat, I understand it would be nice for them to grow, but if sales are flat or we're going to free up is this, I call it $15 million to $17.5 million will split the difference of inventory. And one thing that I'm just thinking, I know you can't project the next fiscal year, the sales or the profitability, but if you're working right now for the next 2 to 3 quarters, like you said, through inventory, the cost less then what you're going to have to buy for in the future."
