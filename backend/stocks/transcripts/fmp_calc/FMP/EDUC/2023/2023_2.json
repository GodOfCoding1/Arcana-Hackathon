    "content": " Turning to the second quarter, net revenues were $19.4 million, a decrease of $13.6 million or 41.2%, as compared to $33 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2022, or a decrease of 16.4%, as compared to $23.2 million during the first quarter. Our loss before income taxes was $1.1 million, a decrease of $3.8 million or 140.7%, compared to $2.7 million in the second quarter last year. Net loss totaled $0.5 million, compared to $5.3 million for the first half last year, a decrease of $5.8 million or 109.4%. Lastly, as Craig mentioned in his previous comments, the strategic decision we have made to temporarily postpone our quarterly dividend currently improves our quarterly cash flows by approximately $1 million per quarter. I don't have the crystal ball to tell you how much or it's going to drop our inventory from $67 million by the end of the quarter or by the end of the fiscal year, but it will be dropping."
