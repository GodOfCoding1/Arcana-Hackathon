    "content": " Looking at our unconsolidated investments in total, residential and business data customers grew by approximately 9,100 customers or 2.2% on a sequential basis from quarter one of 2022. Before I begin, I'd like to remind everyone that our second quarter 2022 results do not include operations contributed to Clearwave Fiber at the beginning of this year and the results for the second quarter of 2021 included just two months of Hargray operations and did not yet include CableAmerica operations. Starting now with revenue, total revenues for the second quarter of 2022 were $429.1 million, compared to $401.7 million in the second quarter of 2021, 60.8% increase. Operating expenses were $118.4 million or 27.6% of revenues in the second quarter of 2022, compared to $112.4 million or 28% of revenues in the comparable quarter of the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA was $227.5 million for the second quarter, an increase of 6.7% when compared to 2021. Capital expenditures totaled $107.3 million for the second quarter of 2022, which equates to 47.2% of adjusted EBITDA. While we estimate this initiative reduced video revenues by approximately $1.7 million in the second quarter of 2022, more importantly, it has helped prepare our network for the next-generation of high speed data enhancements."
