    "content": " Given our exceptional track record of strong financial results and solid customer growth, we hope you\u2019ve come to know the Cable One as the team that delivers quarter in and quarter out, building upon our history of long-term consistent performance. During the first quarter, we saw the first signs of this with Cable One\u2019s capital spending as a percent of adjusted EBITDA declining from 48.8% during the fourth quarter of 2021 to 43.9% in Q1 2022, even with a large upfront modem spend. I think, as we move forward, clearly, the HSD ARPU impact will \u2013 there\u2019s really none of that in the first quarter because of the timing of the way some of the unlimited rolls-off for those customers, we really got no ARPU lift tied to that particular move in the first quarter. So I would say a lot of it, as we\u2019ve mentioned on previous calls about the competitive mindset and digging deeper and understanding every market, just even in the time I\u2019ve been here, if you look at the data we get on the competitive footprint today compared to what it was then, it\u2019s unbelievably different and way more focused and down to the really small communities and even within the communities down into the neighborhoods and a better understanding on all of that."
