    "content": " Earlier this year, we laid out four priorities that we are focused on; enhancing our customer acquisition notions for both new and existing customers with a common theme of driving digital engagement; enhancing our user experience, our marketing, sales, manufacturing, supply, and product teams working together to improve the customer's journey from beginning to end; building out and optimizing our supplier, network and marketplace; and lastly, securing additional capital. As we look at the first half of the year performance, our team's been proud of nearly 50% year-on-year growth and significant progress and serving our customers and building out our cloud manufacturing platform, building out a new modern infrastructure for designing, making and moving things to better meet the needs of our time. And so in that sense, it really has accelerated the pace of digital engagement with a supply base, and I think it's accelerating the pace of work for our customers, as well as easing the experience of our suppliers of plugging into the cloud platform and making parts with us."
