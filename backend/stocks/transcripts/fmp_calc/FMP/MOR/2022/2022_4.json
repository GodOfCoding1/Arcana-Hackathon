    "content": " Our solid cash position enables us to not only reach the pivotal data milestone for the Phase 3 study of pelabresib, which has anticipated in early 2024, but to also provide a cash runway of at least 12 months before the pivotal data readout. With pelabresib, we have a tremendous opportunity to improve the standard-of-care for patients with first-line myelofibrosis, and we expect the top line data from our Phase 3 study in less than a year from now. We have the MANIFEST study, particular Arm 3, that's investigating pelabresib in combination with ruxolitinib in that naive patient population of myelofibrosis, where of course, we showed data at ASH last year with a very good screen response rates of 68% at week 24, which I guess is a quite competitive parameter if you compare that to some of the other drugs available in that space."
