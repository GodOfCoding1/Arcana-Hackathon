    "content": " We entered a clinical trial collaboration with Pfizer and Incyte to investigate the immunotherapeutic combination of Pfizer's TTI-622, a novel fusion protein targeting the CD47 pathway; and tafasitamab plus lenalidomide in patients with relapsed or refractory DLBCL who are not eligible for autologous stem cell transplantation. And on your questions on the second-line patient start, I mean, the market share, we've communicated in the past that we're basically capturing between 1 out of 3 to 2 out of 3 new patients in second line."
