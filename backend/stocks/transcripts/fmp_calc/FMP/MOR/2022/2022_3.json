    "content": " As indicated in the previous quarter, additional treatment options now available for patients with relapsed or refractory DLBCL led to a sequential decline of Monjuvi sales in the third quarter, and an updated financial guidance for the full year. It's a highly heterogeneous patient population, and we're quite pleased with the fact that despite the degree of prior therapies, patients are responding to the therapy, making comparisons regarding safety between this agent and other agents, I think, is a bit premature, very premature, and we continue to investigate the agent and find the optimal setting for its use -- potential use in clinical trials and clinical practice later on."
