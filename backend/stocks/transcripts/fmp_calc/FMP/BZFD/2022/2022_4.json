    "content": " Turning to the ongoing shift to short-form vertical video, A year ago, at our first earnings call, I discussed the implications of the rapid rise of short-form vertical video on our business, namely as we shift focus to building large, highly engaged audiences around our short form media content across the platform. As we continue to grow our creator network and run production of short-form vertical video, we expect to scale creator-led advertising and branded content solutions like this for our clients. Performance by business is as follows: Advertising revenues declined 27% year-over-year to $50.5 million which was primarily the result of the ongoing price on question on our owned and operated properties, driven by the broader macro environment as well as sustained declines in time spent on Facebook. So, as it relates to Q1 2023 revenue and each of the segments, we are seeing a continuation of the Q4 question, especially as we anticipate a higher level of activity from clients in the back half of 2022, as they lost budgets for the start of 2023 of certain verticals such as CPG, retail and tech platform have also been impacted by the market softness, compounded by the challenges from the integration of the sales team."
