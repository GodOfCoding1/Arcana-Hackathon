We see multiple opportunities for long-term growth, including continuing to adapt our original and creator-led IP to new formats and platforms to extend our leadership position among young audiences, scaling our emerging businesses by leveraging our reach first-party data and cross-platform insights to help our partners address challenges in areas like e-commerce and long-form content development. On a year-over-year basis, revenues grew 15% to $103.7 million as our category-leading brands continue to attract new and existing clients even in a constrained digital advertising environment, with performance by business as follows. Advertising revenues were flat year-over-year at $50.4 million compared to $50.2 million in the third quarter of 2021, as growth on our owned and operated properties offset declines on third-party platforms. Content revenues grew 45% year-over-year to $38.4 million, decelerating versus Q2 as expected as macro constraints on ad budgets drove lower demand for branded content in certain verticals relative to prior quarters. U.S. time spent as reported by Comscore, which does not include TikTok or Reels, declined 32% year-over-year to 151 million hours in the third quarter, driven by declining Facebook traffic, a short-form vertical video format continues to gain audience share. In terms of year-over-year trends in Q4, we expect content revenues to be most impacted by this trend relative to advertising revenues with less client spend being allocated to the production of original branded content access that require a longer lead time to deliver relative to traditional display and pre-roll advertising."
