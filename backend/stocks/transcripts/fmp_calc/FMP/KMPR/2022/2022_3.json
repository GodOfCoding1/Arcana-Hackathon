Your line is now open. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. Yes, I think what you're seeing in that overall impact column is that the written impact of the rate it's working in, so I'm not sure I would read the 13.7 to the 14.6 as being 1 point and that's driving. When you're thinking about the rate side to written, there is about how it  into the book or what has essentially been priced against it, right, and this is telling you when you think about like the percentage of the book that had these pricing elements against it, this is telling you that that's at the 40.6 component, right, that's working its way in there. So what you could take away from this is that if we believe in the rate adequate in all states, other than California now, that we are also planning on taking 5% rate on roughly 14% of our book, because that is in our rate indications and we are conservatively and thoughtfully saying we want to make sure we're ahead of this not behind this. I think what you're trying to get -- what's more important to get is that when we're going into those states, we're still looking for about a 5% rate increase, not a 1%, a 5%."
