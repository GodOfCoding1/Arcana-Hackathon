    "year": 2022,
    "date": "2022-06-30 14:35:16",
    "content": " At that time, the individual companies will be named Reunion Neuroscience Inc., a drug discovery business which will continue to focus on the research and development of novel psychedelic molecules such as FT-104 and Field Trip Health and Wellness, which will house the clinics and technology business and will continue to focus on developing proprietary, competitive and differentiated psychedelic assisted therapies through innovation and therapeutic protocols. Concurrent with closing of the spin-out transaction, Field Trip Health and Wellness is expected to complete a series of private placement financings for gross proceeds of $20 million led by Oasis Management Company and Field Trip. On a year-over-year basis, total operating costs in the fourth quarter were $14.3 million, up from $7.7 million in the same comparative period and reflects our investments in growing and scaling both our clinics and drug development businesses. Our fourth quarter R&D costs were $2.3 million, an increase of 153% over the prior year, primarily due to ramping up of development costs as we work to further progress the development of the active ingredient FT-104 as you just heard from Joseph. Now turning next to the balance sheet, Field Trip at year end had unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of $64 million following our $9.8 million capital infusion into the standalone clinics business on a pro forma basis upon closing the cash position for Reunion. On the Field Trip Health & Wellness side, upon the close of transaction, the clinics business will have $20 million in gross proceeds to fund the operations on ongoing basis."
