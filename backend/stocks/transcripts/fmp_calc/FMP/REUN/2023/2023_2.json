    "content": " We also recognized CAD1.9 million and CAD7.6 million in noncash charges for the three and six months ended September 30, 2022, in recognition of our financial guarantee of certain lease obligations associated with entities that were part of the spinout of clinical operations and the company's equity share of loss and impairment of its investment in Field Trip Health & Wellness, respectively. I would only highlight that I think that a lot of the hesitancy, let's say, in the past, and that was probably 20 years ago was the fact that the drugs weren't being developed ethically by pharma companies and speaking to the FDA and getting their feedback and using that feedback appropriately. So again, I think this is -- it's a wonderful opportunity to ask the Safety Review Committee to move forward with a fifth cohort, maybe do a sixth cohort, and really assure ourselves that we're on the right path, and we're giving patients the right dose when we go to really see an effect in postpartum depression."
