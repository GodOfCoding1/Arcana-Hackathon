    "content": " Now with that kind of margin structure by line of business, we do believe, with the kind of efficiencies that we have seen on the customer acquisition expense side which I've just talked about, we do expect that while there might be small increases in the overall kind of marketing and promotional spend, it is unlikely to kind of go beyond, say, the 7-odd percent kind of percentage point of gross bookings level compared to the 9 to 10 percentage points of gross booking that it used to be pre-pandemic and therefore, that kind of gives us confidence that we kind of should kind of remain on a profitable path."
