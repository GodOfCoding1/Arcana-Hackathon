    "content": " The third quarter of 2022 benefited from approximately $10 million in incremental alternative fuel tax credit revenue when compared to last year, and we also recorded approximately $8.8 million in accelerated depreciation expense related to the removal of equipment at select pilot locations that we talked about on our last call. Having said this, and looking at our adjusted EBITDA, we reported $24.1 million of adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter of 2022, which also benefited from the incremental alternative fuel tax credit during the quarter. A year-ago third quarter adjusted EBITDA was $13.4 million, which had one quarter of alternative fuel tax credit revenue. Year-to-date, our GAAP loss is $46.4 million and adjusted EBITDA is $37.4 million and we are guiding to approximately $58 million of a GAAP loss for the year and approximately $60 million of adjusted EBITDA for the year, which implies the fourth quarter needs cooperation from credit prices and fuel margins among others."
