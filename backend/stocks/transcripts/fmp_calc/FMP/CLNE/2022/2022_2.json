    "content": " Fuel volumes of 107 million gallons were up year-over-year, more than 5% compared to the second quarter of 2021 and revenues came in at over $97 million. On a non-GAAP basis, our loss for the second quarter ending June 30, 2022, was $848,000 versus a non-GAAP income of $1.8 million a year ago but last year included the $5.2 million of alternative fuel tax credit income. Our RNG volumes were 50 million gallons in the second quarter of 2022, representing a 17% increase from a year ago and up 26% from the first quarter of 2022. And as we've noted, that we're in the process of securing a modest level of debt at the corporate level with the idea that as our RNG projects come online toward the end of this year, we will put -- more financing will be supported at the project level going forward. And I think that when you look at the -- all of the information that's recent on this, the draft scoping, this recent comments from the governor, the workshops -- CARB has recognized that it's working and that the -- it's likely that they're going to increase the compliance curves. -- like another 1.5 years or whatever until new carb targets kick in, if we see a broader market increase in the ultra-low dairy perhaps at a level or a rate that was quicker than you thought, that could be margin positive to you even as LCFS remains a little challenged for a year or two."
