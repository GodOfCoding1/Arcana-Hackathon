    "content": " Within our Engineered Solution segment, which includes our Fluid Power, Flow Control, and Automation offerings, organic sales growth accelerated 300 basis points from last quarter, increasing over 21% year-over-year, despite a meaningful prior year comp of 19% growth. Within our Engineered Solution segment, sales increased 22.5% over the prior year quarter, with acquisitions contributed 140 basis points of growth. Segment sales growth continues to be supported by strong backlog levels across our Fluid Power division, sustained customer MRO and CapEx spending into process flow infrastructure and ongoing demand for our next-generation automation solutions. Combined with the robust sales growth we saw in the quarter we saw in the quarter, EBITDA increased 36% over prior levels, while EBITDA margins expanded 128 basis points over the prior year to 11.8%. In addition, we assume incremental margins in the mid-teens based on our low to mid-teens sales growth increase assumptions for the quarter, combined with considerations around our annual focus merit increase, effective January 1st, ongoing inflationary pressures and reduced operating leverage as sales growth eases."
