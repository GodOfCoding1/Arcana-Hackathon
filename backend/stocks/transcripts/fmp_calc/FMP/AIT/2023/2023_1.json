    "content": " Sales, EBITDA and EPS all hit record first quarter levels, with respective growth of 19%, 34% and 45% over prior year levels. Positive underlying demand and sales growth have continued into the early part of our fiscal second quarter, with organic sales, month-to-date in October, approximately 20% over the prior year. Of note, Engineered Solutions segment organic sales growth of 18% accelerated from 14% last quarter. Within our Engineered Solutions segment, sales increased 18.4% over the prior year quarter, with acquisitions contributing 60 basis points of growth. Segment sales growth has been supported by strong order rates and backlog across our Fluid Power division, sustained customer MRO and CapEx spending in process flow infrastructure and ongoing healthy demand for our next-generation automation solutions. Overall, our solid sales growth, gross margin management and cost leverage drove a 34.2% increase in EBITDA over prior year levels. We now project EPS in the range of $6.90 to $7.55 per share based on sales growth of 5% to 9%, including a 6% to 10% organic growth assumption as well as EBITDA margins up 10.9% to 11.2%. Lastly, based on our low to mid-teen organic sales growth assumption, we expect second quarter gross margins to be relatively unchanged compared to first quarter levels and SG&A expense down slightly on a sequential basis."
