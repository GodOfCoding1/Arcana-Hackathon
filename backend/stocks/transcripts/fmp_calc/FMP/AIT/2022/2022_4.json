    "content": " Combined with ongoing price contribution, year-over-year organic sales growth of approximately 19% represented the strongest quarterly performance for all of our fiscal 2020 to even though we're facing more difficult prior year comparisons. Within our Fluid Power & Flow Control segment, sales increased 15% over the prior year quarter, with acquisitions contributing one point of growth. Overall, our solid sales growth gross margin improvement and cost leverage drove a 26.5% increase in EBITDA over prior year levels, which represents an over 43% increase when excluding the impact of LIFO in both periods. We are establishing full year fiscal 2023 guidance, including EPS in the range of $6.65 to $7.30 based on sales growth of 3% to 7% and EBITDA margins of 10.8% to 11.1%. Actually, the guidance assumes the fluid power, flow control automation segment, slightly outpacing service in our growth, just given the strong 22% that we had in that piece of the business and just that robust backlog position that we entered the year with, so slightly outpaced growth out of the project orient business."
