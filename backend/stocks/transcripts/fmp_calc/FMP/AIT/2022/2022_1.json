Industrial supply chain constraints are having some impact on the timing of demand flowing through to sales, so solid execution and our favorable industry position steel drove and over 16% organic increase in sales versus prior year levels and stronger growth on a two year stacked basis relative to recent quarters. Turning now to our results for the quarter, consolidated sales increase 19.2% over the prior year quarter, acquisitions contributed 2.1 percentage points of growth and foreign currency drove a favorable 80 basis point increase.
