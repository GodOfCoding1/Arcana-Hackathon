    "content": " The value of our diversified business strategy was evident in our second quarter results during a period of volatile markets, high inflation and macroeconomic uncertainty, strong customer growth across our businesses, rising interest rates and optimization within our general account are helping us to mitigate some of the headwinds from market volatility. We closed the second quarter with $632 billion of total company AUM, reflecting the AUM that was transferred as part of the reinsurance transaction, as well as unfavorable equity and fixed income performance and foreign exchange headwinds. Excluding this $2.8 billion of income from exited businesses, as well as a negative $83 million true-up for the first quarter gains in the funds withheld portfolio, net income for the quarter was $315 million. Unfavorable equity market and fixed income performance relative to both the prior quarter and year ago quarter, negatively impacted AUM, account values, fee revenue and margins and RIS-Fee and PGI, as well as DAC amortization and RIS-Fee. Despite macro pressures, PGI reported strong second quarter results with $1.4 billion of positive net cash flow and the overall management fee rate of approximately 29 basis points remain stable."
