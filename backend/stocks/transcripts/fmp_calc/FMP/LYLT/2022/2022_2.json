    "content": " As before we remain committed to the capital allocation priorities that we outlined earlier this year, which are designed to deliver stronger marketing ROIs and top-line growth for our sponsors and clients and in turn drive growth in both AIR MILES and BrandLoyalty over time. Even as we innovate around new partnership models, it's important to remember that, the AIR MILES Program has a history of developing creative ways for sponsors to participate in the coalition, at a commitment level that fits their business. In the second quarter AIR MILES revenue declined approximately $5 million, with about half driven by a decline in service revenue, representing the flow-through impact of lower miles issuance in 2020 and 2021. So it's one of those and we've seen this with AIR MILES before we've seen with this BrandLoyalty people adjust what they're going to spend based upon the economy recession, inflation whatever the case may be."
