    "content": " As I mentioned earlier, we added 50,000 consumer fiber broadband customers, driving a 14% increase in our customer base to the same period last year. Fiber EBITDA grew 6% year-over-year, an acceleration from 2% growth last quarter, as strong consumer fiber broadband growth and margin improvements offset EBITDA headwinds from video products. Let me take the first one, and I'll pass to Nick for the second one. So yes, on Wave 3, the big point today is to show that, a, we think it is worth more than we thought it was in emergence; and then b, give you guys a specific dimensionalization that we think there's 1 million to 2 million incremental homes to pass there that they're going to be positive to fiberized. On your first question on Wave 3 modeling, I'd say that the detailed modeling we did on Wave 3 fortifies our conviction around our mid- to high-teens IRR on Wave 2, where gives us increased confidence in our $900 to $1,000 cost per passing, increased confidence in our penetration and ARPU assumptions that we've met or exceeded in the past 4 quarters. And so if there are data points in the market that would suggest other assets out there worth $5,000 per passing, I think that only strengthens our conviction that $3,000 to $4,000 is reasonable, maybe even conservative and then gives us increasing confidence to accelerate to build, convert copper to fiber as rapidly as we can. Let me take the first one, and I'll pass to Nick for the second one."
