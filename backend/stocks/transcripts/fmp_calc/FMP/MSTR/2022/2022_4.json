Total software licenses which consists of total product licenses and subscription services revenues in our consolidated statement of operations were $147.2 million, which increased 6% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. We've also made important progress in our shift towards our cloud offering, resulting in annual subscription revenues of $60.7 million, an increase of 46% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. As a percentage of total revenues non-GAAP cost of revenues increased 2% year-over-year, related in part to the growth of our cloud business similar to what we've seen in recent quarters. Although bitcoins held at the sub approximately 34,600 bitcoins are pledged as collateral to Silvergate loan and just over 82,900 bitcoins or 63% of our total Bitcoin holdings, equivalent to approximately $2 billion at the current approximate market value of $23,800 remain unpledged and unencumbered. People often ask us so why did we do this and are we pleased with the result and of course there are lots of headlines about accounting charges and quarterly losses or GAAP losses but as you can see, if you're a shareholder and your choice was to choose from any of the bars on this screen, MicroStrategy is still the number one choice and Bitcoin is the number two choice of what you want to invest in as commodity bitcoin is the winner as a commodity and asset class and if you want to invest in a security, MicroStrategy has worked very hard to provide shareholder value to our investors."
