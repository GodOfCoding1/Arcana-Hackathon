    "content": " Our debt capital structure consists of a $500 million senior secured note, a $205 million Bitcoin back loan and $1.7 billion of convertible senior notes, all with a blended interest rate of approximately 2%, the earliest maturity, which is not until March 2025. Of the Bitcoins held at the sub, approximately 30,000 Bitcoins are pledged as collateral to our Bitcoin back loan and just over 85,000 Bitcoins or 65% of our total holdings, equivalent to approximately $1.7 billion at the current market price of $20,400 remain unpledged and unencumbered. Finally, before I turn the call over to Michael, I would like to reemphasize that MicroStrategy's principal core strategies are to operate and grow our enterprise analytics business and to acquire and hold Bitcoin as a treasury reserve for the long-term. So even though I think there's a lot of publicity about the volatility of Bitcoin and some of the non-cash charges we've taken, the real interesting story here is that MicroStrategy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Bitcoin strategy is the winner against all of these other strategies over the last 2.25 years. And after they've internalized or absorbed all the public comments on the transition plan and the guidance, then I think that we'll see \u00e2\u0080\u0093 we will see companies like MicroStrategy and anyone holding Bitcoin on their balance sheet, adopt fair value accounting, and that will be a huge benefit to the asset class."
