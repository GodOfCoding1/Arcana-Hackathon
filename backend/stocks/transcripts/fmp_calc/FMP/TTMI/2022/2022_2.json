    "content": " In the second quarter of 2022, TTM delivered an outstanding quarter with revenues and non-GAAP EPS above the high end of guidance despite a challenging supply chain and labor environment and the continued impact that COVID-19 is having on our business. Revenues were up 10.3% year-on-year, the second consecutive quarter of double-digit growth as our commercial markets drove the year-on-year increase. The medical, industrial, instrumentation end market contributed 21% of our total sales in the second quarter compared to 19% in the year ago quarter and 21% in the first quarter of 2022. The MI&I market set a new quarterly record, as it was up 27% year-on-year, exceeding $100 million in revenue for the fifth quarter in a row and performing much better than expected with broad-based strength across all segments. For the third quarter, we expect MI&I to be 17% of revenues as the elevated quick-turn business in Q2 normalizes in Q3 and select customers face component shortages. At the end of Q2, our 90-day backlog, not including Telephonics, which is subject to cancellations, was $635.7 million compared to $553.1 million at the end of the second quarter last year and $605.3 million at the end of the first quarter. In the second quarter of '22, R&D was $5 million or 0.8% of revenues compared to $4.1 million or 0.7% in the year ago quarter."
