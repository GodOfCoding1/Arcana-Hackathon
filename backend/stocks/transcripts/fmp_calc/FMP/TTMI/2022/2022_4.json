    "content": " As we look into Q1, production inefficiencies in our Asia-Pacific facilities due to Chinese New Year, inventory adjustments, and weaker demand from some of our commercial end markets, are causing revenue and margin declines, but we will continue to see strong demand in our A&D market, which now represents 40% of our revenues. For the full year, MI&I grew 16.7% following 11.5% growth in 2021 and 12.4% growth in 2020, well above industry forecasts three years in a row as we took advantage of mega trends and faster growing subsegments of this end market. At the end of Q4, our 90-day backlog not including Telephonics, which is subject to cancellations was $546.7 million compared to $615 million at the end of the fourth quarter last year. For the full year, revenues grew 5.4% excluding Telephonics, driven by our medical, industrial and instrumentation, data center computing, automotive, and A&D end markets. In the fourth quarter, R&D expense was $6.4 million or 1% of revenues compared to $4.8 million or 0.8% in the year ago quarter."
