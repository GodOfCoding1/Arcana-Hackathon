    "content": " I guess to consider the other side here, demand destruction, I'm curious for any insight on, so in an environment where you have realized substantial price and looking at your numbers, I don't think there's any sign today of significant or any demand destruction on the end user side, but it's got to be something that's on everyone's minds. And then, I know we've talked about this on past calls, the success that you're having in selling other HVAC products, that segment used to lag equipment, and lately you've been seeing similar even better growth in a lot of cases. Well, I'm talking about \u2013 so you've got your report equipment, and then there's other HVAC products, and I'm saying other as a segment historically used to lag the equipment because you sort of swung between the new construction related stuff, the duct work, and the thermostats and things, and then the repair parts. Well now, with the tools, we think that the pricing, right and pricing profile is right for the customers, and then market digitally through our e-commerce and e-mails and mobile push notifications making customers aware that we sell these products, they're well priced competitively. Again, to circle back to gross margin because it was just kind of such an impressive number here, I guess it would be fair to characterize, you guys finally hitting whether it's critical mass in kind of the adoption of the business intelligence tools and the operational efficiency tools, is that part of what's really driving this uptake, obviously price-on-price goes a long way. We can't quantify to you what \u2013 whether we're going to have 50 new employees because we don't decide that at the corporate level, we let the people know what's going on in the field beside that, but we certainly are growing branches and employees."
