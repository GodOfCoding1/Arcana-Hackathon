    "content": " Freight, inter-branch freight where we moved products around was negative in the quarter for all the reasons that we're talking about when we talk about freight and moving products around that's an inefficiency in gross profit year-over-year. So that would be a variable cost that moderates simply by the business, in terms of the scale of the business, changing, something like freight where it's a $60 million, $70 million number that's up 40%, 50% over the last 18 months, I would expect that to moderate for all the reasons that we're talking about. The product mix is changing and now as I think that's a plus, you only see is not unit sales as you otherwise would, but you see the sales that do occur, they occur at a higher price in the marketplace. And so obviously there's still a measure of inflation we're capturing in the market, but when we use the term heat pump and discuss that it's up 32% in a quarter and that's substituting for straight-cool units that are probably 10%, 15% less in price; that's mix, that's a price achievement in mix. So when we use the word the term price and mix there's a lot of subtlety in that discussion and the heat pump discussion and this synergy mix \u00e2\u0080\u0093 energy efficiency mix discussion, I think accounts for a lot of what we're talking about in price right now, not just inflation. And as Barry indicates the heat pump growth was something that's been happening sequentially over the last three quarters and we saw it accelerate in Q3, expectation is for it to continue to grow as that grows, it does have a material impact on revenues and residential products."
