    "content": " First, to give you some context, you have to understand that we do business with about a thousand manufacturers and all of them -- I think, it's fair to say all of them have had probably multiple price increases over the last several quarters and years. And we're in an inflationary environment, which we were have been in for the first half of this year, it'll -- it can be something more than the 27% and that's precisely what you see in the numbers year-to-date. And the noise is that in the first quarter with pricing actions by the OEMs, when we flip inventory for the first 90 days and -- in the smallest quarter of the year, the benefit of that spread is, is in gross profit and builds a gross profit that's higher, and that's where the 29% came from. So, it's -- if I focus on SG&A, there's been a complete lack of capability over the last probably 18 months, almost two years, lack of an ability to find efficiencies when supply chain was completely disrupted. The most important two regions that are really performing well right now are in the Southeast and the Southwest, but we're seeing substantial increases, even compared to last year's July. So, I think it's -- still it'll be interesting times, but I don't think the volatility is as great as other consumer products let's say. Barry is saying that the growth rate of the industry is going to slow, because we were in an extraordinary period for the last two years, but that doesn't mean it's going to slow."
