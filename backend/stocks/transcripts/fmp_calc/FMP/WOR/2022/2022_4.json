    "content": " In Q4, we had inventory holding losses estimated to be $42 million or $0.64 per share, compared to inventory holding gains of $51 million or $0.71 per share in the prior year, an unfavorable swing of $93 million which is $1.35 per share. In Steel Processing, net sales of $1.1 billion were up 71% from $655 million in Q4 last year, primarily due to higher average selling prices and the inclusion of both Temple Steel and Shiloh's BlankLight business in our resource. The large year-over-year decrease was driven by the inventory holding losses I mentioned earlier, estimated to be $42 million in this quarter compared to gains of $51 million last year, an unfavorable swing of $93 million. In Consumer Products, net sales in Q4 were $186 million, up 18% from $157 million in the prior year quarter. Building Products delivered a record EBIT for the quarter of $64 million and EBIT margin was 36.8%, up from $41 million and 33.3% in Q4 last year. In Sustainable Energy Solutions, net sales in Q4 of $41 million were in line with the prior year despite significantly lower volumes, due to the divestiture at the end of Q4 last year of our LPG auto gas business going forward. For the full fiscal year, cash flow from operations was $70 million and free cash flow was an outflow of $24 million as operating working capital increased by $258 million during the year, primarily a result of higher steel prices. And what you're seeing this quarter, it is actually what we talked about and it giant swing the gain next quarter or more kind of an echo right from when steel prices post Russia's invasion of Ukraine bounce back up to $1500, but then they've got of resume their downward bias and so if you just kind of look out into the future."
