    "content": " In Steel Processing, net sales of $823 million nearly doubled from $431 million in Q1 of last year due to higher average selling prices and increased volumes. Total shipped tons were up 14% from last year\u2019s first quarter when demand was just beginning to recover from COVID-related shutdowns, particularly at our automotive customers. In the current quarter, steel generated adjusted EBIT of $108 million and adjusted EBIT margin of 13% compared to $14 million and 3% in Q1 of last year. In Consumer Products, net sales in Q1 were $148 million, up 10.6% from the prior year quarter. EBIT for the consumer business was $21 million and EBIT margin was 14%, down from $24 million and 18% in the prior year quarter. Building Products generated net sales of $115 million in Q1, which was up 30% from $88 million in the prior year quarter. Building Products EBIT was $49 million and EBIT margin was 42%, up significantly from $23.4 million and 27% in Q1 of last year. We saw significant growth year-over-year in our wholly-owned Building Products businesses, but the majority of the upside was driven by strong results at WAVE and ClarkDietrich that contributed $26 million and $17 million respectively in equity earnings. With respect to cash flows in our balance sheet, operations used cash of $50 million in the quarter, which was driven by $149 million increase in working capital, primarily associated with higher steel prices along with annual accrued compensation being paid out during the quarter. In the last three quarters \u2013 Phil, using simple working capital metrics, just the inventories, receivables and payables in the last three quarters, we\u2019ve added $330 million to working capital."
