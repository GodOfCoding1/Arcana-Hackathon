    "content": " And good afternoon, everyone. In Steel Processing, net sales of $938 million doubled from $469 million in Q2 of last year, primarily due to higher average selling prices and a slight decrease in volumes. In Q2, steel generated adjusted EBIT of $72 million compared to $34 million last year. In Consumer Products, net sales in Q2 were $144 million, up 20% from $118 million in the prior year quarter. Adjusted EBIT for the consumer business was $18 million, and adjusted EBIT margin was 13% during Q2 and compared to $17 million and 15% in the prior year quarter. Building Products generated net sales of $121 million in Q2, which was up 29% from $94 million in the prior year quarter. Building Products adjusted EBIT was $55 million, and adjusted EBIT margin was 45%, up significantly from $26 million and 28% in Q2 of last year. Despite continued demand headwinds related to semiconductor chip shortages at their customers, the business was profitable and reported adjusted EBIT of $1 million in the current period compared to $2 million in the prior year. With respect to cash flows and our balance sheet, operations used cash of $119 million in the quarter driven by a $235 million increase in operating working capital, primarily associated with higher steel prices. Looking at our balance sheet and liquidity position, funded debt at quarter end of $702 million and interest expense of $7 million were both down slightly compared to the prior year, primarily due to favorable exchange rates for our euro-denominated debt. And good afternoon, everyone. We continue to invest in working capital during the quarter and have added almost $600 million in the past year, but the price of hot-rolled steel peaked during the quarter in the mid-1,900s and has already fallen close to $300 a ton."
