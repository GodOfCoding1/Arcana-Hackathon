    "content": " Gross profit, as a percentage of sales, decreased by 620 basis points from 28.3% in the second quarter of 2021 to 22.1% in the second quarter of 2022 driven primarily by the initial costs required to complete projects that were in process and to integrate and absorb the VisionMark NYC operations. Cash used in operations during the first six months of 2022 was due in part to the integration of the VisionMark NYC acquisition, including cost to expedite completion of projects that were in process, and also due to an increase in inventory, as we secured parts in advance of production in our disinfection segment, to mitigate potential supply chain disruptions ahead of targeted marketing initiatives planned for the second half of 2022."
