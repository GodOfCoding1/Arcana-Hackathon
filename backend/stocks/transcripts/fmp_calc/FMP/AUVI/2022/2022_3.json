    "content": "  Our financial results for the third quarter include revenue of $5.9 million, roughly in line with prior quarter and up 65% year-over-year, primarily as a result of our acquisition of the factory operations of a 100,000 square foot manufacturing facility in Brooklyn, New York. This increase was attributable to the Hospitality segment, which increased by $2.5 million, primarily as a result of the fulfillment of orders that were delayed from Q2, plus the addition of the orders fulfilled from the VisionMark acquisition, offset by a decrease of $208,000 in the Disinfection segment, primarily due to the pushout of orders into the next two quarters."
