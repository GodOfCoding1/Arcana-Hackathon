    "content": " It's sort of protecting a lot of the -- at least the dollar cost of actual sort of inflation, but that supply chain costs and some other things, of course, have weighed on margins and profitability as well, like it has for the Group as a whole. And then the other factor that I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d just call out that's worth mentioning is the impact of divestitures, the ones that we've announced and the ones that we've closed, will be a bit higher in the first half before we begin the lap the yogurt and dough divestitures which happened in the second half of this recent fiscal year. Rob, I think you've got -- you have to remember that we'll be starting to roll over some pricing as we come into fiscal '22 and certainly much more so as we get into the back half of the year as we have significant pricing come through in the back half of -- sorry, of fiscal '22, we'll be rolling over that in fiscal '23. And so as we think about our assumptions for the year -- and we saw this in the last recession, The Great Recession, we saw that consumption away from home eating was down and replaced by at-home eating, we're seeing the same kind of behavior starting now. And then just on shipment timing, I think a quarter ago, you talked about how some of that under-shipment in North America would likely be a fiscal '23 event, at least looking at Nielsen seems to be a bit of timing benefit in the fourth quarter."
