    "content": " I think when you look deeper into our third quarter and retail movement, what you'll see is that our dry dog food business really performed quite well and Life Protection Formula continued to accelerate and was up 23% in dollar terms, but also 9% in pounds. And so is not really an accident that private label is lower in our categories, and I think it pretends well for our future because even during the last recession, what we found is that even though private label gained a little share back in 2008 to 2010, we were able to hold -- we were able to hold market share due to our brands, thanks and our investments in consumer spending. And that's paying dividends as our Life Protection Formula has continued to accelerate, but it does mean our marketing spending had a negative impact on the P&L in the third quarter over the although it's clear over the long run -- that this is such a good idea. And I would also say, you didn't ask this, but I guess a bonus answer would be that in our fourth quarter, we actually -- we expect that our profitability will be up in our fourth quarter as we see our pricing that took place at the end of the quarter come into effect as we see a little bit easing on inflation, we see the service getting better. And I think it's fair to say that we're still in the early innings on driving back margin growth into our food service business, and we're confident that we can and we're also confident that we need to."
