    "content": " You may proceed with your question. The biggest variables, as you can imagine, as we think about the gross margin progression for us are going to be volume performance on the level of disruption and as we obviously would just take note of the inflationary environment, where we just noted that we are expecting modestly higher inflation for the year. You may proceed with your question. I think as a cautionary note, well, I would certainly be in the front of the line along with all our business leaders, including Jon to want the environment stabilized, I think supply chain disruption is still very, very real, categorically well above historical levels and the cost of servicing volume in this business even as we think we are doing it competitively in our North America business is just higher and will remain higher until we see that stabilization. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just a matter of as we look through the year, we would anticipate that elasticities would become a little bit less favorable than they are right now, but still more favorable than they would have been historically, but so far, we haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t seen really any change in elasticities, which for us was a positive for the quarter. You may proceed with your question. And that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s important to note because as we think about our second quarter in pet, we will have a lot of costs from increasing service in the business, whether it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s through external supply chain or through adding capacity on treats and warehouse space and all those things, but we won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t yet have the sales associated with it. You may proceed with your question. You may proceed with your question. You may proceed with your question. You may proceed with your question. You may proceed with your question. And then my next question is as you go forward in a couple of years, can your gross profits expand if elasticity becomes what you think it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to be and volumes don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t kind of subside a little bit, or do you truly need the volume operating leverage because that seems to be one of the points you pointed to as a key core reason for gross margin expansion. You may proceed with your question."
