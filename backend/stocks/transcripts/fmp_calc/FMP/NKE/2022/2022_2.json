    "content": " Our brand\u2019s deep connection with the consumers driving strong holiday sales, most notably with North American digital, leading the industry over Black Friday week with close to 40% growth; and our Singles\u2019 Day performance showcased our brand strength in Greater China as we added 13 million new members, and NIKE was again the number one sport brand on Tmall. NIKE\u2019s second quarter financial results were in line with the expectations we established 90 days ago, fueled by continued brand momentum, the strength of our product franchises with extraordinary levels of full-price realization and strong season-to-date holiday sales, offset by lower levels of available inventory supply relative to marketplace demand. As John mentioned, we had an incredible Black Friday week, with NIKE Direct in North America and EMEA, increasing over 20% versus the prior year on top of last year\u2019s meaningful gains. As we\u2019ve discussed before, NIKE is focused on creating one NIKE marketplace that elevates the brand by creating direct consumer connections through fewer, more impactful wholesale partners with a connected mobile digital experience at the center built for the NIKE member. In the second quarter, North America Digital grew 40% versus the prior year, pushing NIKE Digital to 30% of total North America marketplace, bringing NIKE Direct to 48% of total. The progress being made to create One Nike Marketplace has accelerated North America\u2019s revenue growth and gross margin expansion for yet another quarter, illustrating how consumer-direct acceleration will fuel NIKE\u2019s growth and profitability towards the fiscal \u201825 outlook we shared in June."
