And now turning to guidance, the sales headwinds we experienced in the third quarter are expected to increase in the fourth quarter, specifically, this is the pressure on consumer spending in the U.S. and the spillover effect on near-term orders as retailers tightly manage their overall inventory levels. Given the current prices for commodities and freight as well as our current inventory turns, we would expect these lower costs to begin flowing through our P&L in the second half next year, particularly the fourth quarter.
