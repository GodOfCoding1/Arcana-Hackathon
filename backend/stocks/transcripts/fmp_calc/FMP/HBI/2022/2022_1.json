    "content": " While we're encouraged that we positively comp last year strong 41% growth rate in the U.S., we were disappointed that product supply challenges did not improve as expected in the quarter. Looking at our Innerwear business internationally, constant currency sales increased at a mid-single digit rate over prior year, driven by growth in our Bras N Things brand in Australia, as well as our Hanes brand in Latin America and Southeast Asia. Turning to margins, adjusted gross margin declined 305 basis points over prior year to 37.1%, driven by the expected impact from higher inflation and higher than planned strategic investments and expedite freight to service new retail space gains. First of all, very pleased with the first quarter, and the performance of the Innerwear business and really establishing this business as a growth business for us going forward which is something that we've been working to do for a while, and it was a strong quarter, we have strong order demand, service levels improved during the quarter. We're really optimistic about back-to-school, because what we've seen is, we're doing much better, I think we have about 18% more inventory on the floor, Steve, than what we had last year."
