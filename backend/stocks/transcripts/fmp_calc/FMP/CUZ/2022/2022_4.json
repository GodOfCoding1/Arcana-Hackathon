    "content": " I'm pleased to say that even with our outsized leasing activity in Houston, second-generation net rents for all activity increased 7.3% on a cash basis and in the fourth quarter and 9.5% for the full-year. We signed 92,000 square feet of leases across all of our submarkets in Atlanta this past quarter, rolling up cash net rents over 10% on average. In Austin, JLL pegged market leasing activity last quarter just below the pre-pandemic average at 1.1 million square feet, with positive net absorption for the fourth quarter and the full-year. We signed 153,000 square feet of leases in Austin last quarter, rolling up cash net rents over 40% on average. JLL Research also cited that 80% of Austin\u00e2\u0080\u0099s leasing activity this quarter occurred in leases for less than 10,000 square feet, an indication that we see momentum could slow in Austin as larger requirements pause. Fortunately, our portfolio is 95% leased as in-place weighted average lease term of over six years and only 8.2% of our annual contractual rents in Austin expire through 2024, equally balanced between \u00e2\u0080\u009823 and \u00e2\u0080\u009924, including only one exploration larger than 50,000 square feet that is in the third quarter of 2024. You may now go ahead. You may now go ahead. You may now go ahead. You may now go ahead. You may now go ahead. You may now go ahead. You may now go ahead."
