Good morning, and welcome to Cousins Properties Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. With me today are Colin Conley, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Richard Hickson, our Executive Vice President of Operations; and Gregg Adzema, our Chief Financial Officer. If you did not receive a copy, these documents are available through the quarterly disclosures and supplemental SEC information links on the Investor Relations page or website, cousins.com. Please be aware that certain matters discussed today may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws, and actual results may differ materially from these statements due to a variety of risks and uncertainties and other factors including the risk factors set forth in our annual report on Form 10-K and our other SEC filings. The company does not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. The full declaration regarding forward-looking statements is available in the supplemental package posted yesterday, and a detailed discussion of potential risks is contained in our filings with the SEC. Before providing some observations on the macro environment and trends, I want to provide a quick overview of our second quarter financial highlights. Importantly, we leased 588,000 square feet during the quarter with an 11.6% cash rent roll-up. These are strong results, and we remain encouraged by the leasing pipeline in front of us. Looking at the macro environment, I'll highlight 3 important trends. First, as we all know, unprecedented fiscal and monetary stimulus supply chain disruptions from COVID were in Europe and an extraordinarily tight labor market have created inflation levels not seen in decades. Second, the return to office, particularly premier office continues and is likely to accelerate. At the same time, younger workers and recent college graduates are increasingly looking for an in-person experience. Let me paraphrase a recent statement from Shopify as they laid off approximately 1,000 employees, \"we placed a bet that the channel mix, the share of dollars that travel through e-commerce rather than physical retail would permanently leap ahead by 5 or even 10 years.\" While I can't speak for commodity or suburban office, we believe that premier office will remain critical for innovative companies to build culture, collaborate, solve problems and grow talent. To illustrate, net absorption since 2020 for buildings built since 2015 is positive 181 million square feet. On the contrary, net absorption since 2020 for buildings built prior to 2015 is negative 327 million square feet. Market and financial conditions will likely become more challenging, we are not immune to the impact of rising interest rates or a weakening economy. Let me highlight why: First, we own the leading Sunbelt trophy office portfolio in the best submarkets of Atlanta, Austin, Charlotte, Tampa, Phoenix, Dallas and Nashville. Second, our $566 million development pipeline with our share of the office component approximately 70% pre-leased, is appropriately positioned for the current climate. While a recession, if it were to happen, could extend the timeline to complete the re-leasing of these attractive properties, our overall portfolio is on solid footing. Our lease expirations through 2024 totaled just 14.3%, among the lowest in the office sector. In anticipation of a changing market, we have remained disciplined and kept our powder dry, notwithstanding the potential accretion to short-term earnings. Many recently announced deals in our markets, which were priced in the spring and have had cash cap rates in the high 4 percentage range on our underwriting. Today, just a few months later, the pricing looks much more attractive. The key ingredients of this strategy include a pure-play portfolio of premier, highly amenitized properties in dynamic Sunbelt markets, a leading development platform that creates value through the development of innovative office, residential and mixed-use properties, a strong balance sheet with low leverage and ample liquidity and local operating teams with a creative and entrepreneurial approach. Looking forward, we will continue to prioritize selling less relevant properties which at this point is a modest percentage of our portfolio and reinvest the capital into strategic acquisitions, unique developments and our own stock, if that is the most compelling use to accomplish our long-term goals. In the near term, the bar for new development will be higher. While demand is quite strong for new product, material escalations in construction costs has compressed development yields so they look less attractive today compared to acquisition cap rates and the implied yield on our own stock. In closing, we are mindful of the potential impact of higher interest rates and a slowing economy on short-term results. However, over the long term, we are optimistic that premier office will separate into its own asset class with improved investor sentiment. We own a trophy portfolio, and we have a dedicated and talented team, and our balance sheet is primed for opportunities. Before turning the call over to Richard, I want to thank our entire Cousins team who provide excellent service to our customers as well as their skill and talent to their jobs every day. Despite the current macroeconomic backdrop, our operations team was able to once again produce solid quarterly results. In particular, our leasing activity this quarter is a clear indication that the quality of our portfolio is resonating well with office users in our Sunbelt markets. We executed 52 leases for a total of 588,000 square feet with a weighted average term of 7.9 years. New and expansion leases represented 45% of total leasing activity this quarter, and our activity was diverse in terms of industry mix with traditional professional services leading the way. Rent growth in the quarter was strong, with second-generation net rents increasing 11.6% on a cash basis. In addition to strong rent growth, leasing concessions defined as the sum of free rent and tenant improvements were $6.32 per square foot per year, more than $2 lower than what we posted last quarter and $0.60 lower than in 2021. Despite lower concessions, our net effective rents came in modestly lower compared to last quarter at $23.37, more in line with levels seen in the first half of 2021. Looking forward, I'm also pleased to say that we continue to have a healthy late-stage lease pipeline that to date has shown no signs of disruption. With oil prices remaining at an elevated level, we are seeing interesting market activity in Houston. A quick reminder that our 835,000 square foot Brier Lake project in Houston remains a noncore holding. While lease economics in Houston going forward will almost certainly not screen well relative to our stronger core markets, new activity in Houston would be a welcome net positive to our holding there and to our overall portfolio. Despite our strong recent activity and healthy pipeline, we are closely monitoring macroeconomic conditions and acknowledge that any further deterioration would almost certainly have some negative impact on leasing activity in the back half of this year. As Colin highlighted in his remarks, we do continue to see the impact of the flight to quality trend. According to JLL Research, the overall market has posted negative net absorption of 532,000 square feet year-to-date. However, the Class A segment and the highest quality CBD and Westshore submarkets, where our properties are located, has posted positive net absorption of 278,000 square feet. Our same property portfolio in Tampa is currently 92.5% leased, and our lease pipeline has filled nicely during the past quarter. The migration and flight quality trends are also clear in Atlanta, where we completed an impressive 323,000 square feet of leasing this quarter, including over 48,000 square feet of new and expansion leases at Prominent Central in Midtown with a blended cash rent roll-up of 38%. According to JLL, Atlanta's office market leasing activity has surpassed the 2016 to '19, 3-year average leasing activity in 3 of the last 4 quarters. In the first part of '22, great companies like Visa, Walmart, McKenzie and Nike have all committed to creating new hubs in Atlanta. Broader rent growth has also resumed in Atlanta after remaining relatively stable since 2020, with 8 out of Atlanta's 10 submarkets showing average asking rents above pre-pandemic peaks. Austin led the nation in return to office occupancy levels this quarter according to Castle Systems data as the market continued to realize net occupancy gains with over 472,000 square feet of positive absorption. Average rental rates in Austin were at a record high last quarter according to CBRE, and they remained at those levels this quarter. Like Atlanta, our Austin leasing activity was strong this quarter, including a 94,000 square foot early renewal and expansion of Cadence Design Systems at our Research Park Plaza property in the Northwest submarket. Nevertheless, we believe leading companies will continue to seek out high-quality office space in our core markets over the long term. The larger expirations of the past couple of years are behind us, and we are in an enviable position of stability as economic headwinds threaten. Then I'll move on to our transaction activity, our capital markets activity and our development pipeline, followed by a quick discussion of our balance sheet before closing my remarks with updated information on our outlook for the balance of 2022. Overall, as Colin stated upfront, second quarter numbers were solid despite the economic volatility and uncertainty. Focusing on same-property performance, cash net operating income decreased 0.2% compared to last year, driven by a 1.6% decrease in revenues and a 4.1% decrease in expenses. These numbers include 2 properties here in Atlanta, 3350 Peachtree and Buckhead and Promina Tower in Midtown that have each had large recent move-outs and are undergoing significant redevelopments as we take advantage of its  to update both properties. Excluding these 2 buildings, same-property cash NOI would have increased 1.9% during the second quarter, a better reflection of the current underlying fundamentals within our portfolio. For the first 6 months of 2022, same-property cash NOI, including 3350 Peachtree and Promina Tower is flat compared to last year. As a quick reminder, this building has been empty and generating no revenues since the beginning of 2022 as Expedia moved out to consolidate their operations at our newly developed Domain 11 building. Prior to this move out, we signed a lease with Amazon that rolled up the rent and extended the term from Expedia's prior lease. As Richard mentioned earlier, fiscal occupancy at our properties has increased and our parking revenues have grown along with it. For context, parking revenues comprise about 6% of our total property revenues. Early in the second quarter, we acquired our partner's 10% interest in the 2 Avalon properties we developed that are located here in Atlanta for $43.4 million. Later in the quarter, one of our joint ventures with Heinz sold its interest in a parcel of land located in the victory submarket of Uptown Dallas for $23.1 million. However, since our purchase, this location has emerged as more of a residential and retail area rather than office and the highest and best use of the site is now high-rise multifamily. On the capital markets front, we closed on a new unsecured credit facility during the first week of May. It's a 5-year commitment and the new maturity date is April 30, 2027. Near the end of the quarter, we settled 2.6 million shares of our common stock sold on a forward basis during the third and fourth quarters of '21 at a gross price of $39.32 per share. All 3 projects, 100 Mill in Phoenix, Domain 9 in Austin and New Hakan Nashville remain on budget. Our remaining funding commitment for this pipeline is approximately $240 million, which is more than covered by our construction financing, our existing liquidity and future retained earnings. We entered this period of uncertainty with a relatively small, highly derisked development pipeline. Looking at our balance sheet, we purposefully reduced leverage during the second quarter. As Colin stated earlier, net debt to EBITDA is now just 4.9x. This $0.04 adjustment is driven by a negative variance of $0.08 due to higher interest rates, partially offset by $0.03 from the Victory land I discussed earlier, as well as $0.01 of improved property NOI. Focusing on interest rates, we use the forward LIBOR and SOFR curves to forecast short-term rates and the forward 10-year treasury curve plus credit spreads to forecast long-term rates. As I stated on our first quarter conference call, the guidance we provided at that time already reflected increases in rates that had taken place earlier in the year. Since March, both short- and long-term actual and forecast rates have moved even higher. For example, the forward curve for 30-day LIBOR at year-end '22 has moved from 1.5% to 3.5%, an increase of 200 basis points. Beyond '22, I'd encourage you to look at the forward curves and credit spreads as you update your 2023 earnings models for us. Turning to property NOI, we're currently anticipating about $0.01 per share of improvements over our prior '22 guidance. Again, 18% of our activity this quarter was tech and a large piece of that was the renewal and expansion that I called out in Austin with Cadence Design Systems. And really, you look at our first quarter activity, and tech was a very small piece of our activity then. So I think the demand is certainly not showing up in '22, like it was in '21 for us. But at the same time, I'm super encouraged by the fact that we completed close to 600,000 square feet of activity this quarter with very little of that from the tech sector. So I think what we'll continue to see based on our completed activity in our pipeline that I look at today that we'll continue to have strength in the professional services sector, just the good old fashioned legal, accounting, consulting and other miscellaneous business services companies, the demand is encouraging in that area. Anthony, I'd just add that as you look at our markets like Atlanta and Austin, Charlotte, again, very dynamic cities with very diverse economies. And while tech has been a large driver of growth over the last couple of years, as Richard mentioned, a lot of the traditional users of office space, again, the accounting firms, financial firms, professional services really have not leased a lot of space over the last couple of years and are now returning to the office in greater numbers. And given your comments on development, can you update us on Domain Central. Look, as I mentioned, we're -- the bar for new development is higher. And as costs have gone up, those development yields relative to our other alternatives have become less attractive. And I think over time, we need to see costs come down and/or rents go up to -- for us to financially justify moving forward. I'm actually optimistic that that's going to happen faster than many believe and again, the flight to quality in the demand for new product, I do think there's an opportunity even if the world becomes more recessionary to see that rebalance again, the flight to quality being so pronounced. Yes, Blaine, great question. And again, we're -- the balance sheet now stands at about 4.9x debt to EBITDA. And from our perspective, from spring to here later in the summer, we do think that as debt has become less available and at the same time, has repriced there could be interesting opportunities to acquire high-quality assets in our targeted submarkets at hopefully, advantageous pricing. And so I think we'll be -- continue to be on the hunt and the lookout for those opportunities, which will likely come. Kind of related to that, you guys have 2 multifamily properties in the portfolio, both currently and JVs. Yes, Blaine, great question. And as you pointed out, we do have quite a bit of experience in the residential sector in a mixed-use context. We are, as I mentioned, committed to premier office and think that, that will differentiate itself over time. But as we continue to see opportunities in our urban submarkets, oftentimes, those opportunities are a mixed use of both office and residential. And we've got a terrific land bank today that would support projects of that type out of Domain Central, that will be an office and residential project. We've got 2 sites in Charlotte that can accommodate both office and residential Dallas, Midtown Atlanta. And then just wanted to get your thoughts on the Dallas market as a whole and kind of your level of commitment to that market, given that you only have 2 operating assets at the moment, and any thoughts on future development there if you are, in fact, still committed to Dallas. We're still committed to Dallas, and it's a large, vibrant market in the Sunbelt and we remain focused and disciplined on finding the right opportunities. As Gregg pointed out, we came to the conclusion that the highest and best use of that site was multifamily. And it was a joint collaborative decision and discussion with Heinz, who ultimately became he was the buyer with a capital partner as they do have a high-rise residential platform. I think for us, as I pointed out earlier, we're absolutely open and willing to invest in multifamily development, but I think it will tend to be in conjunction with a larger mixed-use site. So we felt at that time, it was appropriate in had interest to move forward with the multifamily at an attractive price. So currently, we've got about 30% floating rate debt as a percentage of total debt on our balance sheet. Typically, if you look over the last decade, we've maintained it closer to 20% of total debt. As you know and as I stated earlier in the call, we've got about $300 million of debt that matures at the end of this year and the beginning of 2023. Well, clearly, the macro economics have gotten in the way of that, and we're not probably not going to do an unsecured bond deal. And there's liquidity in the market for other types of debt, bank term loans, insurance, private placements, and we'll get that refinanced in the next quarter or -- and in the process, we'll lower our floating rate debt down closer to where it has historically been. If you go back and look at our balance sheet over the last decade, it's been very close to about 20% pretty much every quarter. Well, Jamie, the -- certainly, as we sit today, I'd say there's a lot liquidity in the investment sales market. My hope would be -- again, the balance sheet is very strong. But I think philosophically, we're focused on trying to match up sources and uses as best we can. I think it's important to note, change. That would be a choice to sell as we've talked about, with sub-5 net debt-to-EBITDA, the balance sheet is in terrific shape. And we do -- as I said, we think interesting acquisition opportunities are going to come along. And then finally, your comment on pausing on new development until you see better economic conditions. I mean what are you watching for, given it's kind of a 2-year lead time to start to finish on an office project. Look, it -- what we're looking for are development yields that are attractive relative to our other alternatives. I think as we sit here point in time today, I want to be very clear that there's good solid leasing demand for new development, but at the same time, we don't want to lock ourselves into escalated construction costs and therefore, compress yields and just build a building to get it out of the ground. And so I do think it's going to rebalance costs, we believe, over the second half of the year are absolutely going to moderate. At Cousins, we've got a great land bank, and our hope will be that we're first out of the ground. Maybe Colin and Richard, this will go to both of you, but you guys usually build toward informed demand down in Austin, and so you're obviously a little bit more cautious there, but you talked earlier about record number of leases, good volume, really encouraged by the leasing pipeline, yet the tone does come across as much more cautious. Obviously, there's a lot of uncertainty. Again, our caution around development is not informed by leasing or demand. It is informed by construction costs that over really in the last quarter or 2 from our perspective, have materially escalated beyond what we just thought a few quarters ago. But as I mentioned, those costs will moderate, we believe, over the second half of this year and into next year and then perhaps those development yields become more attractive. But that's going to change, and we'll be ready to go. I don't know are there any details you can share that make you cautious there in terms of maybe length of time to close a deal to our activity, anything along those lines that makes you more cautious if we separate out the development component. Look, it is -- we're not seeing anything certainly on the ground within our existing leasing pipeline at the moment or any feedback from any of our customers. It's obviously the summer tour activity typically slows a bit in the summer, but there -- we're seeing positive signs again from some broader parts of the economy that had perhaps been on hold over the last couple of years. but also realistic, as you read kind of headlines and see GDP numbers that if the market were to change, we want to make sure we positioned ourselves well. And as I always say, at Cousins, we are positioned to thrive during all phases of the economic cycle. Maybe last question, just maybe more specifically on the Anthem and Peachtree Tower. Backlog of activity to kind of backfill that space, timing, any expectation on downtime before you're able to kind of finish up the leasing of those. I think kind of importantly, we are finishing up the renovation of the ground floor and outdoor amenity space of both of those projects. Maybe just first one, you talked a little about development yields and you're pausing and when to see where things shake out. Well, again, as it relates to development, again, we remain constructive on demand but cautious on pricing and again, waiting for those to hopefully quickly rebalance. As it relates to pricing, again, there has not been yet a lot of price discovery kind of on the other side, a material change in the rate environment that really occurred or I should say, the debt capital markets for real estate in June. And so you haven't seen really any completed trades yet I do think as it relates to kind of discussion of some deals that are out there today, we're seeing people talk about a 10% change in asset values and could be higher for more value-add type product. But again, the market is still kind of finding its pricing level. And can you translate that into for Cousins specifically, how should we think about the mark-to-market and TI trajectory. I think that from a mark-to-market and TI perspective and concessions perspective, I'm not sure I see that anything is really going to change with a rotation from technology to more traditional customers. I think the demand levels, again, like we talked about earlier, are still there. I would just add, again, we haven't really yet seen kind of that softening again, if the broader economy over the latter half of the year and next year does, certainly, that would have an impact. But as Richard said, the pipeline today looks pretty solid, and we haven't seen a material change in rents or in concessions. Would it be fair to say the magnitude which you've adjusted the guide just from the rate impact, the $0.08, I think you mentioned. And if you were looking at '23, you would use a full year annualized number. However, the current forward LIBOR curve is assuming that short-term rates peak kind of in the first, second quarter of '23 and then come downward. So the increase over the last 3 months to short-term rates in '22 of the 200 basis points I mentioned earlier, is much lower in '23. So it's a smaller adjustment upward from what we previously had in, but applied to a longer time period. But I would say we have seen, over the last quarter, more land become available. And so we are starting to look at some of those opportunities, but that -- we have not seen a change in that pricing. But I think you've seen some instances for whatever reason, different funds, perhaps have cues, trying to find liquidity and with less debt available, they're smaller buyer pools. And then hopefully, at some point down the road, the development market will rebalance and we'll pivot to development opportunities like we have in the past. And so we continue to be kind of agnostic allocators of capital and willing to pivot between acquisitions and development and again, focus on whichever provides the most compelling return. But now there's confirmation the largest life science owner in the country is developing in Austin, just curious, updated thoughts on potential expansion in that submarket sector and any potential acquisition opportunities within the life science on the horizon for Cousins. Again, we're obviously taking note and seeing that life science activity in Austin. We're actually also seeing an uptick in that activity in Atlanta, but again, we're open to a mix of use. And as I mentioned, have have been active in the residential sector, and I think we'll be active in the residential sector going forward in the context of an urban mixed-use projects, we'll evaluate and understand the life science market. I think today, we likely -- I think we lack the expertise, but it's something that we'll get smart on over time and perhaps there could be opportunities to partner with groups and we could offer some local market experience. But given our lack of experience in history of life science, I think it's a lower priority for us. Colin, you've mentioned repurchases a few times as a potential investment given where your implied cap rate is. And so when we identify a potential source of capital, and share repurchase emerges is the most compelling use of that capital we can put in place very quickly. Blaine, I don't have a lot to add to Gregg's comments. Again, as we if we're able to generate sources of capital, we along with our door, sit down and look at the strategic and financial merits of acquisitions, development and/or share repurchases, and we have done that in the past. We have executed on all 3 -- and again, I think today, where our share price is, that's certainly going to be part of the conversation, and it will be dependent on, again, the source of capital at the time and what those uses are in front of us and we'll try to be dispassionate agnostic investors and focus on the right opportunities to drive value for shareholders."
