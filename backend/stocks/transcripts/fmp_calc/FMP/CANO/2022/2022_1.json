    "content": " Our Medicare Advantage membership grew sequentially in the first quarter, the lower than our generate one estimates due to on-going management of our Puerto Rico affiliates, retaining those affiliates that are most committed to value based primary care and due to timing of convergence of fee for service Medicare patients to Medicare Advantage in new markets, which we expect to pick up in the second half of this year. Even with natural attrition and DCE membership during the year, we expect total membership in Medicare to remain about 60% of total members through 2022, due to growth in our Medicare Advantage membership. Your line is open. First, we're referring to 60% for the Medicare Capitated Membership as a whole, not just the Medicare Advantage hard to predict which value based model patients will select on any given month or quarter though the trend is toward Medicare Advantage. Your line is open. Sure, I think it's very similar to what we talked about last quarter, where we have a very active and robust pipeline in terms of market intelligence around what are the opportunities, as we're expanding in each of these markets, we have people in the field working the opportunities, and I would say, we've seen some of the multiples become much more attractive. Your line is open. Your line is open. And then as far as the DCE, MCR improve, we've talked about how we're around 96% or so, in the first quarter, we would expect that to see some sequential some improvement as we go to the back half of the year getting into the low 90s, probably, as we kind of exit fourth quarter 2022. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open."
