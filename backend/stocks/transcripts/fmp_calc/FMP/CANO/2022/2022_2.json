    "content": " Additionally, while DCE performed well during the quarter, we realized a $6 million unfavorable prior year development primarily due to higher than anticipated delayed claims for 2021 third party medical expenses, and given periodic benchmark updates we are decreasing our expected 2022 contribution from DCE by approximately $9 million. Given the higher than expected third party medical expenses from new Medicare Advantage and Medicaid members and the lower performance expectations for DCE, we now expect cash used in operating activities to be in the range of negative $80 million to negative $90 million."
