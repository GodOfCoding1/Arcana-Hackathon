    "content": " I think you're all familiar with the research we did mid last year when we revised our plan and gave a series of presentations as to how we saw the medium-term and long-term optionality of the Stillwater ore bodies and all the work needed to reposition the business for long-term flexibility, cost management, and to do justice to a world class ore body. Now having said that, we have also updated our numbers and due to inflation reasons, also because we did some more detailed engineering work, so you can see that the 588 that's in October last year, updated CapEx total project capital number and that's excluding the sustaining capital. Thanks very much, James. I think the second factor you've got to take into account, that is if we look historically at Eskom, we've seen over the last five or six years a constant decline in terms of the energy availability factor, which is essentially how much power they can generate. Thanks very much, James."
