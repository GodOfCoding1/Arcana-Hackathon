    "content": " With our first product origin offers an entirely circuit or plastic solution 100% Zero Carbon recyclable PET, which the world's plastic recycling infrastructure is already designed to collect, sort and reuse with the critical added benefit of removing Co2 from the atmosphere. In addition to these partnership announcements, Origin was named to Fast Company's prestigious annual list of the world's most innovative companies for 2022 in manufacturing, recognizing our patented platform for turning the carbon funding sustainable wood residue into usable materials including clothing, textiles, plastics, packaging, car parts, tires, carpeting, toys, and more, while capturing carbon in the process. While we were able to absorb inflation this past year by using our Origin 1 budget contingency and finding alternative supply sources, we believe it is more important to maintain our overall consumption schedule by taking the price increases we're seeing in the market today to avoid a delay to our production schedule, this increased to Origin 1 capital budget also includes an appropriate contingency reserve. Yeah, it's a great question. Yeah, it's a great question. Yeah, it's a great question. And so that's one of the reasons why we're excited about polymers, like PEF that we were discussing earlier, PEF brings a ton of the benefits and performance and recycling behavior that you see with PET that make it such a good material, but it also enables other sort of both performance and end of life solutions that really aren't available to PET so PEF brings for example, higher barrier, which means that you can get into applications that you can't use straight the PET very effectively."
