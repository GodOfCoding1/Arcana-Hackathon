    "content": " With our first product, Origin offers an entirely circular plastic solution: carbon-negative, recyclable PET, which the world's plastic recycling infrastructure is already designed to collect, sort, and re-use, with the critical added benefit of removing CO2 from the atmosphere. Moving to Slide 7, we recently announced an initiative with Revlon, a leading global authority and beauty trend setter in the world of color cosmetics and hair care to pursue the rapid development and commercialization of new sustainable materials for cosmetics packaging based on Origin's technology platform. Moving to Slide 8 on July 25, we announced a strategic partnership with Intertex World Resources, a leading value added distributor of synthetic rubber, carbon black, process oils and rubber chemicals to bring sustainable, carbon-negative, carbon black made using Origin\u00e2\u0080\u0099s patented technology platform to the rubber compounding industry. Moving to Slide 9, we recently announced a strategic partnership with ATC Plastics, a leading global manufacturer of black color concentrates to bring sustainable, carbon-negative, carbon black made using Origin's patented technology platform for the plastics industry. The award recognizes the technology behind Origin\u00e2\u0080\u0099s patented platform for turning the carbon found in sustainable wood residues into useful materials for a wide range of end products, including clothing, textiles, plastics, packaging, car parts, tires, carpeting, toys, and more, while capturing the carbon in the process. Origin 2, our first world-scale manufacturing facility, will produce carbon-negative materials used to make PET plastic resin and fiber, which is used in packaging, textiles, apparel, and other applications, and HTC, which can be used as fuel, as activated carbon, and as a replacement for carbon black."
