    "content": " I will then turn it over to John who will discuss construction progress on Origin 1 and Origin 2, our Origin 1 platform development and application strategy, and our new strategic partnership with Avantium to accelerate the mass production of FDCA and PEF. Third, continuing on the next slide, regarding Origin 2, in early January, we announced the final approval from the Louisiana State Bond Commission and preliminary approval from the Louisiana Public Finance Authority for the issuance of up to $1.5 billion of tax-exempt bonds, inclusive of the previously announced expected $400 million in Private Activity Bond volume cap allocation for financing the construction of the plant. As Nate will discuss in more detail, in January, we announced the Louisiana State Bond Commission final approval of up to $1.5 billion in tax-exempt bonds for the construction of Origin 2, providing further positive momentum for project financing, and potentially putting us on a path that would enable the debt financing of Origin 2 using entirely tax-exempt bonds. The partnership aims to bring together the strengths of Origin's patented carbon-negative technology platform, which turns the carbon found in sustainable wood residues into useful materials including chloromethylfurfural, or CMF, and its derivatives, with Avantium's YXY Technology, which can be used to convert Origin's CMF derivatives into FDCA, the chemical building block for the polymer PEF. I think, first, I'd like to emphasize that we've talked about this before, but just to be really clear, we view Origin 1 as an asset that really can strategically produce materials for application development of higher-value products such as some of the ones that we just mentioned, FDCA, epoxies, resin, surfactants, carbon black, asphalt, that kind of stuff."
