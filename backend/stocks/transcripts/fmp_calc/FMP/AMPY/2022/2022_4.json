    "content": " Despite the substantial impact of the Beta incident and lack of production from Beta, Amplify reported $93.8 million of adjusted EBITDA and over $43 million of free cash flow for full year 2022, which demonstrates our ability to generate substantial and sustainable cash flow and the benefits of a mature, diversified asset base. Currently, our forecasted 2023 to 2025 production is expected to climb but on average by only 1% annually and generate cumulative free cash flow of approximately $180 million at current strip pricing."
