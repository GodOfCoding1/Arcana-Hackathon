    "content": " Capital spending during the second quarter was approximately $13.5 million, primarily related to development activity in East Texas and the Eagle Ford, workover activity in Oklahoma and facilities maintenance at Bairoil and Beta. Free cash flow, defined as adjusted EBITDA less CapEx and cash interest expense, was negative $600,000 in the second quarter and primarily impacted by the timing of LOPI recognition and the accelerated capital expenditures previously noted. Total oil, natural gas and NGL revenues in the second quarter were approximately $112.9 million before the impact of derivatives compared to $93.9 million in the first quarter. Lease operating expenses for the second quarter were approximately $33.3 million or $17.91 per Boe, a slight increase from $32.9 million or $17.92 per Boe in the first quarter. Second quarter cash G&A totaled $7.7 million or $4.16 per Boe compared to $7.1 million or $3.87 per Boe in the first quarter, primarily due to onetime increase in certain professional and adviser fees. Adjusted EBITDA in the second quarter totaled $16.3 million, a decrease of approximately $8.6 million from $24.9 million in the prior quarter. Cash capital spending for the second quarter was approximately $13.5 million, an increase of $6.6 million from the first quarter of 2022. Free cash flow for the second quarter was negative $600,000, primarily related to the increased capital spending discussed on this call and the differences in LOPI payment recognition during the first and second quarters. As a result of the performance of our workover activity and non-op development projects, we increased the midpoint of our production guidance by 5% to approximately 20,750 Boe per day and we've also increased the midpoint of our adjusted EBITDA guidance by 8% to $105 million."
