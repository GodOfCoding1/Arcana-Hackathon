    "content": " Capital spending during the third quarter was approximately $9.9 million, primarily related to workover activity in Oklahoma, non-operated development in Eagle Ford and facilities maintenance at Bairoil and Beta. Free cash flow defined as the adjusted EBITDA less CapEx and cash interest expense was $17 million in the third quarter of 2022, which compares to $14.3 million in the first half of the year. As a result of this program, Oklahoma production increased approximately 5% in the third quarter from 6,500 to 6,800 Boe per day, and the field achieved its highest quarterly production rate since the first quarter of 2021. Lease operating expenses for the third quarter were approximately $32 million or $16.56 per Boe, a decrease from $33.3 million or $17.91 per Boe for the second quarter, primarily attributable to lower workover cost at Bairoil. Third quarter, cash G&A totaled $6.1 million or $3.16 per Boe compared to $7.7 million or $4.16 per Boe in the second quarter, primarily due to a decrease in certain professional and advisor fees. Cash capital spending for the third quarter was approximately $9.9 million, a decrease of $3.6 million from the second quarter primarily related to reduced capital in the East Texas and Bairoil. As we progress into 2023, we expect to not only continue generating the current level of quarterly free cash flow, but we anticipate materially increasing our free cash flow profile as our hedge book continues to roll-off and the Beta field is returned to production. Currently, our forecasted 2022 to 2024 cumulative free cash flow is estimated to be approximately $235 million at current strip pricing and we are projecting to improve our leverage to under one times by the third quarter of 2023."
