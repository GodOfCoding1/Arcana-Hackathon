    "content": " We expect our CapEx to be roughly broken down as follows: approximately 4% of revenue for our delivery business; approximately 9% of revenue for our compute business, of which roughly $100 million of that will be for internal workloads moving in-house and the remainder for future revenue growth; approximately 7% of revenue for capitalized software; and the remaining about 1% for IT and facility-related spend. But if I just do a rough back of the envelope numbers, right, with 9% of total revenue being CapEx, specifically for the compute business and then I strip out $100 million of nonrecurring, that's still telling me that CapEx -- compute CapEx this year in 2023 is going to be 45% of compute revenue, which, again, it's a growing business and everything."
