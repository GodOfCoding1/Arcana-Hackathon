    "content": " Our Security Solutions generated revenue of $381 million in Q2, up 17% year-over-year and up 21% in constant currency. Overall, our Zero Trust solutions delivered $43 million of revenue in Q2, up 59% year-over-year in constant currency. I'm very pleased to report that the revenue for our Compute product group was $106 million in Q2, up 74% year-over-year and up 78% in constant currency. Our Delivery products generated revenue of $417 million in Q2, down 11% year-over-year and down 8% in constant currency. While these are challenging times to be sure, I believe that Akamai is on the right track for long-term growth and success and that we're well positioned because of our unique global-edge platform, our market-leading security and delivery solutions, our new compute capabilities which provide great performance at an affordable cost, our premier enterprise customer base and our strong financial position and profitable business model. Security revenue was $381 million and grew 17% year-over-year and 21% in constant currency, with continued strength from our Zero Trust business led by Guardicore. As mentioned previously, the near-term decline in operating margin is due to slower traffic and revenue growth, our annual merit-based wage increase, which become effective July 1, the negative impact from foreign exchange, investments associated with Guardicore and Linode and increased third-party cloud costs."
