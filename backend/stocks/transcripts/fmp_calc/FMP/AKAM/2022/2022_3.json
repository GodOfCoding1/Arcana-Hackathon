    "content": " Our compute product group also performed well in Q3 with revenue of $109 million, up 72% year-over-year and up 77% in constant currency. Our delivery products generated revenue of $393 million in Q3, down 15% year-over-year and down 11% in constant currency. While this resulted in less revenue in Q3, it's enabled us to meaningfully lower our delivery network CapEx as we direct cash flow from our delivery business to our compute and security businesses where we have a higher ROI. As you look to the future, the big growth comes when we're tapping into the core cloud compute market, a market that's over $100 billion today and growing rapidly. So the big growth for us, what we're really going after over the next several years is in that core cloud compute market, mission-critical applications for major enterprises because that's a very big potential market for us. With our business, given it's a SaaS business and we've got recurring revenue contracts are constantly going through and renewing contracts, what you're seeing is some customers that are talking about, say, adding Page Integrity Manager or a Bot Manager or Account Protector, just pushing that off into the future as they go through their budget cycle. Since we're lapping, in constant currency that is -- since you're lapping the Guardicore acquisition at this point, and we just came off a 15% organic growth rate, if you back up the contribution from Guardicore in Q3, that's probably a reasonable number."
