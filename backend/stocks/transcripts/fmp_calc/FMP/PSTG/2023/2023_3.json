    "content": " We're seeing the same in large enterprises, although I would say that that's in an earlier phase right now, but FlashArray//C has been an incredible grower for us, and that does compete largely with the hybrid disk market, and we think we'll be able to go after the non-hybrid, that is the what's called the near line market, as we go into this New Year. When you think about the economics of our Phase 2 shipments to Meta, when comparing that to our Phase 1 shipments back in Q3 of last year, without getting into specifics, we did make some modifications to the deal structure of Phase 2, which actually resulted in less revenue and improved product gross margins, because obviously, you see the strength of our product gross margins this quarter, especially compared to Q3 of last year. I wanted to see how you're thinking about product gross margins in light of the idea that memory prices appear to have come down and look like they'll be down meaningfully over at least the next several quarters, and I appreciate the fact that there are other inputs but I imagine that's a pretty significant contributor to your bill of materials."
