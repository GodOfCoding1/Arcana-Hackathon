    "content": " As a result of our asset recycling over the past 12 months, more than 80% of our portfolio rent now come from mixed use and retail properties, up from 68% this time last year and single tenant properties now represent just 16% of our overall rents, down from 60% at the end of the first quarter of 2021. As John previously referenced, we did report same-property NOI growth of 17.7% for the first quarter given the rebalancing of the portfolio over the past few years, we haven\u2019t historically reported this metric. As previously announced, the company paid a first quarter regular cash dividend of $1.08 per share, which is an 8% increase over the company\u2019s Q4 2021 cash dividend and a current annualized yield of approximately 6.8%. And so, didn\u2019t know how you got down to averaging essentially 114 per share in the remaining three quarters or anything close to that I mean obviously interest rates are probably some sort of a drag, but when think it\u2019s a $0.10 or $0.20 a share drag on that, especially given the lack of dispositions."
