    "content": " Our excellent Q2 year-over-year same-store NOI growth of nearly 24% was driven by a combination of contractual rent increases, strategic reductions in operating expenses, some non-repeatable one-time items and new leases coming online in the historically vacant space. As previously announced, the company paid a second quarter regular cash dividend of $1.12 per share, which is a 12% year-over-year increase over the company's Q2 2021 cash dividend and a 4% increase over our Q1 2022 quarterly cash dividend and a current stock split adjusted annualized yield of approximately 7%. It was a quiet quarter on the capital markets front, but we did issue just over 88,000 shares of common stock through ATM program for net proceeds of $5.7 million at an average issuance price of just over $66 per share or $22 per share after adjusting for the 3-for-1 stock split."
