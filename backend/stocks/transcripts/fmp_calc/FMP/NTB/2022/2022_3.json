    "content": " In terms of the longer term question, that's kind of what we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been trying to do I guess while still investing in the business in terms of generating more fee income from the Trust acquisition so stabilizing and growing non-correlated income to our home jurisdictions being our banking jurisdictions Bermuda and Cayman and Channel Islands, where as a Trust fee revenue is, annuity revenue capital efficient, and the underlying economic activity in our business doesn't correlate particularly to the domestic economic picture of where we are and so doing these small add-on trust acquisitions ultimately will help stabilize the fee income and give us better platform for capital return overall, whilst making all of our jurisdictions profitable."
