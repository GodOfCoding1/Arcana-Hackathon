    "content": " Since our second quarter call, the U.S. dollar has further strengthened, and we now expect this headwind to impact our adjusted EBITDA outlook by an additional $10 million to $20 million, another macro headwind that we continue to watch as we implement our pricing actions related to input costs. Accordingly, we believe such costs represent an additional $10 million to $20 million headwind to our full year 2022 outlook, but should begin to abate in 2023 when our full pricing actions are reflected. As it relates to adjusted EBITDA, consolidated adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter was $88 million, a 17.4% decrease as compared to the prior year quarter or a 2.5% decrease in constant currency. Based on these items, we're updating our full year revenue guide to mid-single-digit percentage growth, which would be mid-teens growth in constant currency, and we're lowering the adjusted EBITDA outlook for the full year to at least $330 million. So look, I think when we last spoke to you, we said we might have $20 million to $30 million of top line that would move potentially out of the third quarter into the fourth quarter just because there could be some backlog in delivering to customers."
