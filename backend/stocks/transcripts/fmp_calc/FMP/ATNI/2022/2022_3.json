    "content": " (Operating income was $13.4 million and Adjusted EBITDA) for the segment was $27.9 million in the quarter, up 3.77% year-over-year, driven by subscriber growth, as well as operational investments in customer acquisition, additional back-haul capacity, and increased resiliency to support our higher mobile and broadband revenue in the segment. In line with our consolidated performance drivers, the increase in segment revenues was mainly due to the addition of a full quarter of Alaska's results, compared to a partial quarter in the same period a year ago, along with solid organic revenue growth year-over-year."
