    "content": " Now looking at this year's performance, revenue grew 20% to $726 million, largely reflective of our successful acquisition of Alaska Communication, together with solid execution and the growing high-speed data and mobile customer base that continues to exhibit strong demand for the services we offer. Adjusted EBITDA for the segment was $29.1 million in the quarter, up 4% year-over-year driven by the subscriber revenue growth, partially offset by higher sales and marketing costs and network investments supporting that growth. Adjusted EBITDA for the U.S. segment was $22.9 million in the quarter, up 3% year-over-year, mainly due to the same factors that led to higher segment revenues in the period. As detailed in our press release, our outlook for 2023 is as follows: adjusted EBITDA in the range of $183 million to $193 million for the full year with somewhat more of the year-on-year growth expected in the second half of the year. Our business targets for the three-year period ending 2024 remain unchanged with the exception of our net debt ratio, which we now anticipate to be approximately 2x at the end of 2024, with additional debt following the close of the Sacred Wind transaction, higher borrowing costs than anticipated at the start of 2022 and additional fiber investment opportunities in Alaska. The outlook for the full three-year period otherwise remains as follows: revenue compounded annual growth rate of 4% to 6% from 2021 to 2024, excluding construction revenue, adjusted EBITDA CAGR of 8% to 10% over the same three-year period, which was not impacted by the definition change to exclude stock-based compensation as we're comparing to pro forma adjusted EBITDA for both '21 and '22."
