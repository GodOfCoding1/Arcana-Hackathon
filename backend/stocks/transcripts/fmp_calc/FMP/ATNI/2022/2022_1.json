    "content": " In particular, our market leadership in the more mature Caribbean island markets has continued to deliver steady cash flows for reinvestments - reinvestment in markets with higher growth potential, including Alaska, Guyana and the Southwestern U.S., as well as for upgrades to our existing network infrastructure in our other markets. Taking a step back, our glass and steel and first fiber strategy is positioning us well to meet our three year growth objectives, including three years of projected annual EBITDA growth, which we initially laid out for investors with last quarter's earnings release. In the first quarter, total consolidated revenues were $172 million, up 38% year-over-year, largely due to the Alaska Communications contribution. Adjusted EBITDA in the segment was $19.6 million for the quarter versus $4.6 million a year ago, led by the higher fixed and carrier revenues from Alaska."
