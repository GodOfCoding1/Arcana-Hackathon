    "content": " Periods like what we are currently seeing in the first quarter, although temporary in our view, are why we chose to prepay over 60% of our debt over the last two years, substantially reducing our financial leverage and bringing our cash flow breakeven rate down to industry lows, a core differentiator for Genco compared to the peer group. Walking down the formula, this resulted from operating cash flow of $46.6 million less debt repayments of $8.75 million, drydocking ballast water treatment systems and energy saving device costs of $5.5 million and the previously announced reserve of $10.75 million."
