    "content": " 05:28 From an earnings perspective, we generated a strong time charter equivalent rate during the quarter of $24,093 per day, an increase of 98% from the same period of 2021, as we benefited from our past success fixing forward cargoes and period time charters ahead of a seasonally softer first quarter rate environment. 05:51 Looking ahead to the second quarter of 2022, we expect a sequential rise in time charter equivalent rates as we have approximately 68% of our available days booked at over $27,500 per day, highlighting our significant operating leverage to improving market conditions, our sizable fleet, our best-in-class commercial platform and barbell approach to fleet composition. Our cash position as of March 31, 2022 was $49.1 million following $48.75 million of debt repayments during the quarter, as well as $40.8 million paid to acquire the two vessels in January. In Q1 2022, we voluntarily paid down debt totaling $48.75 million, which consisted of $8.75 million of our run rate quarterly voluntary debt repayment, together with an additional prepayment of the revolver of $40 million, which was part of the working capital management exercise to save interest expense without impacting the dividend calculation."
