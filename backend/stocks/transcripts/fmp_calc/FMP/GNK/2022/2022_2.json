    "content": " Most notably, we declared a dividend of $0.50 per share for the second quarter of 2022 representing an annualized yield of 10% based on our current share price. Following are substantial deleveraging since the beginning of 2021, our debt outstanding was $189 million as of the end of the second quarter, which resulted in net debt of $138 million. Importantly, included in our expenses for the quarter was one-time expenses of $9.3 million for ballast water treatment systems, as well as savings - energy savings devices, which we estimated to have a payback period of two to three years and believed continue to enhance shareholder returns over the long-term. Included in that figure is we expect to reserve a $10.75 million, which is based on $8.75 million of voluntary debt repayments expected to be made in the third quarter, as well as estimated cash interest expense. The $8.75 million that you're reserving each quarter in anticipation of the dividend, how should we think about you actually making those prepayments you've been doing that, as we think about the third quarter, fourth quarter - with some visibility, do you think that you'll be continuing to pay down, say, that $8.75 million, rather than it being a reserve, is it actually going to continue to be utilized to paydown the facility? So the - some of - as you rightfully pointed out, some of the expenses from Q2 slipped into Q3 and Q4, having said that, we are coming off of $22.5 million of drydock CapEx-related expenses into $6.8 million of CapEx-related expenses for the third quarter, so significantly lower."
