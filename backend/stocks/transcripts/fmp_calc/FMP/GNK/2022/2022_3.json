    "content": " Notably, we declared a dividend of $0.78 per share for the third quarter of 2022, representing an increase of 56% compared to Q2 and an annualized yield of 22% based on our current share price. Since implementing our value strategy, which is focused on paying meaningful and sustainable dividends throughout the cycles, deleveraging and positioning Genco to capitalize on compelling growth opportunities, we have declared four quarterly dividends totaling $2.74 per share per yield of 22%. For the third quarter, we drew on our significant operating leverage, generating a solid time charter equivalent rate of $23,624 per day as we capitalized on the cargo and time charter coverage we put in place during a strong Q2 market. The prudent approach of taking forward cargo coverage during the period of market strength and then significant benchmark freight outperformance during Q3 2022 particularly on our minor bulk fleet, specifically our Ultramax and Supramax TCE during Q3 2022 was approximately $7,000 per day higher than the Baltic Supramax Index average for the quarter. Looking ahead, our estimated TCE for the fourth quarter based on fixtures to-date represents coverage of over 75% of available days and approximately $20,500 per day well above current spot rates of $12,000 and $14,000 a day for Capesize and Supramax vessels respectively."
