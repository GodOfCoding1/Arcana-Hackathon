    "content": " I'm excited by what 2023 has in store for Passage Bio, and I'm pleased to report that the year is already off to a strong start, with the presentation of additional data from cohorts 1 through 3 of our Imagine-1 clinical trial for GM1 gangliosidosis at the WORLDSymposium last month. To date, we've completed dosing of the first four cohorts in our Imagine-1 study for a total of eight patients and look forward to reporting initial data from Cohort 4, which is early infantile patients treated with a high dose by midyear. Based on the encouraging data we have generated thus far and our supporting preclinical data, we are moving forward with plans to treat additional patients with a higher dose than doses administered in Cohorts 1 through 4. Based on the favorable safety profile of PBGM01 to date, the observed dose response in key biomarkers and supporting pre-clinical data, we plan to treat additional patients at a higher dose than has currently been evaluated in the first four cohorts. By mid-2023, from our Imagine-1 study, we plan to report initial safety and biomarker data from cohort 4, which is early infantile patient's treated with a high dose. In the second half of 2023, we look forward to dosing the first GM1 patient at a higher dose than those previously evaluated, and to reporting initial safety and biomarker data from cohort 1 of our uplifted study. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open."
