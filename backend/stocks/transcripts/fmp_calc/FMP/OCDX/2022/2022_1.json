    "content": " Our core revenue, excluding COVID assay revenue grew slightly over 4% in constant currency in the quarter, with solid growth in both transfusion medicine and non-COVID immunoassays. Excluding the 360 basis point headwind from year-over-year COVID assay sales, core revenue growth was up just over 4%, primarily driven by the solid recurring revenue pull-through on the instruments we placed over the last couple of years across our geographies in both clinical labs and transfusion medicine. Turning to our Q1 performance by line of business, clinical labs revenue, excluding COVID assay sales, grew 1% and largely driven by strength in immunoassay, partially offset by softness in clin chemistry, particularly with analyzers due to the previously mentioned building our open orders, as well as the COVID lockdowns in China. We had a solid quarter to start the year with 4% of constant currency growth in our core business, excluding the COVID assay and 28% adjusted EBITDA margins despite global supply chain challenges, the shutdowns in China and the Russian/Ukraine war."
