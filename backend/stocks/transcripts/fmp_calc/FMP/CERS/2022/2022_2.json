    "content": " As Vivek noted in his remarks, we posted strong second quarter 2022 product revenue of $41 million, which reflected year-over-year growth of 30% and was led by sales in North America during the quarter. So, I know  for Kevin, we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really offer quarterly guidance, but I think there's confidence in the team we can continue see product adoption, but there are some very real headwinds we faced as we ended the second half of the year. I'll let Vivek speak to, sort of what's happening at the hospital level with regard to staffing and things like that, but we're clearly seeing the interest in the clinical benefit for the product being able to provide fiber engine early to bleeding patients who are being diagnosed with fibrinogen deficiency, as well as the operational benefits for blood centers and hospitals of not having to worry about wastage rates and or having to thaw product in an expedited way to try and get into a coagulopathic patient. I wanted to just ask about the reiteration of product revenue guidance, it seems like that is \u00e2\u0080\u0093 represents still nice strong momentum in the business, as a further business displayed with the 2Q results, you're absorbing a couple million in FX headwinds and maybe a slower start to IFC, but guess my question is really just thinking about the INTERCEPT platelet business and the momentum there."
