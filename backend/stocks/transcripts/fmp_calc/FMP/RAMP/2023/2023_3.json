    "content": " On our last call, I outlined several efforts we had implemented to reaccelerate top line growth: one, improve our US sales force productivity; two, deepened channel partnerships; three, expand our network of destinations; and four, something I don't think I talked about as much but is always happening, continuous product improvement. I think this can be a major driver of future growth for us, but let me also caution that we're still in the early rollout with many of these partnerships and we know that the sales cycles typically span two to three quarters. Usage was 16% of subscription revenue, driven by data providers, platform partners and the $4 million onetime contract settlement. Now over time, you're going to see an additional potential revenue driver, because just as our major marketing partners recognize that they have really valuable first party data, so to do all those destinations, whether it be Disney or Pinterest, and I talked about this with the Pinterest example, they recognize they have valuable first party data. We wanted to get out in front of guidance for next year and talk about things in broad brush strokes, but we will learn a lot more in the next quarter or so before our fiscal year starts by seeing how the macro economy develops, what happens to data marketplace and how our cloud partnerships continue to develop as well."
