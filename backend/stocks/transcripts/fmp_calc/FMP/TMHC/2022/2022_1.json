    "content": " To that end, to help us maintain strong mortgage capture rates and offer our customers increased protection and peace of mind in today\u2019s uncertain rate environment, Taylor Morrison Home Funding recently introduced a new extended rate loss program that allows our new shoppers to cost effectively secure an interest rate for up to 1 year. In fact, last year, when land price inflation was accelerating, we grew our land portfolio by 10% when the industry\u2019s lot supply increased by roughly a third, highlighting the favorable position we are in to be more patient when deploying our investment dollars. But I would tell you that the overall mix of the business, when I look at the consumer groups and you\u2019re seeing over the quarters, Alan, 3%, 4% movement between the segments year-over-year, I kind of like where we\u2019re at. I would just reiterate, I think that the balance is: a, very intentional; and b, as we take a step backward, we look at kind of the underwriting in terms of what\u2019s coming through that we can expect to see over the coming years, it\u2019s pretty consistent, and that\u2019s intentional. I think the last thing, Erik, would just be when we look at kind of the margin return margin expectations, over the last 12, 24 months, they have actually been some of the highest we\u2019ve seen in years and years. So absolutely, I think even as a build-to-suit and we\u2019re, I would call us a fairly balanced builder, I know going into \u201821 and coming out of \u201820, we had a very strong to-be-built business, which actually hurt us a bit last year with what we saw lumber and everything. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. Your line is now open."
