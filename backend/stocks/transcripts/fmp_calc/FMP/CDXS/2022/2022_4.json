    "content": " The financial results that we delivered in the fourth quarter were exactly on target and we ended 2022 with $114 million in cash, providing us with runway through the end of 2024 and giving us plenty of time to demonstrate that our new focus strategy is working. Product revenues for 2022 were $116.7 million, an increase of 65% from $70.7 million the prior year, primarily driven by enzyme sales related to tax Slovin, -- excluding these sales, total product revenues for fiscal year 2022 were $41.3 million, an increase of 14% from $36.1 million in the prior year. So, we haven't gone as far to provide quarter-over-quarter guidance yet on revenue, we're very comfortable with the full year range of the $63 million to $68 million for total revenue. Certainly, we're starting the year in a strong cash position with $114 million that provides those 2 years of runway and funds the programs that we talked about on the call today, including moving 7108 forward gene therapy programs as well as RNA and DNA synthesis."
