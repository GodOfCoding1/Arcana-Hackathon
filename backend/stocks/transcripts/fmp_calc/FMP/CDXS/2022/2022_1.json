    "content": " During this call, management will be making a number of forward-looking statements within the meaning of Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including our guidance for 2022 revenues, product revenues, and gross margin on product revenues, prospects for our life sciences tools, crude sector and biotherapeutics product businesses, and our expectations regarding the sales of one of our proprietary enzymes to Pfizer for the manufacturer of their COVID 19 antiviral therapeutic Paxlovid. The increase was due to additional sales of Enzyme to Pfizer for Paxlovid, which represented $21.3 million in product revenues in the first quarter of 2022, compared to $0.4 million in the first quarter of last year. Product revenues are expected to be in a range of $112 million to $118 million, including approximately $75 million to $80 million related to Codexis' proprietary high performance enzyme used by Pfizer to manufacture Paxlovid. We've seen nice growth in the food area, we highlighted that some early R&D work in the other industrial verticals is starting to unfold for us, and there's early R&D revenue-generation there, and we hope to see that continue to grow, and we also shared that we expect to unfold a new Biotherapeutics partnering deal before the end of this year, so that clearly would add to our expectations for being able to deliver the expected R&D revenues for the company over the full year."
