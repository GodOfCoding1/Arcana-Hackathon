    "content": " Our second quarter highlights, we improve the adjusted EBITDA, excluding the securitization gain in Q1 by $51 million, or 38% sequentially, or ecommerce gross profit per unit or GPPU was $3,629 reflecting progress toward our long-term goal. We reduced adjusted SG&A by $52 million sequentially. Given our quarter-over-quarter adjusted EBITDA improvement and our focus on profitability and liquidity over growth, for the year we currently expect to be at the low end or below are forecasted ecommerce units near or better than the midpoint of our forecasted adjusted EBITDA loss range, meaning an EBITDA loss between $325 million to $350 million and near the midpoint of our previously forecasted liquidity range. SG&A for marketing, we reduced our marketing costs $15 million sequentially, and saw improvement in our cost per opportunity as we focused on our high return on investment marketing channels. In total, we delivered approximately $59 million of improvement in adjusted EBITDA excluding securitization gain and non-recurring costs to address operational and customer experience issues. We reduced adjusted SG&A by $52 million sequentially. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open."
