    "content": " Our GPPU for un-aged units or units we owned less than 270 days was in the mid 3,000s excluding the inventory reserve. As of the end of the fourth quarter, 87% of units were available for sale or pending sale, versus 52% at the end of the third quarter. Our GPPU for un-aged units or units we owned less than 270 days was in the mid 3,000s excluding the inventory reserve. As of the end of the fourth quarter, 87% of units were available for sale or pending sale, versus 52% at the end of the third quarter. The team did a tremendous job in 2022, pursuing balance sheet cash opportunities, along with a convertible note repurchases completed in the third and fourth quarters, we have reduced our net long-term debt by over $200 million from the second quarter of this year. Starting with adjusted EBITDA performance, excluding securitization gain and non-recurring costs, adjusted EBITDA improved $3 million quarter-over-quarter. For the full-year 2023, we expect adjusted EBITDA loss of $200 million to $250 million, which is a $112 million midpoint improvement year-over-year compared to 2022 adjusted EBITDA. Beginning with our adjusted EBITDA loss midpoint of $225 million, as I mentioned in my earlier comments, during 2023, we expect to continue to incur significant costs related to legacy operational issues. Finally, with respect to the fourth quarter of this year, we expect our Q4 2023 adjusted EBITDA to be markedly improved from our current adjusted EBITDA run rate, we believe our estimated Q4 2023 adjusted EBITDA run rate along with continued unit growth and operational improvements, positions the business well for 2024 and beyond."
