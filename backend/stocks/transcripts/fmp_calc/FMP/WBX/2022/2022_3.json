    "content": " In addition to reviewing highlights from the third quarter of 2022, I will also share some thoughts on the current market we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re experiencing, and provide you with some insights into our fast charging portfolio, both Supernova and Hypernova, including detail on customers, production, and backlog. Our Q3 results were fueled by exceptional strength in North America, growing revenue by 535%, and key European markets, including 270% growth in France, 160% in Belgium, 130% in Italy and the Netherlands, and 125% in Spain, all on a year over year basis. For the third quarter 2022, revenue was EUR44.1 million, a 140% increase from the year-ago period, driven by strength across multiple regions and products. Given what we see and have discussed here today, we expect consolidated revenues in the fourth quarter of between EUR42 million and EUR52 million, or growth of approximately 60% to 100% year over year. For the full year 2022, this results in expected revenue of between EUR154 million and EUR164 million, representing an approximate annual growth rate of between 115% and 130% percent. And just building on that, can you talk about like how should we think about gross margin, because for 2022 I think gross margins are more or less in line with expectations 40% though, but for \u00e2\u0080\u009823 with the new capacity ramping up in the U.S. markets these lower sales impacted sort of  that would be helpful. But we will give you more detail, but I think overall, we're in a very good position to be working on the gross margins we expected, because again thanks to ARES, thanks to improvements on cost efficiencies and design to cost and increase of volumes, we will be able to manage a potential reduction, given the fact that we are launching new products and will become an important percentage of our revenue."
