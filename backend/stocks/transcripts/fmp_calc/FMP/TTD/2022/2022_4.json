    "content": " Not only is the shift from linear to CTV driving significant growth in digital spend as advertisers shift dollars from linear TV to connected TV, but more spend is happening outside the walled gardens as advertisers shift spend from user-generated content to premium streaming content. And because of the fact that we have already integrated with most of the largest content owners, at least in North America and many of the leading CTV countries around the world, we think as we pointed out, we are one of the unique companies to be able to host an event like that as well as to build the market that makes it possible for forward contracts to be established on an always-on basis."
