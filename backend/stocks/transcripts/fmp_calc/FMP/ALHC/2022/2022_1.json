So I think we\u2019re kind of heading down the path of staying consistent with our approach, and we want to continue to work with these brokers who we\u2019ve known for many, many years, who are great supporters of us really understand our value proposition, not just in terms of the benefit richness, but also the overall experience of what it means to be a part of Alignment. That\u2019s really a function of a lot of the great operational progress last year and just less of an impact of COVID for prior year dates of service as compared to our 2021 Q1, our 2021 payment year where obviously, we\u2019re coming out of the back part of COVID in 2020, and it has a disruptive effect across the industry. And the way we\u2019ve approached it is to be really focused on ensuring that we have all the data we could possibly capture in-house on our membership and tracking it not just from a utilization perspective, but also looking at the actual form of utilization where the sites of service are occurring, which cases might be high-cost outliers to ensure that when we close our books every quarter. What\u2019s really interesting to me is the again, the learnings from the last seven or eight years since we started the business, the providers from a lot of the large integrated delivery systems we\u2019re having conversations with in the context of helping them with value-based care."
