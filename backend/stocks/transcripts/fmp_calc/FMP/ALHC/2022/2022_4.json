    "content": " We previously shared a few highlights from the selling season, including a successful market launch in Fresno, California with 1,800 new members; improved performance in Southern California versus 2022, netting 16% growth year-over-year; a 50 basis point improvement in our California AEP voluntary disenrollment rate; and lastly, positive momentum in our states outside of California, with membership growth of more than 60% year-over-year. Our total revenue in 2022 grew 23% to $1.434 billion, Further, our adjusted gross profit of $193.6 million reflected an MBR of 86.5% for the full year, driven by a continuation of strong medical outcomes in California, while Care Anywhere and our core medical management capabilities began to produce outcomes in our new states as well. Additionally, our ACO reach membership is increasing year-over-year, and we expect total program revenue of approximately $130 million, which represents over 150% growth compared to 2022 DCE revenue. So in terms of the -- kind of Southern California versus Northern California dynamics, what I would say is, really, from a macro standpoint or from a kind of portfolio management standpoint across our geographies, I think there will always be different competitors who are more aggressive and are kind of more focused on growth in certain years, and other competitors who are less focused on growth and are more focused on margin in certain years. And so as we reflect on kind of where the growth is that we've seen so far and our expectations for the year, I would say, based on the distribution of members by market, by product, by provider group, the corresponding new member revenue PMPMs across those different variables and our expected MLR for each of those different again, groups, markets and products, we are expecting our new member MBR to be slightly higher this year than '22."
