    "content": " Now turning to pre-tax pre-provision components of the income statement for the fourth quarter, tax equivalent net interest income was $168 million, which was up approximately $13.4 million or 8.7% from the third quarter, driven by higher interest income due to increases in loan yields on the company's variable rate loans due to rising market interest rates and average loan growth, as well as increases in investment income primarily due to increased yields on taxable securities."
