    "content": " To briefly recap, during the second quarter 2022, Sonic generated all-time record quarterly revenues of $3.7 billion, up 9% year-over-year and net income of $94.8 million or $2.33 per diluted share. Offsetting the lower sales volume, though, same-store retail new vehicle gross profit per unit was $6,905, a 77% increase year-over-year and 2% sequential increase from the first quarter. Beyond these operating results, we continued the nationwide expansion of EchoPark, opening three new EchoPark locations during the second quarter, including two retail hub locations in Raleigh and St. Louis, and remain on pace to reach 50% of U.S. population by the end of this year and 90% coverage by 2025. And it would be my guess that in the first or second quarter of '23, if nothing changes and inventory continue to kind of stay in this $27,000, $28,000, $29,000 price range for 1-to 4-year-old cars, and we don't improve from an overall used car availability perspective. And Rajat, this is Heath. And Rajat, this is Heath."
