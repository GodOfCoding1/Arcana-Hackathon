    "content": " Highlights from our fourth quarter performance include all-time record quarterly revenues of $3.6 billion, up 13% year-over-year and record fourth quarter gross profit of $576 million, up 9% year-over-year. Used vehicle gross profit was down 29%, driven by a 33% decrease in used retail GPU to $1,405 per unit, offset partially by a 6% increase in retail unit volume. Same-store F&I gross profit increased 11% on higher retail unit sales volume and fourth quarter record reported franchise dealership segment F&I gross profit per retail unit of $2,421, up 3% from the prior year. We reported record fourth quarter revenues of $589 million for EchoPark, up 2% from the prior year and gross profit of $41 million flat year-over-year. EchoPark average used vehicle selling price decreased 12% from the quarter -- from the third quarter, but at $29,500 per unit still remains well above target affordability levels. For the fourth quarter, five plus year old vehicles represented 19% of EchoPark retail used vehicle unit sales volume, which was flat from the third quarter of 2022, and our nonauction sourcing mix was 28% of sales in the fourth quarter compared to 32% in the third quarter. This sequential increase in adjusted EBITDA losses reflects a steeper than anticipated decline in used vehicle pricing during the fourth quarter, which resulted in a $533 per unit decrease in front-end used vehicle GPU compared to the third quarter. For the fourth quarter, omnichannel sales through our new e-commerce platform accounted for 38% of EchoPark's retail unit sales volume compared to 31% in the third quarter. We've got probably $10 million to $15 million of floor plan interest headwind at EchoPark this year with the higher volumes, to anticipate higher volumes on top of the higher rates that we've experienced and seen come about over the last three to five months."
