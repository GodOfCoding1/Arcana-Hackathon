    "content": " In Q3, Baidu Core ad revenue was down 4% year-over-year, but improved from the second quarter's 10% year-over-year decline, as macro has improved gradually since June. Baidu Apollo auto solutions continued to gain traction among leading automakers and the total projected accumulated sales reached RMB 11.4 billion recently, growing more than 50% year-over-year. Baidu Core online marketing revenue was RMB18.7 billion, decreasing 4% year-over-year, but improved 10% from the second quarter as macro has improved gradually since June. Baidu Core, non-online marketing revenue was RMB6.5 billion, up 25% year-over-year, driven by cloud and other AI power businesses. Baidu Core, cost of revenue was RMB10.7 billion, increasing 15%, 1-5, year-over-year, which was in line with the growth in sales of AI Cloud and other AI power businesses. For auto solutions, Zhenyu Li mentioned just now, we already have a projected cumulative sales of around RMB11.4 billion, while revenue contribution is still very small at this stage, and we expect it to see more revenue keying from the second half of next year or maybe early in 2024, as small cars with our solutions can become available in the market."
