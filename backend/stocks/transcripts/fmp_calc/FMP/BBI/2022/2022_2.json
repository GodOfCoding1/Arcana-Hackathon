    "symbol": "BBI",
    "quarter": 2,
    "year": 2022,
    "date": "2022-08-11 18:27:28",
    "content": " This is highlighted by the SAD/MAD top line results from the BBI-02 Phase 1 study, which we expect to announce in early 2023 and the continued development and characterization of our other novel therapeutic candidates, including BBI-10 and our next generation kinase inhibitor platform. So we have already planned to carry out some of the in vitro metabolism study, solubility, we are really interested to get an early read on SIP inhibition, induction, plasma protein binding, so that's just the gamut of data is going to help us starting the IND enabling study next year. I think the quarter as you see is far more representative of what our spend going forward will look like, with R&D expenses $1.9 million in the second quarter and that's pharma representative of what it'll look like plus or minus of some as we do this Phase 1 work."
