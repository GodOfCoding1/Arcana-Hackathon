    "content": " This includes a first-in-human Phase 1 study that is set to start imminently for our lead DYRK1A inhibitor BBI-02, the development of our lead STING inhibitor, BBI-10, and the advancement of our next generation kinase inhibitors through early preclinical stage studies in 2022. As Rob just mentioned, our team is thrilled to now be fully focused on the advancement of our novel drug candidates in the immuno therapeutic space, including our potential first-in-class DYRK1A inhibitor, BBI-02 into the clinic and preclinical development of our novel STING inhibitor and next generation kinase inhibitor platform. This decrease was almost fully offset by increases of $2 million in upfront costs related to Brickell\u2019s acquisition of the STING inhibitor platform from Carna, $0.7 million in development costs related to BBI-02 and $0.4 million related to personnel and other expenses. This includes the SAD/MAD topline results from the 101 study of BBI-02, and further development and characterization of the STING inhibitor program, including BBI-10, and our next generation kinase inhibitor platform."
