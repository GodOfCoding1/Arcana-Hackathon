    "content": " First, the conclusion of the 2022 cycle with 100% of ACV recognition to a top line of BRL1.561 billion, representing a 48% year-over-year growth. And third, the outlook for 2023 with commercial cycle for our pedagogical solutions indicating a strong 24% organic growth for the 2023 cycle and integration and efficiency initiatives, leading to a better cash generation profile. Moving to Slide 5, after two years delivering net revenue below the ACV, as COVID-19 led to students dropping out of the school due to the healthy and economic reasons, we delivered 100% of the 2022 cycle ACV for both Core and Supplemental segments. Several initiatives were put in place since 2021 and the results for the first nine months of 2022 reflect our strong commitment to delivering higher cash generation with important improvement in four main areas: adjusted EBITDA, working capital, taxes and CapEx. Moving to Slide 16, we present our ACV guidance for the 2023 cycle of approximately BRL1.930 billion, representing a 24% organic growth versus 2022 cycle. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. I would say that even though we're not breaking down the number Core grew above 20% and Supplemental Pedagogical Solutions grew above 30% which was, let's say, a profile of growth in terms of the difference between Core and Supplemental that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re used to seeing before the pandemic. Thank you very much. Thank you very much."
