    "content": " On cash generation, we showed improvements on all metrics that drives free cash flow generation, including higher profitability with 150 basis point expansion of our adjusted EBITDA margin to 36.5%, better capital allocation, taking our CapEx back to historical levels at 9% of revenues, lower working capital consumption, and finally, a lower effective tax rate. We posted intake and a strong price increase across all brands leading to a 24% year-over-year ACV growth to R$1.9 billion, 100% organic. Our two main Core brands combined and sustained high growth rates at 96% in our most recent acquired brand COC delivered good results in terms of growth, retention, and price increase. Moving to Slide 5, net revenues for the fourth quarter of 2022 were R$679 millions, a 47% increase year-over-year and representing a 34.7% revenue recognition of the 2023 ACV, which will detail a few slides ahead. Despite a 62% increase in costs year-over-year, mainly due to pressures coming from paper prices, we managed to deliver on 150 basis points EBITDA margin expansion year-over-year in 2022 due to the 4% contraction in our G&A and a more efficient sales process. Despite increasing the number of Core students using one or more Supplemental Content Solutions to 18% from 15% in 2022 school year, there is still room to increase this penetration and are convinced of the benefits of this strategy to the entire portfolio."
