    "content": " Net revenues for the first quarter of 2022 were BRL430 million, a strong 30% top line growth year-over-year and representing 27.6% revenue recognition of the 2022 ACV. To neutralize this unusual seasonal effect, we are presenting top line growth for the first four months of 2022, which increased by 47% year-over-year or 32% excluding the acquisitions. Selling expenses, excluding M&As that were not consolidated last year, grew in line with top line, as we strategically decided to anticipate some of our commercial initiatives to the first quarter, including higher investments in cross-selling to take advantage of the positive environment in schools across Brazil as students return to the classroom. Moving to slide 8, adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter reached BRL146.6 million, 24% above the first quarter of 2021, leading to a margin of 34.1% or 35.9% when excluding the acquisitions, flat year-over-year. Looking at the four-month figures, adjusted EBITDA jumped 64% year-over-year with a margin expansion of 300 basis points, which we think is a better proxy of how the business profitability is reflecting the strong topline growth expected for the year and internal efficiency initiatives."
