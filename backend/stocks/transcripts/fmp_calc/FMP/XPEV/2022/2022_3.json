    "content": " Despite near-term challenges brought by COVID-related restrictions and production ramp up, we are confident that the G9 will soon rank among the top three in terms of monthly sales volume in a battery electric SUV segment priced above RMB300,000 and draw closer to number one next year as we continue to enhance our brand recognition. As we continue to rollout new products and technologies, coupled with technology differentiation of our next-generation full-scenario ADAS products, we are confident that we will achieve a significant increase in sales volume and average selling price, gaining a revenue growth in 2023 that exceeds the industry average and increasing our market share. Now, in the past several years, I think not just ourselves, but a lot of our peers have been doing their best to actually identify and also improve their weak links in terms of, for example, safety, product quality, service quality and also cost control as well. The first one is to do changes in terms of our product planning, product development and also to have a higher efficiency and effectiveness in implementing our technology in our future products and also to control \u00e2\u0080\u0093 well, first of all, to be able to identify true demand and to control our investment in the month that has less value."
