    "content": " Moving to our international operation, third quarter sales outside the U.S. accounted for $39.8 million or 33% of sales, a 26% increase compared to Q3 last year. Starting with total revenue, InMode generated $121.2 million in the third quarter of 2022, a 29% year-over-year increase with a gross margin of 85% on a GAAP basis. Sales and marketing expenses increased to $43.1 million in the third quarter, compared to $30.8 million in the same period last year. Because during recession when you are strong and you have the ability to invest and you don't have to cut down in order to save and cut expenses in marketing, people et cetera, you're getting stronger when the recession will end, and eventually the recession will end whether it will start on the third quarter or in the middle of next year. But how what percentage maybe, Moshe, of your boxes out there in the U.S. or even globally have a Morpheus8 hand-piece and I would assume that a fairly easy upgrade to add to it, if I've got BodyTite, FaceTite, AccuTite kind of already on the box to add a Morpheus 8 hand-piece, is that kind of what's helping drive the revenue here as going back to those installed systems and adding Morpheus8?"
