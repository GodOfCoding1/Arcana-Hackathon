    "content": " Moving to our international operation, second quarter sales outside the U.S. accumulated accounted for $41.2 million or 36% of sales, a 33% increase compared to Q2 last year. Starting with total revenue, InMode generated $113.5 million in the second quarter of 2022, a 30% year-over-year increase with a gross margin of 83% on a GAAP basis. But I think this was your biggest quarter ever of global placements, so a couple of questions, I guess one what's been the tenor of demand even over the last couple months, it seems like financing rates are probably going up, there's a little bit of competitive noise out there that we continue to hear in the channel. So kind of what are your expectations maybe over the next six to 12 months in this macro and what are you seeing in the field and then kind of a second question on placement, you help us understand again it's a number we asked about quite frequently but what is penetration in the U.S. now for in the surgical derm and plastic surgery segment of the market, where do you see penetration at right now, how much room is left there? And then I guess my only other question really is just, Moshe, we only see it in the proxies once a year, but stock has been off here pretty meaningfully this year, has there been any level or interest from an insider buying standpoint, has anybody stepped up into buying at these levels internally and maybe same question for Yair, I think there's over $400 million of cash and marketable securities on the balance sheet at this point."
