Net income for the quarter on a GAAP basis was $31 million and $34.1 million on the non-GAAP basis, reflecting year-over-year growth of 16%. As a result of our strategy of focusing on selling more system on the global market, sales of capital equipment was strong, representing 84% of our total revenue in the first quarter. Looking at the international side of the business, first quarter sales outside the U.S. accounted for $32.3 million or 38% of total sales, a 50.6% increase compared to the same quarter last year. The U.S. remains the leading market for InMode and was the biggest contributor to our top line, with total first quarter sales amounting to $53.6 million compared to $44.1 million in the same quarter of 2021.
