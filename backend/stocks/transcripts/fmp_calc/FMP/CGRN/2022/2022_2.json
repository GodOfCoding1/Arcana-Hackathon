    "content": " We also now offer solutions that can help commercial and industrial or CNI customers with their energy efficiency and resiliency needs both saving them money and providing energy security, whether it's with a combined heat and power of our C-65 to 5 megawatt microturbine solutions are the new Baker Hughes 5 megawatts and 16 megawatt turbines or the custom heat recovery solutions through new partner Alfa Laval or food waste management or recycling solutions to new partner Waste2ES. Turning to Slide 13 you will see the financial results for the second quarter of fiscal 2022, which had revenue at $17.2 million up 15% compared to $14.9 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2021, as the prior year quarter was more heavily impacted by COVID-19 project list. While parts and service revenue which includes our FPP long term service contracts, rentals and distributor support subscription fee was $8.7 million, up 13%, $7.7 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2021. Gross margin as a percentage of revenue was 16% down from 17% in the year ago period, primarily due to expenses being lower in the prior year due to our COVID-19 business continuity plan, where we implemented cost saving measures such as furloughs, pay cuts, and travel restrictions, among other things, was partially offset by a higher volume of product and parts. And so, I think as we look at customers, we want to be their one stop shop for green energy micro grid based solutions, whether it's battery storage, solar, micro turbines, Baker, Hughes, biogas, you know, whatever their requirements are."
