    "content": " The long-term micro rental fleets, as I said increased 4.6 megawatts to 17.7. megawatts up from 13.1 megawatts during the quarter, as the company continues to execute against its plan to increase the micro turbine rental fleet to 21.1 megawatts by the end of our fiscal year, which is coming up here in March 31st, 2022. Turning to Slide 11, you'll see the financial results for the third quarter of fiscal 2022, which had revenue at $20.6 million compared to $20.7 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2021. Parts and service revenue, which includes our FPP long-term service contracts, rentals and distributor support subscription fee was $8.3 million up 5% from $7.9 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2021, primarily due to an increase in rental revenue. Gross margin as a percentage of revenue was 11%, down from 17% in the year ago period, primarily due to overhead expenses being lower in the prior year, due to our COVID-19 business continuity plan, where we implemented cost savings measures such as furloughs, pay cuts and travel restrictions among other things. We\u2019ll see the financial results for the nine months ended December 31, 2021, which had revenue at $53.9 million, up 8% compared to $49.8 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2021 as the prior year period was more heavily impacted by COVID-19 project delays. Over that five-year period, C1000 product sale with spare parts can generate approximately $1 million of revenue with approximately $200,000 in margin with a 20% margin as a percentage of revenue."
