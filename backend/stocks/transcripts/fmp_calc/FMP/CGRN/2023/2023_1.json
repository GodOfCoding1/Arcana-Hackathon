Margins for Q1 2023 were 25% compared to 6% in Q4 fiscal 2022, driven by this new Energy-as-a-Service business growth as well as a May price increase we implemented. For the same C1000 units, we can generate $1.8 million in revenue at a 60% margin over 5 years, this compares to a traditional product sale with spare parts for 5 years of $1 million and 20% margin. Parts, service and rental revenue which includes rentals FPP long-term service contracts and distributor support subscription fee was $9.5 million, up 22% from $7.8 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal '22, primarily due to an increase in rental revenue.
