However, gross margins for the quarter fell to 11% compared to 25% in the first quarter due to increased supply chain costs, specifically related to the C1000 enclosures and the need to source alternative recuperatior materials to meet customer delivery requirements during the quarter. Adjusted EDITDA improved 19% to negative $2.2 million from negative $2.7 million versus last year, but sequentially again was down from positive $400,000 in the first quarter. On a first half basis though, EBITDA improved 66% to negative $1.7 million for the first half of fiscal \u00e2\u0080\u009823 compared to negative $5 million last year. You see the EaaS rental revenue was $1.8 million for the second quarter, up $1.2 million or 200% from $0.6 million or $600,000 a year ago. Ending product backlog at September 30, 2022 was $28.9 million, up $4.1 million or 6.5% from $24.8 million in the June quarter. The first pillar was, reduce operating expenses by $4.3 million for the full fiscal year, led by restructuring the business around our Energy-as-a-Service model. Slide 9 shows the details of our adjusted EBITDA first half to the second quarter of fiscal \u00e2\u0080\u009823 versus the first half of fiscal \u00e2\u0080\u009822, showing our improvements in negative $5 million last year to negative $1.7 million this year in adjusted EBITDA. Parts, service and rental revenue, which includes the rentals, FPP long term service contracts and distributor support subscription fees were $10.2 million, up from $9.5 million in the first quarter of fiscal \u00e2\u0080\u009823. Adjusted EBITDA was a negative $2.2 million compared to adjusted EBITDA of a positive $400,000 in the first quarter of fiscal \u00e2\u0080\u009823. Turning to Slide 15, you will see the financial results for the second quarter of the fiscal year \u00e2\u0080\u009823 compared to the prior year period, which had revenue at $20.8 million compared to $17.2 million in the second quarter of fiscal \u00e2\u0080\u009822. We have analyzed it and it looks like if truly it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a 2-year improvement, we should see close rates go from roughly 13% in the U.S., to about 20% in the U.S. And so that would be $40 million to $50 million of improved business results on an annual basis."
