    "content": " That will put quite a bit of production in the second quarter to give us a much better start to the first half of the year in '23 as we had -- than we had in '22, as John noted earlier, probably just maybe a little less than 50% of the production will happen in the first half. You'll see earnings cadence, sort of follow that production ramp that you just outlined there and sort of the puts and takes between higher price in the first half of the year, lower production costs in the back half of the year. really, the bottom line, I think, for you all to take away is, we won't be as back-end loaded in '23 as we were in 2022, and we're doing everything to keep up just the outstanding production progress that you saw in the fourth quarter, and we believe we'll be able to continue with that execution into the first and second quarter of 2023. But overall, we're seeing kind of higher take rates for a lot of our existing technologies that have been in the market for the last couple of years, I would say anywhere from 5% to 10% higher take rates in 2023. Yes, Brent, just to add to that, I think an important comment that underscores why this is happening and why we're seeing these strong take rates is the current environment underscores the need for precision challenges of our customers are definitely more acute than they've ever, ever been and the need for our customers to do more with less is greater than it's been in the past, especially when you consider all the rising input costs, not just labor scarcity, but lack of skilled labor."
