Your line is open. Your line is open. As it relates to trade-offs, the question there is really, as you make some shift to moving from monetizing at point of sale to on a more recurring basis, we do expect to see some of that revenue really then move out of the upfront sale of the equipment and then incurred or received as we deliver that value on a more regular basis, whether that\u2019s per year or by usage, etcetera. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. I think the point being that we are making there is today, we monetize very heavy at point of sale, and the opportunity to make that more accessible and see that technology is carrying that type of model to be more heavily adopted, more quickly adopted across more jobs, more acres at that different price point and really tied closer to the value that\u2019s created through the technology is a significant opportunity for our customers and for us to be able to move forward. Your line is open."
