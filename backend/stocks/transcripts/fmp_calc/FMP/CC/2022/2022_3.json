    "content": " Your line is open. I think to compare periods, I would advise folks to look at sort of a rolling 12 months performance on our TiO2 business, which we expect to be much better with TBS even with some of the high cost inputs that we're running through in the next couple of quarters. Your line is open. So the way I think about the company today is clearly TT is going through an adjustment as we deal with lower demand, but the team is really focused on the cost side and bringing our inventories into line here in the next couple of quarters. Your line is open. Your line is open. Clearly, I think we're acknowledging as we have in our materials that we're going through a bit of an adjustment on TT and really it's trying to align our production schedules with demand in a way that allows us to finish the year with better inventories on our own side. Your line is open. Matt, there are a couple of things I would add as you kind of think about the pricing and the mixes of the businesses, also the aftermarket side of the business as that's -- as the Opteon adoption happens and Opteon is expanding, we should see an expansion on the aftermarket side as well, but better pricing and better margin for us. Your line is open. Your line is open. As some of the other analysts have commented clearly, we would expect more dramatic volume declines going into Q4 to really adjust our production schedules to what we're seeing, again, in Europe, and in Asia Pacific. Your line is open. Look, I mean, I think as I said earlier, right, we've been having very active dialogue with all of our suppliers, all strategic suppliers on -- with respect to aligning the production with the demand and what that means in terms of the cost for us as well, because ultimately we want to be drive a long term kind of a win-win situation for everyone. Your line is open."
