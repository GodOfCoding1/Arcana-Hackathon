    "content": " I'd like to start this morning by first thanking our Chemours employees, the entire 6,600 strong Team Chemours for another great year, a year of improved results in revenue and earnings and high free cash flow conversion, a year in which we set several records, especially as we think of our TSS and APM businesses. So, Denise and her team, while we're seeing some fade in less strategic products, are really working at opening up capacity to meet customer demand in some of our higher value applications, which we're investing in also with some of the investments we announced last year. So, you're not going to see getting 18% right away, but this will be margin recovery through the year as the things that have started easing up on the cost side, thanks for the great work with the team and also on the commercial side by Ed and team, those things should really start flowing and benefiting the P&L and the margin as we kind of go through the year. As you think about this year, with our free cash flow guide of greater than $350 million, the way I think about capital allocation this year is we're stepping up our investment in growth to fund really high return applications in both TSS and APM."
