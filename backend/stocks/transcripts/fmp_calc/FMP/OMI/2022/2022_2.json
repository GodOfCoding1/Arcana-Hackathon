    "content": " Additional assumptions for 2022 guidance include a gross margin rate of approximately 20% unchanged from prior quarters guidance, interest expense in the range of $130 million to $135 million reflecting the most recent assumptions related to rising interest rates. And in terms of calendarization of that $150 million, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d say some of that we saw in Q2, but the lion share of that reduction is going to happen in Q3 and the margin impact from that think of it, because it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s in the Products and Healthcare Services segment that still be about a 10% pull through contributing, $15 million of bottom line profit of $0.15 of EPS impact. And thank you for all of this with the revenue headwind in distribution and products, here in the quarter, and then as well as the outlook, it sounds like the vast majority is really related to distribution, but I want you to clarify that or quantify that if you can making sure that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not missing something on products, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve all expected in easing of demand through the year, but it feels like the majority of this guidance reduction is related to the volume situation as opposed to products being materially lower than you expected."
