    "content": " On a linked quarter basis, substandard accruing loans decreased 20% and OREO and other decreased 63%, and our year-to-date net charge-offs were $2.1 million. Net interest income totaled $41.9 million in the third quarter increasing from $39.6 million in the linked quarter, representing a $2.4 million increase. We looked at our noninterest-bearing average balances, excluding municipal linked quarter as well as year-to-date, and those average balances have actually increased, which is a little bit surprising based on some of the thoughts of excess liquidity in the market causing those balances to go down thinking that they were going to go down."
