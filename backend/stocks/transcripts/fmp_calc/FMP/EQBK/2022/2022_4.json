    "content": " Before taxed $1 billion of loan portfolio cash flows in 2023, with a weighted average yield of 6.75%, which is 63 basis points below our current origination yields, as well as a successful deployment of cash flows of the investment portfolio into the loan portfolio, which has about a 500 basis point spread. We met with several banks in the fourth quarter at the beginning of this year as well, discussing their options of whether it's a good time and having low liquidity and in a high rate interest environment, that Equity Bank would be a good upstream merger partner for them. Thank you, one moment for questions. Thank you, one moment for questions. Thank you, one moment for questions."
