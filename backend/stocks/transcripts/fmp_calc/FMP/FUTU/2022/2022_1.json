    "content": " Meanwhile, our market share in Hong Kong futures and options trading climbed to over 6% and 12%, respectively, for the first time, driving a further increase in blended commission rate. I think the trend, which will witness the market consolidation, especially in Hong Kong markets continue to accelerate in the second quarter, quarter to date, given that we think number one, more and more small players start to exit from the market, we can see some small brokers including some even big ones such as  closed on their office in Hong Kong in the first quarter. I think the contribution from the derivative in this -- in the first quarter was particularly high due to the market conditions, a lot of investors looking for instruments to do the hedging when the market -- regardless in the U.S. Chinese ADRs or Hong Kong market was quite volatile in the first quarter. Besides this new client we acquired, I think in the first quarter and going forward, we are also focusing on our existing clients' asset inflows, in particular, in the first quarter, we do a lot of proactive marketing campaigns to attract our existing clients to migrate more assets to Futu from other brokers or even from the banks."
