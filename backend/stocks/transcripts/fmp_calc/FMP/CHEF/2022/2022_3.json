    "content": " So as you kind of look next year, and I'm not asking you to get in front of your guidance, but, or even the next few years, it sounds like profitability expansion as the EBITDA margin goes up should more be driven by gross profit margin than the expense ratio, contracting given, I mean, there's an obviously volume has a positive impact on the expense ratio. And I think Chef is really prepared for it, and we're making those investments and we're putting the cash back into the business, and we have a talent officer and nothing, as every day we focus on more, more and more, you know, acquiring talent, add to our bench and really we're on that trajectory to be $4 billion and $5 billion and way beyond that and the team is really focused and doing a great job. So we're getting the gross profit dollar growth to drive EBITDA growth and that's just, that's really just a year-over-year comp given what specialty prices have done. And then, as Chris mentioned in his prepared remarks, a number of fold-in type of activities that are happening right now and will continue to happen as we build facilities in places like New England and consolidate the businesses that we've acquired over the past few years and started to grow as we grow Texas and, and as we consolidate our operations in Northern California under a project that's already underway. And I think our hybrid approach and the investments in the new buildings, you know there's at least two a year major buildings going up, and I think that is going to drive that mid-to-high single level organic growth that you're seeing is coming because of the ability to execute that hybrid sell."
