    "content": " 2022 second quarter GAAP net income was $61.8 million and diluted EPS was $1.32, both reflecting notable increases from the prior quarter operating results. Also noted on the slide, you can see the PPP balances paid down to $31 million as of June 30th, generating $1.8 million of net fees recognized this quarter compared to $3.5 million in the prior quarter, with remaining unearned net fees now only totaling $600,000. In particular, we highlight the core net interest margin results, which when excluding the PPP fees and purchase accounting impact, increased 23 basis points as compared to the prior quarter margin -- core margin. Non-performing loans stayed relatively consistent at $55.9 million as of June 30th, net charge offs were a mere $200,000 or one basis point on an annualized basis, total delinquencies ticked up slightly to 0.4% of the portfolio, and total loan deferrals at June 30th decreased another $108 million to $197 million or 1.4% of the total portfolio, with the majority of that set to mature prior to 2023. And despite a market-driven reduction in assets under administration from $5.7 billion last quarter to $5.2 billion as of June 30th, overall investment management fee income increased nicely in the quarter, driven by strong retail and insurance commission income as well as seasonal tax prep fees. Okay, that's very helpful. Okay, that's very helpful."
