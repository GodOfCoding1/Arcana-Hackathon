    "content": " In late March, we initiated pivotal development of VX-147 following agreement with FDA and the design of the program, which included one, a single adaptive Phase II/III study design in people with 2 APOL1 mutations, proteinuria and decreased renal function; two, evaluation of VX-147 in the broad AMKD population representing approximately 100,000 people in the U.S. and Europe with this disease; and three, the ability to conduct an interim analysis, which if positive, could provide a pathway to accelerated approval in the U.S. Transitioning now to our pain program. U.S. revenues grew 9% to $1.37 billion in the first quarter of 2022 driven by additional patients starting treatment with TRIKAFTA, most notably children ages 6 to 11, following the mid-2021 approval. It is an unfortunate fact that some of these scripts result in addiction problems for some patients and contribute to the opioid epidemic in the U.S. provisional data from the CDC's National Center for Health Statistics for the latest 12-month period ending April 2021, recently estimated that there were more than 75,000 overdose deaths from opioids in the U.S., an increase of 35% compared to the prior 12-month period. Our growth was again primarily driven by new patients coming on therapy compared to the prior year, including continued robust uptake of KAFTRIO internationally, following expanded reimbursement access in a number of geographies over the past year as well as continued growth of TRIKAFTA in the U.S. Our first quarter 2022 combined non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses were $687 million compared to $531 million in Q1 2021."
