    "content": " On the other hand, revenue was in line with our expectation and demand for our product and services remain strong as evidenced by another increase in our backlog to $422 million in quarter one, which is close to 3 times higher than prior year levels. Turning to profitability, similar to recent quarter\u2019s lower equipment sales or less profitable mix of equipment installed, higher supply chain cost, lower margin on per sales revenue and incremental cost associated with new businesses drove our profitability lower year-over-year. Adjusted operating margin of minus 0.2% decrease 540 basis point year-over-year reflecting lower gross profit, higher bad debt expense, prior year benefit from temporary government subsidies on furlough measures and investment associated with our new businesses. Equipment orders once again outpaced supplies resulting in a community backlog this quarter of equipment on IT hardware of $422 million, a 21% increase of quarter four and close to 3 times higher than prior year level. As noted earlier adjusted operating income was negatively affected this quarter by incremental cost associated with supply constraint, inflation on investment in our new businesses, which had the negative impact to adjusted operating income margin of 470 basis point. This segment generated a loss due to lower equipment sales, less profitable mix of equipment installed, higher supply chain cost, lower margin on post sale revenue and incremental cost associated with new business. Hey, good morning guys. Hey, good morning guys."
