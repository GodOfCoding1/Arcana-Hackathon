    "content": " Given the strength in demand we see across our portfolio of products and services and a line of sight to margin improvement through price increases and cost reductions, we are maintaining our 2022 revenue and free cash flow guidance. As with prior quarter results, profits were lower year-over-year due to lower equipment sales, lower margin on equipment on post sales revenue, broad-based inflationary pressure on incremental investment associated with our new businesses. Post sales growth was driven by IT services, which increased more than 30% year-over-year on an organic basis and benefited from a full quarter of revenue from the recent acquisition of Powerland in Canada. Free cash flow was a use of $98 million in Q2 and was lower year-over-year by $296 million, driven by the receipt of a $100 million Fujifilm prepaid royalty in the prior year and $41 million onetime contract termination payment in the current quarter as well as lower cash earnings, which included incremental investment in our new businesses, a larger working capital outlay and the timing of management bonus payment. Working capital was a use of cash of $65 million this quarter, $30 million in higher than the prior year, mainly driven by an increase in inventory in anticipation of higher second half revenues, partially offset by growth in accounts payable."
