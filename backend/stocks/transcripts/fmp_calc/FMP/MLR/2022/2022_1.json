    "content": " Our sales increased 26.9% to $215.5 million, compared to the first quarter last year and 6.9%, compared to the fourth quarter of 2021. Net sales for the first quarter 2022 were $215.5 million versus $169.9 million for the first quarter of 2021, a 26.9% year-over-year increase driven largely by strong market demand for our products and our elevated backlog, along with a favorable comparison to the prior year period as a result of our enterprise software upgrades committed in the first quarter of 2021. Gross profit was $15.3 million, or 7.1% of net sales for the first quarter 2022 compared to $15.8 million or 9.3% of net sales for the first quarter 2021. SG&A expenses were $12.4 million for the first quarter 2022, compared to $11.1 million for the first quarter 2021, due to greater investments in human capital to support the company's growth and increases in employee benefit costs. Interest expense net for the first quarter 2022 was $418,000 up from $275,000 for the first quarter 2021 primarily due to increases in distributor floor plan financing, which as a reminder lags up and down with revenue levels."
