That said, we were very pleased with our fourth quarter results that were ahead of internal expectations closing out 2022 on a strong note despite a year of persistent supply chain challenges. Sales in the quarter increased 12% year-over-year and 9.9% sequentially to $225.9 million due to improved deliveries on our strong backlog and a large order from a new customer, which we began recognizing revenue on in the back half of the year. Gross profit in the fourth quarter was $25.5 million, an increase of 63.6% compared to the prior year quarter, while gross margin of 11.3% improved 360 basis points year-over-year. In an effort to provide more context as to why we feel it is prudent to accumulate inventory, at the end of the year, we have a record backlog that positions us to generate revenues in excess of $1 billion in the fiscal 2023, subject to no further deterioration in the supply chain and general economic conditions. Net sales for the fourth quarter 2022 were $225.9 million versus $201.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2021, a 12% year-over-year increase, driven largely by the robust demand across all of our products and the benefit of our 2022 price increases as Will mentioned earlier. Cost of operations increased 9.8% to $200.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2022, compared to $182.4 million for the fourth quarter 2021. Gross profit was $25.5 million or 11.3% of net sales for the fourth quarter of 2022 compared to $15.6 million or 7.7% of net sales for the prior year period. Interest expense for the fourth quarter 2022 was $1.3 million up from $454,000 for the fourth quarter 2021, primarily related to an increase in our debt levels to find higher working capital needs along with the increases in our distributor floor plan financing costs, which flags up and down with revenue. Other income for the fourth quarter was $512,000 compared to an expense of $64,000 for the fourth quarter 2021 attributed largely to currency exchange rate fluctuations and the strength of the British pound. Net sales for the full year were $848.5 million compared to $717.5 million in the prior year period, an increase of 18.3%. Net income for the full year of 2022 was $20.3 million or $1.78 per share compared to net income for 2021 of $16.3 million or $1.42 per share increases of 25.2% and 25.4%, respectively. Turning to the balance sheet, cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2022 was $40.2 million compared to $33.2 million as of September 30, 2022 and $54.3 million as of December 31, 2021. Accounts receivable as of December 31, 2022 was $177.7 million compared to $167.9 million as of September 30, 2022 and $154 million as of December 31, 2021. Inventories were $153.7 million as of December 31, 2022 compared to $144.4 million as of September 30, 2022 and $114.9 million as of December 31, 2021. Accounts payable as of December 31, 2022 was $125.5 million, compared to $107.5 million as of September 30, 2022 and $121.7 million as of December 31, 2021. During that same time, we have reinvested approximately $136 million in CapEx, approximately 15% of which has gone towards automation and productivity improvements, such as our new fabrication facility in Greenville, which produces steel parts to complement our existing supply chain, 60% have gone to capacity expansion projects, such as the purchase of a small facility in Ooltewah, Tennessee, which was used to improve production of our small carrier units and 12% has gone to projects related to the health and safety of our employees, including closing our shipping docks to eliminate employee exposure to extreme weather conditions. Lastly, Board of Directors approved our quarterly cash dividend of $0.18 per share payable on March 27, 2022 to shareholders of record at the close of business on March 20, 2022 marking the 49th consecutive quarter that the company has paid a dividend. Our results over the last two quarters of fiscal 2022 have given us increased confidence in our business and our strategy, as top line growth has continued to improve, we are encouraged by the sequential and year-over-year margin improvements in the back half of the year."
