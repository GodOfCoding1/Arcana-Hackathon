    "content": " On commodities, the way to maybe look at it is that, if you look at -- if you look at the fourth quarter, $700 million of EBITDA and you multiply that by four and get to $2.8 billion for the year and given that we expect a couple of $100 million upside on specialties and that means that we get to the upper side of our guidance, you need to take out about $600 million, $600 million would reflect the downside on commodities and, of course, about 80% of that comes from potash."
