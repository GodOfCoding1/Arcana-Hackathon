    "content": " In the first quarter of '22, total revenue was $830 million, a decrease over the first quarter of 2021 of approximately 12% as reported and a decrease of approximately 7%, excluding a foreign currency impact of $36 million and a $14 million impact from divested businesses in Russia and Ukraine. Free cash flow for the quarter -- first quarter of '22 was $230 million usage compared to a $70 million usage in the first quarter of '21, which is largely the result of lower adjusted EBITDA and supply chain challenges resulting in higher inventory investment, coupled with lower accounts payable leverage.
