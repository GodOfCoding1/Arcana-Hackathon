    "content": " As provided in our current report from Form 8-K filed and updated on October 20th, given our elevated backlog, we have 100% coverage for product revenue in 2022 and we expect to shift 52,000 ATMs 25,000 self-checkout units and 127 points of sale terminals this year. Noting 15% variance in units would equate to approximately $100 million in revenue and approximately $30 million in adjusted EBITDA, depending on geography, customer and product mix. And as you know Europe has been very strong for us, but we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re now starting to have significant deployments in the US, which will also help us you know demonstrate how our solutions are capable in every \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and probably the most challenging self-checkout market in the world, which is US groceries, and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re making significant progress there. We clearly still have a lot of work to do in that market, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an industry that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s shaping it to \u00e2\u0080\u0093 so I would really you know we want to be a part of this EV charging companies start developing their service model for the future."
