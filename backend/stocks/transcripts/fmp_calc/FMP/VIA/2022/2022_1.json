Good morning, and welcome to Via Renewables First Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. In the first quarter, we've reported an adjusted EBITDA of $10.8 million. In the first quarter we achieved $10.8 million in adjusted EBITDA compared to last year's first quarter of $32.7 million. In our Retail Electricity segment, gross margin was $17.2 million compared to $30.6 million in the first quarter last year. In our Retail Natural Gas segment, gross margin was $11.6 million compared to $19.4 million in the first quarter of last year. G&A expenses of $14.9 million were higher compared to $12.7 million in the first quarter last year, primarily due to increases in sales and marketing expenses, cost reserves, and employee expenses in 2022 as we ramp up our segments. Total RCEs in the first quarter were $387,000 compared to $367,000 in the first quarter of 2021. Our net income for the quarter was $31 million or income of $0.70 per fully diluted share compared to a net loss of $27.6 million or a loss of $0.66 per fully diluted share for the first quarter of 2021. The increase is mainly due to a $64.9 million loss incurred in the first quarter of 2021 for winter storm Uri, partially offset by higher income tax expense in 2022. Income tax expense increased to $6 million in the first quarter of 2022 compared with a benefit of $1.5 million in 2021 due to the winter storm Uri's impact to our bottom line last year. On April 21, we announced first quarter dividend of $0.18125 per share on our common stock to be paid on June 15 and $0.47639 per share of preferred stock to be paid on July 15."
