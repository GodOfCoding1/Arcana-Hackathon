    "content": " Our partnership lease business is up over 55% year-over-year and 22% quarter-over-quarter, driven by an increase in new door fronts, which we expect to continue to see through the rest of this year. However, lease dollar volume from the marketplace is up 21% sequentially from last quarter, which is being fueled by higher new customer volume even despite our credit tightening. So in this case, this new line of business, which we just launched and we've tested with some degree of success in the second quarter, enables us to derive profitability from the retail sell itself as well as the profitability from the lease that finances that retail sell."
