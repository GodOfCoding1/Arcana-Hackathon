    "content": " Let me \u2013 getting down to business, let me start with confirming as an advance to you in our last call that although we had a slow start for the year this first quarter, we have seen significant improvement month-to-month leaving to Q2, which allows us to be more confident on the guidance that we have provided to you. But it\u2019s very important when I talk about the improvement of the cost position, it\u2019s not a one-off opportunity to reduce cost, but it allows us to continue to improve our cost structure, so that we can deliver more with less to our customers, year-on-year. Also, I would like to add that the component that I mentioned last, perhaps very important, the global delivery models and methodologies are critically important for those customers that we have been targeting over the last couple of years."
