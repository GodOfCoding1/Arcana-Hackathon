    "content": " Yes, we were excited to see that real positive core loan growth in the first quarter as we think about 2022 and where we're seeing those opportunities well diversified as we show on the kind of number of Page 12, our Metro Bank is 3%. Commercial real estate, right now, there's definitely some nice low leverage opportunities in this environment that we're very focused on the right opportunities with a rising interest rate environment, but I think also you're going to continue to see that commercial finance have some strong opportunities as well kind of throughout the rest of the year. When I think about where we're positioned in all of George's comments earlier around organic growth and just the look of our balance sheet today, overlaying that with Matt's comments around where we're at from a loan growth point of view, we make a lot of investments on the production side, and I don't think our expenses would grow as fast as our revenue will in those scenarios. I would say -- I mean, we think, first, on efficiency, the 50% to 55% range is good for a company like us that's really focused on community banking. Yes, Stephen, I'd say at the high point that delta -- this is I want to say, speaking generalities here to hold me to the number itself, there was a 50 basis point type delta on what's coming off our books versus what we're bringing on."
