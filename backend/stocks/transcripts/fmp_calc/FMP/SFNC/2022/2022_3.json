    "content": " During today's call, we will make forward-looking statements about our future plans, goals, expectations, estimates, projections and outlook including, among others, our outlook regarding future economic conditions, interest rates, lending and deposit activity and net interest margin. Throughout the third quarter, 2 Fed hikes, 150 basis points, and it's really illustrating our pipeline on Page 12, where that pipeline is now $1.6 billion, that's really a result of the staying disciplined to our relationship strategy, underwriting hurdles, stress tests. So I think we'll continue to see some loan growth in the fourth quarter and on, but just depending on what the Fed does, I think I just look back at what happened between the second and third quarter and what the increase in interest rates did to our pipeline. But it's -- I think that we've all had the good fortune of a really steep move by the Fed with a nice lag in deposit betas, and that's just going to moderate itself for the industry, I believe, over the coming quarters."
