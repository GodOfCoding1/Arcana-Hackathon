    "content": " When I think about \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and I've spoken about this in prior quarterly calls, when I think about excess funds, that surge deposits, funds that we're laying around whether they're consumer or commercial or otherwise, I think most of that moved out of the bank earlier in the year last year. I think  I'd add to that just on the retail linkages, what we're seeing also alternative opportunities, money markets with a Smith Barney or somebody to that effect, Charles Schwab, but also we're seeing in the small community markets, rural markets, that is getting very competitive and seeing some really irrational pricing and that's where we're also seeing small retail customers kind of leak out  customer losses, Jay said, but just real competitive  on the time deposits. And there's somewhat maybe potentially not  with, but from their bond or investment portfolio and so they're trying to fund in a new way that they're not used to and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s laser focused on funding right now and resulting in what we're seeing on the special  deposit side what we're seeing the most interesting rates are offering. I don't have that number off the \u00e2\u0080\u0093 right off the  here for you, Gary, but I think you can suffice it to say, I think to maybe get to the point of your question, if you unpacked the quarter, certainly as we layered in on the wholesale side and made a decision to extend maturities, margin or cost of deposits, cost of deposits was higher, margin was lower late in the quarter, compared to early in the quarter. I would say that's something that we're very focused on analytically of where those peaks arise and where do we need to start originating more CLDs, always thoughtful on credit for us, but you're right \u00e2\u0080\u0093 we believe it did in the fourth quarter, but the outside where it funds up, I think is far into the future."
