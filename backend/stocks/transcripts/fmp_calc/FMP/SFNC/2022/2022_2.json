So, we're seeing some pipeline fallout, so I don't think we'll see a Q2 loan growth again, but I do think we're going to stay with steady loan growth through the next two quarters. But I will tell you at a macro level, the -- with the cap rate staying low, we're still in a scenario where deals are trying to get done but the economics just aren't working like they should, and so there's fallout that we're seeing in our pipeline. All right, thank you. All right, thank you. So, when you think about loan betas going forward, I think they're going to be very high being given a lot of the comments, Matt has said, our ability to kind of flex that pricing muscle on two originations is better than it was earlier in the year, when a lot of folks were still willing to buy down on the yield side."
