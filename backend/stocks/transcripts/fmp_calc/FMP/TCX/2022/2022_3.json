    "content": " Quarter-over-quarter is where we see the numbers look lumpy as expected, with revenue for Q3 at $4 million, a decline of 55% from Q2 and gross margin at $3.8 million, a decline of 52%. Year-to-date total revenue for 2022 is $242 million, up 9% from the year-to-date total revenue of $222 million at the end of Q3 last year. Gross profit before network costs for the third quarter increased 13% year-over-year to $29.7 million from $26.4 million, with the increase due mainly to the higher gross profit contribution of Ting Internet. As a percentage of revenue, gross margin for Ting expanded to 61% in the third quarter from 43% in Q3 last year driven by a stronger contribution from our growth markets as well as higher capitalization of our field and engineering labor. The increase is primarily the result of the following: people costs were up $3.2 million this quarter with increased workforce cost to support business expansion related to Ting Internet growth as well as the continued Wavelo ramp and, to a lesser extent, the acquisitions of Simply Bits as well as the UNR assets and its development team, both in October 2021. That total breaks down amongst our 3 businesses as follows: adjusted EBITDA for Tucows Domains was $10.4 million, down 9.5% from Q3 of last year. And finally, the Corporate category had adjusted EBITDA of $3.4 million this quarter compared with $4.5 million in Q2 last year, with the decline primarily driven by, and as expected, the lower earnout from the sale of the Ting Mobile customers to DISH as customers continue to churn, lower transition services margins and lower contribution for the mobile subscribers retained offset slightly by a onetime recovery from the renegotiation of a supplier contract. Finally, deferred revenue at the end of Q3 was $147 million, down 2% from $150 million at the end of the second quarter of 2022 and down 3.3% from $152 million for the third quarter of last year."
