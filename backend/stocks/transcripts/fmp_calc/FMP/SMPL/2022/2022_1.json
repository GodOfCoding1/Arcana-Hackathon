    "content": " First quarter net sales, gross profit, and adjusted EBITDA, all increased double-digits on a percentage basis versus last year and were slightly better than our expectations. Looking at the key metrics of our updated full year fiscal 2022 outlook, we expect net sales to increase 12% to 14% versus last year and this includes a 1 percentage point headwind related to the European business exit. As I stated earlier, higher supply chain costs versus our previous outlook, driven mostly by ingredients remains a headwind in 2022 and will result in full year gross margin contraction of about 250 basis points with the biggest impact in the second and third quarter.
