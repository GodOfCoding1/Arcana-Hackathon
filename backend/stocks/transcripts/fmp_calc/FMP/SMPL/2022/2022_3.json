    "content": " Atkins third quarter measured channel retail takeaway for our core bar and shake business increased 3.5%, driven by solid shakes growth of 14.1%, partially offset by a decline in bars of 4.2%. Looking at the key metrics of our full-year fiscal 2022 outlook, we expect net sales to increase 14% to 15% versus last year, including a two percentage point headwind related to the European business exit and the licensing of the Quest frozen pizza business, our previous guidance for net sales growth of 13% to 15%. Your line is now live. Hey, good morning, folks. Your line is now live. Your line is now live. So, number one, last year's gross margin was very, very high with the highest we've had, since the acquisition of Quest is kind of everything hit last year, we had favorable, we got bars back in, and most importantly, we didn't -- Q3 was really the last quarter that we didn't see a big increase and start to see the increasing commodity. Your line is now live. We're already in -- it's a great question, historically, I'm going to go back seven, eight years historically, the mindset of our business in the category is if you kind of win January, February, March kind of resolution season, you win the year. Your line is now live. Hey, good morning, folks. Your line is now live. Your line is now live. Your line is now live. Your line is now live."
