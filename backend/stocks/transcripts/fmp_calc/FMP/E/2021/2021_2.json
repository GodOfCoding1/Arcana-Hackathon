    "content": " But of course, the situation would change a little bit, if going forward relative to sort of oil prices - oil price expectations that prevail in the market, you'd start to say rather large margins of safety, large discounts to that when effectively setting your dividend policy. And before you know it, you start to sort of think about, well, that will require quite a bit and refining margins are already quite low, incurring more CapEx is not easy for the European refining system to kind of absorb - And when you start to put those things together, you wonder sort of what the sort of true long-term sort of viability of this business is and it's already been sort of challenging for some time. So that are the reasons then clearly, we'll see in February, March when we present our strategy and maybe we can say something additional on our policy as we did in the first quarter when we changed our - and we reduced the floor to increase the share of the free cash flow for our shareholders. COVID clearly creates additional fragility emerge and the negative margin that we have in the last 3, 4 quarters are clearly the results, not just demand, but also refine that sometimes are not - I'm talking generally, but it clearly - it's true also for us and not cause linked to upstream and not cause linked to chemicals."
