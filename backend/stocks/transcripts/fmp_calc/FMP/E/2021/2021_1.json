    "content": " Thank you very much. But just to give you some elements coming from the market, our E&P measure is now valued four to five times EBITDA, I think it\u2019s valued between seven to eight times of EBITDA, and the renewable player is valued clearly based on the growth assumption et cetera between 10 to 15 times of EBITDA, there are also section above that. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. On the spreads -- clearly, let's say you're right in the sense that the inflow of gas from that pipeline has the brought to the market roughly 60 bcm growing to 8 bcm per annum of extra capacity. I will say the quarter -- the first quarter has been also affected by clear -- very strong TTF price linked to the LNG tightening of the market, which actually brought away LNG from Europe towards Asia and the in turn  was let say, brought up by this dynamic while PSV actually was not really linked to that dynamic. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you very much."
