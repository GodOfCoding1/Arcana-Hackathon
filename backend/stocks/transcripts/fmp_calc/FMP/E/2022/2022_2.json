    "content": " IPO clearly is a good tool to give value and independence to the company, but the strategic move is Plenitude itself because it's functional to our aim to sell the carbonized product \u00e2\u0080\u0093 green, blue and biogas \u00e2\u0080\u0093 to our client to reach the net zero in our Scope 3. So, I think that, if you look at the overall performance of Eni in 2022, first of all, in managing a risk that is huge, in finding new source of supply that ensures Italy, in particular, to have, let's say, a better condition so far versus other European countries in terms of security of supply."
