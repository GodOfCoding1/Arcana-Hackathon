    "content": " A big thank you to everyone at Nikola and our partners for their exceptional and extraordinary efforts, especially in these last few months to ensure that our production and delivery targets were met, despite every obstacle, including a supply chain crisis that just won't quit, the war in Ukraine, and COVID-related shutdowns in China have put new and additional pressure and uncertainty on the global manufacturing landscape. Our capital expenditures totaled $33.5 million year-to-date and comprised of the construction of our Coolidge Greenfield Manufacturing Facility, and equipment purchases, renovations for office space expansion and hydrogen storage testing building in Phoenix, hydrogen mobile, fuelers, supplier tooling, and investments made into our European JV. We view this investment as a validation of the recent accomplishments our company has made on the operational and strategic funds, including the $200 million of convertible notes, Nikola would have had a total cash and liquidity position of approximately $1 billion as of March 31 2022. One, deliver 300 to 500 production TRE BEV trucks; two successful fuel cell EV alpha testing with an Anheuser-Busch and TTSI; three, build, validate and test TRE fuel cell beta trucks; four, announced location, break ground and commence construction of the first hydrogen production hub in Arizona, and five, announce two or more dispensing Station partners in California. And we have stated, when you look out for 2023, we believe that there will still be some supply chain issues with respect to battery cell availability as well as packs what we have stated previously, is that we have enough cells to build approximately 2,300 trucks for next year."
