    "content": " Adjusted EBITDA excludes, one, $54.8 million in stock-based compensation, two, $13.0 million for legal expenses to pay Mr. Milton\u00e2\u0080\u0099s attorney\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fees under his indemnification agreement, three, $1.3 million for equity and net loss of affiliates mainly from our IVECO JV in Europe, and four, a net $0.2 million loss for the revaluation of financial instruments including warrant liabilities and derivatives. This is because, one, negative gross margin impact from the temporary pack price increase in Q3 to a lesser extent in Q4, negative gross margin impact from the existing Romeo customer contract runoff, three, incremental R&D and SG&A expenses of Romeo post-merger, and four, transaction costs and purchase accounting adjustments that may further impact our Q3 and Q4 OpEx. With a good accumulated understanding of Romeo\u00e2\u0080\u0099s operations, we have identified several areas of operational improvements that will begin to be implemented immediately following the transaction closing, longer term we are targeting up to $350 million in annual battery pack cost savings by 2026. Having said that, as you know, our current cash burn rate based on financial statements is running around $55 million per month and so it really depends on how much cash and liquidity we want to end up at the end of this year."
