    "content": " Also, 63% of our fixed income investments are now held as available for sale versus none at the end of 2021, which we believe will help reduce volatility within our P&L going forward, albeit still contributing to capital. Normalizing for that, gross premiums rewritten -- gross premiums written are up 21% year-over-year with 83% growth in Insurance & Services driven by organic growth and new deals across A&H lines, the positive impact of reduced COVID-related travel restrictions on travel MGA premiums and strong growth in our MGA strategic partnerships. For the full year ended December 31, 2022, the trading portfolio resulted in $115.6 million in losses primarily due to rising interest rates within our overall investment result."
