    "content": " In the first quarter 2022, recurring EBITDA was $920 million, down 19% from the fourth quarter with the decline explained mainly by the expected normalization of international spreads for the main chemicals and resins in Brazil for PP in the U.S. and Europe and PE in Mexico. Let's go to the next slide, please. Let's go to the next slide, please. Braskem Idesa within its capital structure and the financial commitments it has and especially considering the bonds that were issued by Braskem Idesa, there's already some -- there's already a room of about $40 million to pay dividends, Braskem plus Idesa, to pay $40 million a year to -- in dividends to its shareholders. In May of 2022, we paid dividends of by BRL 1.35 billion with -- added to those BRL 100 million that were paid early in December 2021 add up to BRL 7.35 billion, which is 77.5% of the company's adjusted net profit in the year 2021. And I think that considering everything that was shared with you this year, we remain very much confident about this year's results, expecting spreads that are even higher than the recent historical average despite the scenario of political tensions with a scenario that's very much in line with what external consultants in the industry expecting."
