    "content": " At the end of the third quarter, the balance in the '23 notes was $302 million, and during the first few weeks of January, we retired an additional $100 million of the '23 notes, leaving a current balance of $203 million. From a balance sheet perspective, we have reported total liquidity at the end of the third fiscal quarter of approximately $280 million and borrowings on the ABL facility of $156 million. In terms of your fourth quarter, usually you see a working capital release, and you've paid down $100 million. From where we are at the end of the third quarter, I think it's fair to say that the ABL balance could be there might be $40 million to $50 million on it at the end of the fiscal year. In terms of the NGL segment, any - like I think at the start of the year, you guys said that you would kind of be flat this year in the Liquids Logistics, and you're trending not so close to flat, implying a big fourth quarter."
