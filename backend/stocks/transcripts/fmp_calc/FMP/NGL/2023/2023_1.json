    "content": " Starting with the financial results for the quarter, our Water Solutions segment had a very strong quarter and reported record adjusted EBITDA of $105 million, an increase of 29% when compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2022 and an increase of more than 16% from the immediately preceding quarter. These results were driven by record produced water volumes processed of approximately 2.15 million barrels per day, which was 12% higher than the immediately preceding quarter, as well as higher-than-expected skim oil volumes sold. As expected, due to the volatility in the crude environment, results for the quarter were negatively impacted by approximately $20 million of net financial losses on derivatives that related to inventory gains realized in the fourth quarter of fiscal '22, as well as inventory gains that we expect to be realized in subsequent quarters. Physical volumes on Grand Mesa were approximately 79,000 barrels per day compared to 77,000 barrels per day in the first quarter of last year and 74,000 barrels per day for the preceding quarter, and margin on crude oil barrels sold continued to benefit from increased differentials on certain sales contracts, as well as the realization of the full price adder on certain contracts whose rates increased with crude oil prices."
