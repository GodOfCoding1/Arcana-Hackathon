    "content": " Looking at the business by vertical, we saw the most notable improvement amongst our owner operator customers, but especially with refining customers spending by this customers grew our MSC business by 3.2% sequentially and 9% in the last 12 months just shy of its historical double-digit growth rate, which is a strong performance, especially when compared to the growth of the MSC business in fiscal year 2021 at 5.8%. When you put that together with a great software businesses that are being contributed to new Aspen tech and the deeper partnership with Emerson, we believe we have all the pieces in place to generate meeting's growth and reach $1.5 billion in annual spend in fiscal year 2026. We reported non-GAAP operating income for the first quarter of $55.4 million representing a 40.7% non-GAAP operating margin compared to non-GAAP operating income margin at $42.7 million and 37.2% respectively in a year ago, period, as a reminder, margins will fluctuate period to period due to the timing of customer renewals and therefore license revenue recognized during the quarter non-GAAP net income was $51.6 million or $0.77 per share based on 67.4 million shares outstanding turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. Look as I like to say one data point doesn't make a trend, but certainly if you look at the macro KPIs, we track, they're all open to the right price of oil, refining margins, chemicals production and chemicals margin, chemicals demand, and chemicals margins and even with EPC as well, while certainly there's been a significant reduction in CapEx, it's already been almost a year and we believe that the situation there is stabilizing but we have to work to the contract. Look, if you only have to look at the announcements from chemical companies record margins and cash flow generation and certainly, there's cautiousness within that customer sector around supply chain issues dampening demand for their products and that's something to keep an eye on and they're still sectors small sectors, but they're still sectors within the chemicals industry that are not doing as well as they were doing before the pandemic but on the whole ball chemicals which is ethylene and polymers has done very well in this calendar year."
