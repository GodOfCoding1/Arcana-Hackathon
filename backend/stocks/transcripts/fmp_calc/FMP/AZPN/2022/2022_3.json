    "content": " Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us to discuss our financial results for the third quarter of fiscal 2022 ending March 31, 2022. With me on the call today are Antonio Pietri, AspenTech's President and CEO; and Chantelle Breithaupt, the CFO of AspenTech. Before we begin, I will make the safe harbor statement that during the course of this call, we may make projections or other forward-looking statements about the financial performance of the Company that involve risks and uncertainties. Factors that might cause such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in today's call and contained in our most recently filed Form 10-Q. Also, please note that the following information relates to our current business conditions and our outlook as of today, April 27, 2022. As we have mentioned previously, we expected the new budget year for our customers to lead to a better spending environment for AspenTech, considering the positive macro indicators coming into the year. We also remain optimistic about our ability to drive further improvement in annual spend growth over time, considering the continued positive macro environment and growing strategic importance of operational efficiency and sustainability to our customers. We believe the combination of our current solutions with innovation and expertise of OSI and Geological Simulation Software will position the new AspenTech to create greater value for our customers, as we help and solve the dual challenge of meeting the increasing global demand for resources in a sustainable manner. Looking quickly at our financial results in the third quarter, revenue was $187.8 million, GAAP EPS was $1.12 and non-GAAP EPS was $1.38. Annual spend was $655 million, up 2.4% in the quarter and 7.4% year-over-year and free cash flow was $89.2 million. As I mentioned, the biggest change in the quarter was a notable improvement in customer spending. Our customers\u2019 calendar 2022 budget are much improved, reflecting our expectations after the uncertainty and challenging conditions of the prior two years. As expected, a normalization of the transportation market drove up the demand for fuels and pushed refinery operating rates to historical high levels. In our conversations with customers, it has become clear that forward thinking companies have recognized greater investment in digitalization can increase their competitive advantage, drive better financial performance and move closer to their sustainability goals. The tight supply demand balance for oil resulting in high oil prices along with increased commitment to emissions reductions in the last few years has started to have a positive impact on global energy and sustainability CapEx budgets, respectively. The improved macro outlook for this industry is benefiting AspenTech through improvement in attrition rates, which we now expect to come in modestly better than our previously revised range of 5% to 5.5%. Longer-term, there are three factors that we believe can have a positive impact on our E&C business. The second is the expected acceleration of sustainability CapEx investments and the pivot that many E&C firms are making towards executing projects in low carbon energy areas like hydrogen, carbon capture and sequestration or CCS, biofuels, wind, solar and other areas. First, a global chemical company and long-term customer of AspenTech renewed its agreement for all three suites of our products and solutions. This company uses AspenTech Solutions to run their operations safer, greener, longer and faster, including for their required reporting on emissions to regulatory authorities. Second, a leading independent player in the European energy and refining industry signed a new agreement to expand its use of our MSC and APM applications. This customer, which operates one of the largest refineries in Europe and the most advanced in terms of plant complexity, decided to increase it's usage after a study by AspenTech personnel, identify tens of millions of dollars in incremental profitability, through operational performance improvements and energy savings and the related reduction in emissions. The deployment of the AspenTech control and optimization solutions in the refinery, including a CO2 emissions dashboard, coupled with expansion of Aspen Mtell to a second \u2013 recently acquired wind farm will be key solutions to help this customer meet its sustainability and profitability objectives. And third and final, a North American electrical vehicles company that manufactures fleet commercial vehicles and SUVs increased its use of the aspenONE Engineering suite to drive collaboration and standardization across production lines in the modeling and manufacturer of electrical cell batteries by the chemical engineers in these teams. In addition to the examples I've reviewed for this quarter, our latest ESG report released in Q3 and available on our website cover several more longer-term examples of our customers are implementing our solutions for sustainability, highlighting the role that digitalization plays in helping companies across diverse industries, reduce waste and energy use and meet their emission targets. As we have discussed in the past, the drive towards the automation and digitalization of assets to run them more efficiently and sustainably is still in the relatively early stages and it\u2019s a top investment priority for our customers. In a world of growing demand, rising inflationary pressures and greater scrutiny of the environmental impact of their operations, our customers recognize that being able to do more with less strategic imperative. I've been attending this conference for years and this year, the focus on the need to increase the use of technology to drive efficiency and sustainability was greater than I've ever seen. In particular, the increased activity by regulatory agencies most notably in Europe, but more recently by the SEC here in the United States about sustainability reporting requirements is driving customers to take a comprehensive view at their strategy in this area. AspenTech is in a great position to benefit from this trend in two ways, driving material amounts of emissions out of customers operations while also making it possible to track their progress in a holistic way. While we are pleased about our performance year-to-date and see the conviction from customers globally about transacting in the current quarter, we also recognized that a degree of uncertainty exists in certain markets for AspenTech, such as Russia and related sanctions and China and the spread of COVID-related lockdowns, which could dampen the growth in the quarter. In addition, we are adjusting our fiscal year guidance for attrition to 4.5% to 5% compared to 5% to 5.5% previously. And finally, we expect to deliver the best-in-class profitability outcome that we guided to for the year and their investors have come to expect from AspenTech. We believe our expanded product portfolio will give new AspenTech a unique ability to benefit from the coming decarbonization transition by enabling existing energy and chemical suppliers to operate with higher levels of efficiency and lower emissions than they ever have before to meet current energy and chemical demand, while also capturing the emissions they produce in CCS systems to further decarbonize their production. In addition, we will enable the design of hydrogen production facilities and will optimize their operation once built as countries around the world ramp-up on the utilization of hydrogen as a clean energy source over the coming years and decades. And finally, we will enable the transition to global electrification from clean energy sources by supporting the dramatic increase in power transmission and distribution capacity that is required to meet many of the ambitious sustainability targets that countries and companies have committed themselves to over the next 10 to 30 years. For example, according to S&P Global, the total CapEx spending in the global energy sector supply side in 2021 was $1.5 trillion. About 30% or $450 billion is spent on low carbon power, which includes hydrogen, CCS, wind, solar and other forms of renewables. Furthermore, carbon capture and sequestration is estimated to be a $4 trillion market by 2050 according to ExxonMobil as compared to the $6.5 trillion market for oil and gas today that they estimate. What all this says is that going forward, AspenTech will benefit from a major CapEx investment cycle where the products of the new AspenTech will be uniquely positioned to enable our customers to design, operate and maintain these new facilities. We remain confident in new AspenTech\u2019s ability to be a consistent mid-teens grower with high recurring revenue, best-in-class margin and substantial free cash flow. Before turning it over to Chantelle, I would like to formally welcome Manish Chawla, who recently joined AspenTech in the newly created position of Chief Revenue Officer, where he will lead all revenue generating functions of the company. He's led IBM's effort around energy transition, sustainability and Industry 4.0 and has extensive experiences scaling large global organizations. Manish will be assuming the leadership of our operations team from John Hague, who has decided to retire after 27 years with AspenTech. John will remain in AspenTech until October 1, supported the integration efforts of OSI and GSS and leading the commercial team that will support the Emerson\u2019s sales team taking AspenTech solutions into a number of their key markets. John has been an important and value leader at AspenTech in a number of roles over the years, most recently as EVP of Operations. We are delivering better than expected growth, high profitability and free cash flow and have made significant progress preparing for the completion of our transaction with Emerson. As a result, we believe our income statement will provide an inconsistent view into our financial performance, especially when comparing between fiscal periods. In our view, annual spend will continue to be the most important metric in assessing the growth of our business and annual free cash flow the most important metric for assessing the overall value our business generates. Annual spend, which represents the accumulated value of all the current invoices for our term license agreements at the end of each period, was $655 million at the end of the third quarter. This represented an increase of approximately 7.4% on a year-over-year basis and 2.4%, sequentially. Total bookings, which are defined as the total value of customer term license contracts where the associated term licenses were deemed delivered in the quarter under Topic 606, was $207 million, an 18% increase year-over-year. Total expenses, including cost of revenue, were $107 million, which was up from $93.8 million in the year ago period. Excluding the impact of stock-based compensation expense, amortization of intangibles associated with acquisitions and integration, planning-related fees, we reported non-GAAP operating income for the third quarter of $102.5 million, representing a 54.6% non-GAAP operating margin compared to a non-GAAP operating income margin of $80.9 million and 49.7%, respectively, in the year ago period. As a reminder, margins will fluctuate period to period due to the timing of customer renewals and therefore, license revenue recognized during the quarter. In the third quarter, we generated $81.1 million of cash from operations and $89.2 million of free cash flow after taking into consideration the net impact of capital expenditures, capitalized software, acquisition and integration planning-related payments. Before turning to guidance, I would like to provide an update on our preparation for the closing of the Emerson transaction and the integration of both OSI and Geological Simulation Software. With respect to annual spend, as Antonio mentioned, we are maintaining our outlook for the year at 7% to 8% growth. We are maintaining our bookings guidance range to $814 million to $840 million, which includes $486 million of contracts that are up for renewal in fiscal 2022. We now expect license revenue in the range of $513 million to $530 million and maintenance revenue and service and other revenue of approximately $196 million and $28 million, respectively. From an expense perspective, we now expect total GAAP expenses of $410 million to $415 million. This outlook continues to incorporate our ongoing investments in our go-to-market organization, product development and business units, including APM, AIoT and pharmaceuticals. We expect GAAP operating income in a range of $327 million to $339 million for fiscal 2022, with GAAP net income of approximately $299 million to $310 million. From a non-GAAP perspective, we now expect non-GAAP operating income of $404 million to $416 million and now expect non-GAAP income per share in the range of $5.33 to $5.50. From a free cash flow perspective, we are now targeting free cash flow of at least $285 million. To wrap up, AspenTech delivered strong third quarter results. We look forward to completing our transaction with Emerson later this quarter, which we believe will expand our capabilities to create even greater value for our customers and shareholders. Your line is open. Maybe just a quick clarification on the guidance because I think you're leaving the full-year annual spend range the same, but I think attrition is a little bit better, but it sounds like APM is \u2013 maybe nominally a little lower. Well, I mean, look, certainly, we've captured some of the benefit from the improvement in attrition through the Q3 quarter. At the same time, like we enumerated in the prepared remarks, while our \u2013 we closed some business in Russia in Q3, there's increasing difficulty from the implementation of sanctions and that could provide a little bit of downside in the quarter. And it's not that the business isn't there, it's just that would take longer to close. And then we're monitoring the lockdowns, the roll out of lockdowns in China, not that the business would disappear, but as we experienced over the last two years, when people are not able to come out of their homes, they're not able to then work on the contracting of these transactions. So we're just taking a cautious approach here with regards to changing the range, meaning we're not changing and we're living it at 7% to 8%. Your line is open. They elongated during the pandemic and now there's one, they're going back to their historical level or length, but also they're more predictable. And to us, that's the fundamental difference is a predictability and our ability to close business when we believe it can be closed. I also think there's been a little bit of pent-up demand, of course, in Q3 after two years of suppressed spending. And we also saw a little bit of business from Q4 move into Q3, which certainly deliver a very strong Q3 quarter for us, but overall much easier environment to be doing business in. And the follow-up for me, and you mentioned, Russia and how that along with China contributed to your thinking relative to maintaining the annual spend guide in Q4 even with the better attrition. I mean, we're seeing companies like SAP that are abandoning Russia altogether. Well, I mean, we start with, look, at less than 5% of our annual spend is in Russia and these are five, six year contract. Look the \u2013 while our technology is not sanctioned today and we're still doing business there, the environment to do that business has become increasingly more difficult as a result of sanctions in banks that our customers have used for business, banks that our own employees have been using to, for us to pay the \u2013 refund their business expenses. In some cases, a little bit of issue around collections and that's why you see also our free cash flow projection for the year at the midpoint being cautious about potential collection issues in Russia. But having said all that, way in Q3, we did what we thought we could do in the quarter, and we're just being cautious about it. Your line is open. So one of the questions we got a lot today, sort of how do should we think about your cost inflation and what's the dialogue with your customers on pricing beyond your regular business model, if you could just comment on that, and clearly if you're looking at the results, your margins seem to be okay. And look, as you are well aware, Andrew, our contracts on average have 2% to 3%, price escalation that historically we talked to customers as being tied to CPI. Over a five or six-year contract, our prices move up 15% to 18% for those customers. So in a way every year, we are increasing prices on our customers, and that allows us to maintain in that regard, the gross margins and profitability for our software business. And we believe our financial discipline, which is also tied to the different levers that we use in the company to compensate and create an attractive rewards program for our employees, will allow us to manage through this. a) You do report, you have a midyear year, but as you're thinking about conversations with your customers for a remainder of calendar 2022, can you just tell us, give us more color as to \u2013 right, because they are on a calendar year budget and you're in your fiscal year budget. How does it look to things accelerate into the calendar year and more importantly, does the nature of your conversation with your customers changing, right, because of going forward, you're going to be closely aligned with Emerson and do these sort of hard way capabilities change, how you interact with your customers and the kind of conversations you're starting to have. Well, let me look, first of all, since our customers\u2019 fiscal year is the calendar year and the budget is for the calendar fiscal year, the outlook for the rest of the calendar year supported by these strong budgets that they put in place for this calendar year. So we would expect that Q4, Q1 and Q2, meaning the June, September and December quarters are still going to reflect the strength in spending that we saw in this March quarter. And depending on the macro situation towards the end of this calendar year, new budgets for calendar 2023 will dictate the spending environment then. Now it\u2019s not only we need AspenTech Solutions for profitability purposes, we need AspenTech Solutions for profitability and sustainability reasons. With respect to Emerson, absolutely, you see customers that are both users of Emerson and AspenTech and they themselves are thinking about the possibilities from combined solutions between Emerson and AspenTech, how the synergies from the two relationships into that customer and other areas of collaboration, so including co-innovation between customer Emerson and AspenTech to help them address sustainability or operational excellence issues. Your line is open. Antonio, it seems like the Engineering and MSC suites are certainly performing ahead of your expectations, but APM maybe a bit below what you\u2019re expecting. So having said that, look, I said that there's a little bit \u2013 in my opinion, there was a little bit of pent-up demand in the March quarter because of lack of spending over the last two years. And the easiest thing to do when you want to spend and you really haven't \u2013 you've fallen behind on your automation and digitalization plans is to go with what you know, and the low hanging fruit, which is advanced process control optimization plan in scheduling history and so on. And then you start to focus on new technologies, new areas of technology spending and I think that's APM. Matt, in 2019, really towards the end of 2019, beginning of 2020, I was talking to you guys and investors about this wave of CapEx spending in LNG around gas. And that CapEx wave, which was estimated to be about $125 billion over five years sort of dissipated with the pandemic in 2020 and a lot of that investment was put on hold. We believe that certainly the geopolitical situation in Europe around Ukraine is refocusing countries and customers on LNG as an alternative fuel both low carbon, but also a diversification of supplies. So that would be the main driver initially, of course, oil will continue \u2013 CapEx in oil will probably continue to increase low to mid single-digit as a result of the need for more oil supply over the next three to five years and that will also be a benefit. But more importantly, LNG CapEx, which in 2019, we were talking about $125 billion over a five-year period. Your line is open. And then switching gears a little bit here, with respect to the pharma business, it's been about a year now since a new General Manager was hired or appointed to that business. I mean, look, pharma certainly it's an opportunity for us and a lot of the work that was put in place when he first joined, but this time last year was an investment in R&D that will start to bear fruit later this year in our next release of software in November. But yes, pharma continues in its trajectory and it\u2019s something that we're still focused on, so\u2026\n Great."
