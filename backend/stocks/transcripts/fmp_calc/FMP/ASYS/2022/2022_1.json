    "content": " Among the important factors which could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are changes in the technologies used by customers and competitors; change in volatility and the demand for products; the effect of changing worldwide political and economic conditions, including trade sanctions; the effect of overall market conditions, including the equity and credit markets and market acceptance risks; ongoing logistics and supply chain and labor challenges, capital allocation plans; and the worldwide COVID-19 pandemic. The strong demand for our products continued in the first quarter with bookings of 31.6 million up 77% year-over-year, backlog of 48.5 million up 250% year-over-year, and revenue of 27.3 million up 52% year-over-year, representing yet another record over the past three years. Selling, general and administrative expenses SG&A increased $1.4 million on a sequential basis, adjusting for the partial insurance reimbursement for the cyber incident of $0.4 million in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2021. SG&A increased $2.7 million compared to prior year period, due primarily to $1.1 million in increased shipping and logistics costs driven by higher revenues and increased shipping rates, $0.4 million in higher commissions on higher sales, $0.3 million in added SG&A from our acquisition of Intersurface Dynamics in March 2021."
