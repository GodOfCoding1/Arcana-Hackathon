    "content": " Among the important factors which could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are changes in the technologies used by customers and competitors; change in volatility and demand for our products; the effect of changing worldwide political and economic conditions, including trade sanctions; the effect of overall market conditions, including the equity and credit markets and market acceptance risks; ongoing logistics, supply chain and labor challenges; capital allocation plans; and the worldwide COVID-19 pandemic. Moving on, the robust demand for our products continued in the second quarter with bookings of $33.7 million, up 4% over a strong second quarter in 2021. In the second quarter, we saw bookings increase nearly 100% year-over-year and gross margin for this segment improved to 48%, driven by increasing strength in our consumable products as our customers continue to expand manufacturing capacity. Net revenues increased 5% sequentially and 44% from the second quarter of fiscal 2021, with the sequential increase primarily attributable to strong shipments of our advanced packaging equipment and the increase from the prior year quarter due to higher shipments across all of our product lines. SG&A increased $2.1 million compared to the prior year period due primarily to $0.6 million and higher commissions on higher sales, $0.6 million in employee-related expenses, $0.4 million in higher shipping expenses driven by higher revenues and increased shipping rates and $0.2 million and added SG&A from our acquisition of Intersurface Dynamics in March 2021."
