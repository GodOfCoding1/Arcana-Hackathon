    "content": " Before we get started, I would like to remind everyone that management will be making statements during this call that include forward-looking statements regarding the company's financial results, research and development, manufacturing and commercialization activities regulatory process operations, the impact of COVID-19 on its business and other matters. As in the previous quarter, the revenue growth was due to the acquisition of Zebra Medical Vision, now Nanox.AI, a deep learning machine analytics company; MDW, now Nanox Marketplace, which is decentralized marketplace connecting imaging facilities with the radiologists; and USARAD Holdings, Inc., a leading provider of teleradiology services. We ended the quarter with property and equipment net of $41.2 million, the increase of $3.8 million during the first quarter of 2022 is mainly due to the completion of our -- the construction of our fab in South Korea and the preparation for mass production of our MEMs chips. So I think that the process as it's going right now from -- at least from our point of view and especially due to the fact that it's kind of a new technology that they haven't experienced in the past years, and asking a lot of fundamental questions."
