    "content": " We reported a GAAP net loss for the fourth quarter of 2022 of $44.8 million, compared with a net loss of $22.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2021, which increase was largely due to expenses related to increased research and development expenses and goodwill impairments related to the acquisitions of Nanox AI, which was mitigated by decrease in our general and administrative expenses and an increase in our obligation in connection with the merger and acquisitions, mainly due to the settlement with the former shareholders of Nanox AI. Right now, all the other hospitals or educational offices, by the way, like the one in Ghana, what we are working with them is to get a special permit by the way, in Europe and in the US, to get special permit and to get the clinical trials or clinical samples to be taken working with the hospital in order to expand first of all, the variety, but also to expand the presence and the understanding of the art and the tomosynthesis and to ensure that we are in a process to get it ready once we start the mass deployment."
