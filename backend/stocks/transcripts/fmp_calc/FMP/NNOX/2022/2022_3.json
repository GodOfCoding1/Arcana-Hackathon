    "content": " We reported a GAAP net loss for the third quarter of 2022 of $19.1 million, compared with a net loss of $13.5 million in the third quarter of 2021, which increase was largely due to the consolidation of Nanox.AI and USARAD with the Company since the fourth quarter of 2021, an increase in our research and development expenses, an increase in our general and administrative expenses, which was mitigated by a decrease in our sales and marketing expenses and a $1.0 million expense due to change in our obligation in connection of acquisitions. The increase was due largely to the consolidation of Nanox.AI and USARAD with the company since the fourth quarter of 2021, an increase in the company's headcount and the overall organization infrastructure and an increase the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s legal fee due to the US Securities and Exchange Commission inquiry and class- action litigation as discussed in the company's Form 6-k file today and Form 20- F from the year ended December 31, 2021, filed on May 2, 2022. Our approach is right now to do the deployment in the US only in the next step, and we'll inform when we actually get the dialogue with the FDA, and as soon as we can get it, we're making all the preparation, even in the countries that will require the FDA, namely meeting distributors, getting to know better the customers, know the preparation of their regulatory processes, et cetera, et cetera."
