    "content": " As the market deteriorate fast, we moved quickly to respond and initiated cost-cutting actions that reduced our non-GAAP operating expenses by $338 million, which is 23% less on an annualized basis from the second quarter of 2022 to the fourth quarter of 2022. Our average number of principal agents increased to 13,426, representing a 10% growth year-over-year in the fourth quarter. In the fourth quarter of 2022, Compass agents averaged 3.2 transactions per principal agent, which outdistanced the industry average of 1.3. We grew the average number of principal agents 18% year-over-year in 2022, and our principal agent retention for Q4 2022 was 98%, which is consistent with both Q3 2022 and Q4 2021. Gross transaction value was $42.5 billion in the fourth quarter, a decline of 34% from a year ago, reflecting a 25% reduction in total transactions as well as a decrease in average selling price of about 12%. Free cash flow during the fourth quarter was negative $131 million, which was higher than prior year due to the higher adjusted EBITDA loss as well as approximately $18 million of severance payments related to our reduction in force and $10.5 million from litigation settlements announced last quarter. Your line is open. Your line is open. We haven't historically given forward-looking forecasts for principal agents, and we don't intend to start doing that, particularly given the market conditions we mentioned on the scripted portion of the call that nor has seen the total number of agents in the industry decline from 1.6 million to 1.5 million, I believe. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open."
