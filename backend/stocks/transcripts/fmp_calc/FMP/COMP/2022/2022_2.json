    "content": " Today, we are sharing our financial results for the second quarter of 2022, our outlook for the third quarter and full year 2022 and updates on our ongoing expense reduction plans and how they position us to generate positive free cash flow in 2023. Going forward, I am focusing the company's efforts around the following three objectives: one, generating free cash flow; two, profitably gaining market share; and three, retaining our agents and our principal agent retention continues to be above 90%, even growing quarter-over-quarter. So in terms of the reduction, as Robert mentioned on the call, we're going to focus the reductions on the two biggest areas of expense that we have: technology and our incentives, to acquire agents, so those are reflected in the R&D and sales and marketing lines, on the P& L that we report."
