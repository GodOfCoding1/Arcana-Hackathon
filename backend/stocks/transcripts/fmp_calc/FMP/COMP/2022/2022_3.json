    "content": " For Q4 of this year, we expect revenue of $1.15 billion to $1.3 billion, which is a reduction to the implied Q4 guidance we provided in August, reflecting the pressure on the real estate market driven by continued increases in mortgage rates and volatility in the equity markets. This translates into an adjusted EBITDA loss for the full year of $185 million to $215 million, which is within the range of the full year adjusted EBITDA loss guidance we provided in August, reflecting the favorable impact that our cost reductions have had to partially offset the continued weakness we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re seeing on the revenue line."
