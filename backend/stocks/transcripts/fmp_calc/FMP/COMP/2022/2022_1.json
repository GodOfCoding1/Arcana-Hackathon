    "content": " Kristen's leadership over the past four years, is a key reason I believe, we are well prepared to continue to grow, outperform the industry and take share while delivering on our commitments to profitability and cash flow regardless of market conditions. Second, our expense base increase in Q1 2022 compared to a year ago, driven by the annualization of investments we made last year to drive profitable growth in the long-term, namely in our platform, adjacent services and our new expansion markets. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. And to put even a finer point on our outlook for the year even, if there is no market growth no new agents and no new markets and no growth in T&E and mortgage, we would expect to generate 15% top line growth. Your line is open."
