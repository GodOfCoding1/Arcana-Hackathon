    "content": " In our heavy materials sector, which includes our Cement and Concrete and Aggregates segments, revenue increased 3%, reflecting higher cement sales prices and revenue from the acquired business in Northern Colorado, partially offset by lower cement sales volume resulting from difficult weather conditions and much lower inventory levels during this quarter. I think, look, as we said in the last couple of quarters, we had some operational issues there that we believe we had turned the quarter on and when these businesses and the operations start to become more consistent, you see a turnaround pretty quick in terms of profitability. Look, I would say the acquisitions that we've made over the last decade or so and the improvements that we've continued to make in the network, whether that's from a distribution perspective or just operating efficiencies, I think we actually have a lower cost system today than where we were in prior cycles, in many different ways, again, logistically and operationally. Yes, it's a great question and how the supply and demand is currently right now, I think we're going to be going into this next year, very similar to last year, where we will be -- our key is to keep our plants running and get as much out of each plant as we can because the demand is there. Hey, good morning guys. Hey, good morning guys."
