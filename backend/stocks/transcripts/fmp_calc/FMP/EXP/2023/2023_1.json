    "content": " We realized 24% price increases in wallboard for the quarter, reflecting the strong prevailing market demand and we realize 10% higher cement -- prices for cement. Yes, Trey, what we do is we've historically done with any cycle, as you know, we monitor our demand profile, which right now our demands are strong across both businesses, but we monitor those demand profiles and we could we can shift with those demand profiles to make sure we continue to operate the operations effectively. But take all of that against the environment that we're operating in where we've been able to achieve good price increases across all these businesses and certainly the demand environment is very supportive of that with very high utilization rates across the network, but there's no doubt a portion of those are also associated with these inflation costs around energy."
