    "content": " Annual diluted earnings per share for the full fiscal year increased 14% to a record $9.14, reflecting strong pricing across each business line, good margin expansion and our reduced share count. It's atypical to have multiple price increases in one calendar year, which demonstrates the very strong demand environment and the sold-out position of the U.S. cement industry. Annual revenue in our Light Materials sector increased 27%, reflecting improved wallboard sales volume and prices and annual operating earnings increased 42% to $274 million, reflecting higher net sales prices and wallboard operating margins improving by 680 basis points. If we think about a scenario where, let's say, housing starts dropped to 1.2 million starts nationwide, is the same level of margins that we saw last time starts were at similar levels, a good way to think about your business or any other moving pieces we should keep in mind given the factors that you just stepped through."
