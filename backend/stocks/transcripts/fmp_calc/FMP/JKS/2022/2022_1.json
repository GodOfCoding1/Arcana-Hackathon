    "content": " Leveraging our competitive advantages in supply chain management and our global network, we delivered solid results in the first quarter of 2022 with total revenues of RMB 14.8 billion, an increase of 86% year-over-year and quarterly shipments up by 57% year-over-year to 8.4 gigawatt. Despite a very challenging environment due to macroeconomic uncertainties and supply chain disruptions from the resurgence of COVID-19 in many parts of the world, we continue to improve our in-house cost structure and our gross profit in the first quarter, increased by more than 60% year-over-year. For the first quarter of 2022, total revenues increased significantly year-over-year as a result of strong shipment growth and competitive module prices to mitigate the impact of higher ore material prices, we strengthened our supply chain management. So the first quarter, we didn't have the shipments from the new capacity \u2013 and from the order perspective, it's very attractive from the customer perspective, we are confident we are able to ship over 10 gigawatts segments and for the full year."
