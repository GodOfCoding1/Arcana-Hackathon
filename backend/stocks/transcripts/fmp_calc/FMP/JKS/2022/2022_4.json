    "content": " Please note that today's discussion will contain forward-looking statements, made under the safe harbor provisions of the U.S. Leveraging our outstanding global supply chain management and marketing network, our total shipments and total revenue increased significantly year-over-year. About 30% of the total PV demand, leveraging our accumulated experience in mass production and marketing expect our proportion of N-type shipments in 2023 to further increase penetration of N-type products far stating the industry average. I think the most important for the company business is, we are doing investments in time, starting at the beginning of 2022, and we reached to 35 gigawatts N-type capacity by the end of last year and with more N-type shipments and polysilicon now the supply is sufficient on this downward trend and we have significant sales order pipeline in 2023, and we think we are in a good position to drive the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s growth including the revenue gross margin net profitability."
