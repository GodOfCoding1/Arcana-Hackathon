    "content": " While the first quarter was lower than we had expected, we continue to see healthy demand and expect supply chain disruptions to ease modestly in the back half, both of which should positively impact our performance as we move throughout the year. For the full year, although we are pricing for higher cost than anticipated, margins are expected to be slightly below prior guidance due to pressures we are seeing in the business around freight, raw materials, and additional inefficiencies associated with supply chain challenges. I'm not suggesting we're seeing the demand soften, but the point I'm trying to make is that the inventory is so depleted throughout the channel that we feel confident we'd be able to work right through any kind of economic movement that we might see or volatility because we've got a lot of work to do to get inventory back in the channel. And obviously, if our efforts combined with a supply chain environment that improves better than we're expecting, we'd obviously be able to improve upon that because as you can see, in any given quarter, the majority of the retail is presold, which means we've got the ability if we can get the parts to get these vehicles through. So, we think the risk of continued increase in supply chain costs to be relatively limited in the back half of the year versus the prior year and versus where we are right now. I mean, we've got a lot of important strategic initiatives and with the channel refill opportunity in front of us, even if we were to see a demand drop off for a couple of quarters, I think we're still going to stay the course from a business perspective."
