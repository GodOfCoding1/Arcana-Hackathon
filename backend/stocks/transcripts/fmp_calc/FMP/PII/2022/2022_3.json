    "content": " And then as I think about the market share conversation that we've had, it seems like you guys believe that it is more a product availability issue than it is a product issue per se, which in theory, would create a pretty big opportunity once you get back to sort of normalized stocking levels. We're delivering to what consumers are prebuying, but we're not able to get our inventory up above those levels, and that's going to be a big focus, which has us in a positive share position, not just in the fourth quarter, but as we get into 2023. Semiconductor is a prime example, in a much better spot than it was trending in the right direction, but it's going to be a bit of a journey until we get back to the levels that would be able to meet all the demand that we have in front of us, if you think about the amount of tech that we now have on the vehicle. That's a big part of this market share discussion we've had, specifically around our utility business, but it is moving in the right direction, and we're going to continue to push and do everything we can to make sure those improvements, not only stick, but continue to move in the right direction. I do think we talk a lot about investing in our business, and we've ramped up the level of CapEx in the investment the last couple of years, and a lot of that has been focused on, not really exciting projects, but just adding more back shop production capacity and capability around the world that our various factories to allow us to bring back in things that have been outsourced just due to volumes."
