    "content": " We've had $2 million in the quarter for FX , we think about $4 million year-to-date, about 15% to 25% of our revenues in a given quarter, depending on the mix are coming out of pounds, Norwegian krone, Brazilian reals, and the pound really got hit hard in Q3, which impacted us in the quarter. So we've got five or six trees kind of in that $75 million number right now, but we expect that there could be upside depending on how many of those -- the $150 million to $200 million tender gets awarded in the quarter. And I recognize it's a little early to ask you this, but I'm going to anyways on how you're thinking about what '23 orders might look like. I mean the quarter -- so year-to-date, we're about $20 million behind where we had anticipated in our internal projections that presented that 3% to 5% free cash flow margin, and really split into two things. One is working capital is higher by about $15 million, specifically due to sort of what I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d call investment in inventory, strategically ahead of what's going to happen, who knows in Europe this winter, stocking plans and so forth have been replenished to kind of make sure we've got raw materials for the foreseeable future. Yes, I think there's enough sort of support and energy right now where you're going to see a lot of these -- a lot of transactions probably come to the threshold here over the next six to 12 months or so. I mean the shallow water tree that we've got, we're making some tweaks to make it more fit for purpose, but it's a nice offering that we have on the Subsea product side for a long time, and we're just converting that over to -- for use in CCUS. So if you go out to kind of, call it, 2024 when everything has been been installed there, I think that's the next time we'll really do a reassessment of what's our refine look like and do we need to tweak that again."
