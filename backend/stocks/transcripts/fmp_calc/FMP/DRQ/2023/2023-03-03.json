    "content": " Fourth quarter gross margin grew by over 15%, and our overall profitability improved with adjusted EBITDA reaching almost 11% in Q4 and improving 350 basis points year-over-year. We ended the year with a very strong and growing backlog of over $241 million, representing double-digit sequential and year-over-year growth as product bookings increased due to improving market conditions. Fourth quarter revenue was $96.8 million and increased 24% year-over-year, driven primarily by higher product and service revenues across all regions, reflecting the ongoing up cycle in the offshore market. The improvement in adjusted EBITDA was driven by improved macro trends, strong performances in all of our businesses with subsea product revenue, up 15%; sub-fee services revenue up 10% and downhole tools revenue up 6%. As we look toward the first quarter of 2023, we do expect to see a bit of a gap in bookings for the first quarter sequentially, likely in the $60 million to $80 million range due to the fact the fourth quarter tends to be seasonally very strong as customers utilize the remaining CapEx budgets."
