    "content": " Cost of revenue for the first quarter was approximately $2.0 million, including $1.0 million from the cost of diagnostic test and testing services we performed for our pharma customers, and $0.9 million in non-cash amortization expenses of DetermaRx and pharma services related intangibles. Sales and marketing expense for the first quarter of 2022 was $3.2 million, an increase of $1 million year-over-year, primarily attributable to an increase in headcount and continued ramp in sales and marketing activities to prepare for commercialization of our transplant business, as well as support the commercialization efforts of DetermaIO and DetermaRx. I would -- I think the DetermaCNI timeline is the one that's at the greatest risk candidly, because right now we are not going to -- unless we find an appropriate partner that wants to do some studies with us and keep them fairly cost neutral for us, we'll probably not invest behind those studies, we'll launch it as an RUO in the United States for pharma and hope we can solicit some of that support from pharma."
