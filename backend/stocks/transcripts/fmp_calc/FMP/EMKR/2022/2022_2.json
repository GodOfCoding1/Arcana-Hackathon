    "content": " EMCOR's second fiscal quarter revenue was $32.7 million, roughly at the consensus midpoint for revenue but down about 23% over Q1. On the cable TV side, excess transmitter will remain a major challenge, forcing us to reduce our guidance range for June quarter to $25 million to $27 million, which includes $3.5 million in revenue from our new acquisition. $7.5 million of the sequential quarter revenue change was attributable to our cable TV products, which, as indicated during our last call, was impacted by transmitter inventory tied up in the channel at 1 MSO. Shifting for a moment to the GAAP results, fiscal 2Q net loss was $2.2 million or $0.06 per share -- this included several items associated with the transition of our cable TV operations to our third-party manufacturer fast train. And the principal problem is the techniques you employ over on the commercial side of the business to break let's call it availability problems going to brokers, finding customers that may have excess inventory, they don't work, and it's because of the slowdowns and requirements we have for these government contracts for counterfeit protection on parts. One of them looks kind of interesting, the SCI-70 in the precision guided munitions -- this sounds like maybe a substantial or important piece of this opportunity to run revenues up to $30 million per year. And the implication of that, let's just keep the math simple, call it, $1 million, at 50% margin, it implies that once you're shipping $2 million a quarter -- sorry, yes, $2 million a quarter worth of devices, you are effectively paying for the fab with or without cable television. And then, once we get to the point where we're shipping $2 million a quarter worth of devices, which won't take us too long, right, then it starts to turn margin accretive."
