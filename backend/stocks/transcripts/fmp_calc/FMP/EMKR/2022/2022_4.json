    "content": " Operating expenses were $11.2 million in fiscal 4Q, compared to $10.5 million in the prior quarter, due largely to the inclusion of the Inertial Navigation acquisition for part of the quarter. Together with the gross margin items I just outlined, as well as the need to invest in future growth, 4Q operating loss was $10.8 million, adjusted EBITDA was negative $9.4 million and net loss was $10.9 million or $0.29 per share. The GAAP results also included two non-cash items excluded from the non-GAAP measures, a $3 million long lived asset impairment charge associated with the Alhambra fog operation and a $3.1 million accounting credit related to the reversal of variable incentive comp accrued during the first three quarters of fiscal '22. The $49 million decrease consisted of $55 million to acquire the Chicago Inertial Navigation business, $2.4 million representing the second and final payment related to the space in Nav acquisition, $5.2 million in acquisition transaction costs and $1.8 million in CapEx."
