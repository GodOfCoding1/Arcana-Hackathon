    "content": " When these products hit full production, they're expected to produce$20 million to $25 million in revenue per year and are also expected to significantly contribute to gross margins. To add some perspective on the severity of the current down cycle, cable TV product revenue this quarter was $1.6 million compared to $28.5 million in the year ago quarter, and $20 million when looking back to just the March 2022quarter. During the first half of fiscal '22, Broadband accounted for 75% of the business, and just a couple of quarters later in fourth quarter of fiscal '22 and first quarter of fiscal '23, this has completely flipped to over 80% of revenue coming from Aerospace & Defense. Just looking at the December quarter results here on gross margins, broadband gross margin is actually negative and it seems hot or interesting that revenues went down $1.3 million and gross profit down almost the same amount."
