But I would say on top of the financial things that we can see around that business, we can be seen the enabler to maximize what potentially Vegas could be for Formula One in terms of awareness, in terms of business creation, in terms of activating an area of the world where we can bring internationality and I think that is a great win to win business also for the ones that are investing there. And a keen developer, let's see, two strategy and that one, how we can maximize the value that Formula One will bring to community, but also how we can maximize the value of our partners that are coming here and investing for Formula One can see as once again, the enabling factor of creating business opportunity for them. There's some issues also, we're still looking at around Sirius and what we might do there, as you know, we crossed -- just crossed over the 80 there, we've just had Formula One become an ATP.
