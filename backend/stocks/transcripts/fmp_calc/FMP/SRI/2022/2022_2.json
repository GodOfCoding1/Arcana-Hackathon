    "content": " We are reducing our midpoint adjusted revenue guidance by $15 million or 1.7% to reflect slower than expected improvement in customer production forecasts, driven primarily by material shortages, despite continued strong end market demand. Operating loss, excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency of $2.1 million, improved by approximately 210 basis points relative to the first quarter, primarily due to favorable net engineering spend, and the timing of customer reimbursements, as well as favorable SG&A spend. Stoneridge Brazil's second quarter sales, excluding the favorable impact of foreign currency of $700,000, increased by $600,000, or approximately 4.8% relative to the first quarter of 2022, due primarily to the impact of typical sales seasonality. Adjusted operating income, excluding the favorable impact of foreign currency of $400,000, declined by approximately $0.5 million relative to the first quarter, primarily due to slightly higher SG&A and D&D spend. That's aligned, Justin - if you look at the second to third quarter progression, that's aligned with our - kind of the high end or a little bit greater than the high end of our historical contribution margins, if you think about kind of the impact of FX and the inventory stuff we talked about in the second quarter, which we see as reasonable given the fact that we've taken cost reduction actions that we expect to continue for the remainder of the year, and the fact that as you get some incremental revenue - some significant incremental revenue, we always expect to contribute at the high end of that range as revenue ramps up faster."
