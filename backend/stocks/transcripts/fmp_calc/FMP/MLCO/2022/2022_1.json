    "content": " Most of our costs as we look forward are probably going to be more related to the W. We think we can stretch with our existing team, particularly with some of the programs that we've got working with some of our dealers and converting some of our staff that we've got that are probably more excess staff now, converting those over into, let's say, some of the non gaming roles, whether that be in the front desk, be in the restaurants, but the idea is to take a lot of our existing staff where we're overstaffed with some of our local talent and to convert them over and to try to operate as best we can."
