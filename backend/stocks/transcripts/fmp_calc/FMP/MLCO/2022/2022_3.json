    "content": " Our results for the third quarter of 2022 continued to be impacted by the challenging operating environment resulting from low levels of visitation due to COVID related travel restrictions, and the government mandated closure of our casinos in Macau in July. A favorable VIP win rate positively affected EBITDA at COD Macau, Studio City and Cyprus by around $3.6 million, while an unfavorable win rate negatively impacted COD Manila by around 400,000. Furthermore, the quarter-to-quarter devaluation of the Philippine Peso and the Euro negatively impacted our reported property EBITDA by around $3 million for COD Manila and about 400,000 for Cyprus. To provide more clarity on our capital structure Melco, excluding its operations at Studio City, the Philippines and Cyprus had cash on hand of around $700 million available liquidity of around 1.4 billion and gross debt of $5.3 billion at the end of September 2022. Can you please provide us an update on OpEx or your expectation of OpEx, do you guys anticipate it to be around $1.7 million per day that you're experiencing in the second quarter?"
