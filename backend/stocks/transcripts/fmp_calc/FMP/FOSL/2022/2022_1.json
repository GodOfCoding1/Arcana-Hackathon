    "content": " We are pleased to report strong first quarter results in line with our expectations, which includes 4% worldwide net sales growth or 6% on a constant currency basis. Q1 net sales came in at $376 million, up 4% year-over-year and up 6% on a constant currency basis. From a regional perspective sales in the Americas region were up 6% in constant currency, with stronger wholesale sales in the front half of the quarter and stronger brick and mortar traffic and retail stores throughout the quarter. As a percentage of sales, SG&A costs were 52.1%, up 50 basis points versus the prior year period as increases in labor costs and investments in our digital initiatives were only partially offset with reduced store costs arising from lower store count versus the prior year. We expect full-year adjusted operating margins to be between 5.5% to 6.5%, compared to our prior guidance of 6% to 7%, primarily driven by some impact from FX headwinds, as well as lower revenue mix from international regions, which typically carry a higher margin."
