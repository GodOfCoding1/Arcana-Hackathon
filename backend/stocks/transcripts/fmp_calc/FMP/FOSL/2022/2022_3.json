    "content": " In the quarter, sales in Mainland China were down 44% versus last year. In Asia, sales were down 17% in constant currency, primarily impacted by sales in Mainland China, which were down 44% versus last year in constant currency. Declines were most notable in Mainland China as well as the US market where many wholesalers are constraining open to buys in order to sell through existing inventory and across all of our global distribution channels, digital sales, which we define as sales on our own e-commerce sites, global third party platforms and wholesale.com were down 12% versus last year and represented approximately 37% of our total sales mix. Net sales dollars in our smart watch category were $33 million sequentially flat to our prior quarters volume, but down 34% in constant currency versus last year. 130 basis points in FX driven higher inventory costs in our European and Asian subsidiaries due to a stronger US dollar this year versus last year, increased promotional outlet channels and a lower China sales mix, which carries significantly higher product margins compared to our other markets. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales were 45.2%, up 220 basis points versus last year, primarily due to lower sales. As we mentioned, our inventory levels at the end of Q3 were up 14% versus last year, which is too high relative to our sales forecast."
