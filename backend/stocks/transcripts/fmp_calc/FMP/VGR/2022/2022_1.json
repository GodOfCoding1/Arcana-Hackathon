    "content": " I'm pleased to report that we are successfully capitalizing on both opportunities, highlighted by the fact that Liggett's retail market share increased to 5.2% in the first quarter of 2022, up from 4.2% in the first quarter of last year, driven by the growth of our Montego brand. Similar to our successful expansions of Pyramid beginning in 2009 and Eagle 20's in 2013 Montego's significant volume and market share growth has required targeted investment, which led to a small decline in year-over-year income in the first quarter of 2022. Montego distribution expanded to over 63,000 stores in the first quarter of 2022 compared to approximately 26,000 stores in the first quarter of 2021, while the brand market share increased to 1.9% compared to 0.4% in the corresponding period in 2021. So, the issue is if you look at the smaller companies in the U.S., we are in a dominant position relative to them because of our share, because of our nationwide sales force and frankly, it never has made sense to this point, to pay a premium for their volume, which is a price based volume, where it's much more efficient for us to build it ourselves and that's what we've done in the course of the last 20 some odd years, building up from 1.5% market share to a 5.2% market share."
