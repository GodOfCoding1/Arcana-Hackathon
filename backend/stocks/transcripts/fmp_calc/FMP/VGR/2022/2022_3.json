    "content": " For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 revenues increased 26.9% to a record $338 million and 18.5% to approximately $1.1 billion respectively compared to $297.9 million and $895.9 million for the corresponding 2021 period. Related to this despite an increase in MSA cost per pack from $0.40 in the third quarter of 2021 to $0.57 in the third quarter of 2022, tobacco gross profit for the three months ended September 30, 2022 declined only slightly to $111 million compared to $111.5 million for the corresponding period a year ago, reflecting a gradual transition of our strategy on Montego's growth from volume to profit-based."
