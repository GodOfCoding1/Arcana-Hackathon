    "content": " And as you saw yesterday, we expect our revenue and adjusted EBITDA to hit new high water marks, including free cash flow of more than $2.1 billion, while our return on invested capital should be another milestone for us. Outside of rental, fourth quarter used sales increased by roughly 26% to $409 million as we sold some fleet we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve held back on selling earlier in the year. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $1.65 billion, another record and an increase of $338 million or 25.8% year-on-year. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll add that within the fourth quarter results, in the roughly three weeks we owned Ahern, the business contributed about $54 million of total revenue, the vast majority of which was rental and roughly $20 million of EBITDA. Total revenue is expected in the range of $13.7 billion to $14.2 billion, implying full year growth of about 20% at midpoint and pro forma growth of roughly 12%. What I really wanted to refer to is you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll prop because it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the one that we feel pretty sure of is that you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll probably see us do more about 20% of our capital spend here in Q1 as opposed to maybe in a standard year, it would be 12% to 15%. So I think you hit the nail on the head, certainly as reported, flow-through would look like 48 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 or excuse me, as reported looks like 48% pro forma 55%, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hard to kind of discretely break apart the businesses. Matt, maybe the first is just on fleet productivity and just how you think about the components within that in 2023, just thinking of maybe time and rate given that you held on the fleet longer in this year to make sure you met the demand presuming you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re running pretty hot on time."
