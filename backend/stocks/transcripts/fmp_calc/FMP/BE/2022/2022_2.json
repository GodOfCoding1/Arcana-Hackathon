    "content": " The clear competitive advantage attainable when combined with nuclear power plants is why Westinghouse Electric Company and Bloom Energy announced signing a Letter of Intent to pursue clean hydrogen production in commercial nuclear power market, the IML demonstration and announcement today should provide greater market momentum going forward. It's the reality company is safe in many parts of the US and in Europe, I might add, whether it's a Bloom Energy server, delivered on a SCIT and installed within date or it's a Bloom Energy server power tower in urban settings with very low land needs, our solutions enable customers to solve energy reliability, security, and decarbonization in the manner that best suits their needs with a very quick to power option. In the short-term, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, the two markets that I truly believe are going to be the early adopters are hard to decarbonize industries that can use that hydrogen to decarbonize and have a source of heat and have renewable electricity coming to them where you don't have the logistics, transportation, liquefaction, pressurization, all that involved is the obvious first place where it will play a big role, and it will have a huge impact on the carbon footprint. That and then the curtail nuclear power where you're getting in a way, from a marginal cost basis, that electricity for that nuclear operator is free, right, because during the day, it's being curtailed and to be able to use that in the heat and to produce the hydrogen."
