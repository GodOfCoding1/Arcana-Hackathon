    "content": " Reducing methane emissions from oil and gas production by 75%, a technically proven and economically viable option today will have the same impact as replacing 60% of the world\u2019s coal power plants with renewable electricity. Our power generation value proposition of sustainability, resiliency and predictability continues to resonate with customers, whether it\u2019s providing a roadmap for decarbonization or delivering resilient power without backup diesel generators, our 24/7 AlwaysON energy server is receiving the attention of commercial and industrial customers. So when we talk to a customer, you\u2019ve almost got that inherent natural hedge, right, where the best alternative on a cost basis would be them and versus us so our expectation is those two things offset each other and you still get the benefits of the sustainability, the predictability and the resiliency on it. Second, of all the trends that we\u2019ve been talking about for years, whether it\u2019s resiliency, whether it\u2019s decarbonization, whether it is the predictability of price of power, whether companies needing to take control, which one of those have become less relevant today, which ones have become more relevant."
