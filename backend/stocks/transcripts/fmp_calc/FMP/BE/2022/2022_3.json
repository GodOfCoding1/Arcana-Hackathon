    "content": " If you look particularly within the fourth quarter around how we're building that framework, I would expect some improvement in our service margins, given that, but there's still about a breakeven assumption within the business that we're still able to get to our full year guidance around gross margins. One is unit costs should continue to come down like it's come down every quarter so far this year as builds have been increased, we would expect to see those unit costs to come down and that's a margin improvement. So we've got a lot in the fourth quarter that is expected to get shipped to U.S domestic customers, including the PPA for the powering that we're going to do within the fourth quarter. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re -- whether it is the ITC benefit on our core micro grid equipment, or whether it's on the ITC benefit being extended into our biogas, waste to energy business and more of that product getting in, we're really encouraged about that, as that helps our projects become more attractive to our customers. And quite frankly, as they go to their local utilities, and which they've shared with previously around this is going to be their energy demand, when they made the commitment to build in that location, they're being told that it is going to take several quarters, if not several years to get to the power that they need in."
