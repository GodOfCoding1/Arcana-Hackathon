    "content": " Shifting gears and looking more closely at the quarter, we saw strong financial performance with organic double-digit year-over-year growth in both orders and sales, healthy incremental margins drove adjusted operating margin of 19.7% and another step toward our aspirational goal of above 20%. Incoming orders were up a robust 20% year-over-year with sales of $382 million, up 12% organically on a reported basis and up 16% on a constant currency basis versus last year. These growth and margin executions combined to fuel adjusted earnings per share of $1.45, up 45% over last year's third quarter. In our Americas segment, sales were up a strong 21% year-over-year and adjusted operating margin improved 640 basis points to 27.2%."
