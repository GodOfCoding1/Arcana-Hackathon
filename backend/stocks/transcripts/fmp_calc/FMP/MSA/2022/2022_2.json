    "content": " Our quarterly revenue, which continues to be restrained by supply chain issues was $373 million, up 9% from a year ago on a reported basis and 12% on a constant currency basis. Adjusted operating margin was 14.3%, down 220 basis points from last year due to unfavorable currency headwinds, large orders and higher input costs impacting gross profit, offset partially by improvements in SG&A performance. On an adjusted basis, adding back in both periods, product liability expense, restructuring and similar items, net income was $51 million or $1.29 in adjusted EPS, which was a 22% increase over the prior year on the 9% increase in reported sales."
