    "content": " Ultimately, that translates into a nice tailwind for our business as approximately 25% to 30% of our annual sales are related to this sector and we're seeing strong demand across all our product lines. Adjusted operating margin was 16.3%, up 90 basis points versus last year as a result of higher volumes and improved SG&A leverage. On an adjusted basis, adding back in both periods, product liability expense, restructuring and similar items, net income was $43.6 million or $1.10 earnings per diluted share which is a 16% increase over the prior year. As I had indicated in my comments, we see a 20 -- we're seeing almost a 20% increase organically in business in the month of April after a 16% gain in the first quarter."
