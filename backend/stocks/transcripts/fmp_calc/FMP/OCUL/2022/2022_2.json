    "content": " For those of you following the Ocular story, you'll know that by far the most anticipated development for the company and for the hope of a more durable treatment for patients with wet AMD is our U.S.-based Phase I clinical trial for OTX-TKI, our existent containing hydrogel implant for treatment of wet AMD and other retinal diseases. This is a multicenter prospective randomized controlled trial that is evaluating a 600-microgram OTX-TKI dose in a single implant containing axitinib compared to Aflibercept, administered every 8 weeks in subjects previously treated with anti-VEGF therapy and without in an intraretinal or subretinal fluid. Our bond in this trial is to answer the question of how long a single 600-microgram OTX-TKI implant containing axitinib, keep subjects dry without the need for retreatment. We recently presented data from the completed U.S.-based Phase I clinical trial evaluating the safety, biological activity, durability and tolerability of OTX-TIC in subjects with primary open angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension at the Glaucoma 360 meeting held on February 11. All patients in the U.S.-based Phase I trial evaluated OTX-TKI in patients versus Eylea in wet AMD have now been on the study for at least 24 weeks, we've been run a late-breaker slot at the AAO, where we plan to present 28-week data."
