    "content": " This strong Q3 growth an increase about $133 million year-over-year was primarily driven by continued volume growth across the business, the impact of higher fuel prices and normalization of late fees. Record quarterly revenue paired with the scalability of our business model resulted in adjusted net income for diluted share of $3.51, an increase of 43% compared to the same quarter last year. Fleet revenue for the quarter was $378.1 million, a 32% increase over prior year, powered by strong volumes from new customer wins and renewals, higher fuel prices and increase in late fees, and the continued recovery in the existing customer base. Your line is open. Your line is open. And then on the investments that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re seeing, so we talked I think last call about $5 million to $10 million a quarter that we expected to see in the back half of the year from the investments we were making. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open."
