    "content": " Strong quarterly revenue, paired with the scalability of our business model and a superior funding model resulted in adjusted net income per diluted share of $3.44, an increase of 33% compared to the same quarter last year. Total volume process across the organization in the fourth quarter grew 31% year-over-year to $53 billion, driven by strong performance in each of our segments and reflecting the power of our model. As we look to 2023 in the health and employee benefits segment, we'll continue to benefit from our large diverse distribution network, an industry experience and expect to deliver another year of strong account growth. As I wrap up my comments, we're confident in our ability to deliver on our financial targets, including our long-term revenue CAGR of 10% to 15% and adjusted net income EPS growth of 15% to 20%, as we outlined at our last Investor Day. Fleet revenue for the quarter was $367.2 million, a 20% increase over prior year, powered by volume growth, higher fuel prices and an increase in finance fee revenue, including the contribution of the new ExxonMobil portfolio on-boarded at the end of Q3. Excluding the impact of fuel prices, fleet segment revenue growth is expected to be towards the lower end of our long-term growth target, which is 4% to 8% because of the expected slow economic growth in the U.S. We are assuming an average fuel price of $3.83 for the year, which compares to $4.46 last year.
