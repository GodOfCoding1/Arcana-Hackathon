    "content": " So the fact that prices are not going up and the fact that we have a price increase that, for most of our customers went into effect on June 1st, should give us upwards -- should be -- should positively impact our gross margin and so I do think we will see modest increases in it over the course of the next couple of quarters. And what I do -- what I did say in the -- my opening remarks and would remind you Marc is that there probably was some pull ahead sales, not probably, there was some pull ahead sales on our June 1st price increase, probably, to the tune of the low hundreds of thousands of dollars, like, let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s call it about 250 would likely have come into the second quarter sales that might have not come in until Q3 if not for the price increase. And that is that our intent is to get into a couple of dialysis clinics that might be one, it might be three, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a small number of dialysis clinics where we can demonstrate for the first time touching patients, since this was a product that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve developed without the need for trials, we want to we want to get out in commercialization into one or two dialysis clinics just to get the patient experience and demonstrate the machines capabilities and whether that is so that we can go from one to two to four to eight to 16 or it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s for strategic reasons, where we just need to get out into a clinic or get real, if you will."
