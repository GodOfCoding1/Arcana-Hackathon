    "content": "  Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Nephros, Inc. Third Quarter 2022 Financial Results Conference Call. Before we begin, I would like to caution that comments made during this conference call by management will contain forward-looking statements regarding the operations and future results of networks. I encourage you to review Nephros' filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including without limitation, the company's Forms 10-K and 10-Q, which identify specific factors that may cause actual results or events to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements. Factors that may affect the company's results include, but are not limited to, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic metros' ability to successfully timely and cost-effectively market its products and services offerings, the rate of adoption of its products and services by hospitals and other healthcare providers the success of its commercialization efforts and the effect of existing and new regulatory requirements on Nephros business and other economic and competitive factors. Contents of this conference call contains time-sensitive information that is accurate only as of the date of the live call today, November 2nd, 2022. I would now like to turn the call over to Nephros' President and Chief Executive Officer, Andy Astor. I'm very pleased to be here to report and to comment on our third quarter results, which reflect positive trends in leading growth indicators and in cash usage. Before reviewing our results, though, I will first highlight 2 events that significantly influenced third-quarter financial results. First, on October 4, we agreed to sell our pathogen detection systems business, also known as PDS. Based on relevant accounting standards, we are reporting PDS as a discontinued operation, and all asset values have been written down to 0. As a result of the company's adoption of this new policy, bone-moving inventory is now reserved more aggressively, resulting in an increase in inventory reserves and net losses of approximately $600,000. It is important to note, however, that neither of these events impacted cash usage at all. First, net revenue was $2.4 million, a decrease of 7% year-over-year and 16% over the previous quarter. Active customer sites or ACS increased 18% year-over-year to a record 1,391 sites, which is also 3% higher than the previous quarter. First, certain customers pulled ahead approximately $300,000 of their third-quarter purchases into the second quarter to avoid a price increase that took effect on June 1, 2022. The second mitigating factor was a revenue reduction of approximately $200,000 from a large customer navigating regulatory issues that were unrelated to Nephros\u00e2\u0080\u0099 products. These issues have since been resolved, and the customers' orders are now back to normal levels. If not for these 2 unusual circumstances, we believe revenue would have been approximately $2.9 million in the quarter. While revenue growth remains our top priority, we are also driving hard to achieve profitability with particular focus on establishing positive cash flow by midyear 2023. To this end, we remain committed to cost savings measures as evidenced by an 8% quarter-over-quarter decrease in total operating expense from continuing operations for the period ended September 30. We expect that the sale of PDS will further reduce our expenses by more than $300,000 per quarter. To summarize our business performance, medical water filtration or more specifically, hospital infection control and dialysis water purification was relatively strong this quarter, ending with record numbers of active customer sites. In addition, new customer sites were very strong as were sales of filter evaluation kits. Our evaluation kits provide customers with tangible evidence of Nephros filter performance, evidence that often makes a compelling case for continued use of our infection control filters. In the commercial filtration space, we have significantly improved our operations with improved manufacturing methodologies and a new sales and marketing partnership, which we will expect -- which we expect to discuss in more detail on our next earnings call. Finally, in our Specialty Renal Products segment, or SRP, the development of a commercial launch is ongoing with an anticipated rollout in at least 1 dialysis clinic around the end of 2022. We reported third-quarter net revenue of $2.4 million, a 7% decrease over prior year. Loss from discontinued operations or PDS was $1.9 million compared to approximately $360,000 in Q3 of 2021. Consolidated adjusted EBITDA in the quarter was negative $304,000 compared with negative $394,000 in Q3 of 2021. Without this event, gross margins would have been in our target range of 55% to 60%. Consolidated research and development expenses or R&D in the quarter were $252,000 compared with $394,000 in Q3 of 2021. Consolidated sales, general and administrative expenses or SG&A in the quarter were $1.7 million, no change compared with Q3 2021. Net cash used in operating activities was negative $172,000 compared to $910,000 in Q3 2021, reflecting our focus on achieving cash flow breakeven by mid-2023. Our cash balance on June 30, 2020 -- I'm sorry, our cash balance on September 30, 2022, was $3.9 million, and we reassert our belief that our current cash balances will suffice for the foreseeable future. Please refer to today's press release for more details about the calculation of adjusted EBITDA and its reconciliation to GAAP, net income or loss. Additional information about our results, including our water filtration and specialty Renal Products business segments will be found in our filing on Form 10-Q, which we plan to file on or before November 15th. But first, as always, I would like to thank each of our Nephros employees and our strategic partners for providing unsurpassed products and services to our customers, especially this year during some difficult times. We know these are challenging times for shareholders, and we believe that our ability to navigate short-term results will be to our ultimate benefit as we maintain our commitment to investments in scalable commercial and operational infrastructures as a path toward long-term sustainable growth. Operator, please open the call to questions. The change in policy was, frankly, just a careful look mostly at our commercial business, which did have a management change earlier in the year. And we found that we have excess inventory that wasn't moving as quickly as we would normally assume inventory is moving, and we decide -- and we had a formal policy in place for expiring items on the medical side, but not for filter housings and things like that, that don't formally expire, but if they're moving very slowly, shouldn't be kept on the books and so we implemented a policy immediately upon that recognition. In answer to the second half of your question, no, there's no expectation whatsoever that this would happen again this -- we expect this to be a nonrecurring item. But there's also dozens of customers that might be $5,000 or $10,000 or $50,000 customers. And it's -- I don't -- when I look at the list of old and new customers, if you will, I don't really see a change. And as many of you know, an active customer as the way we measure, which we've always done consistently is that they've purchased in the last 12 months. And so to have almost 1,400 customers that have purchased from us in the last 12 months is a heck -- well, as we reported, it's an 18% increase over what was there last year. I'll also highlight what I mentioned in the  in the call just now, which is also an increase in the number of the value rating kits, which evaluation kits are when we sell not only filters and the installation kits that go with them and the hardware and so forth. But also for free, we will do an evaluation of the water that we -- of the pathogens and other particles, the particulates, I should say, that we have retained in the filter, which is -- we find is a terrific -- is a benefit to our customers and also, therefore, is a terrific marketing mechanism that we have. And we expect that new customer growth along with the valuation kit growth will always come before larger growth in the top line revenue, which it has traditionally in the past, and this is the highest we've ever seen it. We decided to sell PDS really for the simple reason that we still believe in it, but it is costing more and taking longer to grow than we had anticipated, and I think all of us on this call have experienced that. And at a gross expense rate of about $350,000 a quarter or net expenses of about $300,000 a quarter, it just wasn't a tenable or a prudent investment to maintain. So what we did was we sold it to a partner that we have a lot of confidence in, and there is a 7-year tail on that deal, which once a certain level of gross profit is achieved. And while we're not disclosing the particulars of the deal, I don't expect to see anything significant out of that in the next year or 2. But our -- if you separate working capital from operating expense, I would expect to see a narrowing of the gap or operating income, I should say yes, of operating income over the course of the next few quarters until we achieve cash flow breakeven in mid-2023. Going to the current quarter, would you say $2.9 million is a reasonable or conservative expectation for revenues? It's a fair question, Paul, but I won't answer it. We're only a month into the new quarter, and so I will respectfully decline to a direction or  guidance. Basically, upon a more detailed look, we made some decisions in the prior couple of years that brought in inventory for businesses and for parts of the business that we did not enter. And so for example, we looked at manufacturing our own carbon block as a savings mechanism and a fair amount of cash we spent was spent on that, and it's not something that we're going to pursue. We are in discussions with clinics, and so I won't go further than that. And then in terms of the commercial launch and how that might roll out, I would expect, frankly, that even assuming that we have somebody set up, it will take some time to roll it out. But we would expect to see a clinic using it with patients early in the year, early in '23, followed by additional clinics and a rollout from there. I know on the last call, you mentioned that some of your competitors are facing supply chain issues you have and you were not. And our products are probably 98%, give or take on the shelf ready for purchase. The vast majority of our product is on the shelf and ready to go and some -- there's a few that we have to build, which will take a week or 2. But we actually spend a lot of money, time, and energy on making sure that we have sufficient inventory for our customers, partially because it's in our DNA in terms of our customer support, but also partially because part of our business is responding to emergency outbreaks of disease where minutes and hours and certainly days matter to patient safety. So we are -- I do think that situation is continuing in the marketplace and exactly how much of our market share growth is attributable to that, I wouldn't . So you mentioned that you had about $300,000 in pull-through to the second quarter ahead of the price increase. We are not seeing -- nobody likes a price increase, myself included, but we are not seeing a decrease in demand. I think that in this world that we are all living in the -- with supply chain issues and inflation and so forth, People expect price increases. We are fair about our price increases, and we take what we can and also what we should, based on our cost. But I will say from an investor standpoint that -- and I did say this in the call earlier, this is an important point that without the slow-moving inventory policy change, our gross margins were actually up in the mid-50s again, which I know our investors have been waiting for, for some time. And I'm pleased to say that the price increases have gotten us back to where we should be, and I expect to see solid gross margins, again, starting hopefully in Q4. Well, I'm not sure I understand the question. We monitor our average order value or average orders per quarter, and we have not seen a dip in that. But when a new customer comes on, their purchases are typically about 1 sift of what they average once they are a mature customer. So the first sale to a customer averages about $2,000 and follow-on sales to customers average $10,000. Well, it was my understanding sales for this past quarter and on down some. Andy, just a follow-up on the $600,000 inventory reserve. I would like to see the 2 businesses co-located, but we had talked about that earlier in the year, but never got to it basically because there was a lot of cleanup work to do in terms of product rationalization and production mechanism and part of that analysis was inventory cleanup, frankly. And for those of you on the call who don't know, I'll give just a quick firmer on emergency response. If you just look at us over the last 5 years, about 15% of our sales are for emergency response events where there's an outbreak of  or pseudomonas or what have you. We've seen it up over 30%, and we've seen it at close to 0. And frankly, we have become less dependent on it than I think we were 2 or 3 years ago. So in this quarter, in particular, Nick, it was a low emergency response quarter. And I got on the call a bit late, so you may have already talked about this. But I'm just wondering if you could comment a bit on the commercial order pipeline, following your sale to Chipotle and elaborate a little more on the significance of your partnership that was announced with Donastar and Tractor Beverage Company and how that will work. But the bottom line is, yes, I do think that we will see additional growth in the commercial business aided by our partners, and I hope to have more to say about that in the coming couple of quarters. Andy, just two quick blocking-tackling type questions. And with that, we'll be concluding today's question-and-answer session. And I thank you all for the active questioning and for your patience, both your long-term patients and your patience with me on the call. And of course, you can always reach me at andy.astor@nephros.com, and many of you have my number, and I look forward to talking to you all soon. And with that, ladies and gentlemen, we will conclude today's conference call and presentation."
