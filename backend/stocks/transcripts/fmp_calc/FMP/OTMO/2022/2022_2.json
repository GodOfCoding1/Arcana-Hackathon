    "content": " With over 1.5 billion vehicles estimated to be on the road by 2030, Otonomo's strategy is to develop the mobility data that serves as the catalyst for a new generation of services and experiences that we believe will represent over $100 billion in market opportunity for us by 2030. Our research and development expenses and our sales and marketing expenses for the second quarter of 2022 were $5.9 million and $6.1 million and increased by 155% and 297% respectively year-over-year, mainly due to the accelerated workforce growth of 231% and 217% respectively, and includes the acquisition of Neura and The Floow. General and administrative expenses for the second quarter of 2022 were $6.1 million, compared to $1.1 million in the same period a year ago, representing an increase of over 448%, mainly driven from public company expenses and non-recurring acquisition costs. We expect to continue to see a growth in revenues and other business key metrics in H2, but that growth may not be as fast as forecasted due to a combination of factors such as slower adoption rate by our fleet customers and macroeconomic condition adding uncertainty to the pace of new deal closing."
