    "content": " Several market shaping customers have successfully deployed Cadence Cerebrus, and realized remarkable productivity and power, performance and area benefits, including, a marquee Asia-Pacific systems company used Cadence Cerebrus to achieve 5X engineering productivity and nearly 10% power gains on a critical advanced node subsystem. And you may know we have been working with this particular customer for a while and now we are excited to build upon these successes with these new contracts and it\u2019s a broad ranging contract like we mentioned so it includes our EDA solutions, but it also includes our hardware platforms and our new systems solution. So these are big system and semi-companies, also our top customers in System Analysis, because we want to make sure your product is differentiated and I think that\u2019s ongoing and you see the strength and clarity in Celsius and now with the introduction of Fidelity. Now, with respect to your second question, like we said, we are pretty happy with our engagement with the marquee U.S. semiconductor company and there\u2019s a lot of opportunities to grow there over the years in multiple aspects EDA, hardware and the system solutions. I am just wondering, when you look at the especially the customized IC design, are you thinking that that\u2019s an area of your business that is going to sort of -- get back to sort of the corporate type of growth rates or maybe underperform a little bit relative to some of these newer areas, whether it\u2019s fabrication tools, system design and analysis tools, et cetera."
