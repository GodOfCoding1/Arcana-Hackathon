    "content": " At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Cadence Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2022 Earnings Conference Call. Today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s discussion will contain forward-looking statements, including our outlook on future business and operating results. Today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s earnings release for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, related financial tables and CFO commentary are also available on our website. I am pleased to report that Cadence delivered record results for 2022 as we exceeded our guidance yet again, achieving 19% revenue growth and over 40% non-GAAP operating margin. Cadence\u00e2\u0080\u0099s innovative solutions are essential and especially relevant in the current environment, enabling customers to achieve their increasingly challenging design goals. Secular megatrends such as 5G, hyperscale computing and AI/ML that are driving sustained long-term semiconductor and system growth remain unchanged. Amid ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty, companies continue making significant investment in their next-generation products, resulting in robust design activity. We expect our pioneering solutions to continue fueling broad-based business momentum in 2023, driving strong revenue growth and profitability. Our Intelligent System Design strategy greatly broadens our total available market and leading end-to-end EDA IP, hardware and expanding system analysis portfolio uniquely position us to capture a wide range of market opportunities. During the year, we introduced 9 significant innovative products across all of our business groups and we expect these to be key drivers of our future growth. The age of AI is upon us and Cadence provides several groundbreaking computational software-driven generative AI technologies at both the chip and system level unified by JedAI, our differentiated big data analytics platform. Our customers are seeing dramatic results, with these solutions delivering highly optimized designs and unprecedented efficiency gains. Additionally, by automating repetitive tasks and producing new ideas, our generative AI frees up engineers to focus on more advanced high-value activities, opening up more opportunities for innovation. During the year, we also materially expanded our core EDA, IP and system solutions footprint and market-shaping customers. In Q2, we extended our collaboration with AMD to a far-reaching commitment to our innovative core EDA hardware, design IP and system software solutions. In Q3, we deepened our partnership with BAE Systems across our core EDA and systems portfolio, including proliferation of our digital full flow and analog products and a broad expansion of our PCB and multi-physics system analysis solutions. And in Q4, we have broadened our relationship with a global leader in memory and storage solutions through an extensive proliferation of our custom, digital and system solutions. We also expanded our strategic partnership with a global leader in networking and telecommunication through their renewed commitment to our core EDA, IP and system solutions. In addition, we further our partnership with leading foundry, IP and cloud service providers and won six Open Innovation Platform Partner of the Year awards from TSMC. Our digital IC business finished another strong year, with 17% revenue growth. Deployment of our digital full-flow delivering industry-leading quality of results at the most advanced nodes continue to accelerate, with nearly 50 additional customers adopting it during the year. We are pleased with the accelerating growth of our front-end Genus and Joules Tools and signoff products such as Tempus and Qantas, complementing the board proliferation of Innovus. Our transformative Cadence Cerebrus AI-driven solution continued to deliver impressive PPA and productivity gains across a wide range of designs, resulting in broader adoption and accelerating proliferation. In Q4, GUC successfully delivered an advanced HPC design and a CPU design using our digital full flow and Cadence Cerebrus on TSMC N5 process technology, delivering 8% reduced power and a 9% area improvement while significantly improving engineering productivity. In 2022, several market-shaping customers, including Intel, NVIDIA, Broadcom, Samsung and Renesas shared their remarkable successes with Cadence Cerebrus at our CadenceLIVE user conferences. Escalating system and software bring-up complexities, combined with relentless first-pass silicon requirements, continued to drive strong demand for our essential Functional Verification solutions. Our Verification business grew 28% year-over-year, fueled by secular trend for hardware, which had another record year. Our dynamic duo of Palladium Z2 and Protium X2 platforms, providing best-in-class system verification and software bring-up solutions, saw accelerated growth and strong momentum across mobile, hyperscale, HPC and increasingly, auto EV segment. Due to the compelling value offered by common front-end compiler, demand for the pair greatly exceeded our expectations, with more than two-third of the orders in the year, including both platforms. And in early production usage at several market-shaping customers, Verisium delivered up to a 30x improvement in efficient root cause analysis. Our custom IC Virtuoso and Spectre franchise solutions tackled the toughest challenges in analog, mixed signal, RF design and circuit simulation. And as electrification and digital transformation trends gain momentum, they are becoming increasingly crucial to our customers. Building on our market leadership, our custom IC revenue grew 13% year-over-year in 2022, with Virtuoso growth spurred by demand in advanced nodes, heterogeneous integration and the emerging silicon photonics segment. Increasing usage of preconfigured IP blocks to reduce risk and time to market, coupled with our star IP portfolio, led to a strong year for our IP business, which grew 12% year-over-year in 2022. Demand was particularly strong in HPC, 5G and automotive segments, with our silicon proven, high-performance PCIe Gen 5, LPDDR5 and Ethernet interfaces helping secure key wins in advanced node designs. Rising system complexity and challenges stemming from the growing hyperconvergence of the electrical, mechanical and physical worlds are driving the strong need for a seamless platform solution across design, packaging, simulation and analysis. Our System Design and Analysis business that is expanding our TAM beyond EDA continued its strong momentum, delivering 27% year-over-year growth. Industry interest in advanced packaging solutions notably spiked in 2022, with customers embracing our revolutionary Integrity 3D-IC solution, the industry\u00e2\u0080\u0099s only comprehensive platform providing tightly integrated system planning, implementation and analysis technologies. Our multi-physics portfolio comprising of leading electromagnetic, electrothermal, signal and power integrity and CFD solutions continued ramping strongly across multiple end-markets. Our in-design analysis solutions had several significant wins with HPC and hyperscaler customers, while our CFD Fidelity platform proliferated with market shaping aerospace and defense customers. During the year, Fidelity CFD\u00e2\u0080\u0099s software meshing capabilities were chosen by Toyota Motor Europe to be their standard workflow for CFD preprocessing. And in numerous customer engagements, Optimality Explorer, the industry\u00e2\u0080\u0099s first AI-driven multidisciplinary system analysis and optimization solution has demonstrated up to a 10x efficiency improvement in design space exploration, leading to faster time to results. Lastly, in keeping with our transition plan, Lip-Bu Tan has notified the Cadence Board that he will not seek reelection at our upcoming 2023 Annual Stockholders\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Meeting in May. In closing, we are pleased with our strong execution in 2022 and are thrilled by the business momentum and market opportunities ahead of us in 2023. Now, I will turn it over to John to provide more details on the Q4 results and our 2023 outlook. Here are some of the financial highlights from the fourth quarter and the year, starting with the P&L. Our cash balance was $882 million at year end, while the principal value of debt outstanding was $750 million. Before I provide our outlook for Q1 and 2023, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d like to share a few comments. Our most recent fiscal year ended on December 31, 2022. At the midpoint of our 2023 revenue outlook, we are expecting a similar revenue mix for the year. In our outlook for 2023, we expect revenue in the range of $4 billion to $4.06 billion, GAAP operating margin of 30.5% to 32%, non-GAAP operating margin of 40.5% to 42%, GAAP EPS in the range of $3.24 to $3.34, non-GAAP EPS in the range of $4.90 to $5, operating cash flow in the range of $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion. For Q1, we expect revenue in the range of $1 billion to $1.02 billion, GAAP operating margin in the range of 31% to 32%, non-GAAP operating margin of 41% to 42%, GAAP EPS in the range of $0.84 to $0.88, and non-GAAP EPS in the range of $1.23 to $1.27. And as usual, we published the CFO commentary document on our Investor Relations website, which includes our outlook for additional items as well as further analysis and GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations. In conclusion, I am pleased that we achieved double-digit revenue growth across all of our businesses, increased 3-year revenue CAGR into the mid-teens. As always, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d like to thank our customers, partners and our employees for their continued support. Your line is open. John, your fiscal year and Q1 guidance seem to imply a relatively flat revenue profile through the year. Although I know the fiscal year, yours and theirs end slightly different months. I think one quarter ago, you were cautious, your hardware sales into fiscal \u00e2\u0080\u009823 because 2022 like you just said, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a record year for the hardware sales. The \u00e2\u0080\u0093 yes, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re expecting another strong start to the year as we continue to see strength in our hardware business. You did pick up some caution ahead I think the last quarter because hardware was proving not to be discretionary at all for our customers, and hardware demand was outpacing our ability to produce the hardware. Demand is really, really strong as we head into the new year for 2023. And as you can see from the outlook, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re expecting that last year, the 85-15 split in recurring revenue to upfront revenue mix, we expect that to continue. Now the second half of the year is harder to predict for hardware, so typically, I wait until the middle of the year. And if we see continued strength into the second half of the year, we can increase the second half later. And in the second half of the year, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve kind of de risked the second half of the year for hardware. I think some investors are worried about hyperscaler spending on EDA, I mean, both on a near-term and a long-term sense. I mean, in the near-term, I mean, obviously, the layoff in tech, well, some people think it could reduce the chip design projects and lost jobs for design engineers. And in the long-term, I mean, there is a smaller portion of the investors are kind of worried about the sustainability of the hyperscale spending strength, although I think chatter around AI recently seems to suggest that, that strength is probably not going to \u00e2\u0080\u0093 going down but probably going to accelerate. Our demand is broad-based, right, across both our semiconductor customers and our system customers. So as we mentioned before, right now, about 45% of our business is coming from system companies. If you look at whether they are social media companies or phone companies or data center companies or car companies, they have multiple design projects in different stages of development. And overall, we see strong design activity on the systems side and on the semi side. But overall, like there will be more and more designs done by system companies. And as you know, the other part of our interaction with system companies is also expanding our portfolio to include System Design & Analysis products, our SDA segment. So we are working with system companies, not just on the silicon side but on the system side, whether it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 3D-IC or thermal simulation or CFD. So last year, we reported about 27% growth in the system business, which is beyond our traditional EDA business. And I think design activity remains very strong, driven by 3-nanometer and other things and the expansion of our portfolio to System Design & Analysis. Your line is open. When I look at the guidance, 12% to 14% growth to start the year, best growth guidance I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen and you invest last year\u00e2\u0080\u0099s on a much tougher comp. Last year, if you recall, we wanted to wait until we had increased visibility into the hardware pipeline, so we were a bit more conservative about the second half for hardware. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re approaching this year very similarly, but we had \u00e2\u0080\u0093 we just finished with really, really strong momentum through the year. And the guide, I mean, there is so much of it coming out of backlog, we feel very confident in the year. And then I think you mentioned on the hardware side, you increased capacity. For the last year, we couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t build it fast enough. We did ramp up production capacity, I think, 40% last year, but we sold more than that so we didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t keep up with demand. So we ramped up production capacity again for 2023, and we feel very confident that we have access to the inventory and the components we need to meet that production demand. But also to the extent that we can produce extra systems, we have a number of underserved or unserved customers that want access to our hardware in the cloud. Your line is open. Thanks for taking my question. And if I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not mistaken, this will all be included in digital IC, which according to the finish to the year was dilutive to your overall revenue growth. I mean, in EDA or in chip design or system design, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s more about automating the design process and producing better results. So even if you look at \u00e2\u0080\u0093 the way I look at it, even if you get it right now, some of these chips have 100 billion transistors, right, on 1 inch by 1 inch. So the design complexity that our customers need to do will go up by at least 20, 30x in the next 5 to 7 years. Over the last 5, 10 years, we have done a lot of massive virilism, running things on more CPUs, using cloud. But going forward, one of the biggest ways to improve productivity is using AI. And so the way we approach it through is a very comprehensive \u00e2\u0080\u0093 we build this JedAI data analytics because data is critical, too, as you know, to a data analytics and AI platform. We also launched, a few months ago, Verisium for verification, which is another very difficult and all-consuming problem for our customers. And typically, the system customers are not used to optimization or this level of automation that the chip industry has seen. And we have always focused AI on optimization, which, of course, now called generative AI. And even for Cerebrus, I mentioned in my prepared remarks, several leading companies like Intel, NVIDIA, Samsung, Renesas, they all talked about the results they are seeing. And if you include Verisium and optimality, we have hundreds of designs being done by AI. And because I believe in the next few years, almost all designs will have some AI component. Nice job on that, up 32% in the year, next 12-month backlog up 26% on the year. I mean, we had a really strong finish to the year. But if you look over a typical contract cycle, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll see that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re particularly pleased with the 3-year CAGR on cRPO. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tracking to mid-teens growth now, and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s very consistent to the mid-teens growth we achieved over the last 3 years to 2022 and the mid-teens growth that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s implied at the midpoint of our guidance for 2023. Your line is open. Anirudh, a wise man once said that silicon companies are becoming increasingly like systems companies, and systems companies are becoming increasingly like semiconductor companies. You alluded earlier to some of the additional opportunities that systems companies represent for you, for example, in CFD and so forth. The last number of years, you and, for that matter, Synopsys have significantly ramped up, for example, your investments in synthesis, verification, AI, you mentioned, of course. I mean, about 35% of our revenue is invested in R&D. So whether that is synthesis, like you mentioned, place and route, circuit simulation, analog, verification, so that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a given, making sure that the core is best in class. And then the three that I want to highlight, which is \u00e2\u0080\u0093 which I think will be thematic for years to come. AI will have a big effect on, like I mentioned, design work. Second is 3D-IC, the emergence of chiplets and heterogeneous integration, and Cadence is the best positioned to take advantage of this. And then the third area is this move to systems, system design and analysis and our engagement with system companies are similar, to a lot of extent, with semi companies. Everybody wants to do more with less now, so the benefits of AI and productivity and better results are there in both set of customers. But of course, our emerging portfolio and system design and analysis provides unique value to our system companies because we are no longer talking to the chip designers. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re talking to the system designers, the architect, the coupling of the mechanical and the electrical designs uniquely positions us. But AI, 3D-IC and systems will be with us for years to come. Your line is open. Thanks for taking my question. So on hardware verification, you guys have, sounds like, very good visibility to the first half of the year. But we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve also talked about how these hardware platforms are becoming a need-to-have, right, not a nice-to-have but a need-to-have as it relates to these very complex digital SoC platforms. I think what we see is the hardware is no longer \u00e2\u0080\u0093 I know it could be part of CapEx, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no longer discretionary spend for our customers. I mean, any chips that are designed today, any complex chips, you have to use these hardware platforms to verify them. These days, we have \u00e2\u0080\u0093 I think we had the record year, year after that, too. So the other thing with hardware is it is also expanding to other end markets, whereas traditionally, the big chips used to do it like data center chips. And then my follow-up, the team has done a great job on integrating machine learning-based methods as a part of your customer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s digital SoC design and verification Although different but nevertheless, still needing many iterations around many variables, is your custom cell and IT design and analog simulation and verification, seems like the team could take advantage of your ML frameworks and apply it to your custom and analog franchise. So I mean, like I mentioned, we have more than 30 projects in all aspects of AI. We want to make sure they are working with several customers, with different end markets and then we announce them. So last year, the year before, we talked about digital implementation. Last year, we talked about JedAI and verification. And I think this year, you will hear more from us in other parts of the business. Your line is open. So, fourth quarter was very good, finished north of 25% growth. And then even if I appreciate that probably has some hardware in it, John, as you said, that the trend growth is closer to a mid-teens type number now. I mean as Gary mentioned earlier, that he was asking about the number of customers, was there any big customer, there wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t one big customer in Q4. As Anirudh said earlier, they have become indispensable part of our customer spend on the R&D side, and people wanted to get their orders in before the end of the year. So, we have a lot of visibility into the next year. And I think like if you want to reconcile between where the growth in cRPO, say, for the last year is probably up closer to 20%. But if you look over 3 years, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mid-teens. And if you look over 3 years for our revenue CAGR, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mid-teens to \u00e2\u0080\u009822, and we are guiding to mid-teens for \u00e2\u0080\u009823. So, I think you can take out some of the noise by looking over a 3-year kind of average period. And obviously, Cadence is already using a lot of reinforcement learning and design flow and verification. You have started to see, I think some tinkering with like RTL code generation or maybe within certain aspects of verification. I mean one thing to mention is, we always look at all the kind of AI technologies. And like I mentioned, for us, the biggest application is simulation plus optimization, because you can generate much better results for the customers. And to give you an example, like some of the results we are seeing, the PPA can be improved by 10% to 15%, okay. And typically, you see this improvement from \u00e2\u0080\u0093 going from one node to the next, okay, spending billions of dollars, okay. But the main customer-facing applications are when we give better results, better productivity, which we are already doing in multiple ways, as I mentioned, and we will continue to look at all possible ways to improve that. Your line is open. Thanks for taking my question. Anirudh, when I look at the relative growth in your different segments, the System Design and Analysis seems to be the fastest-growing segment, obviously, off a lower base over the last 5 years. If you look at even our analog business, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s grew 13%, okay. That was used to be a stable business a few years ago, okay. Digital business, 17%, okay. Verification business, 28%, okay. So, I mean just to put that in context to what was happening in EDA and chip design like 5 years ago to now, I mean this is a remarkable growth in our business, and at the same time, very good profitability. And to come to your question on systems, I mean that had a very strong year with 27% growth. And the customers want this integration like I mentioned, like Jay mentioned earlier, system companies and semi companies. When you look at 3D-IC, one of the biggest things I have mentioned before is thermal simulation. Electromagnetic simulations, our products will run like 10x, 20x faster and higher performance because of our computational software trend. But with optimality, not only we can simulate, we can put that in the inner loop of a reinforcement-based AI engine to give results automatically that, that space has not seen. So, I am actually very optimistic about AI-driven optimization in the system space because it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s entirely new to that set of customers, along with like regular simulation performance and capacity improvement. And for my follow-up, John, not complaining at all, but when I look at the implied incremental EBIT margin for this year, it seems somewhat lower than the average incremental margins that you have managed to achieve over the last few years. Over the last \u00e2\u0080\u0093 I mean we are very pleased that I think 2022, I think was the sixth year in a row we achieved over 50% incremental margins. And the range that we have achieved over that period of time have ranged from 52%, I think to 58% incremental margin over the last 6 years. But that is the largest and strongest \u00e2\u0080\u0093 the largest initial guide and the strongest start to any of the 7 years \u00e2\u0080\u0093 of the last 7 years, right. And as you know, throughout the year, we tried to find profitable and sustainable revenue growth to improve that through the year. And we have managed to achieve that 6 years running, feel confident about doing that for a seventh year. Your line is open. I mean our , very excited about Future Facilities because I think that the way to differentiate in the system space is also through differentiated vertical offerings. because if you look at the simulation space, there are only few like kind of unknown algorithms. And the one way to even further differentiate CFD, one way we differentiate CFD is by our compute power, right, doing things bigger things and faster. But they also have built like a lot of models for like, if you go into a building or a data center, they have models for all the components, whether they are AC vents or AC systems and racks and all that. So, right now, data centers consume as much energy as like the whole airline industry, okay. So, we have a lot of engagements which are picked up with the hyperscalers, and with other companies, even in other industries because a lot of companies have big data centers, whether they are internal or on the cloud. Your line is open. Anirudh, you got a bunch of questions on hardware, and I think Carlin\u00e2\u0080\u0099s question hit on most of the things that I wanted to ask about. But I guess one thing that stood out to me from your commentary was that the two-thirds of your, I think new orders in \u00e2\u0080\u009822 were for both Palladium and Protium. And that was interesting to me because it seems like as we are moving to more SSD designs, more firmware and software on those designs, that that sort of selling Palladium and Protium together is likely to move up. So, I guess if you could just comment on that and how you are thinking about that as either TAM expansion or a revenue growth driver kind of longer term behind hardware would be interesting. I mean the thing with hardware, first of all, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s in a secular growth trend like we mentioned, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s always good to have multiple products. And that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s why the addition of Palladium and Protium that are complementary, but address different parts, which both of them are growing, it also provides more predictable growth for our business. So, like even though we had a record year last year we still see growth this year and in the future because of this product mix, because software bring-up, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t need to tell you, most of the designs now are software-defined hardware design. And then once you do the chip design, then Palladium comes in and then at the end, Protium comes in again. So, there is a lot of back and forth between software bring-up and chip design. But I also believe that just like our customers have different silicon platforms, we need to do that too, okay. Of course, x86, that has been traditional, but we have also ported all our software platforms, especially in verification to ARM-based systems because they can offer price performance. So, not only we have multiple products with Palladium and Protium, we are always looking at the right hardware to run them on. And then in logic simulation and Formal, we look at both x86 and ARM, so to give a full variety of options to our customers. If I could just ask a quick follow-up for John, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think you were asked on the pricing environment, John, and just watching the backlog move up again and kind of all the megatrends that you are talking about is understandable that things are going well. The \u00e2\u0080\u0093 yes, I mean we are very focused and disciplined on driving value for Cadence and for our customers. As like I said, on our hardware side, we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t believe that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s very much on the software side too, that a lot of our customers spend with us is not really discretionary. And everybody these days wants to focus on improving productivity, and all the tools we provide help our customers to drive that. One thing to add to what John said, I think you know this already, but one thing to emphasize, like typically, when people move from one node to another, right, so we are at 5-nanometer, a lot of the design\u00e2\u0080\u0099s at 3-nanometer, then 2-nanometer, 1.4-nanometer, 1-nanometer. So, we have like 10 years of node migration ahead of us. So, for the same chip being done, it has more things in it so that normally requires more use of our software. So, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s one thing just to emphasize to our investors is that whenever there is a node transition, and this is happening in the past, but this will continue to happen for next 10 years. So \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and Moore\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Law is not slowing down for at least 10 years, okay. So, we have a lot of sustained growth that the customers will build amazing products, and they need more and more of our software and hardware to do that. And I am just kind of trying to think about how \u00e2\u0080\u0093 it seems, and you guys have talked about this, greater portion of R&D budgets from both semiconductor and systems companies just going into kind of the suite of tools that you offer. Your line is open. Thanks for taking my question. So, I think it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s something like Cerberus AI, our use model is very similar to what they are doing right now, okay. And if they are used to running Innovus, then Cerberus will run on top of it, almost like a cockpit, but it will do those experiments that they were doing manually, they will do it in an automatic way. So, typically, we have seen \u00e2\u0080\u0093 that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s why you have seen a lot of kind of uptick to Cerberus and these AI-based tools because they don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fundamentally require a new working model. There is always some learning gap, but it is, our customers are very smart users anyway, right. And then one question for John, in terms of the share repurchases, I think you bought 1 billion or so last year. Andrew, our approach for capital allocation hasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t changed and share repurchases, that effectively for this year again, we are expecting to use 50% of our free cash flow to repurchase shares. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the way we started last year, too. And last year, that kicked in, in Q1, Q2 and Q4. We typically don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t guide to that right now, but we assume using at least 50% of free cash flow to repurchase shares. This year, if our opportunistic repurchase program kicks in, we will buy back more. Our exceptional execution of the Intelligent System Design strategy, customer-first mindset and a high-performance and inclusive culture are driving accelerating growth as we grow our core EDA business while expanding our portfolio with new innovative solutions. Fostering sustainable innovation is a top priority, and we are thrilled to have been included in the newly released 2023 top-rated ESG Company List, ranking number 18 out of over 1,000 companies in the software and services group. And on behalf of our employees and our Board of Directors, we thank our customers, partners and investors for their continued trust and confidence in Cadence."
