We created technology to vote this and basically help our partners get the same B2B business and more in the wholesale markets, but do it in a way where their prices would be protected and they have \u2013 and they make sure they weren\u2019t undercut by their own prices out in the world. Thank you for your question. Thank you for your question. Thank you for your question. Thank you for your question. Thank you for your question. But what\u2019s really exciting and what we\u2019re all excited about is we\u2019re rebuilding the platform now in a way where it will be much more self-service, much more able to go for the biggest down to the smallest partners so that anybody who wants to be in the travel business or any of our partners who want to sell incremental products or use our technology to drive incremental benefits to their business, we will be able to access it. Thank you for your question. Thank you for your question. Thank you for your question. Thank you for your question. And we are in a much better place if you think about even just the Hotels.com example I gave you, we would have to test things on Hotels.com, test different things on Expedia, test other things on Vrbo, we will get to a place where we will be able to test everything across everything and that\u2019s just a much more impactful way to make change and drive better traveler outcomes and better conversion. Thank you for your question."
