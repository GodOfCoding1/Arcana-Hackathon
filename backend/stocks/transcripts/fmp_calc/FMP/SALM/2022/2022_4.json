    "content": " When you combine the digital revenue within the Broadcast division and the National Digital division, overall digital revenue was flat in the quarter and is nearly 30% of total revenue. I already talked about our combined digital revenue within the Broadcast division, digital revenue, which encompasses Salem Surround, the Salem Podcast Network, SalemNOW and the Salem News Channel increased 14% during the quarter. Broadcast expenses increased 11.4%, driven by our continued investment in the sale of News Channel, the 401(k) match, which was reinstituted in the beginning of 2022 and the impact of a bad debt credit in the fourth quarter of 2021. Compared to last year, net broadcast revenue increased 4.5% to $53.3 million and broadcast operating expenses increased 11.4% to $43.2 million, resulting in station operating income of $10.1 million, a decrease of 17.4%. On a same-station basis, net broadcast revenue increased 4.5% to $53.3 million, and SOI decreased 15.7% to $10.3 million. Looking forward, for the first quarter of 2023, Salem is projecting total revenue to be between flat and a decline of 2% from first quarter 2022 revenue of $62.6 million. Salem is also projecting operating expenses before gains or losses on the sale or disposal of assets, stock-based compensation expense, legal settlement, changes in the estimated fair value of contingent earn-out consideration, impairments, depreciation expense and amortization expense, to increase between 7% and 10% compared to the first quarter of 2022 non-GAAP operating expenses of $55.8 million."
