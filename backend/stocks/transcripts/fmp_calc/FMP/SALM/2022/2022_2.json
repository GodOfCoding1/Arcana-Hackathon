Not only did we get the $4.5 million investment returned almost immediately after the release, we generated approximately $900,000 of income distribution fees at SalemNOW, advertising revenue platform from the LLC and interest earned on our initial investment. For the second quarter, total revenue increased 7.7% to $68.7 million.
