    "content": "  In the last couple of months, we published two key peer-reviewed manuscripts; a discrete choice experiment, highlighting the single dose at bedtime as the number one driver of patient choice; and a plain language summary of a review of 20 years of published data which found that the sodium in sodium oxybate was not linked to increased cardiovascular risks in narcolepsy patients and concluded that people who take sodium oxybate are unlikely to need to change their sodium oxybate medicine because of the sodium."
