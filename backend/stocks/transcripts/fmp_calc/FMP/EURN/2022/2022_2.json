And I would add to that that we are also slightly more optimistic that the number will improve dramatically because of what Brian said, but also because when we analyze the voyages that we have done so far, I wouldn't say all of them but like a majority of them were what we call backhaul, so repositioning voyages that they are lower rate but then the ships will be positioned in the market that should be much better for them to take the next cargo. But it's not automatic and certainly not an open-end tender because that would decrease the incentivization of people to tender in the first and we want as many people to tender as possible, simply because we want to get to the 50% and one share as early as possible and potentially to 75% as early as possible as well. You may now go ahead. You may now go ahead. And I noticed Teekay Tankers have done some interesting work on this, this morning on their presentation later on today, which I think dovetails with ours in that, we would expect the net effect to be something around about 2 million to 2.5 million barrels and that being replaced by oil from the Middle East and from the Atlantic and that's what we've started to see already.
