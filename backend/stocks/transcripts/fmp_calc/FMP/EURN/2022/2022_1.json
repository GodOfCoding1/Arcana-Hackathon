    "content": " Four key factors we addressed in Slide seven, bottom left U.S. Crude exports have risen on a full weekly average basis by over 1 million barrels per day or 41%, since mid-January as a mix of increased production, release of strategic reserves and attractive inter oil pricing has boosted exports. But I think also one absolute and output we would expect to see is further continuation of the U.S. exports of crude, because there's obviously some slate deliveries from the strategic reserves and they are obviously going to come over and a lot of that is being used as feeds stock into the European refinery, because we know expressly the U.S. refinery slate is already full and they don't need that all in that crude."
