    "content": " For fourth quarter 2022, we step-up our capital distribution and propose a 50% increase in the ordinary cash dividend through $0.30 per share. Creating and capturing value across our business, we estimate a free cash flow over the four years to 2026 of around $25 billion. And then cash flow, for the full-year, we delivered record cash flow from operations of almost $84 billion and after subtracting taxes, including the additional tax payment last quarter of $10 billion and subtracting investments and capital distribution, we delivered a net cash flow for the year of around $23 billion. Our projects coming on stream over the next 10 years will create large value, low break evens of around $35 per barrel, high returns of around 30% internal rate of return, short payback time of around two and a half years and a low-carbon upstream intensity of less than 6-kilo per of CO2 per barrel, which is less than half of the global industry average. Thank you very much. I think the ordinary cash dividend and ordinary share buyback program, that is linked to outlook for the future, the $20 billion cash flow from operations and the return on capital employed. But maybe Torgrim, I'll challenge you here a little bit because you're presenting a $50 breakeven after CapEx and I think on your 2023 cash flow outlook, the $17 billion of cash returns are going to be covered roughly where we are right now in $80 plus/minus gas prices where we are right now. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you very much."
