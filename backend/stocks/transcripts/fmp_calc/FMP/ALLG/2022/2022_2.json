We saw growth across all key metrics, including charging stations, climbing nearly 75%, the utilization rate of 8.3%, compared to 4.3%, and total energy sold increasing by more than 105% to nearly 72 gigawatt hour, all compared to the first half of 2021. From an operational standpoint, we executed during the period several initiatives, which include exercising the option of the project Mega-E, thereby adding more than 100 sites, and nearly 770 charging ports mainly fast and ultrafast, which aligns with our strategic focus as scheduled acquiring Moma an R&D technology platform to reinforce and control our technology news and competencies, expanding our strategic partnership with ATU to equip an additional 400 ATU branch locations with electric charging stations partnering with G&V Energy Group to install ultrafast charging stations at 100 G&V locations across Belgium. Total energy sold increased 105.2% to 71.8 gigawatt hour, the total number of charging sessions climbs 74.2%, and the average utilization rate nearly doubled to 8.3%, compared to the first half of 2021. The regular customer rate was steady at approximately 80%, while higher electricity cost continue to pose a challenge as I mentioned earlier, we're working on long-term fixed price supply agreements and announced an average price increase of 10% effective September 1st, 2022."
