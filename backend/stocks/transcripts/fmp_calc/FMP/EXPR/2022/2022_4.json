    "content": " As a part of the transaction and reflecting the intellectual property of the Express brand that we contributed to the joint venture and to the private sale of a pipe investment, which WHP Global used to acquire 5.4 million newly issued shares of our common stock, we received proceeds of $260 million, which repositioned our company financially, and we are now beginning to reposition our company strategically. Second, to optimize our fully integrated omnichannel platform to create synergies and drive efficiencies across a portfolio of brands. However, we received $26 million of fresh product in the back half of January, which was earlier than expected due to improved supply chain conditions, and we began to see improved results immediately upon receipt of that product, particularly in women's. Compared to the first quarter of 2022, we expect the following: Comparable sales of negative low double-digits; gross margin rate to decline approximately 850 basis points; SG&A expenses as a percent of sales to deleverage approximately 500 basis points; diluted loss per share of $0.70 to $0.80; inventory to move closer to parody with sales trends as the year progresses. Compared to full year 2022, we expect the following: Comparable sales of positive low single digits; diluted loss per share of $0.85 to $1.05; capital expenditures of approximately $55 million. Second, to optimize our fully integrated omnichannel platform to create synergies and drive efficiencies across a portfolio of brands."
