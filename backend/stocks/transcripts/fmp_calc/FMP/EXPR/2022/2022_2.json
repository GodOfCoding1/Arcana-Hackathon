    "content": " Comparable sales were plus 14%, gross margin expanded 270 basis points, average unit retail increased 13%, and we delivered EBITDA of $31 million, an increase of 350%. We saw strength and comp growth in men's across all categories, generated higher and more profitable sales, drove a 12% increase in average unit retails, and grew our customer file. Our results in the first six months of the year were solid, comparable sales were positive 14%, gross margin expanded 270 basis points, average unit retail increased 13% and we delivered EBITDA of $31 million. To determine our outlook, we considered our year-to-date performance, as well as the numerous advancements we've made in each of our four foundational pillars, product, brand, customer and execution, and balance those factors against the increasingly challenging macroeconomic and retail apparel environment, the ongoing uncertainty of the global supply chain and geopolitical events and the possibility of other unforeseen headwinds that could impact our business. Compared to the third quarter of 2021, we expect the following; comparable sales to decrease mid-single-digits, gross margin rates decreased approximately 350 basis points and SG&A expenses as a percent of sales to de-lever approximately 350 basis points, including incremental investments in technology and higher store labor expenses."
