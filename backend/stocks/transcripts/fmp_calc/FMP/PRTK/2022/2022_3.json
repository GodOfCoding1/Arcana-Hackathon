    "content": " The strength in continued growth of Paratek's core commercial business in the third quarter of 2022 was driven by our unwavering commitment to disciplined operational execution, combined with NUZYRA's many clinically important product attributes. Net sales from our core business increased from approximately $19.4 million in the third quarter of 2021 to $25.5 million this past quarter, which represents a 31% year-over-year growth. Importantly, NUZYRA's trailing 12-month core commercial revenue performance, as seen in the figure on the right, demonstrates an upward growth trajectory that we expect to continue for the remainder of the year and into 2023 as the community and institutional sales teams broaden and deepen their access points and connections to physicians. Revenue earned in the third quarter of 2022 was comprised of $25.5 million in net U.S. sales from the NUZYRA core commercial business, a 31% increase from $19.4 million for the same period in the prior year. As Evan noted earlier, disciplined execution has resulted in impressive year-over-year growth in NUZYRA's core commercial business as evidenced by the 31% increase in net sales over the same quarter in the prior year."
