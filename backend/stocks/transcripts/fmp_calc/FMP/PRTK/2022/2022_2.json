    "content": " Strong demand, coupled with disciplined execution, resulted in a significant year-over-year second quarter growth in NUZYRA's core commercial business. Net sales from our core NUZYRA commercial business increased from approximately $14.9 million in the second quarter of 2021 to $25.1 million this past quarter, which represents a 68% year-over-year growth. Importantly, as you can see on the right side of this slide, NUZYRA's trailing 12-month core commercial revenue performance continues to demonstrate a consistent and significant upward growth trajectory that we expect to continue through the balance of this year. Revenue in the second quarter of 2022 was comprised of $25.1 million in net U.S. sales from the NUZYRA core business, a 68% increase from $14.9 million for the same period in the prior year, $4 million in revenue earned under the BARDA contract, and $0.6 million in royalty revenue. As Evan noted earlier, strong demand and disciplined execution has resulted in impressive year-over-year growth in NUZYRA's core commercial business as evidenced by the 68% year-over-year increase in net sales. As previously mentioned, BARDA's receipt of positive topline data from this study will trigger the process for the purchase of our second NUZYRA procurement valued at approximately $38 million. However, because of the ultra-rare nature of this disease, the orphan and now Fast Track designation we received from FDA on top of the totality of data that just continues to be generated for NUZYRA, whether it's on the nonclinical side or even through the real-world setting, we think that we will, assuming robust data from our Phase IIb study, that we'll be in a good position to have discussions with FDA."
