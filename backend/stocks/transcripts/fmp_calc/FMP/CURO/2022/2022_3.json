    "content": " Flexiti's loan book has continued its strong growth and ended the quarter at approximately CAD950 million or just under USD700 million, which is 128% higher than a year-ago and compared with approximately CAD250 million when we closed the transaction in March of 2021. At the quarter end, of our $739 million U.S. loan portfolio, approximately 70% is in the larger loan category, and we expect to see that percentage continue to increase over time. Since the end of last quarter, gross loans receivable grew by $114 million or 6%, primarily driven by the acquisition of First Heritage and Canadian POS lending growth of $63 million or 10%. Direct Lending business was up -- obviously up 40% sequentially, but $225 million of the growth -- of the $300 million of growth came from the acquisition of First Heritage. The balance of the portfolio, I think the U.S. business starting at a base of 7.30% to 7.40%, we could see maybe $20 million, $30 million of portfolio growth there, given kind of where we are from a credit perspective. An average Canadian consumer, similarly situated, similar FICO, similar income, all the same kind of ability to repay metrics that you'd run in the U.S., that customer is going to pay -- payment rates over time are going to be 15% to 20% higher than what you see in the U.S. And the flip side, obviously, is delinquencies and charge-offs for similarly situated customers are going to run lower."
