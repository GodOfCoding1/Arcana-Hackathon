And what that means is we're going to have our engineers, especially some of our most experienced engineers with our ships, really working through the upfront design to basically modify our existing ships design, same outer mold line as we've discussed, but modify them in a way such that Bell and Qarbon can take those designs and then put them through their own shops, their own areas and manufacture them in a very efficient way, in a very both time and cost efficient fashion. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. But what you'll see directionally, as we go forward is, probably still some growth because of the fact that we're still finishing up the flight tests phase, getting ready for commercial service while we're also ramping up the fleet expansion efforts, the fleet development with the outside vendors. But as we get to commercial service, then you start to see some ramp down on the current fleet because we've finished that flight testing process and we're now in a sustainment mode and maintenance mode and see that starts to come down, but at the same time, you've got the vendors ramping up. Your line is now open. Also regarding costs relative to\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\n Regarding costs, I'd say relative to our expectations, first I'd say as Doug mentioned, we start these relationships in a time and materials basis so that we can kind of work through the design specificity with each other together, and then we move to firm fixed price. So we put the emphasis on, number one, I'd say, ensuring that Eve and Unity, not only are flying, but have the engineering resources to fly on a consistent basis, as we said, and just make sure we have the ability to have the staff ready if there's anything we need to settle out in the early flights. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. Your line is now open."
