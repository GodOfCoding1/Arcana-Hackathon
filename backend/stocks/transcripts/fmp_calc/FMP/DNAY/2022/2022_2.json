    "content": " With a cash position of approximately $62 million at the end of the second quarter and our combined efforts to reduce spend, access to non-dilutive debt financing of up to an additional $25 million and the potential for $30 million in milestones from our Pfizer partnership, we are laying a strong foundation for a potential path to profitability by year-end 2024. We also experienced a record quarter for BioXp kit sales, which has continued along its strong growth path, posting 66% growth over the prior period and 50% for the first 6 months of the year compared to the same period in 2021. During the second quarter, we reported solid growth of 392% in services revenue from combined Eton and Codex DNA biofoundry services group and growth of 558% for the 6-month period, driven mostly by contributions from Eton. Fewer COVID-related gene synthesis requests impacted the organic growth, that being excluding Eton, for the second quarter and first 6-month periods, which was down 42% and 3%, representing a decrease of $149,000 and $15,000, respectively. We experienced record revenue growth of $838,000 in sales during the first quarter for BioXp kits, representing 66% growth over the prior period and 50% growth for the 6 months -- first 6 months of 2022 as compared to the same period in 2021. Revenue was $5.7 million for the second quarter 2022, which was a 98% increase in total revenue from $2.9 million for the same period in the prior year. This strong growth was driven by a record quarter for BioXp kit revenue, totaling approximately $840,000, up 66% year-over-year, and solid contributions from Eton's sequencing services and oligo production revenue, which totaled $1.5 million."
