    "content": " In the third quarter of 2022, we grew total revenue by nearly 140% compared to the prior year period, excluding contributions from Eton Bioscience acquired in Q4 of last year, overall growth for the third quarter was 83% for the 9-month period ending September 30, 2022 total growth, excluding Eton was 69%. We also experienced a record quarter for biopsy kit sales, which has continued a strong growth trajectory, posting 69% growth over the prior period and 58% for the first 9 months of the year compared to the same period in 2021. Margin expansion for the third quarter as compared to the same period a year ago was largely driven by a positive mix shift to higher-margin products, including the BioXp 9600, mRNA and a lower cost of DNA raw materials. Revenue was $6.7 million for the third quarter of 2022, which was a 140% increase in total revenue from $2.8 million for the same period in the prior year. This strong growth was driven by a record quarter for BioXp kit revenue totaling approximately $884,000, up 69% year-over-year and solid contributions from Eton sequencing services and oligo production revenue, which totaled $1.6 million. Net loss was $12.3 million or $0.42 per share and $40.3 million or $1.37 per share for the third quarter and first 9 months of 2022, respectively."
