    "content": " While private equity returns were again strong, they compared to an even stronger Q1 of 2021, adjusted earnings per share was $2.08, down 5% year-over-year on a reported basis and down 4% on a constant currency basis. Moving to Asia, the adjusted earnings were down 7% and 4% on a constant currency basis, primarily due to lower recurring interest margins and a decline in first quarter equity markets in Japan and Korea. I think the broad interest rate sensitivities we gave as part of our outlook directionally still hold, even though the shape of the curve is a little different, so numbers may not be exact, but I would say the directional nature of that from an earnings perspective, which means that it\u2019s a little negative in the first year, may -- I might call it neutral-ish now just the way things have kind of panned out and then you start to see kind of the positive momentum emerge in the 2023 and 2024, again, assuming rates kind of pan out as they are projected to. However, since you asked the question, I wanted to give you a little bit of context for overall Asia in terms of our performance this quarter, which is really were very good, but also caution that, we are continuing to deal with COVID and that\u2019s a big factor across all our markets, clearly, Korea and Japan, we have a surge in cases in quarter one and we are dealing with that even in China as well, And so-- and then on top of that, in Q2, we are dealing with a bunch of market-specific regulatory and exchange related challenges, which are ongoing."
