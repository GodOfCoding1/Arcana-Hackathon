    "content": " Given our share gains and our pricing actions, we are raising our guidance for sales growth and we are reaffirming our guidance for adjusted EBITDA, reflecting confidence in our business plans, margin recovery and continued volume growth. Our confidence in ongoing share gains combined with the pricing actions that we executed in April, has led us to raise our same-store sales growth guidance to 12% to 14%. Sales growth outpaced a strong volume increase of 9%, highlighting our continued success in passing-through cost increases with pricing. Sales growth in global products continued to run well ahead of strong volume increases, highlighting our ability to pass-through inflationary costs with pricing. So the combination of the continued growth in transactions, somewhat above expectations and then the increased pricing is going to put us in that 12% to 14% range for the full fiscal year."
