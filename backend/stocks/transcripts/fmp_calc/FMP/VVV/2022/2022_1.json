    "content": " And our local teams, the regional teams that we have, and what's unique about Valvoline\u2019s business internationally too or what gives me confidence in the future is that, each of our regions are solidly profitable, have good solid profit margins, very clear strategies on how they're going to continue to grow share, penetrate the market and then strengthen the product lineup, particularly as the international markets also rely more heavily on synthetic based lubricants products. One program that we've highlighted over the last year is our battery program, so replacing those 12 volt batteries making sure we're testing every battery that comes in to allow our customers know what kind of life the battery has left in it enable us to increase our sales of our Valvoline batteries."
