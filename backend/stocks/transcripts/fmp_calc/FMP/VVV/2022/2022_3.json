    "content": " While we are experiencing temporary dilutive effects on profit margins due to higher cost and price pass-through impacts, the strength of our top line growth highlights the nondiscretionary nature of our preventive maintenance business and positions us well for margin expansion when the current inflationary cycle eases. While improved, our Q3 margin was slightly below our long-term target, driven by continued inflationary pressure as well as the dilutive impact of passing through higher product cost and sales to our franchisees, which drove 100 basis points of margin decline year-over-year. Retail services growth -- retail services sales growth of 16% includes same-store sales of nearly 10%, reflecting the continued strong performance in the business, with ticket growth outpacing transaction growth in the quarter. But we'll work on our guidance for fiscal '23, and I believe it's going to continue to be strong because we're seeing good solid opportunities in both growing market share, winning new customers, retaining those customers and selling them the additional services, providing those services that they're needed and seeing ticket performance, too. We would expect that transactions will be a healthy component of our same-store sales growth moving forward, but we also see the ticket performance driven by premiumization of oil changes, pricing leverage and selling the -- and providing those additional services for preventive maintenance being key."
