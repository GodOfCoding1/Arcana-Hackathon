    "content": " We expect the transaction will bring significant additional scale, including approximately 24,000 barrels equivalent a day to 2022 estimated production and approximately 78 million barrels equivalent of proved plus probable reserves as well as increased asset diversity, reducing field level concentration and doubling our operated deepwater facility footprint. During the third quarter, we produced 53,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, inclusive of approximately 9,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day of mostly planned deferred production from the HP-1 dry-dock and third-party midstream downtime as well as other operational developments, which Tim referred to earlier in the call. This is inclusive of 3,500 to 4,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day of anticipated deferrals from ongoing loop currents and downtime at non-operated Delta House, putting us slightly below our full year production guidance provided at the beginning of this year."
