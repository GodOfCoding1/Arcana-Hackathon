    "content": " This quarter, we achieved our lowest leverage multiple and our highest liquidity in the company's history, positioning Talos well for the second half of the year that will focus on our deepwater drilling campaign, continued growth in our CCS business and ongoing debt reduction. Financial terms for the transactions delivered upfront cash as well as a material capital cost payments by Chevron that we'll expect to cover all the expenses for the project through the project's FID, and that capital is being put to good use as we finalize plans to drill our stratigraphic well test in the fourth quarter. Look, our goal for 2022, I think you've seen it consistently both in the first quarter and the second quarter, and I think you'll continue to see for the rest of the year is to be in a position as we exit this year to deliver the best credit profile that we can deliver to the marketplace. Look, I think we'll have exactly like you said, we'll have a similar level of HP-1 dry dock maintenance expenditure that's going to flow through in the third quarter based on our outlook. And you look at the first half of the year and even with some pretty impactful downtime on a third-party pipeline north of the Phoenix field in the first quarter, I think we're on the -- obviously averaging somewhere around for the year, 64% or so."
