    "content": " At Talos, we're building what we think the energy company of the future should look like, one that balances to continue to responsible growth of our upstream business to meet the world's needs, as well as the increasing mandate to reduce our industrial carbon footprint. Hey, good morning, guys. I would say to answer your other question, though, we're drilling these targets that can be anywhere between 10 million and 30 million barrel equivalent, one well, subsea tie backs, I mean, these are, these are good projects that are exactly down the middle of our fairway, but they aren't projects that are going to come online in six months, there are projects that are going to take 15 months, maybe 24 months. And so now with our partner, Carbonvert and now with Chevron, we feel like we've got a lot of the right skill sets, experience, expertise, and all things that we're going to need to develop these projects from filing our first class six permits to all the way through the injection and long-term monitoring programs here. Hey, good morning, guys. I would say just as a matter of notes, you can look at the hedge schedule, we got in the press release and in the Q as well that really after this quarter, pretty steep drop off just in terms of volume metrics in terms of what's in place, you're still going to see in those low to mid 50s for the remainder of the year, the hedge book."
