    "content": " Longer-term Talos is healthier than it's ever been, because of our recent successes in our development and exploitation drilling program, most of which will come online throughout 2023 and 2024, and our bullish outlook on several of the projects we're planning to drill this year. Those projects could deliver a combined 15,000 barrels to 20,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day gross once they come online in the first quarter of 2024 contributing to the highest gross production rate achieved in Ram Powell facility in over 15 years, which is exactly what our strategy of infrastructure-led drilling is expected to achieve. In 2022, we use our adjusted free cash flow to repay borrowings under the company's credit facility as well as the repurchase of a portion of our second lien notes for a total debt reduction of $393 million or approximately $4.77 per share in total debt reduction for the year. Also factored into our production expectations and capital allocation plans for the year is the deferral of our gas-weighted Lisbon project originally planned to be drilled in online in mid-2023 with an expected average daily rate contribution of 8,000 barrels to 10,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day gross. So as we get to the end of this year, beginning of next year we got Lime Rock, we got a Venice coming online that's going to add fresh production to the mix, we're drilling a rig lead in Pancheron this year that would hopefully to the extent we have success, begin to come on kind of in the next stage beyond that."
