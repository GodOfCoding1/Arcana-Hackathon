    "content": " 2022 was a transformational year for Mirati and I'm pleased to report we received our first approval and launched our first commercial product, KRAZATI for KRAS G12C mutated locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer. The initial launch feedback from clinicians, patients and payers reinforces our belief that KRAZATI is the best-in-class KRAS G12C inhibitor addressing a multi-billion dollar market opportunity across multiple lines of therapy and tumor types, both as a monotherapy as well as in combinations. We have K7 which is the doublet that is showing - that has shown safety and also some preliminary efficacy in that particular setting and we will be taking another look at the data in K7 the second half of this year that will allow us to provide information regarding the durability and also increased numbers of patients so we have a more refined response rate, giving us a concept - an idea of how to move forward best in the Phase 3 space."
