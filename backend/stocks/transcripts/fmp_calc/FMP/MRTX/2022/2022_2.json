Beyond the US, we completed the submission of adagrasib's marketing authorization application for the treatment of patients with non-small cell lung cancer harboring the KRAS G12C mutation who have received at least one prior systemic therapy to the European Medicines Agency. These ASCO updates included positive results from the registration and enabling Phase II cohort of the KRYSTAL-1 study evaluating adagrasib 600 milligrams, administered twice daily in patients with non-small cell lung cancer harboring the KRAS G12C mutation who have received at least one prior systemic therapy.
