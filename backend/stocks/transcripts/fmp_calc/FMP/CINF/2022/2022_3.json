    "content": " Non-GAAP operating income of $114 million for the third quarter of 2022 was down $95 million from a year ago, including catastrophe losses that were $19 million higher on an after-tax basis. Based on our rate filings that average low double-digit rate increases for policies effective beginning January 1, 2023, we expect the full-year 2023 personal auto written premium effect will be an average premium rate increase of approximately 10% The commercial line segment grew third quarter 2022 net written premium by 10% with the combined ratio of 99.0%, reflecting elevated inflation effects and catastrophe losses 1.2 percentage points higher than a year ago. During the third quarter 2022, we experienced $43 million of property casualty net favorable development on prior accident years that benefited the combined ratio by 2.4 percentage points. On an all lines basis by accident year net reserve development for the first nine months of 2022 was favorable and included $94 million for 2021, $95 million for 2020 that partially offset by unfavorable $46 million in aggregate for accident years prior to 2020. While we've recently reported significant unfavorable reserve development on prior accident years for our commercial casualty lines of business, the net $25 million for the first nine months of 2022 included $41 million for the commercial umbrella and net favorable amount was $16 million for other coverages included in commercial casualty. You may now go ahead. You may now go ahead. You may now go ahead. You may now go ahead. You may now go ahead. So I think it's something that we keep a close eye on, try to measure, try to price for, go through everything that Steve mentioned already in terms of all hands on deck from underwriting to pricing to claims to make sure that we are understanding the impacts on umbrella and also recognizing that there's volatility there, as I mentioned a little bit earlier in terms of what we've seen a variation of payments on commercial umbrella from one year to the next. I have, I think a mathematically similar question when we look at the large loss data combined losses over between $1 million and $5 million and $5 million and higher in commercial, about 50% year-over-year, much more than in the second quarter. You may now go ahead. You may now go ahead."
