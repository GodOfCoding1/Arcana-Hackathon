Total first quarter net sales were $290.8 million, an increase of 7.2% as reported and 9.1% on a constant currency basis compared to the prior year period. The other thing I'd add from a financial perspective is the other thing that I've seen in the international business over the last two years, despite COVID impact, we've said for years, double-digit growth, low to mid-double-digit growth is what we're going to see in our international business. But Chris, in the past, when I've asked you this question, you said that when you do come to market with your first-generation robotic capability on Pulse that you will likely be coming to market with something that's on a more advanced level, not just kind of pedicle screw placing robot, but it will be likely competitive with where next-generation current robotic systems will be at that point in time."
