    "content": " Company-wide inclusive of floating rate assets and liabilities in all of our business lines, a further 50 basis point increase in base rates would increase annual earnings by $19 million or $0.06 per share. On the CECL front, we increased our general reserve by $27 million in the quarter to a balance of $94 million or just over 0.5% of our commercial lending portfolio. However, we downgraded 4 office loans totaling $724 million from a 3 to a 4 in the quarter, which Jeff will discuss and won $42 million retail loan from a 4 to 5 million bringing our total 4-rated loans to $872 million and 5-rated loans to $287 million. During the quarter, we foreclosed on a 5-rated $245 million first mortgage loan related to an office building in L.A., which Jeff will discuss in more detail. In our Residential business, we acquired $745 million of loans, including $713 million of agency investor loans that we discussed last quarter, bringing our on-balance sheet portfolio to $2.8 billion. And on the segment\u00e2\u0080\u0099s property portfolio, this quarter, we sold 1 asset for proceeds of $37 million, resulting in a net GAAP gain of $25 million and a net DE gain of $23 million, once again demonstrating the embedded value of this portfolio, which has been a source of consistent and recurring gains across cycles. Funding totaled $68 million with repayments and sales totaling $75 million, keeping the balance of the portfolio consistent with last quarter at $2.4 billion, which was 97% floating rate. This is in addition to our ATM capital raises early in the quarter where we issued 750,000 shares of common stock for gross proceeds of $16 million at an average share price of $21.17, bringing our full year ATM issuance to 2.2 million shares or $49 million at an average share price of $22.72. Rina said, we have reduced our exposure to office loans from 38% to 23% of our CRE lending portfolio since COVID, but since we have other investment cylinders on our balance sheet, Lending segment loans on office make up only 13.6% of our assets, which is by far the smallest percentage of our peers and a fraction of most of them. So short and long-term, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to see rents \u00e2\u0080\u0093 they are actually \u00e2\u0080\u0093 headline rents are going down, but in-place rents are going up because it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the gap in these buildings in our portfolio alone on the loan book, Jeff tells me our rents have increased more than 20% since we started making those loans.
