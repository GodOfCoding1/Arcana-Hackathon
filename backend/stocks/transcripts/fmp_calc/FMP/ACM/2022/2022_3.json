And so when we talk about that high win rate, we believe that's important because it talks to the -- our thinking about disciplined investing, but also again, the quality of the backlog is important because the things that we win change the momentum of the business and they have this flywheel effect that want more people to join, clients are more interested in what you're doing and it attracts larger and better opportunities. Sean, thanks for the question. I think you look forward and you think, well with the win rate, the things that we're doing to create long-term momentum in the business and create competitive advantage, that certainly bodes well for the long-term health of our backlog of the business and the business itself."
