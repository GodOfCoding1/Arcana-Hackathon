    "content": " The reality is that this clear pathway and commercial opportunity for aumolertinib in the U.S. as directed by FDA feedback requires us to adapt and shift to a market-based pricing strategy for both of our lead assets, aumolertinib and Lerociclib in the U.S. For supporters of a new disruptive model and for the U.S. portion of our Global Buyers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Club partners, this was not what we were planning for together. Importantly, we expect that our extended cash runway will allow us to get through key clinical and regulatory milestones in the U.S. Of course, it would have been preferable if sugemalimab and aumolertinib could have activated the Buyers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Club in the U.S. along the same timing as what we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re expecting for our launches in the UK and Europe. First of all, let me just put one really important piece up there which is what we are now talking about especially when you think about a timing for aumolertinib in the U.S. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s several years from now and I just want to make sure that we all remind ourselves that we could know entirely what pricing in that category of EGFR inhibitors is going to look like 3 years, 4 years, 5 years from now especially given the IRA and potential changes there. We wanted to bring our partners our first two drugs in the \u00e2\u0080\u009823, \u00e2\u0080\u009824 timeframe along with our partners outside of the U.S. As I said earlier that we do not believe is in the best interest of patients because these drugs, aumolertinib and sugemalimab have strong Phase 3 efficacy and safety data that absolutely supports their use, but ultimately we do need an approval from the FDA to use them in the U.S. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Shibutani with Goldman Sachs."
