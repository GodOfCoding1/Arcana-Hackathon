    "content": " In fact, we just initiated our US-led comparative three-arm Phase 3B clinical trial of Almonertinib for the first line treatment of EGFR-mutated non-small cell lung cancer. Our partner Turning Point Therapeutics, recently initiated a Phase 1B2 clinical trial evaluating Almonertinib in combination with Lenvatinib  in patients with EGFR mutant MET amplification advanced non-small cell lung cancer. At ASCO, our partner CStone presented Interim Overall Survival Data from the pivotal Phase 3 GEMSTONE-302 study, which assessed the addition of sugemalimab to chemotherapy in patients with Stage 4 non-small cell lung cancer, demonstrating that the addition of sugemalimab to chemotherapy led to an improvement of median and overall survival by 8.5 months with a median overall survival exceeding 25 months in the sugemalimab arm. To further build sugemalimab's body of evidence, we are planning to initiate a US-led randomized clinical trial, which will compare sugemalimab with other approved immune checkpoint inhibitors in a population of non-small cell lung cancer patients, reflecting the US demographic. For the company, an additional trials to start in the second half of the year, including a comparative study for sugemalimab, we do anticipate our operating expenses will be back and loaded in the second half of the year, but we still expect to end the year with cash between $1.3 billion and $1.4 billion."
