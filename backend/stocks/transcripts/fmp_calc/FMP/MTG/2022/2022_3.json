    "content": " However, the rapid increase in interest rates over the last several months resulted in unrealized losses that reduced book value per share by $1.50 at the end of the quarter, while at December 31, unrealized gains increased book value per share by $0.47 and by $0.59 a year ago. As a result and consistent with our capital strategy, we repurchased 6.1 million outstanding shares of common stock for a total cost of $84 million, and we paid a $0.10 per share dividend to our shareholders for a total of $31 million. These actions reduced our annualized interest expense by $15.2 million and reduced dilutive shares by $1.1 million, and reduced our debt-to-capital ratio from approximately 17% to approximately 12%, which is in line with our target debt to capital level. As a result of our strong capital position at the operating company, and consistent with our capital strategy, we received OCI approval and paid a $400 million dividend from MGIC to the holding company, enhancing the holding company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s liquidity position and the financial flexibility of the company overall. We will evaluate future dividends to the holding company using a consistent framework, but if we experience a more challenged economic environment for mortgage credit, that will impact our target capital levels, which could extend the time between dividends, reduce the amount of future dividends or retaining capital in the operating company may be preferred. So, we haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t gotten into the details of exactly what that level is, but the $2.6 billion at the end of the quarter was above our targets, and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s really what prompted the discussion with the OCI and internally and, ultimately, the approval and payment of the $400 million dividend."
