The high resilient profit profile of this business helped drive operating income of $252 million and operating income margin of 37%, the third highest level in over three years and slightly above the 2025 target of 33% to 36%. Profitability reached record levels in the quarter with a delivery of $13 million in operating income, more than double the prior year amount and a 28% operating income margin, nicely approaching the 2025 target of 30% plus.
