    "content": " Pet Supplies Plus, Sylvan and Buddy's are likely to grow in 2023 and offsetting EBITDA growth at Freight, PSP, Sylvan and Buddy's will likely be a slight decline in Vitamin Shoppe EBITDA, driven by continued mix shift in favor of lower-margin sports nutrition products as well as a larger decline in Badcock's EBITDA as we expect the home furnishings industry as a whole to continue to struggle somewhat until fully landed inventory costs are closer to pre-COVID levels."
