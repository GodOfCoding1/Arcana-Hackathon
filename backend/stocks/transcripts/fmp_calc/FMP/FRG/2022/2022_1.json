    "content": " I\u2019d say that, the main differences today versus where we were three months ago, it would be -- I didn\u2019t really see what the catalyst would be that would snap things back more into equilibrium and now I think I feel better that we can see the light at the end of the tunnel, because the consumer generally is challenged. And I think a lot of it has to do with vendor relationships and whether or not we\u2019re able to successfully get the vendors to look at the American Freight, Badcock, Buddy\u2019s and anything else that we may add to the Home Furnishing segment over time as just Franchise Group and that relationship and whether or not we\u2019re able to drive better pricing, a very small benefit in pricing has a very large impact on overall profitability. So that\u2019s -- it\u2019s every -- it takes to, we\u2019ve always said that, we can find for a lot of businesses we\u2019ve loved own and we can price businesses that we would like to own, but that doesn\u2019t mean that the counterparty is going to be interested in selling them for the valuation that that we think makes sense for Franchise Group, but we\u2019re not going anywhere, hopefully. It\u2019s -- again, what -- it depends on which business you\u2019re comparing it to, I think that, the way I would have you understand what we\u2019re seeing holistically is that when you combine all of those variations, the things that are better, the things that are not as good as what we would have expected, when you blend it all together, we\u2019re right where we thought we would be."
