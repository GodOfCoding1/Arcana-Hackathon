    "content": " I think it's important to specifically separate our poor execution at American Freight from a difficult home furnishings environment that has also been impacting American Freight, Buddy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, and Badcock for some time. That's one of the reasons that we went out to find Peter, we need somebody who can spend 365 days a year focused on value creation, and, operating our home furnishing businesses, and that he can do that, well, we're spending time, we are pursuing M&A. So they're all three are the same in that regard, as you would have assumed, I think, with American Freight, the main difference is when supply was tight, and there was a time where we really, we couldn't get inventory, we were struggling as the supply chain really contracted and wait times were very long, and then orders would get cancelled anyway, we really just in my fault, we just bought whatever we could, instead of what we should. Look I think Vitamin Shoppe has held up incredibly well, we've been hearing for quite some time, all right, COVID induced bump, it's going to come back to where were it was a $40 something million EBITDA business, it's clearly not now. Look higher rates, the economic environment that I think we're in and that we're heading deeper into, they're really good for our value driven, home furnishings businesses like American Freight and Badcock where we can offer payment plans to customers. We don't need to be at the corner of Maine in Maine, this is not an impulse buy, you don't drive by an American Freight, and say, okay, I think I want to go in there and buy something, you're specifically going to American Freight for a purpose, kind of like a Cracker Barrel, and you can be wherever you want, well, this is that time."
