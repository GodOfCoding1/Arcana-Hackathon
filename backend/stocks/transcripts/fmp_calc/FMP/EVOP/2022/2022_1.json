    "content": " I\u2019m confident that we will be able to execute on our strategies and generate solid top line and bottom line growth for the company given the diversification of the business, the cash-to-card tailwinds across our markets and our significant M&A pipeline and capital capacity. In Mexico, consistent with previous quarters, we demonstrated mid- to high teen\u2019s volume and adjusted revenue growth of 18% and 15% respectively, driven by our bank referral channel as COVID-related restrictions abated and customers resumed in-store buying activity. In the first quarter, our tech-enabled revenue increased 13% compared to the prior year, which reflects our ISV and B2B growth and strong momentum for our repositioned direct e-commerce business. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. But the direct channel is always \u2013 it is what it\u2019s always going to be, which is there are roughly 7 million card accepting merchants in the U.S., and I think rough number is, a third or 40% of them have an integrated solution today. And so while I don\u2019t think that\u2019s ever going to be a bellwether of the U.S. business, it\u2019s an enormous source of cash flow for the company that allows us to then reinvest in super high-growth markets like what Darren is focused on in his comments on Greece or what I have been talking about with respect to our activities in Chile. Your line is open."
