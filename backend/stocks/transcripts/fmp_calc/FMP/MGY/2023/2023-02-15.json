    "content": " It may add to other learnings that could sort of steer us in a little bit of an adjacent direction maybe, is the best way to say it, but I think it will supplement -- it's going to continue to supplement some of what we do around propping up are extending and sustaining Giddings even further and utilizing some of the learnings that we've had over the last several years. It's a simple sort of decision on our part, frankly around some of the returns and some of the ultimate performance that we're seeing out of the Giddings wells, that has clearly led us or steered us more to allocating capital a little bit away from Karnes as opposed to sort of just -- yes, if we wanted to drill a little bit more in Karnes, I suppose we could, but it's -- it tends to be a little bit -- a lot of flush IPs and sharp production initially and then it declines more rapidly typically than Giddings."
