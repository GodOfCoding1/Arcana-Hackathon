    "content": " Third quarter 2022 production of 81,500 boe per day increased by 21% year-over-year and 10% sequentially, and well above the high end of our earlier guidance. We were purchased three million shares during the quarter reducing our diluted share count by 8% from the same period last year, and paid our regular quarterly dividend of $0.10 a share. I mean, I think maybe set a different way, Leo, is that if you just look at our full-year 2022 capital, and probably say it is going to be 10%, higher in 2023, that would probably get you to approximately what we are thinking right now at least based on what we know today. Chris, I think this may be his question for you, if you could help me understand the production get the drivers behind the production beat in 3Q with an eye at trying to, say what, what is a onetime thing and what is maybe Mechanoid being on a different trajectory, and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m really thinking about me, you can have well out performance, you could have, up performance versus your schedule for turn lines."
