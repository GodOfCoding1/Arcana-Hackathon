    "content": " During the first quarter of 2022, we grew our total production 15% year-over-year and 3.5% sequentially, while spending just 28% of our EBITDAX drilling and completing wells and generating operating income margins or EBIT of 62%. We repurchased a total of 6 million shares during the first quarter, reducing our total diluted share outstanding by 9% compared to last year's first quarter. We also paid the second installment of our semiannual dividend of $0.20 a share, which is based on our full year 2021 results recast at $55 oil, bringing the total dividend associated with 2021 results to $0.28 per share. Efficiencies such as faster drill times, longer laterals and more wells per pad are expected to lead to more net wells during the year, leading to approximately $25 million of additional capital. We have improved our drilling feet per day by about 20% compared to a year ago and increased the lateral length of the average Giddings well by about 15% to 8,000 feet with some wells expected to surpass 10,000 feet. We established corporate records for many of our key financial metrics during the first quarter, including net income, diluted earnings per share, free cash flow and most notably, operating income margins or EBIT of 62%. We generated total net income for the quarter of $209 million, including an effective tax rate of 8%, which was at the high end of our guidance and due to stronger product prices. Overall, company production volumes grew 3.5% sequentially and 15% year-over-year to 71,800 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the first quarter. As shown on Slide 7, we also used $49 million of cash or $0.20 a share to pay our final semiannual dividend associated with our full year 2021 results, recast using oil prices of $55. Our total adjusted cash operating costs, including G&A, were $13.18 per BOE in the first quarter of 2022, an increase of $2.45 per BOE compared to year ago levels, and our revenue per BOE rose by more than $21 per barrel over the same period. Including our DD&A rate of $8.21 per BOE, which is generally in line with our F&D costs, our operating income margin for the first quarter was $36.48 per BOE or 62% of our total revenue. As a result of the additional efficiency-driven net wells, we now expect our full year 2022 production growth to exceed 10% compared with our earlier guidance of high single-digit growth. And so as long as you have this money, you put it in a share reduction because we believe maybe rightly or wrongly, but as we reduce the shares, it basically allows for larger and larger dividend increases because the way we manage the dividend size as we recast the current year in the $55 oil environment and then figure out how much we can afford to spend on dividends out of that."
