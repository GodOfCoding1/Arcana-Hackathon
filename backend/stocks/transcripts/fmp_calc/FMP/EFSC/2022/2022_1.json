    "content": " As Jim had mentioned, we're out of the gates well in 2022 with loan growth for the quarter of $176 million net of PPP or 8% annualized as represented on slide number 5. Kansas City loans were up $21 million in the quarter or 10.8% annualized with a balanced mix of new C&I and CRE loans in the various industries, including logistics, foodservice, broadcasting and metal fabrication. On Slide 14 we reduced the allowance for credit losses with a $4 million provision benefit in the first quarter, due to improvement in our credit quality metrics, forecasted macroeconomic factors, most notably unemployment rates and the commercial real estate price index. With a strong capital position and equity market trends, we repurchased over 350,000 common shares, totaling $17 million in the first quarter and announced another increase to our quarterly dividend. I think just count alone is going to give you that expense coverage back and then the 25 basis point hike that we already have that, you didn't really see any through P&L in the first quarter, but is fully impacting the second quarter and a midstream hike here continued earning on the growth for the first quarter."
