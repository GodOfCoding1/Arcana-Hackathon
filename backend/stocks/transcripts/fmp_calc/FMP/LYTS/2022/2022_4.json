    "content": " Margin expansion was a strong focus throughout fiscal 2022 and the business attained our highest levels in the fourth quarter, with our adjusted operating margin improving 160 basis points versus last year and adjusted EBITDA increasing 130 basis points to 8.3% of sales. I'm not -- I don't want to commit that we're going to hit the $500 million, but I will say that, based on the momentum we've generated over the last few years, we're certainly on our way to it. We're all seeing pain points in terms of inflation from gasoline to groceries, and obviously, we're seeing the supply chain issues work out in all kinds of different places, whether it's the availability -- if you want to go buy a new car, or machine, upgrades we want to do here, all of those type things. I mean, I think that -- it's a great question, Rick, and I think from a company's perspective -- from a company's standpoint, yes, we become much more stable, have better visibility, our forecasting is better, our commitments from our customers, our salespeople, our agents is much better and that all works. And I would just encourage your -- the management team and as you sit with the Board and think about valuations and all, the multiple of sales that the company trades at less than one times sales, where EBITDA even soon should be 10% of sales, really is -- I got to believe from your perspective, frustrating, but from our perspective, it's just -- it's an opportunity that this company trades -- continues to trade at this kind of discount."
