    "content": " This is the first time in the company's history that we've exceeded $100 million in sales in a single quarter, and you can be assured we'll be looking to make this a regular event. Now, while I focus much of this call and the benefits of our actions to the company, our customers and our financial performance during our first quarter, I would like to underline that these actions are all in alignment with LSI's long-term efforts around sustainability and our ESG initiatives. We basically -- I think I mentioned it in a prior call, about a third of the customer base is somebody that's LSI is in the lead on, about a third of that addressable customer base is somebody JSI in the lead on, and about a third of them were -- we either don't know or either of us do not know or neither of us are in a lead position. But that is going to take -- that sales cycle is going to take even longer than the six to nine months because we're really creating a whole new category in parallel with interest from our customers, but it's a whole new category and an approach. But the good thing about it is it's in tough times like this, it's really exposing the capabilities the organization has, and I'm very proud of the team that works here across the whole company, thrilled with the way JSI is integrating, and we see really strong opportunities ahead for us."
