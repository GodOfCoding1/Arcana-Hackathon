    "content": " Our outstanding performance in both our second and third quarter this year helps underline the changes we have made to our business, our ability to deliver products despite a challenging labor market and supply chain, our new product introductions over the last few years and a very active sales and agent network, along with the success of our Display Solution Group, including JSI. So I know when you took over the reins, Jim, a little over three years ago, it was sort of like, let's jettison some of the assets that really aren't being put to use redundant or unnecessary, and we're able to do so monetize those assets at really good prices and pay down debt and extinguish debt, which was sort of an exciting thing for the company. I know that in the best of all worlds, you probably like to operate debt-free, but there's really great opportunities, whether it means using some of the \u2013 some of your working capital for inventory or paying your dividend and now doing some stock repurchases, all of which make a lot of sense and you're still generating free cash flow that can be used to retire debt."
