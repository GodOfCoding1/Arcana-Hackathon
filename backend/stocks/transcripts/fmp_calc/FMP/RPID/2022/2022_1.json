    "content": " With over half of global top 20 pharmaceutical manufacturers as our customers and our value proposition resonating strongly; a ramping high quality commercial team focused on new system placements; an exciting new product pipeline and significantly improving gross margins, I remain as excited as ever about the future of Rapid Micro. Product revenue, which consists of Systems and Consumables, was $2.6 million in Q1 compared to $3.7 million in the first quarter last year. From a comparison standpoint, we placed 8 systems in the first quarter last year, including 3 systems that were originally scheduled for placement in Q4 2020, but were pushed into Q1 2021 as a result of extended holiday shutdowns due to the pandemic. Revenue from Consumables exceeded our expectations, increasing nearly 100% in the first quarter compared to Q1 last year, as we continue to benefit from our growing base of validated systems and increased utilization at existing customers. Looking only at those systems we considered to be in routine use, Consumables revenue per average system increased both year-over-year and sequentially in Q1 and was well over $100,000 on an annualized basis, with several individual customer systems at annual run rates while over $200,000. Service margins were negative $0.1 million in both Q1 this year and last year, with the benefit of higher revenue this year offset by the cost of recent investments in personnel and travel-related costs associated with field service and validation activity to support our growing base of Growth Direct Systems. Moving to revenue, we continue to expect quarterly sequential increases as the year progresses, driven by system placements, as well as increasing recurring revenue from Consumables and Service Contracts as we continue to grow our base of validated systems and move them into routine commercial use."
