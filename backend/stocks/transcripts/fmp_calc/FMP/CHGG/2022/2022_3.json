    "content": " For full year 2022, we now expect total revenue to be between $762 million and $765 million, with Chegg Services revenue between $730 million and $733 million, gross margin between 73% and 74% and adjusted EBITDA between $252 million and $255 million or 33% adjusted EBITDA margin and an increase of approximately 280 basis points from our prior guidance. They're just taking fewer classes and we think that is a result of the commentary that we said in Q2, which is we think a large portion of students now, particularly state school students, the larger state schools are considering college 12-month a year versus two semesters and the summer off, that's good for us because that's part of the reason we believe we're seeing increased renewal intensity. And no one's asked yet, but I think the bundles are going to be a massive opportunity for us to increase conversion and retention and ARPU, because the more value we put in the bundle for the same price and the more we're able to create value beyond just the academic year, the better it is for our business. I think one of the things that we have done for many years, even you've been with us for quite some time, even back when we were struggling to break even on an EBITDA line, we always said to ourselves, we're going to make sure we have enough resources, behind the arrow whatever we're going to do."
