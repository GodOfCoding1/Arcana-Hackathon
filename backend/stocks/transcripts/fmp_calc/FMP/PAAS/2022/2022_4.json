    "content": " In Q4, we expensed $157.3 million for transaction costs primarily for the $150 million we advanced to Yamana toward the termination fee paid to Goldfields Ltd. We are expecting to record additional expense related to the transaction in Q1 2023. But you also have to see that we're going to be a much larger entity in Latin America, having much more purchasing power and negotiation power for our big purchases of, let's say, cyanide, steel balls, explosives, et cetera which will also result in additional synergies which we did not include yet in our kind of proposed synergy number that we put out there as about $40 million to $60 million a year."
