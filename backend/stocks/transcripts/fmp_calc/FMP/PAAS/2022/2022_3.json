    "content": " Cost inflation and supply disruptions continue to be an industry-wide issue, which has led us to expect that silver segment cash costs and all-in sustaining costs could be marginally above the high-end of the range in our 2022 original operating outlook, which indicated an all-in sustaining cost for silver segment of $14.50 to $16 per ounce in 2022. With the transaction announced today, Pan American will receive approximately $102 million in Triple Flag shares and cash. Under the proposal, Pan American would acquire all of the issued and outstanding common shares of the Yamana and Yamana would sell certain subsidiaries and partnerships that hold the Yamana\u00e2\u0080\u0099s interest in its Canadian assets to Agnico Eagle, including the Canadian Malartic mine. The consideration is made up of $1 billion in cash funded by Agnico Eagle, approximately 36.1 million shares of Agnico Eagle and approximately 153.5 million shares of Pan American Silver. Maybe my next question, Michael, as you mentioned Pan American Silver is buying essentially Yamana the company and I would assume that you also take on Yamana\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cash and Yamana\u00e2\u0080\u0099s debt."
