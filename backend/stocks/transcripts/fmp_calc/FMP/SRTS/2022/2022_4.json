Well, again, we haven't provided any kind of guidance, and I don't know if we're going to get to the guidance piece because I think sometimes there's levels of expectation that -- I don't know how they're derived, but there's levels of expectation for us that might not be as accurate as they should be. So our sales force, obviously, gets that information as well and says -- we've directed I don't know how many patients in your area over the course of the last month, 2 months, 3 months that you're not seeing. So that's an objective that we have because we're making money, but it wasn't accounted for by whoever derived whatever our earnings per share were, but I think that we're happy to pay that, and we look forward to paying even more for 2023."
