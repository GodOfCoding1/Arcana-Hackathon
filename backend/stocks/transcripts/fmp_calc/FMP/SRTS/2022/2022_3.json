    "content": " As Joe mentioned, our revenues for the third quarter of 2022 were $9 million, and this compares with revenues of $5.5 million for the third quarter of 2021, which was still impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Turning briefly to year-to-date financial results, revenues for the first 9 months of 2022 were $31.4 million, up 124% over $40 million for the first 9 months of 2021. So, I think that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to be appropriate someday when we have significant numbers to reflect what each one of those units have if we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to be over $0.5 million or over $1 million on a quarterly basis with TDI or with the aesthetic product or the laser product."
