    "content": " And if the research continues to show beneficial outcomes as it has so far in a small number, veterinary medicine could be an important new market for our SRT systems with approximately 30,000 veterinary practices in the U.S. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll briefly mention our international business now as I think the fact that we shipped 5 SRT systems to Asia, including to China, in spite of the never-ending pandemic in that country, reflects the importance of treating patients for skin cancer and keloids despite the geopolitical uncertainty. With the influx of cash and how we've been able to preserve our cash over the last 2, 3 years in spite of COVID, we're now reinvesting that cash, as I mentioned during the dialogue that we've -- we're working with an outside agency of PR and advertising firm to help create more patient awareness. But we've gone from literally 2 patients a week inquiring by reaching us either off of our website or phone calls, to now we're seeing -- we're approaching 30 calls a day, 30 inquiries a day from patients and we're not even starting the PR program throughout the entire country. So if I were them with the new money that they're making or the renewed opportunities that they have within their practice, I think looking at taking some extended vacations with the wife and kids somewhere, whether it's the cottage or whether it's overseas or wherever they want to go after 2 years of being closed up, I think they're going to take advantage of that. So it's an exciting product and I think that the advertising and the marketing that we're doing with regard to that and the word of mouth that is going from one doctor to the other, I mean, being able to provide these patients with these services  without the lidocaine, all of these features, again, provides customers with better productivity and patients with less pain and no downtime."
