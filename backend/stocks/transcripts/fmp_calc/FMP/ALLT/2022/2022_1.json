    "content": " With nine launch networks, any change in the timing of an expected new launch, or any change on the manner in which it is expected to be launched or marketed would result in a significant impact to the overall SECaaS revenue number for the year. I would like to know that we still expect to launch numerous SECaaS networks during 2022 despite the about delay, but as we are getting closer to year-end, and given that usually there are also a few months of free service and ramp time, we do not expect them to have a significant contribution to 2020 SECaaS revenue. Okay, and then when I look at the new guidance for 7 million of SECaaS revenue for the year, it seems like if I just linearly plug in kind of adding 100 or 200,000, of sequential revenue per quarter, I get to that number."
