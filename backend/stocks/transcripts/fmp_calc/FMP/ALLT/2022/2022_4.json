    "content": " While our SECaaS revenues are being recognized later than we would've liked and later than we expected, I remain convinced of the large potential of this business, and I'm confident that it will grow significantly in the coming years. I think it's mainly the -- it's mainly really the timing and how long it takes to close the deals and then recognize the revenue and that's delaying our revenues, but I don't think it's an overall contraction in the market size. It turned out as we discussed several times in previous earnings calls, that while it could be a good indication for long-term potential for the first -- I don't know, for the first few years, it's not a good indication for the short-term revenue because it doesn't bring into account the timing of the launch. You made comments that you don't think that this market is in contraction and that you're not losing market share, but the business was about $140 million two years ago, and it's going to be around $100 million based on the guidance you put out this year. I know you said the Broadcom impact has peaked, but I'm trying to understand that especially this $20 million guidance for Q1, because if I take the maintenance run rate that you have which is around $10 million a quarter, and then kind of layer in some enterprise SECaaS, it looks like the CSP the sort of lumpy CSP deal business is being guided to basically zero for Q1."
