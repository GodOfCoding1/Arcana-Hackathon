On the call, we have Aneel Bhusri and Chano Fernandez, our Co-CEOs; Barbara Larson, our CFO; and Pete Schlampp, our Chief Strategy Officer. Before we get started, we want to emphasize that some of our statements on this call, particularly our guidance, are based on the information we have as of today and include forward-looking statements regarding our financial results, applications, customer demand, operations, and other matters. These statements are subject to risks, uncertainties, and assumptions, including those related to the impacts of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and recent macroeconomic events on our business and global economic condition. Please refer to the press release and the risk factors in documents we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our 2022 annual report on Form 10-K and most recent quarterly report on Form 10-Q for additional information on risks, uncertainties, and assumptions that may cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in such statements. In addition, during today's call, we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe are useful as supplemental measures of Workday's performance. You can find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations with comparable GAAP results in our earnings press release, in our investor presentation, and on the Investor Relations page of our website. Starting with this quarter and going forward, we will be posting a quarterly investor presentation on our Investor Relations website, following each quarter\u2019s call. Also, the customers\u2019 page of our website includes a list of selected customers and is updated monthly. Thank you, Justin, and welcome to Workday's first quarter fiscal year 2023 earnings conference call. Workday reported solid Q1 results, delivering subscription revenue growth of 23%. During the quarter, we continue to see companies across our target geographies and industries, select Workday as they move their finance and HR systems to the cloud. At the same time, several key opportunities that we had expected to close in Q1 were pushed to later in the year, impacting backlog performance, Barbara will touch on later in the call. Continue to see strong demand for our products and are optimistic about the year, we're mindful, however of the current macroeconomic and geopolitical environments and the impact these conditions could have on businesses globally. That in mind, our focus remains on what we can control, which is to continue to drive innovation as we broaden our offering to become an even more strategic partner to our customers, deliver the industry's top levels of customer support and cultivate our culture, which remains foundational to all that we do. Now, I'd like to share some of the business highlights from Q1, starting with Workday HCM, Barclays, Callaway Golf and West Tennessee Healthcare were just a few of the many new customers that we welcomed last quarter. While these new wins are very important to us, we remain equally focused on ensuring our customers successfully go live, critical to our ability to drive customer satisfaction, the go-lives in Q1 include Hy-Vee, Kyndryl and Royal Bank of Canada, better known as RBC, proven ability to support our customers large volumes of data and transactions, continues to be a significant differentiator in our success. We're also opening new markets with solutions,  analytics, which now is over 500 customers and Workday journeys, which has over 300 customers. Something that we don't take for granted, we continue to find new ways to increase our strategic positioning within the office of the CHRO. Highlights included key full suite wins at American University, Lehigh Valley Hospital, and Mohegan Tribal Game Authority along with several core financial customer go-lives in the quarter, including Advocate Aurora Health and Sentara Healthcare, name a few. Our strategy for many years now and one of our key differentiators is to provide the organizations with a unified solution to plan, execute, and analyze their businesses in real-time. That strategy is clearly resonating in the market with Workday adaptive planning now being used by nearly 6,000 organizations globally, including nearly 75% of our core fins customers. Here's some analytics nearing 1,000 customers, including roughly 40% of our core financials customers. As you know, Workday was found on a core set of values that help guide our decisions as we look to do what's right for our employees, the customers we serve and the world around us. Example of this approach can be seen through our increased focus on supporting our customers evolving ESG initiatives that have quickly become a top priority in the boardroom and for the office of the CFO, especially considering the most recent and upcoming SEC disclosure requirements. Q1, we announced two new solutions that will be available this year to further help companies view their businesses through an ESG lens. We'll help our customers more easily track progress against goals and identify areas for improvement within workforce composition, organizational health, diversity, and workforce investment. The second is supplier and sustainability, which help customers to improve the sustainability and resilience of their supply chains. And these two new solutions to our existing product portfolio further strengths our ability to be a strategic partner to our customers, shareholders on the . Switching to the people front, we continue to invest heavily in our company culture to sustain our belief that happy employees deliver the highest levels of satisfaction to our great customers. We intend to create 1,000 new jobs over the next two years, which will increase our overall Ireland based workforce by approximately 60%. Dublin site plays a critical role in our product development and customer service efforts, decided to build on the already incredible group of employees we have in Dublin. As we look forward, have been the backdrop of macro uncertainty, comforted by the fact that as a company we've been through these cycles before, most recently navigated the pandemic. And as a younger company, the 2008-2009 financial crisis, each time we've come out stronger and remain confident in the fundamentals of our business and our long-term strategy, believe that our leadership position will only strengthen. We have a proven track record of growth at scale, a robust business model with strong cash flow generation, the values driven culture there attracts the best talent and  it\u2019s always been a recipe for long-term success for us. With that, I\u2019ll turn over to our Co-CEO, Chano Fernandez. And we once again drove very strong renewals, a testament to the strategic nature of our solutions and our commitment to customer satisfaction. As Aneel mentioned, we did see the timing of several Q1 key deals push into future quarters. And we\u2019re also seeing some Q2 pipeline opportunities move to the second half, but we\u2019re confident in closing them later this year. More broadly, we see healthy overall pipeline positioning us to deliver a strong FY2023. From a geographic standpoint in Q1, we have solid growth across several international market highlighted by the UK where we have significant wins and companies such as Barclays and NatWest Banking Group. In the us, we saw a strength across multiple areas, including the medium enterprise where our broad portfolio of solutions across the CHRO and CFO is driving our success. In the large enterprise, in addition to some of the new core HR and financial management wins, we expanded our strategic footprint with several of our existing customers, such as Voya, advanced auto parts, and one of the world\u2019s largest technology companies. Industry is another area of significant opportunity, including emerging industries like the U.S. federal government, as well as established ones, such as healthcare, where we are the market leading provider for both cloud based HCN and financial solutions. Some of our most strategic transactions and go-lives in Q1 came out of our healthcare team, including wins at Lehigh Valley Hospital, Health Research, Inc., and West Tennessee Healthcare, as well as  go-lives at Advocate Aurora Health and Sentara Healthcare. And there is clear momentum looking forward as our significant base of reference customers, along with our targeted product investments in areas like supply chain are clearly paying off. Another key growth opportunity is across our partner ecosystem, which from day one has been critical to our customers success. Not only do our partners help ensure successful deployments, but through the extensibility of our platform, they\u2019re also accelerating our product roadmap. A great example is partners here and consulting who leverage the industry expertise and operational supply chain knowledge to develop a demand planning solution on Workday adaptive planning, work was built for the healthcare industry. Using this solution Dayton Children\u2019s Hospital is able to make data driven decisions and ensure critical supplies, resources, and space are available when patients need their most. Over the course of Q1, we depend our partnerships with multiple assistance integrators like Accenture, Deloitte, and PwC, to not only launch new partner built solutions, but to align our call innovation plans to scale and accelerate over the coming quarters. Helping us that drive this effort and our overall ecosystem strategy is our new Chief Partner Officer, some are correct, who brings more than two decades of experience to the role and who will report directly to me welcome Sam. In closing, we enter Q2 with healthy pipelines and positioning across the offices of the CHRO and CFO that is as strategic as ever. As Aneel and Chano mentioned, we had a solid start to the year as organizations across the globe continue to choose Workday as their strategic partner in driving their finance and HR digital transformations. Subscription revenue in Q1 was $1.27 billion, up 23% year-over-year and professional services revenue was $163 million, up 14%. Total revenue outside of the U.S. was $360 million, representing 25% of total revenue. As Aneel and Chano mentioned, we saw the timing of several deals, including a few large ones, push from Q1 into future quarters and FY2023, which impacted our 24-month and total subscription revenue backlog growth by approximately 1 percentage point. Total subscription revenue backlog was $12.65 billion, up 26%. Our non-GAAP operating income for the first quarter was $289 million, resulting in a non-GAAP operating margin of 20.1%. As expected, we made significant investments across the business in Q1 and began to transition back to the office as well as resuming travel and in-person events. During the quarter, we raised $3 billion in cash through a public debt offering at attractive fixed interest rates, enabling us to repay existing debt while also providing additional flexibility as we plan for the future. During the quarter, we successfully added and integrated over 700 net new employees, ending Q1 with more than 15,900 employees. Overall, we are pleased with the solid company-wide execution in Q1, and remain focused on leveraging our leadership position to drive sustainable 20% plus subscription revenue growth on our path to $10 billion in revenue. Turning now to guidance, which reflects continued momentum across our business, while also taking into account a more back end weighted year than we originally anticipated. We are raising our guidance for FY2023 subscription revenue to be in the range of $5.537 billion to $5.557 billion, representing 22% year-over-year growth. We expect our Q2 subscription revenue to be $1.353 billion to $1.355 billion, 22% year-over-year growth with sequential growth in Q3 of approximately 4.5%. We still expect professional services revenue to be $650 million in FY2023, as we continue our tight alignment with our growing partner ecosystem to help ensure our customers have successful implementations that support the highest levels of customer satisfaction and business value. For Q2, we expect non-GAAP operating margins of 17.5%, which reflects typical seasonality as a result of our annual employee compensation cycle, which took effect at the beginning of Q2. As a result of our recent debt IPO, we are lowering our FY2023 guidance for operating cash flows to $1.61 billion, which takes into account approximately $55 million of cash interest payments associated with the debt. And finally, I\u2019ll close by thanking our amazing employees, customers and partners for their continued support and hard work. Your line is now live. I\u2019m curious if there were any common characteristics across the opportunities that slipped, for instance, by geo or by vertical. I would not call one particular area, whether by product or region in terms of the deals that push in Q1. Each of these pushes were for different reasons, not necessarily macro related, and we are focused on closing them later in the year. We are definitely mindful that the environment, particularly in Europe remains uncertain and we could continue to monitor it, but we have solid results across regions in Q1, including several international markets. Your line is now live. What are the tactics that you\u2019re pursuing to weather through this potential people call it downturn, maybe you call it something different, whether it\u2019s GTM product investments, hiring. I guess, a question for Chano on the deals front, what are you hearing from customers as to what they\u2019re looking for in order to get clarity so they could go forward and close these deals with Workday. We\u2019re being smart about the way we hire and probably helping customers with ways to continue their think through value proposition, maybe in a way that we hadn\u2019t do every downturn. What I would say in terms of what I\u2019m hearing from customers, and I\u2019m just coming back from doubles right now, I have many CEO conversations there is that digital transformation investments, Workday being at the core of those remain very strategic and a priority. The other fact that I cannot Kash is like, to give Suncor remain \u2013 we really started a strong and our May seems to be a very good first month of the Q2 for us. Your line is now live. Chano, can I just follow-up on that last point you made, which was you feel confident in these deals closing later in the year, so they weren\u2019t macro related. And they just needed more time, but it\u2019s \u2013 they\u2019re not freaking out about the macro or things have deteriorated in terms of their confidence level in their business, and they need some time to get their cash in order, whatever it might be. I just want to sort of separate sort of what you\u2019re seeing or seeing from say customers getting concerned, because you just said, they\u2019re still strategic deals versus maybe these particular deals that are now going to fall in the back half of the year. So I just think it\u2019s an important point to make, because I think people are hearing conflicting things on the macro from different software companies right now. Certainly, there is uncertainty in the macro as Aneel has highlighted that is one point we can\u2019t control. Your line is now live. Obviously you mentioned in the call, some of the deal delays that you\u2019re seeing. One of the things that you had already previously started to focus in on is, is the back to the base selling motion and some of the additional product that you\u2019ve brought under the portfolio. As it happened at the onset of COVID, we adjusted to those motions that we felt that we\u2019re stronger. For example, customer base, for example, medium enterprise and some others like planning. Your line is now live. Thank you so much and apologize if there\u2019s background noise, I\u2019m just here in an airport. But following on the last question, as we think about that light space opportunity and the install base and the degree to which having done such a great job selling into the base the last couple of years. Your line is now live. I wanted to ask about planning, it\u2019s an area that we keep hearing from the channel standing out as relatively strong. I would say at a product level, the product does continue to get better and it now works across multiple use cases, not just financial planning, but workforce planning. And I do think the pandemic and maybe this macroenvironment are causing companies to think a lot more about planning and replanning, and almost a mode of continuous planning. And I think our products are really well suited for this environment of engine, a plan every few months, maybe even sooner to reflect pretty dynamic business environment out there. Your line is now live. We commented, or I said that we didn\u2019t see any particular difference in terms of product or region in terms of the deals that push in Q1, all we said is that there were a couple of large opportunities. But that we still see a strong pipeline and good momentum, and we\u2019ve been creating a good pace that give us confidence to deliver on the goals that we do have for FY 20223. Your line is now live. Can you talk to us \u2013 I guess, for Barbara, can you talk to us a little bit about what enabled those better margins in Q1. As you could hear, we\u2019re all very nervous about the economy. From a margin perspective in Q1, the over performance we saw there was really around the timing of certain expenses and those pushing out to later in the year, which is why you see us holding our full year guide. We continue to hire, but we\u2019re continuing to monitor the environment around us. And that these type of environments could provide us with an opportunity to really leverage our brand, our strategic positioning and our model. Your line is now live. We are confident as well in our sales strategy from a go-to-market perspective, but we will be fine tuning that one as the situation is evolving and as the year is moving on, either in terms of the investments that it requires, or either in terms of balancing investments from one area of goodness, to an area that we may perceive, we have more strength and energy during this environment. Your line is now live. The question and Chano on, if you look, if the commentary is it's not macro related, then you kind of had a kind of odd quarter in terms of sales execution, because it looks like you got very unlucky in terms of how the different deals came together. When some of the deals are because of C-level executive changes, there is no much we can do about it in terms of anticipating some of those. We certainly are here to partner with our customers on a long-term basis, and we want to ensure that they have the confidence in the new executives in terms of the overall implementations on deployment plans. In terms of our ability to split or break those deals into a smaller ones, we fill down some of this, the value of the solution is really when it applies to the whole customer base of the customers. So clearly our medium enterprise motion is thriving Raimo, that is giving much more stability to having a smaller dear components that will better outcome overall in terms of the business out there. Your line is now live. This is not our first \u2013 it's not our first rodeo through a downturn, go back to Dave and I weathered lot of storms at PeopleSoft, Chano has weathered a lot of storms, as long as you have the right value proposition, we weathered the storm in 2008, 2009 which is about the worst economic environment I've ever seen. And so, I think demand goes forward and there'll be some companies that are cautious, and we just need to figure out where to spend our sales cycles. If I may add a Aneel bread, when we're talking on some of these large deal, it's not that we're talking those many. So what we are doing is to continue a few, to continue to work these deals through our sales process, and we're staying very, very close to our prospects. Your line is now live. You mentioned before that this isn't your first rodeo and you've seen this before, and I recall you going through this before. We'll know a lot more, that's not a great answer, but we'll know a lot more coming out of Q4 what real demand was like. When I look back at the COVID environment, it took one to two quarters before people got their arms around that environment. Your line is now live. And then on the inflation perspective in terms of cost, it definitely continues to be a very competitive market for talent, but based on our strong hiring over the last couple of quarters, we feel really good about our ability to attract and retain talent globally. Your line is now live. There are a lot of things that are interesting, but I can't really talk about our M&A strategy in detail other than say that we're always going to be looking for companies that have a great product, a great team, cutting edge technology, but we're not looking for those massive transformational acquisitions that bet the ranch. So we look at the last couple years, whether it's Bentley or Peakon or Adaptive to the extent we can find those kinds of situations or scout, we will continue to pursue those."
