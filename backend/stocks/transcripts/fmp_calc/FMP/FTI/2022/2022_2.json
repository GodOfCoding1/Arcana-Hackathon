    "content": " Inbound for the first half of the year was $3.8 billion, a book-to-bill of 1.4 with iEPCI direct awards and Subsea Services, representing approximately 70% of total orders. The underlying strength is also displayed in our Subsea opportunity list, which increased by 20% from the first quarter update and now represents an opportunity set of $24 billion for the industry based on the midpoint value of these offshore developments. Based on our strong first half results, the growing project pipeline and the active dialogue with our large and expanding customer base, we expect full year Subsea orders will be up as much as 40% versus the prior year, above the previous forecast of 30% with orders now approaching $7 billion in 2022. Your line is open. So, for instance, the second consecutive quarter of $1.9 billion of Subsea inbound and the total inbound approaching $7 billion and indeed the Subsea orders continue to be booked at average margins -- in average margins that are accretive to backlog. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open."
