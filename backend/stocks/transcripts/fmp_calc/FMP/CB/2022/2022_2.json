    "content": " Our second quarter underwriting results were simply lights out: $1.4 billion of underwriting income, which was up 21% over prior, with a published combined ratio of 84%, both record results; catastrophe losses in the quarter were reasonably right -- light relative to our expected losses and virtually flat with last year's second quarter; the P&C current accident year combined ratio, excluding cats, was 83.5%, a nearly 2-point improvement over prior year. Growth this quarter in commercial lines was led by our Major Accounts & Specialty Division, which grew about 10.5%, followed by our middle market and small commercial business, which grew about 6.5%. With an updated forecast of income jurisdiction, along with the closing of the acquisition of Cigna's business, we now expect our annual core operating effective tax rate for the full year 2022 to be in the range of 16.5% to 18.5%. And it's the -- it's -- we're the only company I know of in Asia that has a unified life and nonlife joint approach that is going to together -- and it's a country-by-country strategy, pretty granular to how we're going to accelerate growth faster than either one would have been standalone. We're not seeing -- across our business, it's -- we're not seeing the trends that we're actually using -- we're anticipating and increased those in anticipation of future because our business -- the insurance business classically lags. And how long it takes for others to review portfolios, see results, make judgments, then have that passed down to the trading level of how does it impact how we see rates, well, that's a ways out there, and it doesn't really work in that buttoned-up way in most of the world -- the vast majority of the world of insurance."
