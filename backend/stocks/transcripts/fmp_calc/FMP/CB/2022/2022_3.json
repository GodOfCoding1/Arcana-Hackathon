    "content": " Total North America premiums were up over 10.5% with commercial up 11.4% or 8.1% excluding agriculture and our high net worth personal lines business, up over 7% in the quarter. In North America, growth this quarter in Commercial Lines was led by our Major Accounts and Specialty division, which grew 9.7%, followed by our Middle Market and Small Commercial business, which grew 5.7% and our Middle Market division, P&C lines grew almost 9%, while Financial Lines declined about 5.5%, primarily due to a lack of IPOs, M&A activity and new business. Our North America high net worth personal lines business had a very good quarter, with net premiums up over 7%, driven by strong new business activity. Tangible book value per share decreased 15.2% since June reflecting changes in AOCI, which includes realized and unrealized losses of $3.6 billion after tax, resulting from rising interest rates on our fixed income portfolio and foreign currency translation losses of $466 million. As Evan noted, as rates continue to rise, our portfolio's reinvestment rate has increased from 2.3% in December to 5.8% on September 30, while our current book yield is 3.4% versus 3.2% in the in the second quarter. Your line is open. Your line is open. But I think is -- I think it's around 16% of your book right now, if I look across the P&C business. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open."
