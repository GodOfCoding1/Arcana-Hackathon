    "content": " More important, the quarterly results led to what was the best full year financial performance in our company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s history, including record operating income on both a per share and dollar basis from record P&C underwriting and investment income and another year of double-digit premium revenue growth, including the best organic growth in our international P&C business in a decade. Full year P&C underwriting income was a record $4.6 billion, up 23%, with a published combined ratio of 87.6% and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s with $2.2 billion of catastrophe losses in what was one of the costliest years yet for the industry in terms of cats. Now turning to growth in the rate environment, consolidated net written premiums for the company increased nearly 12% in the quarter on a published basis or 16% in constant dollars to $10.2 billion. In North America, growth this quarter in Commercial Lines was led by our major accounts and specialty division, which grew 9.1%, followed by our middle-market and small commercial business, which grew 8.7% and renewal retention for our retail commercial businesses, was over 96%. To illustrate, in the quarter, pricing for total North America Commercial P&C which includes both rate and the portion of exposure that supports rate increased 6.5%, with loss costs up 6.5% as well. Turning to investments, adjusted net investment income for the quarter of over $1.1 billion topped last quarter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s record by more than 6% and was 24% higher than the prior year quarter.
