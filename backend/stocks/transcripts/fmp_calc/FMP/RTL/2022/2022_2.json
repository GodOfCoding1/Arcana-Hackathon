Furthermore, second quarter highlights include revenue growth of over 43% year-over-year to $116.9 million, an increase in cash NOI of nearly 30% over the same period last year to $86.3 million, and net debt to EBITDA that was unchanged quarter-over-quarter. At quarter end, our $5.1 billion portfolio was comprised of 1,056 properties with portfolio occupancy of 90.8% and a weighted average remaining lease term of 7.2 years. Executed leases include 10 new leases, five of which are with anchor tenants that total over 119,000 square feet and $1.8 million of annualized straight-line rent over a weighted average lease term of 10 years. We also completed 38 multi-tenant lease renewals during the second quarter, totaling over 420,000 square feet and $5.4 million of annualized straight-line rent, bringing our total for the first half of 2022 to 56 renewals, totaling almost 600,000 square feet and $8.2 million of annualized straight-line rent."
