    "content": " The first quarter illustrated the effectiveness of our growth strategy as we closed on over $800 million of open-air anchored, grocery anchored and power centers and completed the sale of an office property lease to Sanofi in New Jersey. First quarter revenue increased by nearly 20% year-over-year to $94.9 million, and cash NOI grew by over 16% to $73.6 million. Importantly, our first quarter results only partially include the benefit of the acquisitions completed last quarter, which represents about 60% of the total $1.3 billion portfolio of acquisitions, as measured by purchase price. At quarter end, our $4.7 billion portfolio was comprised of 1,029 properties, with portfolio occupancy of 91.4% and a weighted average remaining lease term of 7.4 years. Annualized straight-line rent increased 21% year-over-year to $346 million, and our portfolio grew 33% to 26.2 million square feet. As of April 15, and including the open-air shopping centers that we closed at the end of April for $277.8 million, our forward acquisition pipeline totaled $532.4 million based on contractual purchase price, and an 8.6% weighted average cap rate and with 5.9 years of average lease term remaining. In the first quarter, we signed leases for over 12,000 square feet of space, and annualized straight-line rent of $158,000 in our multi-tenant portfolio. In the first quarter, we also completed 18 lease renewals in the multi-tenant segment of our portfolio, including six with anchor tenants that total 250,000 square feet and $2 million of annual base rent. Executed occupancy, which includes leases that have been signed, but where the tenant hasn't yet taken possession of the space is comprised of seven new leases that totaled 78,000 square feet and $1.2 million of annualized straight-line rent over a weighted average lease term of nine years. Our leasing pipeline includes 16 new leases that totaled 86,000 square feet and $1.6 million dollars of annualized straight line-rent over a weighted average lease term of 10 years. We also issued approximately $78.3 million of common stock through a combination of $24.9 million issued through our ATM program at an average price of $9.02 per share, and $53.4 million in issuance to affiliates of the CME Group, in connection with the CIM portfolio acquisitions completed during the quarter. First quarter 2022 revenue was $94.9 million, up 19.9% from $79.2 million in the first quarter of 2021 and up 15% from $82.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2021. The company's first quarter GAAP net income was $39.9 million, compared to losses of $40.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2021 and $9.4 million in the first quarter of 2021. NOI was $75.8 million, an $8.6 million increase from the $67.2 million we recorded for the fourth quarter of 2021 and a 15.3% increase over the $65.7 million of NOI we reported in the first quarter of 2021. For the first quarter of 2022, our AFFO attributable to common stockholders was $30 million, or $0.23 per share, that's compared to $0.21 per share for the same period in 2021."
