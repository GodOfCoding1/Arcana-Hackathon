    "content": " This growth is reflected in a 19% increase in full year 2022 AFFO to $140 million compared to 2021 and importantly, translated to fourth quarter AFFO per share growth of 23% to $0.27 when compared to the same quarter of 2021. As we previously communicated, we completed over $400 million of dispositions during 2022, sharpening our focus on retail properties, lowering our net debt by $51.9 million and reducing our net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio by 0.6 times to 9.1 times from 9.7 times at the end of the third quarter as we successfully did in 2021 prior to the large 2022 acquisitions. Our leasing pipeline as of January 31, 2023, including leases executed after the end of the fourth quarter consisted of over 450,000 square feet and nearly $7.4 million in annualized straight line rent. At year end, our $5.1 billion portfolio was comprised of 1,044 properties with portfolio occupancy of 93.7%, executed occupancy of 95.4% and a weighted average remaining lease term of 7.2 years, up from seven years at the end of the third quarter. For the year ended December 31, 2022, we reported total revenue of $446.4 million, a 33% increase compared to $335.2 million in the prior year. And full year 2022 NOI was $344.9 million, a 23% increase over the $279.7 million we recorded for 2021. Full year AFFO was $140 million or $1.06 per share compared to $118 million and $1.02 per share in 2021, increases of 19% and 4% respectively. The transactions we completed enhanced our portfolio, and our leasing pipeline is expected to increase our multi-tenant occupancy to 92.4% and add $7.4 million of straight line rent."
