    "content": " The business achieved strong top-line growth, up 18% year-over-year in the quarter to $182 million and up 7% sequentially, led by 2 of our biggest games, Jackpot Party and Quick Hit Slots. SciPlay's core business is demonstrating substantial progress with record key metrics across the board, including payer conversion hitting an all-time high of 10.4% in the quarter, average monthly revenue per paying user approaching $100 and record quarterly ARPDAU of $0.87, an 18% increase year-over-year. We know that at the core of our growth is really organic investment, and we're going to continue to focus on that where we have excess capital, we'll look to deploy that, whether that is our share repurchase program, debt reduction or potential M&A, where we can see that it's accretive."
