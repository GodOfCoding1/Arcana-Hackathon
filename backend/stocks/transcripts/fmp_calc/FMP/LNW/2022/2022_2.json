    "content": " This momentum is the result of the fundamental changes we have made throughout the company and our top-ranked product performance across Gaming, iGaming and SciPlay, like Ultimate Fire Link with its extension Ultimate Fire Link Explosion debuting as the #1 WAP game on Eilers; Coin Combo, a land-based favorite, achieving yet another record launch in iGaming with Hurricane Horse and highly anticipated Carnival Cow and Terrific Tiger set to launch in the second half of the year; and Gold Fish, where Gold Fish Feeding Time drove incremental SciPlay visitation and engagement metrics, which was a hugely successful cross-platform launch."
