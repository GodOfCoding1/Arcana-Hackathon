    "content": " As I will also touch upon later, the term market is very strong, as charters are willing to pay off to secure fuel-efficient tonnage given the elevated LNG prices and the introduction of EEXI and the European emission trading scheme for shipping next year. With assuring long-term interest rates and the new financing added to our debt funding, we utilized a big drop in the long-term interest rates during the first week of March and secured interest rate swaps of $200 million, with tenders up to 10 years at an average rate of about 1.7%. However, the 10-year $160 million for Flex Volunteer, which was done in December last year carrying all-in interest of 4% and provide a very good hedge against rising interest rates. In our market section in our February presentation we illustrated the high growth of US LNG exports, with US exports growing $23 million tonnes in 2021, representing 120% of the global market growth that year. While the market grew about 5 million tons of 5% in Q1, the LNG import in Europe grew by a staggering 13 million tonnes in the first quarter compared to last year. For illustrative purpose, we have therefore added a red dotted line to the chart where we have put in a $8 spread between TTF and the delivered price for LNG into Europe and assume that this spread lasts for the next 12 months as ramping up import capacity in Europe will take time even for the Germans."
