    "content": " Today, we then also announced a new bank financing for the Flex Resolute, also $150 million with margin of 175 basis points, also a tenure, which is back to back with the contract, and that is expected to be documented and drawn ahead of Q4. So with demand for gas in Europe going down and a glut of LNG hitting European import terminals, to everybody's surprise, I would say, we are actually now in the middle of November with basically full gas storage levels in Europe, which is also creating further bottlenecks, and this despite Russian pipeline gas being reduced significantly. If you look at the right hand side graph here, we are looking at the change in Europe's gas balance next year, and you can still see this 35 million tons of LNG equivalent gas going from Russia to Europe, there's a big uncertainty in market about whether these volumes will be coming to Europe next year. It's on the import terminals and it's also actually these days on the storage tanks, and this has resulted in a huge build up in ships tied up in floating storage, especially in Europe, but also other countries these days, because of the contango structure in the price curve where you can sell your cargos at a later date at a higher price than today. If you have all 13 ships, it's $900 million increase in the value of LNG carrier in a rather short period of time."
