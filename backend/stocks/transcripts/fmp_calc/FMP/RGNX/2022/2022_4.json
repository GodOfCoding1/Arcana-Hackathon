    "content": " Related to that, earlier this month, we presented initial data from a Phase I bridging study of RGX-314 using subretinal delivery where we evaluated wet AMD patients receiving RGX-314 manufactured by our NAVXpress platform process at the same dose level being used in the two pivotal trials. Now we've also progressed RGX-314 this year using suprachoroidal delivery for both wet AMD and diabetic retinopathy with positive interim data updates in the last quarter of 2022, supporting the emerging clinical profile and the potential of this in-office approach for a one-time gene therapy. Your line is open. I think we have outlined in our clinical trial design that in the first three to six months of assessments, we're going to see things that are more weighted toward early biomarker assessments and maybe certain types of imaging outcomes, I think some of the functional outcomes would be things that will be tracked in the study at time points closer to maybe nine or 12 months. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open."
