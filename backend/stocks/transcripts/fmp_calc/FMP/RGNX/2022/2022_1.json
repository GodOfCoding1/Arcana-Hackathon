    "content": " In wet AMD, we have presented six month data for the first two cohorts in our phase 2 AVA trial, demonstrating evidence of the emerging clinical profile of RGX-314 using Super choroidal delivery, with the most recent data from cohort 2 showing stable visual acuity and retinal thickness, as well as the 72% reduction in anti-VEGF treatment burden compared to the mean annualized injection rate during the 12 months prior to receiving RGX-314. We recently presented six month data from our phase 2 ALTITUDE trial at the angiogenesis conference in February, that demonstrated a clinically meaningful two step improvement from baseline on the DRFS scale after a single Super choroidal RGX-314 administration in 47% of the 15 treated patients in cohort 1 compared to 0% in the observational control. In fact, on that point, this week, we announced the summary of around 15 presentations at the ASGCT conference next week, which reflects leadership in areas such as evaluating our NAV vectors to identify and characterize more clinically relevant features and benefits, engineering novel capsid, enhancing AAV therapeutic tissue and cell type specificity and expression, including optimizations of enhancers and promoter combination, expertise in designing delivery device systems for use with AAV therapeutics, proof of concept research that informs the next step in our pipeline strategy, and innovative manufacturing process development and analytical capabilities. And the other finding of potential transgene immunogenicity, but we\u2019ve taken advantage of the learnings from that in our AAV8 program where clinically complement activation hasn\u2019t been as a real issue in the same way that has been seen with high dose AAV9 nevertheless out of an abundance of caution for our first in human study we\u2019re being very robust and how we look at this initially where for example, including complement inhibition, with Eculizumab just a short course as well as other typical immune suppression regimens to really cover for that aspect. When it comes to the profile of RGX-202 and the execution of the design, we\u2019d be looking to complete the initial cohorts of three patients, look at some of the primary safety evidence as well as the secondary endpoints that we\u2019ll be measuring such as micro dystrophin expression at about 90 days as well as, intermediate measures of things like functional outcomes, and imaging on the order of three months, six months and beyond. And to the extent that we see the same types of evidence that I think others have demonstrated, or can continue to demonstrate, with microdystrophin based AAV gene therapy, we believe that there could be a place in the market for patients who couldn\u2019t access because of pre-existing immune status, other types of products using AAV9 or other capsid, that would be able to access RGX-202 for instance, because of its differentiating immunological profile with AAV8. And then finally, on the manufacturing side, the emphasis today sort of lesson learned on the importance of having control over the quality as well as the control of the process itself here at our manufacturing facilities are of paramount importance and having control over that supply, being able to advance with our people, our processes, and with improvements to those processes that we plan to bring to our new facility as well we think that being a major contributor to supplying the market, and with higher yields processes, potentially having an advantage on cost to goods will be things that in addition to those early looks are meaningful, long term contribution to helping patients with Duchene and having a differentiated profile."
