    "content": "  Operator: Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the ManTech First Quarter Fiscal Year 2022 Earnings Conference Call. I would now like to turn the conference over to Stephen Vather, Vice President, Corporate Development and Investor Relations. During this call, we will make statements that do not address historical facts and thus are forward-looking statements made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. For a full discussion of these factors and other risks and uncertainties, please refer to the section entitled Risk Factors in our latest Form 10-K and our other SEC filings. On today's call, we will discuss some non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe provide useful information for investors. Our first quarter results were above our expectations and demonstrated solid execution particularly on revenue, EBITDA, cash flow and bookings. After the unique disruptions to our business in 2021, our Q1 results and the incrementally improving market environment give us reason to be cautiously optimistic about a return to more consistent execution for the balance of the year. Since our last call, FY '22 appropriations are enacted, which provides our customers with the necessary clarity to decisively execute on their priorities against clear funding levels. The turning and countering near-peer threats is receiving overwhelming bipartisan support, which is evident in the funding priorities in the FY '23 residential budget request. The recently provided FY '23 request calls for $773 billion for defense and $94 billion for intelligence, which represent increases of 4% and 9% over FY '22 enacted levels, respectively. More importantly than the top line numbers are the underlying demand signals for cyber, digital and systems modernization, Data at the Edge and automation. Furthermore, the current and proposed budget growth for the Navy, intelligence community and cyber across the federal government offer long-term tailwinds to our business. After extraordinary challenges over the last 8 quarters, whether from the pandemic with respect to our highly classified work, the rapid departure from Afghanistan, for more cautious behavior from customers from the last Continuing Resolution, the market environment appears to offer better clarity. As a team, we are focused on a return to delivering strong organic growth and making continued progress in retaining and recruiting highly cleared and highly skilled talent. We delivered strong performance to start the year, setting the foundation for continued steady execution throughout 2022. Revenue for the quarter was $676 million, reflecting 7% growth compared to Q1 of 2021. Furthermore, revenue growth was bolstered by contributions from our recent acquisitions. Q1 EBITDA was $66 million, up 7% year-over-year. Resulting EBITDA margin was 9.7%, which is flat compared to Q1 of 2021. Net income for the quarter was $31 million and diluted EPS was $0.76, both figures were down over Q1 2021 due to higher intangible amortization expense from our recent acquisitions. Adjusted net income was $37 million and adjusted diluted EPS was $0.89, both up 1% from Q1 of 2021. Cash flow from operations was $34 million dollars in the quarter, which represented 1.1 times net income and was driven by a strong DSO of 63 days, an improvement of 5 days from the fourth quarter 2021. At quarter end, the balance sheet showed $60 million in cash and $300 million of debt. On the capital deployment front, we distributed $17 million in dividends in Q1, maintaining a steady return of cash to shareholders. M&A remains our preferred capital deployment priority, and we are tracking potential targets that could be actionable over the next few quarters. Moving on to guidance, we're reiterating our previously communicated guidance across al measures. Just to refresh you on our expectations for 2022, our revenue guidance is $2.6 billion to $2.7 billion, representing 2% to 6% growth year-over-year. At the midpoint, we expect approximately 90% of our revenue to come from backlog with the balance largely coming from add-ons, modes and recompetes as well as a smaller contribution from new business. For margins, our guidance continues to assume and EBITDA margin of 9.6%. As a reminder, 2022 margins assumes the normalization of indirect spending and excludes nonrecurring tailwinds enjoyed in 2021. Turning to our bottom line, we continue to expect our adjusted net income to be in the range of $141.3 million to $148.5 million, with adjusted diluted EPS of $3.42 to $3.60. Finally, cash flow from operations is still expected to be at least $215 million with capital expenditures expected to be 1.5% of revenue for the year. In the quarter, we booked $464 million in contract awards resulting in a book-to-bill of approximately 0.7x. Bookings in the quarter were driven large line new business, which accounted for approximately 2/3 of the awards in the quarter. While I cannot comment on the specific nature of the awards further, this renewed moment is what backstops our belief that ManTech has a differentiated market position to capitalize on continued cyber demand over the long terms. Additionally in the quarter, we won a model-based system engineering OTA with the navy, which only further reinforces our long-term thesis around acquiring Gryphon. In Q1, we officially completed the integration of Gryphon and are now squarely folk leveraging the combined strength of our customer relationships and capabilities across the defense market. Our total backlog exiting Q1 was $10.3 billion, and funded backlog was $1.4 billion. We exited the quarter with approximately $6 billion in proposals outstanding, which has a healthy mix of new business and recompete opportunities. With the pandemic restrictions lifting, we are seeing our intelligence customers invite face-to-face interactions, a welcome change as we look forward to reaccelerating growth in a core market for us. Overall, we are pleased with progress to date in both the market environment and our performance. In closing, for over 50 years, we have prided ourselves on doing what is in the best interest of our nation and our customers. And for my follow-up, I was curious, you mentioned looking at some acquisitions that may be something over the next several quarters. So we're aware of opportunities coming and things that we are interested in, but it's probably going to be second half of the year. And valuations, I think we'll have to see what happens because it has been so quiet right now, but I don't see anything that's implying that valuations are going to drop meaningfully. I appreciate you obviously had the drawdown in the Middle East, I'm just curious how that's changed and how you expect it to continue changing from here. I think customer exposure a bit large, it's -- and the macro is still steady. So as I mentioned on the last call, our organic growth for the full year is expected to be negative mid-single digits in Q1 is in line with that. So look, it's going to be choppy. The FY '23 view is very positive, but we have to see how the actual execution of procurements and decisions move. I think a couple of things is that we're seeing incremental improvement, especially in the intelligence area. A lot of, I'd say, in terms of submissions, right, that has -- feels like that's really gotten close to normal back again in that area of the woods. But in terms of -- I think they're still not fully up to speed yet on the adjudication side, positive progress. So while we don't have a crystal ball to give you a prediction on the quarterlys, we are happy with the bookings in the first quarter, especially that's really in line with what we would view as a seasonally softer quarter and you had the CR that really covered the majority of Q1. And so with the $6 billion that we have in proposals outstanding, much of that is expected adjudications over the next several quarters. And as you heard in the remarks, right, with a healthy mix of new and recompete business. So excited about the trends, but obviously, we're still being conservative in terms of how we view. So when you speak about Ukraine, I think for us, the EUCOM support is really not a meaningful part of our portfolio. I mean that's a terrible situation, obviously. And so we obviously -- our hearts go out to the folks involved there, but in terms of that now. And the macro environment, from a budget perspective, I'll pass it over to Kevin if he's got any additional comments there. Look, directionally, bipartisan support for countering China, supporting Ukraine, you can see the shift in the federal budget drive in terms of more defense and intelligence. I think that, that's likely to stay for the foreseeable future. Again, I think we're pretty well positioned. But we need to see how it plays in terms of the final numbers, just like all of our industry to see where those money shift and where we're positioned to take them on to provide you a longer-term view of the upside in the business. But directionally, I think for all of our industry, the environment is getting better, not worse, which is the key takeaway. I was hoping maybe, Judy, you mentioned in the prepared remarks that ODCs were a little higher I assume than expected, there was a pull forward or something. And then just to your point on this is sort of the run rate, obviously, you take $675 million, multiply times 4, you get to $2.7 billion. Is there anything that maybe is rolling off that's dampening what should be, I think, a seasonally better Q2 and Q3 just based on seasonality. And then DL was running a little bit higher than we expected just from, I think, higher utilization rates. We did I have -- I think we talked about it at the year-end call, there was a little bit of runoff in some of the Department of State work in the beginning of Q2, but it was really nominal. In Q1, the whole country was  with COVID in January, did that -- I'm surprised DL was as strong as it was in the first quarter. We had a little bit in the beginning of January, but I think we recovered well. It was definitely in December, but January was kind of after the first week or so was kind of back to business as usual. I'm just curious how you're...\n Gautam, it's Kevin. I think that we're all focused on how that funding will be spent I hope that for '23, it looks like a regular order, we'll start playing a little bit just to be responsive to the global needs I would just say it will be sporting. And then just lastly, you guys have talked about 90% of the sales visibility and backlog. And I think the total of this year into next year, it's kind of that normal 20%, 25%. Anything worth like 5% of sales or...\n No, none of our contracts are greater than 5%. I think on the appropriation side, as well as the authorization, there's more rapid movement and trying to get towards decisions and conclusion in both sides of the aisle. I think it will be quicker than this year, but we don't know how it's going to play against the overall election season. So in my head, it's going to be December, January time frame, but we'll have to see how it plays out. I would say there's more urgency on getting something done, just based on the global environment, but still recognizing that there's other factors at play. In terms of the market, it's competitive. But again, because we see things like our glassdoor ratings are solid and all the other programs that we're doing from a hiring perspective, I'd say in the macro, right, the environment has always been competitive. Thanks, Olivia, and thank you all for joining us on today's call and for your interest in ManTech. As usual, the senior team and I will be available for any follow-up questions you might have. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference."
