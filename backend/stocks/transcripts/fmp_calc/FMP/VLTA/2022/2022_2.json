    "content": " During the second quarter, Voltas revenue was a record $15.3 million, an 83% increase over just last quarter and a 121% increase over the second quarter of 2021. The collaboration will also enable Kroger Precision Marketing, Kroger's Retail Media Network to sell Volta\u00e2\u0080\u0099s media inventory to its clients, unlocking another source of revenue for Volta and highlighting the power of Volta's combined charging and media model to other retailers with advertising offerings. For the second quarter, we delivered above our outlook range for revenue with Q2 revenue growing 83% from our first quarter of 2022 and 121% year-over-year to $15.3 million. And we believe that we're uniquely positioned to garner more than our fair share of the revenue that's going to be available, or I should say the dollars that are going to be available, which are going to be important, not just for Bolsa to be able to accelerate our deployments, but also for the industry to accelerate deployments and help meet the goals of the administration's $500,000 public charger target. We are speaking with a number of high-caliber individuals, and we're not going to settle for anyone who isn't exceptional because the rest of the management team that I showed in my last slide, if you look at -- if you spend a little bit of time looking at the background of that team, it's an exceptional team, and we do think Volta clearly has the winning strategy. And I think if you look at kind of the numbers that we put in the DAC that we sent out, which today is, I believe, around just over 5,400 screens on our network layer on our guidance for full year with the idea that there's very close to 2:1 correlation between the STAL and media screens."
