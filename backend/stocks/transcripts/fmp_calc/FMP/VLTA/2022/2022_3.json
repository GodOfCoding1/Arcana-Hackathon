    "content": " While our pace of installation is still one of the best in the industry, this quarter saw fewer total stalls installed due to management's decision to preserve our very limited capital during our ongoing capital raising process in response to current market conditions and in part due to the attractive investment tax credits, which become available at the beginning of next year under the inflation reduction. And before I go any further, I'd like to address how we're thinking about Volta's revenue in the context of the market conditions many other advertising power businesses have discussed on recent earnings calls. Volta's media powered model generates revenue regardless of how many EVs are charged allowing us to construct chargers in disadvantaged communities, where EV ownership may be lagging and making Volta particularly competitive for these federal grants. Volta's dedicated charging solutions team continues to use our award-winning PredictEV infrastructure planning software to evaluate which of the nearly 8,000 EV stalls in our assigned construction and technical evaluation pipeline best satisfy the government's requirements. By analyzing multiple data sources, including local economic and equity data aligned with the administration's Justice for initiative, PredictEV can identify locations that will simultaneously be competitive for community, government brands and valuable for Volta's media business. So on your slide, the $96 million of CWIP, it sounds from the discussion like that's not necessarily partially installed physical equipment on the ground but could be capitalized permitting, engineering and other costs such that -- and I'm trying to get a sense of how close are you in terms of just a little bit additional capital to having a slew of additional revenue-generating stalls."
