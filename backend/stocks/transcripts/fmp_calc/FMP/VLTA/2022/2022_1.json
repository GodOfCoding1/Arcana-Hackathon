    "content": " This call is being broadcast over the web and can be accessed on the Investors section of our website at investors.voltacharging.com With me from Volta on today's call is Brandt Hastings, Interim CEO and Chief Revenue Officer; Francois Chadwick, Chief Financial Officer; and Drew Bennett, Executive Vice President, Network Operations. At a mature scale, we would expect our media revenue to achieve $23,000 per stall or $11,500 per screen, as we generally have two screens per stalls, which is a 77% increase from current levels due to the three leverage items just discussed. Our forecasted maturity, we modeled that our charging revenue at Volta ought to achieve approximately $2,000 to $3,500 per AC stalls and $10,000 to $12,000 per DC stalls for electricity paid for by the drivers and idle fees. We've always said that this is not -- we're not -- we are one of the companies that the revenue from day one based on our business model, but a good indication of where we are sited right now on where we could say, 25% of our current sites are looking to be in that one-mile corridor."
