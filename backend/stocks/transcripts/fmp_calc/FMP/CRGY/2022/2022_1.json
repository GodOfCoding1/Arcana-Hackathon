    "content": " To reflect today's commodity prices, we've revised our 2022 guidance to $1.35 billion of adjusted EBITDA and $575 million of leverage free cash flow at the midpoint, assuming $100 WTI and $6 Henry Hub. Consistent with our commitment to return cash to shareholders and in the context of closing the Uinta acquisition, today we declared $0.17 per share dividend payable on the second quarter, representing 40% increase to last quarter's dividend. Consistent with our dividend framework of 10% of adjusted EBITDA, we intend to pay $0.17 per share quarterly for the remainder of the year, generating an attractive 4% yield based on recent trading price. For the first quarter of 2022, we produced 120 net MBoe per day in-line with our previous guidance, excluding Uinta, and generated $195 million of adjusted EBITDAX and $89 million of leverage-free cash flow. So, I'd say no intention to increase our base dividend for the balance of the year and we plan to use incremental or the incremental free cash flow that we're generating at these higher prices for you to pay down debt or selectively pursue acquisitions that expect to pay out at that $0.17 per share per quarter for the remainder of the year, which as a reminder, was a 40% increase versus Q1."
