    "content": " Going forward, we expect our capital spend to be fairly flat quarter-over-quarter, while well completions in the fourth quarter will decrease ahead of increased completion activity in the first half of 2023.Across the A&D market we remain on pace to evaluate north of 150 transactions this year and would characterize the past two quarters as a more challenging period to be a buyer across the sector. Additionally, we have continued to see sustained inflationary pressures across our operating cost structure, approximately 10% year-to-date, primarily due to increase maintenance and commodity link costs, but also due to high returning elective work over activity, as well as non-recurring expenses related to our recent acquisitions and merger with Contango."
