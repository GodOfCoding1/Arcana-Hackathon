    "content": " Looking at the balance sheet, our substantial free cash flow generation allowed us to reduce approximately $300 million of net debt subsequent to closing the highly accretive Uinta Basin acquisition in the first quarter of 2022, and today, our leverage ratio is 1 times in line with our long-term target. Our capital structure with an aggregate bond complex of over $1 billion, coupled with increased business scale, access to the equity markets and consistent business execution has been recognized by the rating agencies with an upgrade from Moody\u00e2\u0080\u0099s and a positive outlook from S&P earlier this year. Turning to 2023, we remain focused on adhering to the disciplined strategy that we have pursued for over a decade in the private and public markets; one, generate significant free cash flow; two, exercise prudent risk management; and three, produce attractive returns on the capital we choose to invest."
