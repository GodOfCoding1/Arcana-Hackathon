    "content": " In Q4, 2022, NIO delivered a total of 40,052 smart electric vehicles, up 60% year-over-year, achieving a new quarterly record. Vehicle sales in the fourth quarter were RMB 14.8 billion, representing an increase of 16.2% year-over-year and 23.7% quarter-over-quarter. The decrease of vehicle margin year-over-year was mainly attributed to: first, increased inventory provisions, accelerated depreciation on production facilities and the losses on purchase commitments for the existing generation of ES8, ES6, NC6 but are expected to have lower production levels and deliveries due to the transition to new models on the NIO technology platform 2.0, which in totality elected impacted vehicle margin by 6.7%; and second, increased battery cost per unit. The increase in SG&A expenses year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter was primarily due to: first, the increase in percent costs related to sales and general corporate functions; second, the increase in marketing and promotion activities to promote our vehicles in China and Europe. Net loss attributable to NIO's ordinary shareholders in the fourth quarter was RMB 5.8 billion, representing an increase of 168.3% year-over-year and 41.2% quarter-over-quarter. For the first quarter of this year, we believe that we're going to face more pressure on the vehicle gross margin, considering the overall situation, because this is a transitional period for the company when it comes to the vehicle sales because we are transitioning into a new technology platform for our product portfolio to the NT2.0."
