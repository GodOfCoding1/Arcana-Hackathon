    "date": "2023-02-07 14:32:06",
    "content": " We will also make forward-looking statements this morning on our call with respect to demand, product development and capital expenditure plans, production levels, engineering expense, exchange rates, pricing, share repurchases, dividends, interest rates, future commodity prices, crop production, supply chain disruption, inflation, component delivery, sales, margins, earnings, cash flow, tax rates and other financial metrics. In South America, net sales in the fourth quarter grew approximately 58% year-over-year, excluding favorable currency translation, driven by significant pricing as well as increased volume and positive mix. Operating margins are expected to improve to around 10.5%, driven by higher sales and production, favorable pricing, net of material cost, and improved factory productivity, partially offset by increased investments in our engineering and digital initiatives as well as inflationary cost pressures. You may now go ahead. You may now go ahead. You may now go ahead. You may now go ahead. You may now go ahead. You may now go ahead. You may now go ahead. You may now go ahead. You may now go ahead. You may now go ahead. Again, I have to say, Nicole again, similar to the prop margin, Q2, again, given the cyber event, you might see a little bit of above traditional and then Q4 is we had a very strong quarter here sort of outpacing our own expectations that you might see a little bit of a less, smaller sort of year-over-year change relative to Q1 and Q3, but nothing significant."
