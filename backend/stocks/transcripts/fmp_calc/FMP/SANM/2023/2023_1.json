    "content": " Non-GAAP fully diluted earnings per share grew approximately 9% to $1.64 compared to $1.50 in the prior quarter, and exceeded the upper end of our outlook of $1.41 to $1.51 by $0.13. Q1 IMS revenue increased to $1.94 billion, an increase of 7.7% over the prior quarter, primarily due to strong customer demand and continued improvements in the supply chain. For Industrial, Medical, Defense and Automotive segments, we delivered a revenue of $1.345 billion, which was quarter-over-quarter growth of 4.5% and year-over-year, 27.5%. For Communication Networks & Cloud Infrastructure, we delivered $1.016 billion, which was quarter-over-quarter growth of 11% and year-over-year, 44.6%. So, in summary, as you heard from both Kurt and I, we delivered a strong quarter, with solid execution, revenue of $2.36 billion, growth of 7.2% quarter-over-quarter and growth of 34.4% year-over-year. And we delivered a non-GAAP diluted EPS of $1.64, growth of 9.5% quarter-over-quarter and 52.7% year-over-year. For second quarter, we are forecasting, again, strong revenue outlook of $2.2 billion to $2.3 billion, typically this is seasonally down quarter for us, but the demand is strong and backlog is strong."
