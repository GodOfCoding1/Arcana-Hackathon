    "content": " And one of the things that has helped Sanmina, it looks like is even though in fiscal '22, you grew revenue 17% year-on-year, but OpEx only grew less than 2%, like 1.7%, essentially, you kept it flat at $239 million of OpEx. And so I think we're going to just take one quarter at a time here, but we do feel good about the business, and we do see strong customer demand that's very broad-based at this point. And if we look at our forecast from our key customers, they look good for '23 and new programs that we have that we already want that we're basically waiting for equipment to install for the growth, and we'll be spending few more extra bucks for -- that we are investing for the growth. I mean, look, I think as Jure talked about -- last year CapEx is about $130 million this quarter we're forecasting about $50 million."
