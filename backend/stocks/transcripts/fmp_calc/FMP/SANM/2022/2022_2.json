    "content": " Non-GAAP gross margin was 8.1% compared to 8.5% in the prior quarter, primarily due to higher direct material costs, as well as the impact of annual salary increases, the annual resetting of employer portion of payroll tax and no benefit in the second fiscal quarter for a holiday shutdown. Your line is open. So, I was just curious if I misunderstood that or if you can just clarify how you should think about the revenue growth because the 40% of the midpoint is like $750 million, which is slightly lower than the $757 million you reported in the second quarter. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open."
