    "content": " On the heels of these positive data, we enrolled our first patients in two separate Phase 2 clinical trials of EYP1901, one for the treatment of wet age-related macular degeneration called DAVIO 2 and one studying the drug at non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy called the PAVIA study. The DAVIO 2 trial is expected to enroll approximately 150 wet AMD patients previously treated with a standard of care anti-VEGF therapy and randomly assigned to one of two doses of EYP-1901, approximately 2 milligrams or approximately 3 milligrams versus an on-label aflibercept control. Operating expenses for the third quarter ended September 30, 2022 totaled 28.4 million versus 24.4 million in the prior year period, primarily driven by an investment in personnel across the organization, including non-cash stock compensation and ongoing clinical trial and development costs for EYP-1901.
