    "content": " Just 18 months after we began our trial, we have disclosed positive 12-month data have aligned with the \u00e2\u0080\u0093 FDA for our Phase 2 trial and now dosed the first patient in our Phase 2 DAVIO 2 clinical trial for wet AMD. We discussed the incredible science behind EyePoint\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Durasert drug delivery platform, clinical results, and Phase 2 plans for EYP-1901 and gave a commercial update on YUTIQ, fluocinolone acetonide intravitreal implant, for the treatment of chronic non-infectious uveitis affecting the posterior segment of the eye. The trial is expected to enroll approximately 150 wet AMD patients, previously treated with standard-of-care anti-VEGF therapy and randomly assigned to one of two doses of EYP-1901, approximately 2 milligrams or approximately 3 milligrams. The PAVIO trial is a 12-month randomized, controlled Phase 2 trial of EYP-1901 for NPDR, which is expected to enroll approximately 105 patients, randomly assigned to one of two doses of EYP-1901. Operating expenses for the second quarter ended June 30th, 2022, totaled $30.8 million versus $20 million in the prior year period, primarily driven by an increase in R&D spending, including clinical trial costs for EYP-1901 and investment in personnel across the organization and non-cash stock-based compensation.
