    "content": " A new mechanism of action to treating retinal eye diseases beyond the current anti-VEGF ligand blockers on the market today through potential for neuroprotective and anti-fibrotic benefits to the retina, a proven drug delivery technology with a very positive safety profile, and upon completion of our Phase 2 trials and importantly, the EYP-1901 will have the most robust clinical data for any ocular TKI program with over 180 patients having been dosed by the end of our Phase 2 programs in both wet AMD and NPDR. On the heels of these positive data, we initiated two separate Phase 2 clinical trials of EYP-1901, one for the treatment of wet age-related macular degeneration called DAVIO 2 and one studying the drug in non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy or NPDR, called the PAVIA study. Our Q4 net product revenue for YUTIQ was 9 million compared to 5.8 million for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2021, a 55% increase. Net Revenue from royalties and collaborations for the quarter ended December 31, 2022, totaled 0.6 million compared 0.3 million in the corresponding period in 2021.
