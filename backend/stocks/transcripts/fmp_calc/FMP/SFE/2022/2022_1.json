This quarter's results were primarily impacted by the continued decline in the fair value of Bright Health stock, resulting in a non-cash and unrealized loss of Bright Health stock of $2 million. We -- during the quarter, we have continued with our open market purchases announced last quarter, resulting in the purchase of 148,000 shares during the quarter at $5.27 per share and an additional $0.4 million worth of shares at an average price of about $4.71 per share, subsequent to the quarter-end. Corporate expenses for the quarter, which represent general and administrative expenses, excluding stock-based compensation, severance expenses and nonrecurring and other items were $0.8 million as compared to $1.2 million in the comparable quarter of 2021, a 29% decline. This quarter's decrease in equity method loss is primarily the result of having two less companies in 2022 and a lower level of losses at several companies due to a variety of events, as well as limiting the recognition of losses in a couple of cases where when our carrying value is reduced to zero."
