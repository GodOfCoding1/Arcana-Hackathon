    "content": " Please remember that from the implied enterprise values that are calculated using revenue multiples, we subtract out net debt for each of our portfolio companies and then run the remaining proceeds through a waterfall for each company that reflects its specific capital stack, options, management carve-outs, if any, deal fees, et cetera, to arrive at what Safeguard's stake could be worth. The Safeguard's net loss for the quarter ended September 30, 2020, was $3.2 million or $0.19 per share as compared to net income for 2021's third quarter of $18.3 million or $0.88 per share."
