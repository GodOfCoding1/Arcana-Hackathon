    "content": " Pioneer's strong execution continued during the first quarter, with total production in the upper half of our guidance range supporting significant free cash flow generation of $2.3 billion. As seen on the graph, if oil prices were to average $60 for the remainder of the year, Pioneer's shareholders would receive approximately $17 in dividends per share. For example, Pioneer's 5-year cumulative free cash flow, in combination with 5% oil growth, is forecasted to exceed over $30 billion at current strip prices, and current strip prices that are dropping about $35 from the current price over the next 5 years. That's really the key things that we're focused on as we think about '23 and the program, but it hasn't changed our thought process in terms of growing at around 5% for 2023. We've got -- I think we've talked about 1,000 locations that we've identified and clearly with land trades and small acquisitions of incremental working interest or just extensions to our acreage out there, we're hoping to continue to add to that because it's the capital efficiency of getting that 15% reduction in drilling and completion costs on a per foot basis is important."
