    "content": " Today, we will discuss the strong fourth quarter and full year 2022 results that Pioneer delivered, which resulted in the record 30% return on capital employed and the generation of over $8 billion in free cash flow. These strong results supported highly attractive free cash flow generation, which we returned greater than 95% of free cash flow to shareholders through our $26 per share in dividends and $1.65 billion in share repurchases. Turning to Slide 4, during the fourth quarter, Pioneer generated $1.7 billion in free cash flow, bringing yearly free cash flow to $8.4 billion, of which we returned approximately $8 billion through dividends and share repurchases throughout the year. Consistent with my commentary last quarter, our drilling completions and facilities capital budget of $4.45 billion to $4.75 billion reflects approximately 10% inflation and two incremental rigs which help support our annual production growth targets. Based on the midpoints of our capital and production ranges at strip pricing, we expect to generate greater than $4 billion of free cash flow in 2023 from approximately $9 billion of projected operating cash flow. This combination resulted in 2023 corporate maintenance breakeven WTI oil price of $39 a barrel, which includes the impacts of the 10% inflation that I talked about earlier and estimated cash taxes that are forecasted to be in that mid to high teens of book income for the year."
