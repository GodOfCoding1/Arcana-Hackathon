    "content": " Pioneer's strong execution continued during the third quarter, with both oil and total production in the upper half of our guidance range, driving substantial free cash flow generation of greater than $1.7 billion. I mean, basically, it means every well in the program we've got a higher bar and it's going to increase our program productivity, it's going to increase our annual capital efficiency and result in higher free cash flow generation from that program into 2023. As we look at 2023, and that's going to put our -- it's still early and we're still working on, but growth in that mid 0% to 5% range is where I kind of say given where we're at today. So there \u00e2\u0080\u0093 yes to a small extent, but overall, I think you'll see that, the new programs going forward are going to be more capital efficient than we were in 2022, and which is the objective and higher productivity and better free cash flow generation. And going into 2023, we're going to drill just wells that have higher productivity and higher rates of return, and that's really just what we're charged with from a capital allocation standpoint to make happen. Yes, Arun, I guess just -- like I said in the last question, it's really -- we've made a meaningful impact to increase them, and that threshold is really what we're building our 2023 and subsequent year programs on. So, yes, as I mentioned, I think there's definitely -- we're going to go to locations in areas that have the highest rates of return, and that will move to a certain extent a little bit north. Like I said earlier, the spacing on the wells anywhere, it's just going to those higher productivity areas that were -- and therefore, has higher rates of return that we're targeting."
