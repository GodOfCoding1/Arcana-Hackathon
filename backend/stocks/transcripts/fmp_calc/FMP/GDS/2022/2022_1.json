    "content": " In 1Q 2022, we booked 18,000 square meters of new commitments including three hyperscale orders; two came from the existing cloud and the large internet customers, and the remaining one came from a new financial institution customer. One question from me is that in terms of the overseas market, especially in Southeast Asia, in the longer term, say, five to 10 years, how big of a potential market do you think it could be versus the domestic China market, and what kind of growth rate can we expect from our projects and presence there. Firstly just to remind, we gave CapEx guidance a couple of months ago in the previous quarterly earnings of RMB12 billion for this year, and in the script I gave a breakdown, saying that it would be RMB8 billion organic, which RMB 6 billion was in China and RMB 2 billion is in Hong Kong and Southeast Asia, RMB 6 billion in Mainland China and RMB 2 billion in Hong Kong and Southeast Asia."
