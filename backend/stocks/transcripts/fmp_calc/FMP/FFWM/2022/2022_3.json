    "content": " Credit metrics remained strong in all our loan portfolios, the allowance for credit losses for loans decreased by $265,000 in the quarter to $232.9 million, primarily as a result of the release of specific reserves related to purchased credit deteriorated loans from prior acquisitions, offset by increased loan balances. The net interest margin declined 8 basis points to 3.1% in the quarter, with the unprecedented increases in interest rates our cost of deposits increased 36 basis points to 0.64% while our average loan yield increased 21 basis points to 4.07%. Contributing to loan originations during the quarter, our commercial business division funded $688 million of new commercial loans during the third quarter, of which 45% were adjustable commercial revolving lines of credit. We are going to have an emphasis on commercial loan growth, at least in the foreseeable future, the majority of that will be in variable rate SOFR-based part of the issues we face and the income property channel is when we're originating at 4.5, that seems like a good rate until the Fed increases, and then 5.5 seems like a good rate until the Fed increases. So I think that both did well -- for rents on multifamily, do we think that they're going to moderate, yes, because there's got to be a tipping point that rents can't continue to go up at the same time that costs for food and other things are going up as precipitously as they are."
