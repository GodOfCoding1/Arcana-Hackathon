    "content": " First, I'll discuss the highlights of our fourth quarter and full year 2022 results, followed by Chris Naghibi, our newly appointed Chief Operating Officer, who will discuss our loan and deposit business. We generated $81.9 million in revenue and $17.4 million in earnings for the quarter and $366.9 million in revenue and $110.5 million in earnings for the full year, while our adjusted return on average assets ended the quarter at 0.63% and 1% for the full year. Thank you for the kind words, Scott, and let me be the first say that I'm honored to have been appointed Chief Operating Officer Loan originations were $849 million for the quarter and $5.8 billion for the full year. And as a result of that, just by Rick speaking to these 20 individuals, and it was really about what the economy is doing his typical what he would do with any client or a group of people talking about what the Fed is doing, what's happening in the economic cycle, etcetera, etcetera, generated something like $8 million to $10 million of new deposits, which is not even what you would expect to happen and he got additional dollars for First Foundation Advisors. Including noninterest-bearing, it was 147. Including noninterest-bearing, it was 147. So let's just call it, $2 billion I think I recall after pulling kind of your prepay and payoff activity recently, it kind of implies net loan growth of about 10%, call it, 10, 11, 12."
