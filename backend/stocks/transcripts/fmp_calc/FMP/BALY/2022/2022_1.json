    "content": " For the full year, we expect revenue to be at the low end of our previously announced guidance of $2.4 billion to $2.5 billion due primarily to FX and some slowdown in the U.K. Our EBITDA guidance remains the same in the range of $560 million to $580 million with efficiencies offsetting the slowdown in the U.K. Our capital expenditure guidance remains the same with $180 million of property related CapEx, $60 million of Interactive CapEx and $30 million of one-time corporate integration CapEx."
