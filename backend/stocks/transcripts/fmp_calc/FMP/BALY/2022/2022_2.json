    "content": " And the property is projected to deliver at least $50 million of EBITDAR in the first year of opening, not counting any benefits to Bally's Interactive. At current FX rates, we expect revenue to be $2.2 billion to $2.3 billion and adjusted EBITDA to be $535 million to $550 million, including $60 million of North America Interactive EBITDA losses. So on Tropicana, the way we're viewing the property as is today is the rent associated with it is $22.5 million and it will generate $20 million to $25 million of EBITDAR, so earnings neutral. Atlantic City, we do believe, we will get to $10 million to $20 million in the next two years very seasonal properties. So, you go into 2023, rent is sort of $120 million on 400 plus of EBITDAR when you factor in Tropicana upside from Kansas City, IGT, Pennsylvania, Chicago."
