    "content": " We will execute on building the $1.7 billion Bally's Chicago, which will be game changing for us in 2026. International Interactive started slow in the first quarter of 2022, but after the marketing and jackpot optimizations we executed, the UK business has been strong, growing 12% in the fourth quarter well ahead of the market. As a company we will prioritize, we'll prioritize the opening of the Chicago temp on time and on budget, growing North America Interactive in a profitable way, our omni-channel data capabilities, sports for markets outside of North America and taking Bally's global. As far as what you're referring to, the unique thing that's happened is, since COVID we've seen the 65 plus customer not responding as quickly as pre-COVID 2019 and we've, at the same time, we've focused on a little bit more strategy geared towards the table game customer, so that tends to skew our demographic younger. We focus heavily on the table games market and we've seen a lot of success, which accounts for a lot of our growth in our newer, the newer assets that we've acquired and also we are focused a little bit more on the Asian demographic. And we're more focused on providing the amenities that the higher end customers want, and that's starting to not only skew visitations to the upside, but also the size of the wallet. So well, for one thing for sure is, we're not interested in duplicating other people's mistakes, and we have a long-term opportunity view on this investment, and we're going to be patient about looking for the right project with the appropriate return for that market."
