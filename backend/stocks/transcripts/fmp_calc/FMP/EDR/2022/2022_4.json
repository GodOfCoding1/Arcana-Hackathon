    "content": " The fourth quarter of the prior year included $332.8 million of revenues from the restricted Endeavor content business, which we sold in January of 2022. Excluding revenues related to this business, consolidated revenues would've been up $87.7 million or 7%. The fourth quarter of the prior year included $4.3 million of adjusted EBITDA from the restricted Endeavor content business, as well as the benefit of $26.1 million of insurance recoveries related to events from earlier in the year as well as 2020. For the full year revenue was $5.268 billion, up $190.4 million year-over-year or 4%, and adjust EBITDA was $1.164 billion, up $283.2 million year-over-year, or 32%. Excluding revenues related to that business, consolidated revenues would've been up $927.8 million or 21%. Our own sports property segment generated revenue of $301.4 million in the fourth quarter up $24.1 million or 9%, while the segment adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $142.4 million, up $17.3 million or 14%. On the year, the segment generated $1.3 billion in revenue, up $224.1 million or 20%, and $648.2 million of adjusted EBITDA up $110.5 million or 21%. The segment recorded revenue of $557.7 million in the quarter, up $41 million or 8% an adjusted EBITDA $52.4 million, down $2.4 million or 4%. On the year, segment revenue was $2.5 million, up $420.7 million or 21%. For the full year, representation segment revenue was $1.5 billion, down $447.6 million or 23%. Excluding that, segment revenues would've been up $289.8 million or 24%, and segment adjusted EBITDA would've been up $99.7 million, or nearly 27%. As we said previously, we believe our company's results are best evaluated on a full year basis, given quarterly fluctuations related to the timing of events, content deliveries, sales cycles within our immediate and gaming businesses, as well as business transactions. On behalf of our clients and brands,  We expect consolidated revenue for the year to be between $5.825 billion and $5.975 billion or 12% growth at the midpoint of the range. On adjusted EBITDA, we are expecting a range of $1.25 billion to $1.305 billion, or 10% growth at the midpoint of the range, implying approximately 22% margin on the year. We expect free cash flow between $545 billion to $605 million or a midpoint of $575 million, representing 62% growth over last year. At the time of the announced acquisition, we provided full year 2022 revenue projections of $340 million for the combined businesses. You may now proceed. You may now proceed. You may now proceed. You may now proceed. You may now proceed. I assume that's perhaps across fashion, sports, comedy and music, but I'm not sure we on the outside might have a view on the industry content spend environment overall, but maybe we're a little bit less clear on what the growth trajectory of the rest of the 50% of the business looks like. You may now proceed. You may now proceed. You may now proceed. You may now proceed."
