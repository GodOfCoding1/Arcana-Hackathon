The prior year included $26.5 million of adjusted EBITDA from the restricted Endeavor Content business. Our Owned Sports Properties segment generated revenue of $402.3 million in the third quarter, up $113.8 million or 39%, while the segment\u00e2\u0080\u0099s adjusted EBITDA was $195.7 million, up $61 million or 45%. Now turning to Events, Experiences & Rights, the segment recorded revenue of $440.6 million in the quarter, down $5.7 million or roughly 1% and adjusted EBITDA of $49.7 million, down $35.3 million or nearly 42%. The prior year included $26.5 million of adjusted EBITDA from the restricted Endeavor Content business. Moving on to our updated 2022 outlook, we are tightening our revenue guidance range to be between $5.235 billion and $5.325 billion, which is $5.28 billion at the midpoint, representing year-over-year revenue growth of 21%, excluding the restricted Endeavor Content business. In addition, we are raising our adjusted EBITDA guidance range from $1.145 billion and $1.175 billion, which is $1.16 billion at the midpoint, up $10 million from the midpoint of our prior range, representing expected year-over-year adjusted EBITDA growth of 32%. Our updated guidance incorporates the following considerations: our high degree of visibility into revenue for the balance of the year, the continued adverse impact of FX, the delayed timing of content deliveries within our non-scripted business, the earlier than anticipated sales of the Miss Universe organization and our ongoing cost discipline.
