    "content": " The previously mentioned FX, which primarily impacts our E&R segment, the disposition of Diamond Baseball Holdings which we expect to close in the fourth quarter, the acquisition of Barrett-Jackson which we expect will have a negative impact on 2022 due to the timing of their events, revised timing of the OpenBet\u00e2\u0080\u0099s close which we now expect at the end of the third quarter resulting in reduced contribution to the full year, the shift of clients, sponsorships and event related revenue and adjusted EBITDA, the increased investment in on location to IOC initiatives driven by incremental technology and marketing spends, and the impact of COVID restrictions in China, most notably the cancellation of the WGC HSBC Golf Events. That being said, incorporated into our updated revenue and adjusted EBITDA ranges are among other things, the following: The impact of foreign exchange, primarily in our EE&R business segment, which is adverse to revenues as well, be it a much lower base as to adjusted EBITDA; the shift in the timing of our OpenBet closing, which reduces its revenue and adjusted EBITDA contribution; the removal of Diamond Baseball Holdings revenue and adjusted EBITDA, assuming a closing later this year; the inclusion of the recently announced Barrett-Jackson acquisition, the results which is loss making, slightly loss-making for the balance of the year given the timing of the events; some timing shifts of client sponsorship and event-related revenues associated with adjusted EBITDA."
