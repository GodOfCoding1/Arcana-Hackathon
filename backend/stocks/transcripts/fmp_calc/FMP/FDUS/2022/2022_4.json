    "content": " Total investment income was $27.5 million for the three months ended December 31, a $2.5 million increase from Q3 primarily due to a $2.8 million increase in interest income, including PIK, and a $0.5 million increase in interest income on the excess cash, partially offset by a $0.4 million decrease in fee income and a $0.4 million decrease in dividend income. Total expenses, including income tax provision, were $15 million for the fourth quarter, $2.7 million higher than Q3, driven primarily by a $1.4 million increase in income taxes related to the annual excise tax accrual, a $0.6 million increase in professional fees related to the ATM program and timing of 2022 audit and tax compliance billings, a $0.4 million increase in the capital gains fee accrual and a $0.2 million increase in interest expense related to incremental SBA debentures outstanding. For the three months ended December 31, we recognized approximately $0.4 million of net realized gains related to the sale of our equity investments in Midwest Transit Equipment and Ohio Medical Corporation, offset by partial losses on the exit of our debt investments in  and former investment in Hilco Plastics Holdings."
