    "content": " Canada and the U.S. were particularly strong, as we benefited from a longer field season in Canada due to  and typical weather and building momentum in the U.S. where several business units achieved over 20% organic growth for the quarter. In 2023, we're targeting an adjusted EBITDA margin between 16% and 17%, and our goal is to deliver adjusted EPS growth between 9% and 13% over 2022. One moment for our next question. One moment for our next question. One moment for our next question. One moment for our next question. But we don't see that sort of approaching double-digit mid -- sort of high to single to double-digit growth like we see in the U.S. Canada is going to have a good year, but it will -- but from our perspective, we don't think it will be as strong as the U.S. will be. One moment for our next question."
