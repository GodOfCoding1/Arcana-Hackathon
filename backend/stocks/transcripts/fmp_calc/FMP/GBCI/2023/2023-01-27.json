    "content": " After growing for three quarters, our deposits declined by $1.3 billion, with the largest decline occurring in those accounts with an average balance of $3 million or greater. Core deposit funding of $21 billion, or almost 90% of total funding liabilities, ended the quarter at a cost of only 8 basis points versus 6 basis points in the prior quarter. Our total cost of funding in the quarter for total funding liabilities of $24 billion, including noninterest-bearing deposits, increased from 15 basis points in the prior quarter to a total cost of funding of 35 basis points in the current quarter. So, I would say, if you took the 2.5% guide, you'd be at $138 million for the first quarter -- $136 million to $138 million, and then it will slowly migrate up from there as we make investments back in our company. If I look at, say, you had $519 million in total expenses in '22, if I look at full year, let's strip out the seasonality, with a good growth rate for '23, is it that, like you said, 2.5% to 3% off of a $519 million base? So, I would estimate the range would be, say, $545 million to $555 million, somewhere in that range for the full year, and then that will -- again, we're going to run higher as we traditionally do in the first quarter, and then we go lower from there."
