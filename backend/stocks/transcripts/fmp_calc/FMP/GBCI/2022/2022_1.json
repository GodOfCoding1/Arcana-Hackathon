I know, this is a tough question, but just trying to get given your growth, call it 12% or, double digit any thoughts on provisioning level as we transition through the year, a lot can change, but just trying to get a sense for 7 million in the quarter. Your line is open. And as I've said on prior calls, our pricing competition seems to be more intense in the larger metro areas versus the more rural markets, which are able to set the prices a lot better with less competition, which is why I think we're able to have our average production yield, as Randy mentioned, at 420, which seems to be pretty strong and show some strong growth in the third quarter. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open."
