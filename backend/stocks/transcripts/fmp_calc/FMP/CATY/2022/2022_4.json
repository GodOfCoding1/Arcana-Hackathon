    "content": " This afternoon, we reported net income of $97.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2022, a 29.6% increase as compared to a net income of $75.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2021. In the fourth quarter of 2022, our gross loans increased $147.2 million or 3.6% as annualized. The increase in loans for the fourth quarter of 2022 was primarily driven by increases of $116 million or 5.3% annualized in commercial real estate loans, $122.3 million or 9.5% annualized in residential mortgage loans. For the fourth quarter of 2022, we reported net charge-offs of $2.5 million, which included $2 million that were fully reserved as of September 30, 2022 compared to net charge-offs of $0.6 million in the third quarter of 2022. Our non-accrual loans were 0.38% of total loans as of December 31, 2022 increased by $3 million to $68.9 million as compared to the end of the third quarter of 2022.

For the fourth quarter of 2022, net income increased by $22.3 million or 29.6% to $97.6 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2021. Our non-interest income during the fourth quarter of 2022 decreased by $7.7 million to $12.1 million when compared to the fourth quarter of 2021 due to an increase of $3.2 million in loss on equity securities, a decrease of $3.1 million and the gain on venture capital investment, distributions and a decrease of $1.7 million in derivative fee income. The increase was primarily due to $1.2 million in higher salaries and bonuses; $3.8 million in higher amortization of low income housing and solar tax credit investments, which included a $1.3 million catch-up adjustment in the first quarter; $1 million in higher amortization of core deposit intangibles, which included approximately $900,000 in accelerated write-downs; and $1.1 million in higher professional and marketing expenses."
