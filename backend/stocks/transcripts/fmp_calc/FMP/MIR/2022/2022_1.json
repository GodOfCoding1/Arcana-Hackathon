    "content": " As Tom mentioned, our total company revenue was down 4.3% and adjusted EBITDA declined by 12.5% when compared to the first calendar quarter of 2021. First quarter was dominated by a challenging operating environment, but we believe there are many positives to take away from it, including our robust core order growth of 19% in the quarter, which signals strong future growth; supportive conditions in both our industrial and medical end markets, especially in nuclear power; and finally, the team\u2019s ability to successfully navigate a challenging operating environment despite continued supply chain instability. What this means is that the government support, both for the operating fleet, which represents about three quarters of our nuclear revenue or about 30% of our total business, is higher, but also, the new build activity, we think is very likely to be accelerated in a number of the nuclear states and kind of incipient nuclear states that we\u2019ve talked about on prior calls. One \u2013 just one comment, Andy, I know you are going to ask another question, but I would say that \u2013 when you look at the end markets within the orders, there isn\u2019t like a large military order or something that came in, in the quarter."
