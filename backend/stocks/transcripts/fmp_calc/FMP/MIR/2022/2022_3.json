    "content": " So let's just start on where things maybe got a little bit worse this quarter on the supply chain side, in industrial, because I remember last quarter you guys had talked about building an inventory buffer, improving like some of your supply chain partners. We have changed our overall stance with the supply chain management terms of how proactive we are in managing through that, and that's precisely why we delivered 9% growth overall in the in the quarter, was essentially catalyzed by again some of the improvements that we've made in dealing with this new world order that exists. And I guess, next logical question, right, if you kind of think through the updated segment organic growth guidance that Brian just gave, you're basically assuming still kind of like high teens, maybe low 20s type organic growth in industrial, is a pretty big step up in the fourth quarter. I think, first off in the quarter, like I mentioned on the call, we've seen a little bit of mix kind of between the businesses and just how the business has fell. So we look at the overall order growth rate but more fundamentally, when we look at the top line growth rate of the business, in a world where we've seen that kind of dynamic change, we obviously have continued to see the same headwinds that others have faced in terms of supply chain friction, inflation, elevated interest rates, et cetera. We've often talked about the nuclear market being comprised of the installed base, which is the biggest component, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s about three quarters of our nuclear power related revenue, followed by new build activity, which is typically 15% to 20% followed by a decommissioning activity, which is the remainder."
