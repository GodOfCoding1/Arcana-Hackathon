Looking ahead to the full year, we are expecting organic growth of 4% to 7% with adjusted EBITDA of $172 million to $182 million. At the total company level, we delivered 19.1% organic revenue growth in the fourth quarter and 5.7% organic revenue growth for the full year. We enjoyed continued exceptional performance from our Medical business in the fourth quarter and full year, delivering organic growth of 24% and 15%, respectively. Looking at the full year, total company adjusted revenue was $717.8 million, featuring 5.1% reported growth with organic growth of 5.7%. As a reminder, year-over-year adjusted EBITDA perform -- margin performance was negatively impacted by approximately $12 million of public company costs in 2022 or approximately 170 basis points. While we have recently seen positive trends in the euro to U.S. dollar exchange rate, FX headwinds impacted adjusted revenue performance by 5% in the fourth quarter and 4.5% for 2022. Starting with fourth quarter performance, adjusted revenue grew 25.4%, with organic growth of 23.6%, driven by double-digit organic growth from all three end markets. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s important to note that our installed base is about three quarters of our nuclear power-related revenue, which is -- as you have seen in the presentation constituted about 35% of our total revenue last year."
