    "content": " It\u2019s a little bit offset as you get some benefit in the sales rate there, which is why, if you look at sales rate on a gross margin percentage point basis in Q1, it was down at 14 points, so the full year expectation of the guide 18% to 20%. So Ben, I think if you just look at \u2013 I mean, right now, when you pull out the effects of sales rate on the quarter, I think we\u2019re in the high teen, 17%, 18%, something like that from a gross margin without the impact of sales rate. The other way to look at it, Ben, if we had the commodity adjusters in this current quarter, we would\u2019ve added 10 percentage points to where we are right now, including the impact of sales rate from the commodity standpoint. You\u2019ll see that being leveraged as we grow sales volume as we expand throughout the year, we\u2019ll be averaging close to around 2.5 or 2.6 gigawatts a quarter, so essentially double where we are right now on a sold basis to hit our revenue targets for the year. All that volume would have one or two things on sales freight, either a sales freight adjuster, and I\u2019m talking just the 12 gigawatt or in some cases in this case, in this court in particular, there\u2019s a significant portion of that 12 gigawatts where a customer says, I\u2019ll take the shipping responsibility on my own. On the technology adjusters of the 36, there is about 16 gigawatts that has technology adjuster, but only about 10 gigawatts are included in that disclosure that you\u2019re going to see in the queue tomorrow, because that\u2019s the portion of the 16 that we expect to monetize or to realize."
