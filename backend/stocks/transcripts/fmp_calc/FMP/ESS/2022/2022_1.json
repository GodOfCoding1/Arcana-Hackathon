    "content": "  Operator: Good day, and welcome to the Essex Property Trust First Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. As a reminder, today's conference call is being recorded. Forward-looking statements are made based on current expectations, assumptions and beliefs as well as information available to the company at this time. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Michael Schall, President and Chief Executive Officer for Essex Property Trust. Thank you for joining us today, and welcome to our first quarter earnings conference call. Today, I will comment on our first quarter results recent housing demand and supply trends and a brief overview of the apartment transaction market. As mentioned in our earnings release, our results and rent growth trajectory support an increase in core FFO and same-property revenue guidance for the year, which Barb will review shortly. Overall, rents have continued to improve. And as of April 2022, net effective rents in the Essex markets are now 11.4% above pre-COVID rent levels and up 22% compared to one year ago. All of our markets have positive sequential rent growth with Northern California leading the portfolio, improving sequentially by approximately 3% in each month of the first quarter. The top tech companies also continue to hire rapidly in the Essex markets with over 50,000 job openings posted for California and Washington, a 79% increase compared to March of 2020. Other indicators, including job growth, venture capital deployment and office investment continue to support our thesis that Northern California will remain the epicenter of the technology industries. A significant recent example came from Google, which announced a plan to invest more than $3.5 billion on additional office and data centers in Mountain View, Downtown San Jose and elsewhere across the Bay Area. Business travel, in-person meetings, property tours and conferences have resumed, and we look forward to in-person investor meetings once again. As COVID-related regulations continue to subside on the West Coast, the deadline to apply for rental relief in California has now passed as of April 1. Delays in government reimbursements led to the highest delinquency since the onset of the pandemic, with the rental relief program now closed to new applications in California, we are now cautiously optimistic that underlying delinquency trends will improve. Given the extraordinary government restrictions during the pandemic, it became clear that our portfolio would need to achieve 2 inflection points before we could be confident that a full recovery was underway. The first was the reopening of our markets, which occurred in July of 2021 and the second was a return to office for the largest technology companies. Over the past 2 months, we've seen Google, Microsoft, Meta and Apple all begin to reopen and restaff their offices. Return to office mandates are generating economic activities, which is apparent in the job growth reports with San Francisco leading our portfolio with 8.9% trailing 3-month job growth. On average, the Essex markets reported job growth of 6.7% on a trailing 3-month basis versus the broader U.S. average of 4.7% and marking the second consecutive quarter that Essex markets have outpaced the nation in job growth. The confluence of increasing job growth, a lower unemployment rate of 3.6% in the Essex markets and expensive for sale housing all contribute to favorable rental housing tailwinds. The ability to ramp up housing production is more challenging along the West Coast as a result of long entitlement processes, burdensome regulations labor shortages and inflating construction cost. As a result, housing permits in Essex markets remain at levels roughly consistent with our long-term averages. Our bottoms-up supply analysis indicates that new deliveries will moderate for the rest of 2022, and we are also expecting a 15% decline in apartment supply in 2023 and which includes a 54% reduction in new supply expected in Northern California. Geopolitical events, turbulent financial market conditions and high levels of inflation create uncertainty, which may become a headwind for transactions. However, cap rates generally don't move quickly and are mostly a function of investor demand for property. As to the West Coast specifically, strong evidence of recovering apartment market conditions, higher inflationary growth expectations and significant capital pursuing apartments appear to have mostly offset the impact of higher interest cost keeping cap rates unchanged at this point. Our review of cap rates for recent apartment transactions across the Essex markets indicate most institutional quality assets trading in the mid-3% range for stabilized properties with little deviation across markets, building class and location. We will continue to be selective with our capital allocation strategy, focusing on deals that have the best growth potential and generate accretion to our financial benchmarks. In closing, I'd like to briefly highlight the importance of ESG and its impact on the company. As a leading provider of housing along the West Coast, we know that our company has a responsibility to operate in an environmentally conscious way Consistent with that thesis, we recently released our TCFD report, which is the first step toward alignment with proposed SEC reporting requirements. Last week, we announced that Essex will co-anchor an ESG housing Impact Fund managed by RET Ventures. Finally, we are also pleased to announce the upcoming publication of our fourth CSR report which should be available in early May. With that, I'll turn the call over to Angela Kleiman. First, I would like to express my appreciation for our operations and support teams. As we have implemented new systems and structures to optimize our operations, our team has taken on these challenges in stride and continues to demonstrate exceptional work ethic and dedication to our company's success. In today's comments, I'll begin with key operational highlights on our major regions, including our outlook for 2022 rent growth and conclude with an update on the rollout of our property collections operating model. We are pleased with our first quarter operating results, especially in delivering a 6.5% same-property revenue growth on a year-over-year basis. The first quarter performance exceeded our expectations and included some of our strongest leasing spreads reported in the company's history, with net effective new leases up 20% and renewals up 11.7% compared to the same period last year. Rents in the Pacific Northwest had a strong start to the year, improving sequentially each month since December. In addition, we successfully decreased concession in downtown Seattle throughout the quarter. Our supply forecast reflects a modest rate in deliveries throughout 2022, and the Seattle job market remained strong with March average trailing 3-month growth rate of 6.1%. Moving forward, we anticipate steady performance from our Seattle region with a loss to lease in April of 7.7%. As Mike mentioned earlier, rents in this region are being lifted by the return to office of large tech companies and a solid rebound in job growth. After a typical seasonal slowdown in the fourth quarter, construction usage in San Francisco and San Jose declined throughout the first quarter, leading to a steady improvement in net effective rents. Looking ahead, we expect the supply picture to remain steady for the rest of the year and on the demand side, job growth is accelerating with March average trailing 3 months growth rate of 6.7%. As Northern California is in its early stages of recovery, we are seeing a steady increase to loss to lease, which stands at 5.1% in April, and we continue to expect this region to lead our market rent growth in 2022. Turning to Southern California, which has been our best-performing market throughout the pandemic, we continue to be confident about Southern California as rents did not experience the typical seasonal decline in the fourth quarter and have continued to improve each month in the first quarter. Turnover in Southern California remains at the lowest level relative to the rest of our markets, demonstrating continued strength and stability of this region. For 2022, we have forecasted a modest increase in supply delivery and anticipate concessions may temporarily elevate in areas near those development lease-ups. On the demand side, Southern California was our top-performing region with March average trailing 3-month job growth of 7.9%. Furthermore, our April loss to lease of 14% will provide a tailwind to revenues into 2023. The benefits of this operating model includes enhancing our customer service through virtual on-demand experience, creating more career advanced opportunities for associates through specialization and ultimately generating a 10% to 15% reduction in administrative staffing needs through natural attrition, which is also mitigating the inflationary pressures we are experiencing today. Historically, Essex has operated with an employee to unit ratio of 40:1. Today, we are at 43:1, and our target by the end of 2022 is 45:1. At this point, we have completed the Wola of Southern California and expect company-wide implementation by year-end. In addition, we have ongoing digital platform improvements rolling out over the next few years. As such, we have yet to fully optimize our business, and we anticipate further benefits in 2023 and thereafter. I'll start with a few comments on our first quarter results, discuss changes to our full year guidance followed by an update on co-investment activity and the balance sheet. For the full year, we are raising the midpoint of core FFO by $0.25 per share to $13.95. The increase is driven by 2 factors: First, we are raising the midpoint of our same-property revenue growth by 85 basis points to 8.6% on a cash basis. As Mike mentioned, the deadline for applying for federal tenant relief passed on April 1. We believe this has led to an improvement in our residents paying current, while at the same time, we have also seen an increase in emergency rental assistance over the past 2 months. As such, our April net delinquencies were 20 basis points of scheduled rent which is below our historical average of 35 basis points. While this is encouraging, underlying gross delinquencies were about 5% in April and thus, we still need to make progress before we can confidently put COVID-related delinquencies behind us. In the first quarter, we amended our WESCO joint venture, realizing $17 million of promote income, which was paid in cash. Subsequent to quarter end, we amended our WESCO 4 joint venture earning $37 million of promote income, which was elected to reinvest back into the venture and increase our ownership to 65%. Overall, our private equity platform continues to create value for our investors and remains an important alternative source of capital. In the first quarter, our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio improved to 6.1x compared to 6.6x at the depth of the pandemic. we expect this ratio will continue to improve throughout 2022, driven by stronger operating results. with over $1 billion of liquidity, limited near-term funding needs and multiple sources of capital available to us, we remain in a strong financial position. Hopefully, it's a relatively straightforward one. I would love to be able to give you the earning for 2023, but it's one barbelkilme. And two, it's just too early. I think you can see that our fundamentals are solid, and we're doing quite well. So maybe just one follow-up question I don't know, some of your peers talk about it. So I know it's not the ESS way, but I figured I'd give it a go. That's a good question, Rich. And you've seen us do this, which is when we see market strength, we would change our strategy from favoring occupancy to pushing rents, especially when we see -- when we are anticipating more market strength coming ahead of us. And you'll see that when we are past the leasing season, usually during third quarter, and especially in the fourth quarter, we would change that strategy back to pushing occupancy instead. Mike, if I had another question, which I don't, I'd ask you about solar payables, but maybe we can table that for NAREIT. I'll just make a couple of quick comments, and then we'll move on from there. We have actually, for over 10 years now been had our own, what we call resource management group. So we've got pretty long history of pursuing things that we thought were good for our properties, good for values and create more efficient ways of doing things. So our CSR efforts have been -- they're nothing new, and they've been part of our past. And -- but I would say, as we think about California especially, there's a mandate here to remove gas cars by 2035. There are other mandates, as you all know, and they keep us focused on that. I think that there is a strong intersection between opportunity to add value to the portfolio many of these ESG efforts, and you mentioned one of them, which is solar panels, but it goes well beyond that. Nick, it's Mike, and maybe Angela will want to make a comment. But really, it's I think, opening up a number of different things. The normal migration pattern typically has retirees with expensive California homes leading as you enter into a recessionary period, we certainly saw that. And then normally, that's -- those retiring workers moving out of California are replaced by younger workers that are coming into California to take higher-paying jobs and some of the opportunities for the tech company. In addition to that, there are some foreign migration that has picked up also, and we're starting to see more demand for corporate housing units as these big tech companies in terms of their training and onboarding activities. We're seeing more normalization of our activities, and they're coming from a number of different areas. Obviously, there's high rent growth, but negative leverage with higher interest rates. So going forward, we don't see -- we don't see transaction values changing a whole lot. You are seeing some interest rate pressures, obviously, but with the growth that we're seeing throughout our markets and with the amount of capital in the market chasing deals. We're seeing a somewhat less froth than what we've seen over the last, call it, 6 to 9 months. So it really -- like I said, we're not seeing a dramatic shift in pricing moving forward. Barb, I just wanted to try and clarify some things I'm a little confused. So F-16, you showed -- you had 2.2 in the first quarter. Steve, yes, that's a great question. So what I was alluding to in our guidance, we've assumed 1.9% scheduled rent, and that's on a net delinquency basis. That's for the full year, which implies 2% in the back half of the year. For example, in January, February, we're at 6.5%, and we've come down to 5%. That said, we still have a lot of work to do there, and we've only seen 1 month of data. So our guidance doesn't assume that, that materially changes from here, especially with Alameda and LA County where Avicion protections remain in place. Because remember, our net delinquencies were 35 basis points historically. Steve, let me throw out one other set of numbers. I think that was in my script, of which we booked, I believe, $4 billion of that as revenue or accounts receivable. We just don't know when or how much, given the -- most of it comes from the state rental relief program, and it is impossible for us to predict when that's going to come in. No, I understand it\u2019s hard to kind of figure out when you\u2019ll get it. I mean, I\u2019m going to turn that over to Adam here in a second, but I will say that in the recent past, we press released a couple of development deals, one in Seattle and one in Northern California. Steve, we\u2019re seeing we\u2019re not seeing a huge increase in deals coming out on the development side. They are generally solving to a low 4 cap, which that does not provide the spread that we need in order to justify risk associated with development deals. We probably have seen more tertiary markets, increase their potential for new development deals. So generally, we have \u2013 as Mike mentioned, we press released a deal last year in the Bay Area. One additional note, what Adam talks about a 4 cap, he\u2019s saying today, that\u2019s untrended for cap. My first question, Mike, is on your supply comments. And I was -- and I'm sorry, if I'm saying the wrong percent, please correct me. Jeff, actually, these numbers didn't change a lot from last quarter. And that overall reduction in 2023 was minus 15%, made up of minus 54% and in the Bay Area. So I think what's happened here is that in the early phases of COVID, people pulled back on development. But in my prepared remarks, I noted that the deliveries, we've actually had the peak deliveries in Q1, Q2 '22. So they moderate little bit toward the end of -- for the rest of the year, the last -- the next 6 months and then next year, again, down 15%. And so we're accurate than some of the other data that you see out there, not that some of these can't change their construction delays, et cetera, that happen. And then just a follow-up, Mike, on some of the comments about San Francisco and the return to work. Well, my initial thought goes back to the first chapter of COVID, which the city is basically shut down. They shut down all the restaurants, they shut down hotels, all the leisure, all the service jobs are pretty much eliminated. And so now what you're starting to see is the demand for those services really didn't change all that much, but you got to bring all those workers back in order to reengage in those businesses. So as the cities recover and again, we have some concerns about the is given defund the police movements, et cetera, homelessness. And -- but as the cities recover, we think that there's good upside. And it's entirely due to real demand for travel, for services, for restaurants, for hotels, et cetera. We view it as a policy choice largely that caused the deep hole, and now, we're just recovering to a natural place. Our next questions come from the line of Alexander Goldfarb with Piper Sandler. Well, maybe Angela will add to that because I don't have anything that tells me on a more granular basis exactly what's happening. And the cities, the concern in the cities is both, I think I mentioned before, hoses, et cetera, but also there's more supply in the cities like, for example, almost all the supply in Los Angeles, sort of the greatest percentage supply increase in Los Angeles is in the CBD, same with San Diego and kind of same throughout. Alex, if it helps, just a few data points on what Mike just said. When we're looking at the sequential met new leases, net effective new leases. And Barb, I appreciate your color to one of the previous analyst questions. And then two, if the state is paying all these people's rents, where is the -- I mean that sounds like a big moral hazard that the people know next time they don't have to pay rent. Alex, it's Angela here. Maybe I'll start with the tenant's behavior first and like me, I want to talk about more hazard. In terms of how aggressively we can push on that front, there are a couple of factors. As far as our ability to collect going forward, keep in mind that the protection -- delinquency protection remain for any delinquency that occurred during the period before September 2021. So on the new April delinquency, we can take action outside of L.A., of course, in Alameda. And so it's a whole process that involves going through evaluation of putting people and payment plans, win with our tenants on how to manage through this period of time. And so -- we do, at this point, have the ability to report to the credit agency everywhere, it's really how we want to go about it that will make the most sense to be able to maximize our collections effort. And then the other part, which is state law statewide, which effectively says if you have a rental relief application outstanding, the courts will not hear an eviction case through June 30. But the good news is, I think, that all of these programs appear to be getting close to their end, and then we'll pretty soon have a good idea of where we stand. Barb, if I heard you correctly, the same-store revenue guidance increase was really 2 parts, neither of which seemed to include any change to your projections for market rents or occupancy through the balance of the year. I'll take the first part, and then I'll let Mike and Angela take the second part. So in terms of the same-store guidance raise, so 50 basis points of the raise was due to delinquency, another 30 basis points was due to lower concessions and higher net effective rents and then the balance was due to higher rubs. On the market brands, we are tracking pretty much in line in Northern California and Seattle. And keep in mind, we had anticipated that Northern California recovery would be quite strong. The -- and so we are in the middle of -- in the midst of relooking at our modeling assumptions, and we'll provide a midyear update. Having said that, keep in mind that when we're looking at leasing spreads, year-over-year leasing spreads, we will have the -- it will be the strongest in the first half because last year around this time, we still had negative leasing spreads. In fact, that negative leasing spreads weren\u2019t continued through the second quarter, we didn't turn until July. And so for those reasons, with the year-over-year comparable, we need to evaluate the magnitude of what that means. And maybe 1 final piece, and that is we'll be looking at F '17 and our rent forecast, our economic forecast on -- and the net-net is we're ahead. And we generally don't do that every quarter, we do it biannually, so we'll be looking at that for next quarter. And just to clarify, Barb, on the 35 basis points, you mentioned a couple of items there, but I thought I heard you say in the prepared remarks that was mainly driven by first quarter performance. And so not necessarily that you've assumed that the -- even though it's decelerating in the back half of the year, but that growth will be higher than what was assumed in your original projection. I said it was driven by, yes, strong first quarter results and then better net delinquency collection. So we -- like I said, we factored in 30 basis points improvement in concessions and higher net effective rents for our full year guidance and then 50 basis points on delinquency. And then, Mike, you've provided a lot of data points on the demand to supply ratio and set up for the recovery on the West Coast and how these markets have historically outperformed in an upturn. But obviously, we're amidst sort of some crosscurrents today and concerns about a recession on the horizon. Well, I will -- I'll start by citing the fearful of Barb comment that we already noted, but we feel good about conditions and where we stand. So we are just recovering the things that were shut down during the pandemic now that, again, all of the mass mandates most of them have been removed, and it feels like we're in a better state. And we're at the front end of that process, we\u2019re obviously late to the dance and -- but we feel good about where we stand and expect to continue to perform well. So on the renewals, company-wide, we're setting at about -- slightly above 11%. SoCal at about 10.5%, and Northern California, close to 12% and Seattle close to 13%. In terms of our confidence level, given where we're seeing the activities and the demand, we are quite confident that these are achievable rates. So if that continues in the second quarter, what's implied in your guidance of 8.6% same-store revenue for the second half of the year? I know, Angela, you mentioned that there are tougher comps that you're approaching. But at the same time, the loss lease went up to 9.5%. No, that's a good question. So first quarter, our same-store was 6.5%. We do expect that to gradually increase from a revenue perspective because that is -- essentially there's a lag effect, right, between revenues and economic grants. So as market rents taper off, the revenues is falling, but it's continued to increase. I don't have that in front of -- effective lease growth, I don't have that in front of me. And John maybe -- John, as it relates to F '17, keep in mind that if we get it sooner, it doesn't necessarily mean that we're going to get what we got sooner. And in addition, we're going to get what we thought we're going to get. That's why we want to make sure that we wait for kind of a full review of F-17 before we start kicking it apart, if that makes sense. The $76 million, which is the cumulative number. And I know previously, I didn't see an update on this, but in terms of the reimbursement that you've already applied for and haven't received that number back in March was, I think, $59 million. And that the latter group is the one that the resident -- the former resident has to engage, which is obviously more uncertain of how we'll be able to collect that. And then in terms of the guidance then, how should we think about that $64 million. What's implied is effectively the first group, the resident, the current resident applications. Given the programs now ended in terms of applying for new applications, we think that, that will come in this year. It won't all be same store, though because that's for our total portfolio, including joint venture properties. The other half is uncertain, and we're seeking alternative ways to recoup that money, but the timing is very uncertain on that. So in the prepared comments, you mentioned the 3 co-investments that are expected to be paid off in '23 now versus 2022 previously. So the 3 investments that were pushed, it's really a function of the interest rate environment today and where these properties are going to be in lease up. Keep in mind, in 2021 given the low interest rate environment, developers were able to get takeout financing before they were fully leased up. And given the higher interest rate environment and debt service coverage ratios, we don't see that happening anymore. Brad, we -- I think that we will see more. Again, we have this lag after COVID when construction starts turned downward, and I suspect that we will see a lot of those deals come back and that will create more demand for the food equity program. Mike, I don't know if you remember, a long time ago, I talked to you about a mood ring. Given S-17, I know you're going to update it, but right now, it's the leader. But you also reported quarter, same-store revenue in Northern California was the laggard of the 3 regions. Should we sort of extrapolate what you're thinking rent -- market rent growth wise, into your portfolio, shouldn't this just flip in the coming quarters in terms of the composition of store revenue growth in 2022 where Northern California should really become the leader in the back half relative to the other regions? Well, Angela will maybe have some comments. So I actually -- because of you know what a mood ring is and I have different colors that I have in my mind because of you, Rich. I mean, I think that we feel good, energized, et cetera. You would think blue, black --\n Parting to my mood ring thing, energize is red and excited and adventurous are red. So all that you feel -- I have the wrong mood ring app, I guess. So -- but no, we -- I think we're feeling good about things. In terms of long-term CAGRs rent growth, it's fallen well behind the curve in this case. And in this world because rents are always tethered at some level to income levels, it's really important that they move together. And we -- on the income side, we're still seeing some recovery happening there. And 1 number that I was told by the group here is that our income and our -- our move-ins are up something like 15%, which is pretty darn good. It makes us feel better about the rents that we're charging, especially in Southern California. I expect Northern California to really pick it up here, and it will become -- once again, as it has for the long term, our #1 market is what I would guess. And Rich, it's Angela here. Thanks for making my point for me, which is that in the second half, we do see that flip. And then second question for me is -- we talk a lot about services coming back in restaurants and hotels and all that, but also reemployment or the reuse of office buildings with tech. Is it not true that hybrid office would be a better model for you rather than 5 days a week only because where you guys are located, primarily outside of San Francisco. So maybe a 2- or 3-day a week type of model would be good for your portfolio relatively speaking because people might be able to put up with a longer commute for a variety of reasons in that area, but just because they don't have to go into the office every single day. No, I think you're thinking about it the right way. And I think everyone, including the tech workers and actually Essex as a company, most of them are pursuing a hybrid model of some kind that requires some tethering to an office. And we're actually no different from that, obviously. And so I think what the effect of that is, is that it makes the downtowns, which have all the office buildings, a little less desirable. And it probably adds -- and we've talked about this before, another ring, let's say, another 10 miles out from where we would have drawn our line because our portfolio is planned around the key job nodes and a commute pattern to those job nodes. And a good example is we've been buying in San Diego County, some of the areas that are farther from the major job nodes. So I think it does push out the commutable space and therefore, it expands our geography accordingly. And just one question, and I'll let somebody else jump on. The revenue-enhancing CapEx spend this year, $100 million is a big number. On the redevelopment side, we are targeting 8% to 10% cash on cash yield, and this is consistent with pre-COVID levels. Now the elevated level that you may be referring to when it comes to the CapEx per door, I think that's what you're referring to itself, it's really driven by 2 factors. One is, of course, the material cost increase, but the other 1 is a catch-up. And so during the COVID period, we, of course, were very careful and ran much leaner from a CapEx perspective, both in terms of just trying to minimize contact and also being sensitive to what we can achieve on the top line. And because of that, our normal CapEx per door of somewhere around 1,750 dropped down to almost below $1,400. In terms of where to put capital, obviously, redevelopment of the 8% to 10% returns are obviously our best use of cash proceeds today relative to buying an asset in the mid-3s or even buying back the stock. Remember, you're you've got an occupied building and you can only put so many dollars to work. So there's a capital constraint on how much we can put to work there, but we think that is the best alternative source of capital outside of preferred equity, which we've already discussed in the past. Now it's gone a little over narrow, so I'll be quick. First one, on the the RET fund, the one the climate change funds. It's a good comment, and I'm not going to make any comments about China or India. But I would say that, again, we saw -- as I mentioned earlier, we see good opportunities to invest in our own portfolio and make it better. And by better, I mean, produce a return on investment that makes sense. And we see the cost of electricity, trash removal, water issues et cetera, as being longer-term issues for all of us. And if we can solve some of those issues and get a payback by lowering our bills, et cetera, thdn so be it, we think it makes good sense. And initially, we had -- I know RET Ventures was thinking about that as part of their existing fund and, in fact, had made a number of investments out of their main fund in ESG. So there are a lot of important reasons when we should be doing this, and we see a lot of opportunity out there. And it's not just investing money, it's actually getting a return on your investment. Last 1 real quick, maybe Adam, for you or anyone really, but your stock price is pretty much right around all-time high. I know that this typical model is stock price up, issue equity and buy stuff, stock price down, sell assets, JV stuff. Maybe just talk about the -- I think maybe some I touched on it before, the acquisition pipeline around in your market, potentially maybe some suburban locations, et cetera. As to what's going to come later in the year, it's hard to say. Over the end of Q4 and early Q1, the volume generally on the market was pretty low. As I noted before, over the last 6 to 9 months, we really didn't partake in the frenzy that was happening in those best and best final rounds. And so if there's any sort of adjustment or if we see an opportunity that comes up, and we did see a few of those that we closed on in early Q4 and early this quarter, then we will jump into those windows. So it just seems like it's going to be a little bit harder to kind of do the types of things you did maybe in years past when your stock price was up, and you're heavily acquisitive. I mean if you take the cap rates that Adam was talking about and you compare it to the company, you've climbed to the company, you will find that issuing stock is something we really shouldn't do. And obviously, having positive leverage, i.e., cap rates over debt cost was a -- it helps a lot when it comes to deal making. If you could perhaps give some more insight into the connections operating model, I know you have it lined up to be rolled out fully across the portfolio by the end of 2022. From a number standpoint, I know you've given that ratio of 45 to 1from 40, which is very helpful. And the second one is operating efficiency, and that is the 40:1 ratio that I talked about that we now improved to 43:1 in terms of units to employ. And ultimately, what that means for the financial impact, and that's the third key metric. And so when I refer to the 100 to 200 basis points of margin improvement, when we implemented San Diego and Orange County, that translated to about $15 million of benefit to NOI, and we have realized that savings when we were only about 1/3 way through our implementation back then. So the expectation is that going forward, once we complete the rollout -- now keep in mind, we also have a digital platform rollout that's embedded in all of the cost savings. But upon completion, and this is several years out, we would expect an additional 200 to 300 basis points of margin improvement. The trick here is -- or the challenge is trying to figure out, it's not a dollar for dollar because when we -- when I talked about the $15 million things, we were not under such extreme inflationary pressure today. Our next questions come from the line of Alexander Goldfarb with Piper Sandler. I think it's half of that, that you mentioned by former residents that you said those residents have to initiate, is that -- it sounds like the whole $76 million may not get paid back. So the total that we've applied for is $64 million as of today, the cumulative delinquency that Mike alluded to is $76 million. And then of the $64 million in applications, it's made up of 2 components: our existing residents, which is half and then past residents. Keep in mind, Alex, we can't -- the landlord -- this is not a landlord program, it's a tenant program. So -- but it's really their reimbursement paying us off and their incentive ends, they're going to owe some money if they don't process the application. Alex, it's Angela here. And that includes the impact to their credit report we can, and we actually have reported on our past residents. But also, there are other means for us to try to connect with them, which is we can go through small claims court. And thanks, everyone, for joining our call today. We are looking forward to NAREIT, and hopefully, we will see many of you there."
