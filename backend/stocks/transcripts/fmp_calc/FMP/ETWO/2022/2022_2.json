    "content": " Adjusted EBITDA margin improved to 36.3% for the second quarter of fiscal 2022, compared to 32% for the second quarter of fiscal 2021, and as a direct result of strong operating results related to organic revenue growth, coupled with the leverage we built in our business around scaling up our costs. For the full fiscal year 2022, we expect total non-GAAP revenue to range from $470 million to $474 million representing an organic revenue growth rate of over 10% and up from the initial guidance of $466 million on a like for like basis."
