    "content": " Our confidence that fiscal 2023 will see an increased growth rate over fiscal 2022 is borne by the highly visible nature of our subscription revenue, which accounts for nearly 80% of our total revenue. The organic growth rate of our subscription revenue for Q3 was 11.2%, and the overall organic growth rate for the quarter was 13.8%. Given our performance in Q3, we are increasing our full year total revenue guidance and expect our full year organic revenue growth to now exceed 10%. Despite the natural noise and distraction of this rapid integration, we had a record Q3 for new contract bookings, our qualified pipeline grew, and we produced an organic growth rate of 13.8% overall, but most important, 11.2% for our subscription revenue. We generated total revenue in the fiscal third quarter of $147.4 million, reflecting a total revenue growth rate of 13.8% on a pro forma basis. Broken down by reporting category, subscription revenue was $117.4 million, reflecting a subscription revenue growth rate of 11.2% on a pro forma basis. Professional services revenue was $30 million during the quarter, reflecting a professional services revenue growth rate of 25.5% on a pro forma basis. So, I think when we -- based on what you guys have disclosed in the past, the new full year guide, it looks like the 4Q guide implies growth of up 12% in the high-end inclusive of BluJay, which is just slightly below the 14% that you guys just posted this past quarter."
