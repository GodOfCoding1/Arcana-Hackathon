    "content": " Total net revenues for the second quarter of 2022 were RMB 24.5 billion as compared with RMB 29.6 billion in the prior year period, primarily attributable to soft consumer demand for discretionary categories amid a changing macro environment with COVID-19 resurgence in China. Looking forward to the third quarter of 2022, we expect our total net revenues to be between RMB 21.2 billion and RMB 22.4 billion, representing a year-over-year decrease rate of approximately 15% to 10%. Yes, I think our goal is trying -- to try to bring our customers to positive growth starting from the third quarter because now in the second quarter, we've seen a drastic decline in the customers and we've seen fewer customers shopping our platform because of the COVID impact mostly related to the factor that people cannot move around as freely as before. Second, in terms of our -- in terms of -- we are -- actually, in terms of the Q4 outlook, we are actually quite confident under the condition that if we can turn our customer into the growth trajectory in the third quarter because as long as we bring our -- bring new customers in, we are going to see some upside in the fourth quarter performance because that's going to be the peak season for us. It doesn't mean that adding 2 million customers, we will have to spend RMB 200 to -- RMB 400 million every quarter, we may have to spend a little bit more on acquiring new customers. And actually, we want to keep certain support for the core brands, and we may -- we can't afford to decrease the take rate a little bit to make sure that they can grow faster on our platform with a stronger supply of any kind of quality product offerings because core brands can really help deliver value to our customers and increase consumer mind share for the Vipshop as a discount platform."
