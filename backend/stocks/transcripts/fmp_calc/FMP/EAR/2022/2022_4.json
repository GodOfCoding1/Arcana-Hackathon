    "content": " As a reminder, this partnership enabled us to lead the four core elements of a world-class experience that we believe consumers desire when shopping in-person for hearing aids: one, education and proper merchandising; two, self-administered hearing screening; three, expert sales consultation; and four, outstanding post-purchase support. We continue to focus on our four most important business priorities this year: one, refining and expanding our retail strategy; two, accessing insurance coverage for Eargo hearing aids, including continuing dialogue with individual FEHB payers and other third-party payers regarding insurance coverage of Eargo hearing aids; three, optimizing our cash pay business; and four, continuing to invest in innovation."
