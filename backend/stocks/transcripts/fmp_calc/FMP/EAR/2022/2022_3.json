    "content": " As a reminder, those priorities include refining and expanding our physical retail strategy, accessing insurance coverage for Eargo hearing aids including potentially regaining insurance coverage of a Eargo hearing aid devices for government employees under the FEHB program, optimizing our cash paid business and continuing to invest in innovation. As many of you are aware the final FDA rule establishing a new regulatory category for OTC hearing aids became effective October 17, 2022, allowing certain hearing aids to be sold in person without the supervision, prescription or other order involvement or intervention of a licensed hearing practitioner in preparation for this regulatory change. As part of Eargo's commitment to innovation in connection with the OTC ruling we also submitted at 510-K premarket notification, seeking FDA clearance of expanded labeling for Eargo five and six hearing aids as self fitting before the final OTC rule was announced. Since resolving the DOJ investigation last quarter, our focus has been on establishing dialogue with third party payers and individual FEHB carriers with the objective of aligning on and establishing go forward processes and required documentation to support the assumption of insurance coverage for Eargo devices. Non-GAAP, general and administrative expenses were 10.0 million, or 126.8% of net revenues compared to $16.0 million or 220.5% of net revenues in the second quarter of 2022."
