    "content": " Clearly, our second quarter financial results and year-over-year comparisons reflect our decision to stop accepting insurance as a form of direct payment on December 8, 2021, as well as the cash burn reduction initiatives I just mentioned. This volumes sequentially down as expected, we took the time to continue refining the efficiency of our cash pay business, reducing media spend to $4.1 million in the quarter, down $500,000 sequentially, but improving conversion rate to nearly 16%. From a financing perspective, we achieved a significant milestone in that we secured a strategic commitment of up to $125 million from Patient Square Capital, closing the first tranche investment of $100 million in senior secured convertible notes on June 28th. Pursuant to the terms of the transaction agreement, we are focused on completing our rights offering at 375 million common shares to existing stockholders, which we intend to complete by November 25, 2022, or within 150 days of the closing of the first tranche investment and in any event, by December 24, 2022. Our second quarter results and year-over-year comparisons reflect our decision to stop accepting insurance as a form of direct payment on December 8, 2021, as well as the company's efforts to reduce cash burn. Second quarter 2022 net revenue was $7.2 million, down 68% year-over-year. Second quarter 2022 return accrual rate was 33.3%, up 9.2 percentage points year-over-year, driven by primarily the shift to cash pay only business in the second quarter. We had cash and cash equivalents of $106.6 million at June 30, 2022, which includes proceeds from the first tranche closing of the senior convertible notes transaction on June 28th, and using approximately $16.2 million to pay off our previous SVB debt obligation as well as quoting costs."
