    "content": " We've also met and exceeded our KPI targets for the year, including 62 percentage points of gross loss ratio improvement in 2022 versus full year of 2021; improved our targeted marketing, over 75% of new customers fall within our generation better target market; added geographic diversification, we're now in 40 states covering over 90% of the population; we've improved our claims experience through the use of aerial imagery to rapidly assess damage after catastrophes. The second bucket is business that's primarily fee based revenue that has limited exposure to underwriting results, that's our Spinnaker program business where we support other MGAs by renting our balance sheet to them in exchange for fees, that's about 30% of our expected 2023 total generated premium. And the final bucket, which is the Hippo home insurance program where the economics as we've seen are primarily based on the underwriting results, that'll be about 30% of our 2023 total generated premium."
