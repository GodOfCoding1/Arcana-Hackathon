And we've got a lot of great talent working on that and it's not just going to benefit our company restaurants and our corporate P&L, the insights that we're garnering and the methods that we're developing, the processes that we're going to develop are going to be able to then transfer to all of our franchisees and make them better managers of their labor moving forward, which should improve productivity and margins, which should help us continue to spur domestic development. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. But offsetting that as we've talked a lot about is the positive comp sales growth, not just in North America, but as Rob pointed out internationally outside of the U.K. And then we also expect G&A to be down year-over-year in the second half as we continue to take a disciplined approach to cost management. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open."
