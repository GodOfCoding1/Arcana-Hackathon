    "content": " At the midpoint of the range, this growth would represent a 5% increase in total system wide units and nearly 20% increase over last year's 244 net new units. Beginning with our P&L, for the fourth quarter global system wide sales were $1.2 billion, up 3% in constant currency and excluding the previously announced franchisee suspended restaurants compared with the same period last year. Turning to margins, adjusted operating income, which we believe is a meaningful measure of our operating performance and a metric I will reference throughout my comments today was $38 million in the fourth quarter compared with $42 million, the same period last year. We remain confident and our positive North America comp sales, which we expect to grow between two and 4% annually going forward work as we look to 2023 specifically, we anticipate being at the lower end of this range following three straight years of record sales. And a lot of the operational improvements that we talked about that we started to see, really in the back half of last year and significantly here in Q1 are helping us leverage our labor to a greater degree and make sure that we're able to service our customers."
