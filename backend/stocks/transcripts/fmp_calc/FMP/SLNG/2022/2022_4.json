    "content": " Revenue across both sectors increased year-over-year to 24% of total revenue versus roughly 5% in 2021, which is noteworthy as we are expanding our revenue base into markets that are roughly 20 times to 30 times larger than our historical industrial business. As you can see, our entire team\u00e2\u0080\u0099s efforts really paid off in 2022, having delivered strong operating cash flow, resulting in a considerable increase in cash from $900,000 at the end of 2021 to $11.5 million at the end of 2022, which not only places us on dramatically better financial footing but also advances our company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s positioning for growth. For the full year of 2022, we reported revenues of $98.8 million, an increase of 43% from the prior year, driven by improved pricing, additional LNG gallons delivered and stronger natural gas prices. But also, I think as we start to put capital expansion plans, whether it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s our preexisting liquefaction capabilities or in kind of greenfield markets around the U.S., I think those will also be really good indicators of us starting to see signs of life on the commercial side. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s why it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s very important for us to continue to, I think, be aggressive and appropriate in our approach to these growth drivers, which instead of being about $1 billion, $1.5 billion, to aggregate aerospace and maritime or marine, aggregate almost $20 billion of addressable market."
