    "content": " In line with our policy to allocate capital dynamically driven by relative returns adjusted for risk, we have used our increased cash flows and long-term visibility to increase our common dividend this quarter, as promised, as well as to opportunistically buy back around $5 million of our shares in the market, in line with our policy of returning capital to shareholders in a prudent manner that is well supported and sustainable for the long-term. So it's -- given the other potential demands on capital and the dynamic approach that we have which we review with the Board every quarter, I'm afraid it's just not possible to say, well, we've done 5 million in this quarter, so expect $5 million a quarter for the next few quarters."
