    "content": " Total investment income for the quarter was $1.4 million, up 67% over last year, reflecting increased interest income from portfolio companies and higher dividend income. A reduction in value of Rand\u00e2\u0080\u0099s publicly held securities impacted accrued capital gains and sign up fees to the external investment advisor, resulting in a credit of $663,000 for the second quarter of 2022 compared with $1.1 million of expense for the second quarter of 2021. On an adjusted basis, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, net investment income was $0.29 per share for the second quarter of 2022, up almost 3 times over the $0.10 per share in the last year's quarter."
