    "content": " While we have made great strides building out our portfolio that is delivering strong total investment income growth, we are equally focused on prudent expense management, which was demonstrated in the measurable improvement of our net investment income per share of $0.48 for the quarter, up 4 times from last year\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fourth quarter. Total investment income for the quarter was over $1.7 million, up 40% over last year, driven by increased interest income from the four new debt instruments originated over the last year and higher dividend income. Fourth quarter net investment income was approximately $1.2 million or $0.48 per share, compared with approximately $320,000 or $0.12 per share in the prior year quarter."
