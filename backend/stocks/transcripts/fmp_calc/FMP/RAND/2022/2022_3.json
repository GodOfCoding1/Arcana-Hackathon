    "content": " While we have made great strides building out our portfolio that is delivering strong total investment growth, we are equally focused on prudent expense management, which was demonstrated in the measurable improvement of net investment income per share of $0.39 for the quarter. Total investment income for the quarter was $1.6 million up 54% over last year, reflecting increased interest income from portfolio companies given four new debt investments over the last year and higher dividend income. Net investment income was $1 million or $0.39 per share for the third quarter compared with $53, 000 or $0.02 per share in the prior year quarter. On an adjusted basis, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, net investment income doubled to $0.40 per share for the third quarter of 2022."
