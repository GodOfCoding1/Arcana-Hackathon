    "content": " We delivered 11% growth in total investment income by leveraging the significant investments made in 2021, which had approximately $20 million in portfolio additions and are now reaping the benefits of our improved mix of interest-yielding debt instruments. The fair value of those investments totaled $62.4 million, which contracted 3%, primarily due to the changes in ACV Auctions\u2019 market value as well as the impact of net new investments and payoffs. Total investment income for the quarter was $1.1 million, and that\u2019s up 11% over last year, which reflects increased interest income from portfolio companies. On an adjusted basis, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, net investment income was $0.21 per share for the first quarter of 2022, up from $0.17 per share in last year\u2019s period."
