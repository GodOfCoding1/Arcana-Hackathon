    "content": " EngageSmart delivered record revenue of $78.8 million, representing 42% year-over-year growth, all organic and adjusted EBITDA of $13.2 million, which is 16.8% of revenue for the quarter. SMB delivered outstanding growth of 52% year-over-year, driven by high demand for our SimplePractice solution in mental health and continued traction in new verticals such as speech language pathology and occupational therapy. Total revenue for Q3 was $78.8 million, representing an increase of 42% year-over-year, fueled by growth in customer count and transactions processed. Our SMB segment continues to perform well, with third quarter revenue coming in at $42.9 million, representing 52% growth year-over-year. Overall, the pricing and packaging changes continue to be well received by our customers as we are seeing healthy adoption from new accounts and strong referrals that are scaling with our customer growth. Our Enterprise segment also delivered strong results with reported revenue of $35.9 million, representing 31% year-over-year growth, driven by new customer adds, stronger digital payment adoption and revenue per payment growth from our older utility cohorts. One of the drivers of this meaningful increase, I would have thought it would have maybe trended the other way given the starter package, but how much of this is customer succeeding on your platform and then growing the size of their business versus maybe adding group practices from the\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\n I mean I would say we continue to see a very healthy mix of practitioners joining group practices."
