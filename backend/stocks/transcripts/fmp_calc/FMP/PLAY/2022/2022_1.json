    "content": " Working together with this team, we have accomplished much, reopening all of our stores following the COVID shutdowns, broadening our entertainment offering to include more immersive sports viewing experience, commencing our refresh/remodel program that will give our existing stores a fresh look, a new beverage menu, a nationwide partnership with both Pepsi and WWE to bring all of their pay per view events to our locations, a new D&B rewards program, and a fantastic marriage with Main Event. Yeah, I'm just going to add \u00e2\u0080\u0093 this is Margo \u00e2\u0080\u0093 that with the stabilized staffing efforts, one of the things that we've been able to really get back into in a pretty meaningful way is our local school marketing initiatives where our GMs are going into their individual communities and looking specifically for more opportunities that they can drive into the stores. Also, modeling-wise, just level-setting on \u00e2\u0080\u0093 if you could give us the average weekly sales , what that's running  much if any kind of seasonal drop off versus the 1Q because, historically, average weekly sales do go down slightly in the 2Q but, obviously, it feels like things are pretty strong right now and a lot of programs still rolling out."
