    "content": " First off revenue, I am pleased to report strong revenue growth in the first quarter, which grew 145.5% to $36.7 million from $14.9 million in Q1, 2021. After adjusting for non-cash settled share-based compensation expense, adjusted gross profit was $1.9 million in Q1, 2022 compared to adjusted gross loss of $1.2 million in Q1, 2021. After adjusting for non-cash settled share-based compensation expense, and changes in fair value of our warrant liability, and convertible notes, adjusted net loss was $29.1 million in Q1, 2022 compared to $12.7 million in Q1, 2021. Net cash used in operating activities during the quarter was $24.9 million, which was primarily due to increased notes receivable and inventory due to our higher sales, as well as the management decision to pay for certain raw materials earlier than usual in order to secure lower prices from our suppliers. Management estimates for our total capital expenditures in 2022 remain in the region of $300 million to $350 million, with most of this being allocated to our capacity expansion projects, which will bring online an additional four gigawatt hours of capacity per annum."
