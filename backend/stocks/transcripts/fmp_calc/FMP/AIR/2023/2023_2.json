    "content": " First, commercial market conditions are favorable including strong leisure and business travel demand, the reopening of international markets following the relaxation of travel restrictions and OEM production challenges that are extending the life of the existing fleet; second, our parts volumes although recovering are still well below pre-COVID levels and we have every reason to believe that they will not only fully recover but also grow based on increased acceptance of USM and the maturation of several recently awarded new parts distribution contracts; and third, our government programs offering is consistent with the best value commercial best practices support that the U.S. government is increasingly seeking and the new NDAA language facilitates the government's ability to act on more of our offerings."
