    "content": " To illustrate this, our adjusted margin this quarter increased from 5.6% to 6.1% compared to 2 years ago prior to the pandemic, even though our adjusted revenue was down $127 million over that same period. Sequentially, our commercial sales declined 3.6% due primarily to the impact of the Delta variant on our parts supply activities, and our government sales declined 4.7% driven by the wind-down of certain programs and the reduction of activity in Afghanistan."
