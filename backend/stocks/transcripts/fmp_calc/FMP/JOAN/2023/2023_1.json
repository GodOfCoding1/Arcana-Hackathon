    "content": " After adjusting for $28.9 million of excess ocean freight and related supply chain costs, gross profit declined by 11% from last year and increased versus pre-pandemic comparisons. While we see some category trends that point toward more rapid improvement, we are taking steps to ensure strong positive free cash flow over the next 18 to 24 months, assuming our comparable sales could continue to run mid- to high single-digit declines for the next two to three quarters before we begin to see more stable or growing year-over-year trends. On the cost front, we have wrapped up annual negotiations with our ocean freight carriers, expanding our capacity under contract, which will reduce our exposure to the very volatile stock market and allow us to better control costs for our third and fourth quarter seasonal flow compared to what we experienced last year. I think we're working on some efforts to even improve that further within the following year, we're already looking at rolling forward out another year regardless of where sales remain a little bit tough, taking enough actions to allow us to be more at our historical level of free cash flow, which is approaching $100 million on an annual basis."
