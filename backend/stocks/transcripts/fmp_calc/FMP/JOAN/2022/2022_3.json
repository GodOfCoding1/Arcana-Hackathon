    "content": " Adjusted EBITDA also continued to grow significantly compared to pre-pandemic levels, reaching $72.6 million, an increase of $33.2 million or plus-84% versus the third quarter of fiscal year 2020. We\u2019ve also been successful in managing our pricing and promotions as well as shrink and clearance cost, driving growth in our gross profit dollars at 16.3% after adjusting for $11.3 million of higher excess ocean freight and related supply chain costs during the third quarter. After adjusting for excess one-time supply chain cost, we reached another high water mark in quarterly gross margin rate of 54%, a 410 basis point improvement over two years and a 30 basis point sequential improvement over this year's second quarter. This did require us to absorb significantly higher ocean freight and related supply chain costs in the quarter versus the same period last year of approximately $16 million, of which we reflected $11.3 million as an adjustment to EBITDA as excessive one-time costs that we feel will normalize as current global supply chain issues resolve. Our third quarter selling, general and administrative expenses totaled $257.6 million, a decrease of 12% compared to the same period last year and an increase of 2.9% over the past two years. Part of what\u2019s in that, you know that we are calling one time is I think had about $10 million of cost to offload product from the port, which is something nobody's ever done before, but its effectively taking it off on container and putting it on to a truck; that was $10 million just to get out of the port this year."
