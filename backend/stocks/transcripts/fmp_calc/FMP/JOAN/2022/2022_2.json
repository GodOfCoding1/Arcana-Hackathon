    "content": " Omnichannel sales grew by 115% on a two-year stack and reached $53.5 million in the second quarter, representing 11% of our sales in Q2 compared to 5% over the same period in fiscal 2020. As a reminder, sales in the second quarter last year benefited from unusually high spending on material to produce facial masks and other PPE by our customers as well as high numbers of competitor store closures, driving total comparable sales growth last year in the second quarter of 54%. Starting in the third quarter, these costs will be much more pronounced as we expect to see one-time negative impact on gross margin of approximately $30 million in the back half, with our peak fourth quarter holiday seasonal business most heavily affected. And that actually leads me right into a follow-up, which is on just early read on quarter to date in Halloween and fall for the core demand, how are you thinking about customer-related materials given that last Halloween was probably a bit more lockdowns and this year's is likely to be. So again we're feeling pretty good, and really in the back half, the main event for us is being able to stand strong in our product for the seasons and have that inventory, that's where we do use disproportionate amount of our business in our EBITDA and we have made sure we have - we moved ahead in order to make sure that we're standing tall. But I think that's the way we're modeling and it is on a two-year stack basis, we kind of see the dust settling this year as we have always said is kind of, the quarters pretty consistently somewhere in that kind of mid-teen gross profit dollar versus two-year stack."
