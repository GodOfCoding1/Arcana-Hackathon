    "content": " Just curious as to whether there's a history when there's labor disruption in L.A. Long Beach going back a few years ago, I know the Canadian ports saw about a 13% lift in volume that was above normal due to some of that disruption and diversion. It's never going to take all the business away from L.A. Long Beach, but I think it can complement and create a very reliable supply chain for a steamship customers that will be able to take product to market in a very reliable, efficient fashion that, again, will diversify their book of business and make them not so dependent upon L.A. Long Beach and the ebbs and the flows of the challenges that occur on the West Coast. Think about CP-KC in the future and those export opportunities through the Gulf to service South America versus sort of the East Coast of Canada or even the West Coast of Canada, just lays out a compelling -- not only story in terms of diversification, enabling Canada's growth in potash for the future with Canpotex, K+S, maybe BHP in the future, but being able to do it on a single-line haul service to the Gulf of Mexico to service those markets, it's just that opportunity in itself jumps off the page. We're going to earn-in cost of capital, Jason, so we can continue to invest in the infrastructure and create a product that is not going to be easily defeated when it comes to competition, a great product at a low cost and it's a reliable service, again, that these 3 countries need that this combination uniquely will be able to unlock and create."
