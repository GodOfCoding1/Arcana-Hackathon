    "content": " The current quarter GAAP results include a gain of $305 million after-tax or $1.96 per diluted share that was recognized as a part of the exchange of shares of Dun & Bradstreet common stock as a part of the consideration for acquiring the remaining 40% interest in Optimal Blue Holdco and a $14 million discrete income tax benefit related to the creation of a deferred tax asset as a result of our reorganization of certain wholly owned subsidiaries within the Optimal Blue partnership investment structure. In the first quarter, revenues for the Software Solutions segment increased 12% to $331 million. In Origination Software Solutions revenues increased 16% and organic revenue growth was 10%, driven primarily by growth from new clients and the network effect in Optimal Blue that were partially offset by the effect of lower origination volumes, which was a headwind of approximately $4 million. Organic revenue growth was 2.5%, primarily driven by strong sales execution and revenue from new innovative solutions that are partially offset by the effect of lower origination volumes, which was a headwind of approximately $3 million and the previously disclosed reduction in scope of two multiyear data deals."
