    "content": " Going into a little more detail and beginning with commercial services, the team again delivered a strong quarter, taking full advantage of the surge in travel demand across the U.S. Revenue of approximately $85 million for the quarter represented a 28% increase over the same period last year, and compared to pre-pandemic levels, we achieved 25% growth over the second quarter of 2019. This is predominantly due to increase in cashless tolling and customer adoption across the U.S.  Moving to our government solutions business, we generated total revenue of $84 million, representing growth of 34% over last year. Finally, T2 Systems delivered $19 million of revenue for the quarter, directly in line with the deal model, and they remain on track to deliver full year results in line with our internal expectations. Total revenue increased approximately 46% year-over-year to about $187 million for the quarter, driven by strong operating performance across the company and the inclusion of Redflex and T2 Systems in our financial results. Driven primarily by our New York City photo enforcement expansion efforts, total revenue increased by $21 million or 34% over the same period last year to $84 million for the second quarter. Service revenue for the second quarter was $75 million, which grew $25 million or about 50% year-over-year. Organic service revenue growth, excluding Redflex, was approximately $11 million, or 23%, which was primarily driven by the aforementioned expansion of the New York City school zone speed program. In addition, adjusted EBITDA grew 13% year-over-year to approximately $29 million for the quarter. Moving on to cash generation for the second quarter, we generated approximately $65 million in cash flow from operating activities, resulting in $54 million of free cash flow for the quarter or a 61% conversion of adjusted EBITDA."
