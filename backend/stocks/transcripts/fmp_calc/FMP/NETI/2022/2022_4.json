    "content": " Case in point, during Q4 we signed two new contracts for one of the NG2500 vessels for between 75 days and 102 days of employment, which will generate between approximately $5.7 million and $7.1 million of revenue in 2023. Fourth quarter revenue was $46.6 million, which was higher than expected and the result of optional days being exercised, as well as extensions of contracts that were set to finish during the fourth quarter. Given the additional operating days and the extensions, $5 million of project costs that were expected to occur in Q4 will occur in Q1 this year, as these vessels continue to work at the end of the year."
