    "content": " Obviously the market conditions for those assets, which have a fair bit of employment in oil and gas-related work, has tightened significantly over the last several months, so we're seeing increased inbound inquiry not just for employment but for longer-term employment and also sale, but I revert back to what Robert mentioned, which is there's such a discrepancy between the share price and what the vessels can earn and that we are currently in the early stages of evaluating either selling or putting out on a longer-term business to try and capture that spread. I think that the fact that you are seeing a number of contracts being announced on newbuildings so far out in time prior to their delivery just shows that there is a tightening in that market; and there's a concern about available supply as we move through kind of delivery of our vessels and into '25, '26 and what have you. With regards to timing of when we may be awarded a contract, that really remains down to the procurement processes of our clients on our -- kind of the -- on the projects that we are most kind of focused on trying to get signed up, so I wouldn't give a time frame on it, but I would say that activity continues to be high, which is obviously shown by the number of contracts that are being announced. Maybe up until most recent quarters, you were bidding against, let's say, potential newbuilds wherever there is still time to build ships for these contracts, but I imagine now, just based on the most recent orders that we've seen, it's probably 2026 or at least late 2025 type delivery times. It's we're sitting here, saying to ourselves, well, we're fairly confident with what Sebastian is saying, that Emanuele was saying that the market is improving, that the -- actually supply and demand for the assets is strong over time."
