    "content": " Firstly, we have signed an amendment to the Zaratan and was originally contracted from April through June 2022 at the Akita and Noshiro Offshore Wind Farm in Japan and expected to generate $36.6 million in revenue. In February, the Seajacks Scylla arrived in Taiwan to start work on Orsted's Greater Changhua Offshore Wind Farm, which is completed installation of 12 megawatt Siemens Gamesa turbines should (ph) complete the contract to Greater Changhua in Q4 of this year and is then scheduled to mobilize from APAC to Europe, where Scylla commence its 2023 contract in Europe with Van Oord. Compared to last quarter, we've increased our 2022 annual EBITDA by $25 million to $30 million with the amendment to the Zaratan contract and additional contracts on the NG 2500s. I think that, how I look at it is rather like Zaratan on Akita project, so we secured a kind of anchor baseline of work, it may be possible to bring that forward and equally there may be --maybe options on the back end, but it's not going to be -- we won't be bringing it forward two or three months, because we are going from one project to the other and we have to demobilized and mobilize."
