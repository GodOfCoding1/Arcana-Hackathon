    "content": " I'm Sebastian Brook, I am COO and Co-Founder of Seajacks which has been installing wind turbines since 2009 and the operating platform of Eneti, responsible for operating and contracting the fleet of five vessels that are currently underwater, as well as the two next generation newbuilds which are scheduled for delivery in the second half of 2024, and the first half of 2025, respectively. This is going back quite a few years now, what we're seeing is rather like on the installation side, for the 2500s, people are concerned about being able to secure the availability of next year, this means that people are actually inquiring about work in the shoulder seasons, again, just to secure availability, and that'll drive utilization."
