    "content": " Now turning to our results for the quarter, consolidated net sales in the second quarter were just under $1.1 billion, an increase of 4% on a reported basis and 8% organically compared to the same quarter last year. Within our Global Retail segment, sales in the quarter were $272 million, a decrease of 3% compared to the same period last year on a reported basis and up 1% organically. New orders totaled $298 million in the second quarter, down 8% compared to the same quarter last year on a reported basis and down 4% organically. When you net all those together, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cost price of about 160 basis points positive and then the balance to get to the kind of the full quarter gross margin, you had some adverse product and channel mix, as well as those Retail inventory costs that largely hit us in Q2, a little bit in Q3 going forward."
