    "content": " Importantly, in the fourth quarter of 2022, Ocaliva generated $77.2 million in U.S. net sales, which is 13% growth over the prior year quarter. Our NDA is supported by a robust body of evidence from the OCA NASH clinical development program, including two positive 18-month interim analysis from the pivotal Phase 3 REGENERATE study and a large robust safety assessment that includes the 2,477 patients from REGENERATE with nearly 1,000 subjects on study drug for at least four years. Our fourth quarter net sales growth was 13% over the prior year quarter for Ocaliva in the U.S. For the full year, we reported worldwide Ocaliva non-GAAP adjusted net sales of $343.8 million, with $285.7 million in total U.S. net sales compared to $260.8 million in total U.S. net sales in 2021.

I guess just the last point I would stress is in any chronic class, and clearly, NASH will be over time, an important chronic class of therapy, it always takes multiple drugs to address the different segments of patients that are out there, and we're working towards defining the right introductory approach and the right segments for success for OCA and for the patients who have this high level of unmet needs.
