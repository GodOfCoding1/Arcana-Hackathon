    "content": " As the team will discuss later in the call, the long-term outcomes data and real-world evidence we're generating for Ocaliva and PBC are compelling to both patients and prescribers, and we're focused on reaching these audiences with these important data. While the REVERSE Phase III study, evaluating the safety and efficacy of OCA in patients with compensated cirrhosis due to NASH did not meet its histology primary endpoint, we were encouraged that the FibroScan data showed a reduction in liver stiffness of 3 kilopascals, a clinically significant result. Second, we'll be sharing the detailed results from HEROES U.S., our real-world study that leverages Komodo Health, a U.S. claims database, to compare clinical outcomes in a predefined group of patients with PBC who were treated with Ocaliva, and a comparable group of PBC patients who are eligible, but who were not treated. The real-world evidence we have accumulated thus far from large data sets in the U.S., U.K. and Europe is compelling and consistent and demonstrates the long-term clinical benefits of Ocaliva and PBC, specifically around transplant-free survival, which we know to be the most important goal for patients. But really, as we look at the range -- the broad range of patients who are benefiting from Ocaliva, I think we have a bigger opportunity there to look at now with our outcomes data, and what is the best predictor of those outcomes. And your next question comes from the line of Ed Arce with H.C.\n Firstly, I wanted to ask in PBC, given the additional data that you're submitting towards full approval, including COBALT and the real-world data sets, that you mentioned and in particular, the data around transplant-free survival."
