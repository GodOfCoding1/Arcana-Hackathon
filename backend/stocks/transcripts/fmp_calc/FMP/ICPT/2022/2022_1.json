To that end, we were pleased to present pilot data last year at the liver meeting from the Phase III POISE trial open-label extension, which showed that individuals receiving Ocaliva for PBC in the clinical trial setting has statistically longer transplant-free survival when compared to individuals from external databases they were eligible, but who did not receive Ocaliva.
