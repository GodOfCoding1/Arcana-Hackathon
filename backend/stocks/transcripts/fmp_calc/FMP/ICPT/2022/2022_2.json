    "content": " This is evident in the performance we saw in the second quarter of the year, where we reported $71.8 million of U.S. Ocaliva net sales, representing 5% growth compared to the second quarter of 2021. We're continuing to drive growth in our foundational business of Ocaliva in PBC executing the next step in support of OCA's potential as the first therapy in NASH, including the resubmission of our NDA and advancing our key pipeline programs. We delivered worldwide Ocaliva non-GAAP adjusted net sales in PBC of $100.4 million and U.S. net sales of $71.8 million, representing 5% growth over the prior year quarter. We know that there remains a sizable market segment of patients who potentially could improve with the addition of Ocaliva to their PBC treatment plan, and our commercial organization remains focused on reaching physicians with important data that can continue to drive growth and expansion of Ocaliva. We were also pleased to see the safety and tolerability results from this new interim analysis which included more than 8,000 patient years of safety data compared to 2,400 in the prior submission, and importantly, nearly 1,000 patients who have reached four years in REGENERATE. In the second quarter, we recognized $71.8 million in U.S. net sales and $100.4 million in non-GAAP adjusted net sales as compared to $68.2 million in U.S. net sales and $96.6 million in non-GAAP adjusted net sales in the prior year quarter."
