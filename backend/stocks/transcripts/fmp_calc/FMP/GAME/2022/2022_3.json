    "content": " To begin, total revenue for the third quarter of fiscal 2022 increased 15% to $9.2 million from $8 million in the same period a year ago. SaaS revenue for the third quarter of fiscal 2022 was $2 million, an increase of 22% from $1.6 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2021, and 5% higher sequentially when compared to $1.9 million in the second fiscal quarter of 2022. Secondly, advertising revenue for the third quarter of fiscal 2022 was $7.2 million, increasing 13% from the year ago period of $6.4 million and up 2% quarter-over-quarter from fiscal 2022 second quarter revenues of $7.1 million. For the third quarter, adjusted EBITDA improved on a sequential basis to a loss of $5.2 million, a nearly $1 million improvement compared to the fiscal second quarter of 2022. In sum, our narrowed focus on Frankly, Sideqik and Stream Hatchet deemphasizes our B2C gaming endeavors, increasingly defining the company as one that through its data and analytics, guides companies active in marketing to gaming audiences as well as addressing a broader array of brand sponsors, performance marketers, and media sellers' needs. And again, I think to your earlier sort of question about sort of privacy sort of related issues, as cookies become less sort of relevant in the future having sort of access to some of the tools within our influencer sort of marketing platform such as Sideqik and Stream Hatchet, it'll give us access to targeted audiences that are far more directed than what you could get through cookies today and not quite as targeted as first-party data, but far more informative and far more directed against sort of the brands and marketing partners that we deal with today at Frankly."
