    "content": " To further improve our resilience to rising turbulence of the market, ARMOUR raised $167 million of new capital in the third quarter through our ATM share issuance program that was accretive to our shareholders by $0.14 and insured healthy levels of cash liquidity even under the harshest stress test scenarios. And then the third question I have, and sort of a follow-up to what Trevor was, I think leading up to, is right now given where your stock price is and given the amount of liquidity that you have in terms of cash and unlevered securities, but my estimate, your cash unlevered securities is $3.56 a share, or roughly 70% of your share price."
