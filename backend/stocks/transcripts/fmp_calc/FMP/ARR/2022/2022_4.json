    "content": " While 2022 marked an all-time worst year for total returns on U.S. Treasuries and agency mortgages since their inclusion in fixed income indices, several trends beginning in the fourth quarter and extending into the new year give us optimism that 2023 will see a very constructive environment for MBS and our investment strategy. Sort of the way we look at expense and the ATM, when we look at the sort of the dollar difference between net landed proceeds and recent book value that we actually use to guide the ATM program for the full-year that dollar difference that we disclosed in the 10-K is about $9.5 million if you divide that by ending share count at the end of the year of about 163 million shares, you get $0.06 a share, or the $6 ending share price, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s kind of 1 percentage."
