    "content": " ARR allocated roughly 50%, $4.5 billion par of the portfolio to the production TBA contracts with superior market liquidity compared to the specified pool market, which struggled the trade in line with its fair value in times of heightened market volatility in early first quarter. With about 116% of our repo book hedged with current and forward starting swaps, we believe we\u2019re adequately hedged for the nearly 275 basis point Fed funds rate increase that\u2019s currently being priced in the market. So you wouldn\u2019t have thought looking at February 15, 2020, that we\u2019d be looking at investment opportunities 26 months later in the 12% to 15% area, because that\u2019s about 500 basis points better than what we\u2019re looking at then."
