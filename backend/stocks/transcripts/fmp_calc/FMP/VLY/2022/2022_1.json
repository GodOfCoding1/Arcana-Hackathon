    "content": " In the past 12 months, we have generated nearly $4 billion of organic loan growth, representing a 13% increase from March 31, 2021. Due to the exceptional growth generated in the first quarter and an improved outlook for the rest of the year, we are increasing our 2022 organic loan growth projections to a range of 10% to 12%. As a result of this higher growth and using the forward curve as of March 31, we now anticipate 2022's net interest income growth of between 8% and 12%. So Ira, I wanted to ask so if we look at the $750 million of loans from the expansion to Phily, Atlanta, Nashville, it's always great right to see banks doing what you're doing, but I always go back to having covered Valley for a long time, a predecessor, Jerry would always say the only way to grow in new markets was to offer a better deal than the banks that were already there. And there's an opportunity to layer strategic M&A that really accelerates that growth is something that we prioritized over the last few transactions that we've done, where historically, M&A might have been how do we think about cut costs within an acquisition and then really what is the or organization look like. But the last couple of deals that we've done have really provided us amazing organic opportunities today, and you're seeing that with 17% loan growth."
