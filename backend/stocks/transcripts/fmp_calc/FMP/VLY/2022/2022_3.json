    "content": " While loan origination slowed during the third quarter, net growth is above the high end of our anticipated range as a result of two key factors: first, as interest rates have increased faster than anticipated, payoffs have slowed dramatically; second, contributions from the residential and consumer portfolios exceeded expectations, partially as a result of cross-sell to legacy Leumi customers. I think a kind of base rate going forward, at least for the fourth quarter, expenses is $250 million, and then you can build your growth on top of that relative to a sub-50% efficiency ratio. Yes, Matt, this is Travis. Yes, Matt, this is Travis."
