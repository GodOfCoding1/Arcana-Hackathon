    "content": " Higher quarterly sales, margins, and profitability were mainly driven by increased enterprise customer demand and customers\u2019 acceleration of orders, primarily within our service provider vertical, of approximately $25 million to $30 million dollars that were previously forecasted to occur in our fourth quarter. Moving to our bottom-line, based on the third quarter\u2019s revenue performance and product mix, diluted earnings per share increased to $0.89 from $0.66 a year ago, an increase of approximately 35%. For the first three quarters of the fiscal year, we grew revenue in our service provider customer vertical by more than 7% year-over-year. As mentioned earlier, in the third quarter, several service provider customers accelerated orders with us that were previously anticipated to occur in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year 2022. Got it, that makes a ton of sense. Got it, that makes a ton of sense."
