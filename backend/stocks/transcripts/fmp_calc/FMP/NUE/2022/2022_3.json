    "content": " Joining the call today are other members of Nucor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s executive team, including Dave Sumoski, Chief Operating Officer; Steve Laxton, Chief Financial Officer; Al Behr, responsible for Plate and Structural Products; John Hollatz, responsible for Bar, Engineered Bar and Rebar Fab; Greg Murphy, responsible for Business Services and our General Counsel; Dan Needham, responsible for our commercial strategy; Rex Query, responsible for Sheet and Tubular Products; and Chad Utermark, responsible for New Markets and Innovation. Kingman is currently a rolling mill and we are leveraging that existing footprint and adding melt shop capacity there to efficiently meet the growing demand for rebar in the Western U.S. Lastly, at the end of the third quarter, we announced that the Nucor Board of Directors approved the construction of the galvanizing line at our Nucor Steel Berkeley sheet mill that is expected to begin operations in mid-2025 The Board also approved an additional galvanizing line to be constructed in the Western United States with details to be announced at a future date. And so what I would share with you and give you a little more than ambiguous or generalized statements, as we look at the contracts, particularly with OEMs that have been placed so far this year for 2023 and beyond, the long-term play as we see it today in the contracts that have been established are forecasting up in volumes, about 15% for next year."
