    "content": " Our excess usage revenue in the third quarter, however, was softer than we expected at $7.3 million down 3% year-over-year, up 17% from last quarter, but below the low end of our guided range of $7.5 million to $8 million, driven both by a slower recovery curve in core usage versus our expectations, as well as lower professional services revenue than we had previously forecasted for the quarter. We expect excess usage revenue to be between $5.7 million and $6.2 million in the fourth quarter, down 18% to 24% versus the fourth quarter of last year, again, impacted by the tough seven-by-seven comparison to last year, and slightly lower than last quarter when adjusted for the $500,000 early contract termination payment I mentioned earlier, which is largely reflective of the normal seasonal pattern of usage on our platform."
