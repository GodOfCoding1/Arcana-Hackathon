    "content": " However, we remain as committed and focused as ever to rebuilding gross margin and reaching benchmark levels over time through productivity initiatives, inclusive of Project Ovid in Automation to being very disciplined around launching gross margin accretive innovation, three significant pricing actions internationally to offset the impact of transactional FX for proactive price mix and category management as we are assessing additional opportunities to optimize category mix within each business unit and a strong emphasis on revenue growth management, taking an even more aggressive stance on SKU reduction and supply network optimization. Within that context, the top five priorities we are laser focused on include: number one, accelerating cash flow generation as we significantly right-size the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s inventories; number two, driving a recovery in gross margins as we turbocharge productivity and price internationally to mitigate the transactional foreign exchange impact; number three, significantly reducing overheads both in the U.S. and internationally by leveraging the scale of One Newell while closely managing discretionary expenses and optimizing advertising and promotion spending as well as the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s office footprint; and finally, redirecting investment towards higher margin businesses, in particular, writing to turbocharge innovation and to best leverage the power of our brands and diverse portfolio to meet consumer and customer needs; and third, delivering the next level of simplification and complexity reduction by accelerating SKU rationalization, transforming manufacturing operations and creating a portfolio of mega brands. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open."
