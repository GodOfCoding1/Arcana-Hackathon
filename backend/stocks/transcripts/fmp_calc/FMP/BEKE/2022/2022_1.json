    "content": " Turning to guidance for the second quarter of 2022: considering the housing transaction market is still at the early stage of recovery, and the potential negative impact of COVID-19 containment measures in certain regions, as well as the high base effect of the same period in 2021, we expect the overall market GTV of existing home sales to fall over 60% year-over-year in Q2, and the overall market GTV of new home transactions to decrease over 50% year-over-year in Q2, according to Beike Research Institute."
