    "content": " If you go back to a couple of the last cycles when rates have risen, we've been pretty much sort of 15% to 18% loan growth, and it comes back to where Mike Selfridge started with the service model being there for clients, acquiring new households and really serving their needs. And Mike, congrats on the promotion. So, I think our ability to acquire new households, the service model that Mike talked about, the seeds we planted in areas like the next-generation of households and relationship managers, the mix business to deposits 60/40, the channel, private banking, wealth management, which is now a large driver of deposit growth, business banking, relationship managers. And Mike, congrats on the promotion."
