    "content": " Despite the current margin pressure, we expect net interest income for the full year of 2023 to be down only 2% to 5% given our continued strong growth in loans, and investments. I mean, just because of the revenue side of the equation, it's just doing the math of 2% to 5% decline with net interest income, it's about 66% to 68%, with that guideposts with high single digit growth rates of expenses. And as a service organization, that's what we continue to focus on is that relationship with our clients to ensure they're leaving the right balance of in checking for their operating needs, and their other yield alternatives either in wealth management, money market, certificates of deposit, different alternatives. And so some of it is, if we had projected to grow headcount, we're going to grow a little bit less, Olga, I think, and Neil had mentioned this at Investor Day, there's some natural adjustment to our compensation levels, given the mix of business we're doing that's also factored in. For example, we've hired already announced two teams this year and wealth management, as Bob mentioned, that's a great opportunity for us to hire terrific people, bring them over and have new clients come into bank at the same time."
