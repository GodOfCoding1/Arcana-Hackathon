    "content": " Your line is now open. I would say so I think as we look around the world and I\u2019ll stick to the orders or order question obviously continued improvement in orders, I like the fact that when we look at things like U.S. POS or Fluke and Tek as an example, that those numbers were in line with POS or order growth was pretty close to our sales out. Your line is now open. And to be just consistent with what I\u2019ve said pretty much for the last nine months, we really never anticipated the supply chain issues would go away in 2022, what we anticipated and what I think what we saw in the quarter and will continue to see is the impact of our countermeasures. I think number one is if we look at tax performance in the quarter, you never like to say if China hadn\u2019t had, but the reality is we had an unanticipated shutdown of a manufacturing facility in the last week of the quarter, if we shipped some of that, that volume roughly $15 million, you\u2019re into a good growth rate for Tek. Your line is now open. So it\u2019ll slow a little bit in the second quarter because of a comp that we had a Gordian last year where they had a, some finishing of contracts that of job order contracting that was some upside in the second quarter last year, but in the base business and kind of on a two year stack, we\u2019re seeing good performance Q1 to Q2 sequentially with the common in those businesses for sure. I think the idea that we grew gross margins by 60 basis points in the quarter, I don\u2019t know a lot of companies that grew gross margins in this environment and for us to grow gross margins in the quarter, I think is just a real testament to the high quality work we mentioned on the slide, the price realization work, and the price kaizen that we do really, continuing to demonstrate our ability to get price, but also quite frankly, our ability to still maintain and deliver value to customers. Your line is now open. And then lastly, what inning you think Fortive is in, in terms of the portfolio pivot that has started a couple years ago, because you think back at 2016, you had a set of businesses and it\u2019s been dramatically changed in terms of a higher gross margin, higher recurring revenues, more software. Your line is now open. That doesn\u2019t mean we think most of our deals are getting to the 10% ROI in five years, and we\u2019re very pleased with progress, but coming out with the last couple years, we feel like we\u2019re inflecting here and we\u2019re going to start seeing more from these deals and that\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to talk about. I think we\u2019re in a really good place relative to those doesn\u2019t mean we won\u2019t have an issue or two, but I think what we\u2019ve seen certainly in the last several quarters, as well as these inflections have started to happen in the businesses. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. But I think at the end of the day, just more broadly about how we think about things, I would say, it\u2019s, we\u2019re probably still waiting a little bit more until some of the \u2013 maybe some of the uncertainties that we\u2019ve seen recently sort of find their way to kind of know in the natural direction of what that might be interest rates being one of them the macro, some of those things. Your line is now open. Yes, I think, it\u2019s something we spend a lot of time on Josh, obviously when you build a another 130 million in backlog, like we did in the first quarter, obviously a topic of conversation every month with our operating reviews, with the Presidents and CFOs, I would say I\u2019d break it into a few places within Fortive. Your line is now open."
