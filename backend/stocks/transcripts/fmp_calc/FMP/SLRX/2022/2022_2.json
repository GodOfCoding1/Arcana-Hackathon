    "content": " During this call, Salarius will be making forward-looking statements about operating metrics, future expectations, plans, events and circumstances, including statements about its strategy, future operations, the development and effectiveness of its investigational drug candidates, seclidemstat and SP-3164, as well as its targeted protein degradation program and expectations regarding its capital allocation and cash resources. I will first talk about seclidemstat, our reversible LSD1 protein inhibitor, and although, seclidemstat program is furthest along the development path that does not in any way diminish the excitement we have for 3164, our targeted protein degrader, where we plan to submit an investigational new drug application to the FDA and begin human trials next year. So a protein inhibitor in two clinical trials with interim clinical updates later this year, a protein degrader with preclinical data releases later this year with plans to enter the clinic next year and over $22 million in the bank as of June 30, 2022."
