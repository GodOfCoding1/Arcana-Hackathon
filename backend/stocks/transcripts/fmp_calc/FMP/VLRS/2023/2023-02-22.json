    "content": " The combination of a differentiated revenue management strategy and strict control of costs, enable our operating earnings to offset the around $550 million of full year fuel price impact, resulting in a margin of 5.9% in the second half of the year. For the full year 2022, ASMs grew 26%, in line with our guidance, comprising 22% growth in the domestic market and despite Mexico's FAA category status limitations, a remarkable 34% growth in our international markets. Finally, during the fourth quarter, we closed negotiations for 2023 with our labor union committing to an 8.2% salary and benefits increase. Total operating revenues for the fourth quarter reached $820 million, a 22% increase compared to 2021, driven by higher unit revenue. For the full year 2022, Volaris reported total operating revenues of $2.8 billion, an increase of 29% compared to 2021 levels, in line with our guidance despite the aforementioned economic volatility. At the same time, for the full year 2022, remarkably Volaris posted CASM ex fuel of $0.0426, up just 0.3% year-on-year despite inflationary pressures throughout our operations remaining significantly higher year-over-year. Finally, during the fourth quarter, we closed negotiations for 2023 with our labor union committing to an 8.2% salary and benefits increase. So, regarding the breakdown of the growth rate of 10% for the year, we are seeing slightly higher international growth this year despite being Category 2 in Mexico that is driven by the up-gauge of our U.S./Mexico routes to A321 capacity, but also the already mentioned growth in our Central American seats with the U.S., and international markets."
