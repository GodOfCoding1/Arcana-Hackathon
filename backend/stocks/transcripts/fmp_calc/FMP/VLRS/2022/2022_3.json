    "content": " Total operating revenue grew by 20% to $769 million in the third quarter and EBITDAR came in at $175 million, with an EBITDAR margin of 22.8% rising 7 percentage points from the second quarter of 2022 due to our remarkable utilization levels and cost advantage, coupled with a slight contraction in jet fuel prices. Third quarter travel came in at $0.082, up 6% versus third quarter 2019 and down 2.4% year-on-year, given the excellent performance in the third quarter of last year. Total operating revenue for the third quarter was $769 million, a 20% increase compared to 2021, due to the expanded capacity per with increasingly healthy load factors and solid unit revenue. For that reason, we believe it is also helpful to track adjusted CASM, which excludes fuel, redeliveries , which totaled $0.0378 compared to $0.0396 in the third quarter of 2021 and $0.0392 in the third quarter of 2019, decreases of 2.4% and 4.5%, respectively. Meanwhile, high fuel costs where we saw some relief during the quarter, drove total CASM to $0.0785 for the third quarter, a 24% increase compared to the third quarter of 2021, but a sequential improvement of $0.65 versus last quarter."
