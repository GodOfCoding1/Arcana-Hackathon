    "content": " Our Commercial Specialty segment grew by 13.4% to $214.1 million, driven by growth in our Penn-America binding small business, which grew 22% to $109.5 million. Our program division also realized growth of 8%, generating $72.6 million in gross written premium on strong rate increases of 10.6%. Our InsurTech business grew by 10%, generating gross written premium of $19.7 million. We -- in David's script, we noted that cat losses for the entire book were $12.7 million and on our Commercial Lines business, which will be our continuing business -- most of our continuing business, they were $5.4 million.

What you're seeing in the first six months, again, includes that $2.7 million credit and not a whole lot in the way of, I'll call it, special corporate expenses."
