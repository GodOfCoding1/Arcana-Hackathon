    "content": " Of course, the big news, which was included in our earnings release the last quarter was that soon after September 30 in this quarter, we purchased loans with UPB of $1.15 billion at a price of $998.5 million, which was an 86.6% investment on the purchase price. On the purchased loans, we had a return of 8.69% and when you look at all of this compared to the prior quarter, I would note that in the -- a year ago, we had $6 million of correspondent fee income and only $600,000 in the current quarter, which is great because we're looking for ways to grow our loan book and replace the correspondent fee income, which we've done well. I will say though, as we added $1 billion of -- in our loan book, we will see an increase in expenses in the third fiscal quarter and fourth fiscal quarter as we're going to be adding more people to service the loan book. On Slide 25, you can see that our loan discount combined is now $189.6 million, which is an increase of $150 million from where we were at the end of September as a result of buying the loans at a good discount this quarter. And if we look at the net interest income for the December 31 quarter was $28.7 million, which is the highest, and that's up to $20 million one year ago. Well, I think we will -- sort of generally been -- normally, we buy 100 -- excluding these big transactions, and not only we buy $150 million to $200 million quarter."
