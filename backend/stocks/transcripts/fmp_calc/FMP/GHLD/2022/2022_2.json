    "content": " Adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share came in at $14 million and $0.23 per share respectively for the second quarter of this year, compared to $32 million and $0.53 per share for the prior quarter. Focusing on the second quarter, we booked $47 million of favorable valuation adjustments of MSRs compared to $209 million in the prior quarter. For the second quarter of 2022, we generated $5.7 billion of total in-house loan originations, compared to $6.1 billion in the first quarter. Net revenue totaled $288 million, compared to $482 million in the prior quarter, while net income totaled $58 million or $0.95 per diluted share. Adjusted figures for the second quarter excluded a $46.9 million favorable change in fair value of MSRs, compared to a $209.5 million markup in the prior quarter with the differential largely attributable to an evolving rate backdrop. Our gain on sale margin came in at 363 basis points on $5.7 billion of total funded originations for the second quarter, down from 400 basis points on $6.1 billion of funded originations in the first quarter. Pull-through adjusted locked volume totaled $5.8 billion in the second quarter compared to $7.3 billion in the prior quarter, primarily reflecting a more challenging macro backdrop. For our servicing segment, we generated $64 million of net income in the second quarter versus $227 million in the prior quarter with the quarter-over-quarter decline, mostly a function of less favorable MSR valuation adjustments."
