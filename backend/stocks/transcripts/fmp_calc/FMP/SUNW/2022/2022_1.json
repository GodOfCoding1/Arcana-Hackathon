    "date": "2022-05-16 15:58:03",
    "content": " Multiple margin enhancing actions are currently underway in our business, including the implementation of programmatic price increases, targeted market share gains, optimization of our sales channel partner network and direct sales force, increased productivity resulting from recent headcount investments, and the adoption of lean principles to reduce costs and lead times and drive continuous improvement, which we would expect to reduce cancellation rates and improve margin. During the first quarter, our team continued to advance a multiyear business transformation designed to position Sunworks' solar business at scale, plus both domestic residential and commercial markets. The year-over-year variance was primarily attributable to $2.4 million of noncash expenses associated with the Solcius acquisition, and continued strategic investments in building our direct sales team, and onboarding COGS labor to support anticipated growth throughout the year as well as the impacts of inflationary pressures. Segment revenue increased 7.1% year-over-year on a pro forma basis to $26.4 million, driven by market expansion and executing our strategy of building a direct sales platform. Segment EBITDA loss was $2.3 million, driven by continued investments in our direct sales function, expanding our direct labor force to meet growing demand as well as inflationary pressures, which we expect to offset throughout the year through price actions and their positive effects of leverage."
