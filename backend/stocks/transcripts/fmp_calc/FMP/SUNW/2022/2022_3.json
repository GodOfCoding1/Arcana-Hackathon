    "content": " As household electricity bills continue to arise, order rates for new residential rooftop solar installations accelerated on a year over year basis contributing to robust organic revenue growth in the third quarter. While customer financing costs have increased in tandem with higher interest rates, originations during the quarter were at record levels as the economic case for residential solar remains highly compelling particularly for customers who value independent reliable access to renewable energy. To that end, our total backlog increased 116% year-over-year to $110 million at the end of the third quarter driven by broad-based origination growth across both residential and commercial end markets. Within our Residential Solar segment, total lots installed during the third quarter increased by nearly 50% on a year-over-year basis, driven by strong new contract origination sourced through our direct sales force. Our direct sales force, which now includes more than 600 agents in 14 metro markets, represented 23% of total Residential Solar segment revenue in the period versus less than 5% of segment revenue in the prior year period. Segment revenue increased 57% year over year to $36.7 million, driven by growth across all sales channels. Total residential backlog increased 18% sequentially to approximately $70 million in the third quarter, driven by growth in both direct and dealer originations."
