    "content": " In the fourth quarter of 2022, we were able to leverage our gross profit margin expansion into a 152% increase in operating income, through continued cost discipline with selling, general and administrative expenses down from the year ago quarter despite the impact of inflationary costs. Consolidated revenue for the quarter was $168.2 million, meeting the midpoint of our most recent outlook range of approximately 0.8% compared to the prior year, excluding the impact of unfavorable foreign exchange of $4.4 million in the fourth quarter, attributable to primarily the weaker euro to US dollar conversion. For the full year, revenue was $687.4 million, up 1.5% on a GAAP basis, but up approximately 3.7% when adjusting for $15.2 million of unfavorable foreign currency exchange impacts for the full year 2022, again, primarily due to the weaker euro to US dollar conversion. Note that SG&A expense for the full year '22 was $5.3 million higher than 2021, of which $2.2 million was due to the reinstatement of certain benefit costs, primarily restoring the company's 401(k) matching in the US. As benchmark rates are anticipated to be higher in 2023 than 2022, we expect an increase in our interest expense in 2023 to approximately $13 million for the full year of 2023 but we are focused on continued deleveraging to continue to reduce our outstanding debt balances. Additionally, adjusted EBITDA was adversely impacted by approximately $5.5 million in 2022 due to the aforementioned items, particularly or more explicitly, the expiration of the COVID-related wage subsidies received in Canada during 2021, which was a $3.3 million impact, a missing benefit this year and the expiration of temporary COVID cost reductions, primarily the resumption of the company's 401(k) matching for US employees in August 2021, which was a $2.2 million impact additive cost this year."
