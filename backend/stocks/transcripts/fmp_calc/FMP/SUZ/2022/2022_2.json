    "content": " The second quarter was marked by the continuity of the tightness of the supply and demand balance, mainly as a consequence of supply disruptions all over the world, such as new unplanned downtime events and the initial effects of the sanctions on Russian wood impacting European hardwood pulp production as well as the persisting logistics constraints, which consequently resulted in low hardwood pulp stocks. We continue seeing a scenario of low hardwood inventories throughout the chain as a consequence of logistic constraints, lower European hardware pulp production due to war-related sanctions affecting hardwood inventories and which should more intensely impact supply on the upcoming quarters as well as no major volumes from new projects coming into markets in 2022."
