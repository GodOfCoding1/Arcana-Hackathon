    "content": " Looking at 2023 as a whole, we see organic demand for hardwood pulp growing close to a million tons, which should, which should be further increased by a restock restocking movement in Asia once prices get closer to marginal costs and also supported by fiber substitutions favoring hardwood grades as well as single use plastic substitution. It is worth mentioning that inflation on production costs during these past two years, mainly driven by higher wood costs, have changed significantly the set points of decision making of higher cost producers, which should anchor different price levels when compared to previous cycles. Looking first to the 2022 cash cost performance x downtimes, as we were already seen on previous quarter, a new and higher level was established most due to the exogenous impact of commodity price on wood and input costs throughout the year. And then secondly, linked to this question, given this wood cost inflation which we see as in part related to the higher competition for forestry assets particularly in LatAm where there's a number of different pulp projects in our development, I was just curious to see, whether you believe that there's still competitive forestry assets to continue to support expansions of 1.52 million tons or above projects or whether you believe that we could be nearing that point or that lower availability of forestry assets could start limiting expansions in the industry? And we believe that once prices start falling in closer and reaching closer to this higher cash cost of marginal producers, decisions will be made mainly from Asian producers in terms of either reducing their production rates or stopping the production levels and then buying for also our customers restocking a bit based on their current inventory levels, which we consider quite balanced."
