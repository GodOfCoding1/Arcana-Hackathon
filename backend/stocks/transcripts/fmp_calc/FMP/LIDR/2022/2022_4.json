    "content": " I will then hand the call to Bob, who will review AEye's financial performance for fourth quarter and full 2022 fiscal year, as well as a few comments on our 2023 outlook. Matt, since you've come in, can you talk about the AEye product in the lidar market and the technology differentiation from your perspective, what you're hearing from customers and what you think is going to resonate as you do compete, it's a crowded lidar market, but I'd love to hear your thoughts coming out of the gate here. And also what I've really been impressed by is the actual design of the product, which minimizes the size and number of moving parts, mechanically speaking, that's going to be a clear advantage as we get further down the road, especially into the design validation testing and reliability testing that's required of the automotive industry. But especially given that we're in this go-to-market phase right now and a little bit of my -- or a lot of bit of my technical background weighing in, it's super important to really understand what the friction points, the constraints and the problems that customers are trying to solve and bringing that perspective back into the company and translating that to a set of objectives for the team and priority and focus."
