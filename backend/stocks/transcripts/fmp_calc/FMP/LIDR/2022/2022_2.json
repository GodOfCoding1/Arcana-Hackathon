So, that's the way we look at industrial is that, there is tremendous amount of different markets based on similar use cases, but they're all in our model, we're building the technology on one manufacturing line, and then we're using the software to add those capabilities in. In the industrial markets, however, to your point, we think the markets are maybe smaller in hardware volume, but that there is a lot more value to be added and therefore a lot more software margin to be gained, if you can produce, what they need to again either make it safer so my mind doesn't shut down to make it more efficient so I can increase throughput or to add a new feature so that I can actually do something I couldn't do before."
