    "content": " That's a little over $11 million per quarter, so it's not a huge amount by any means, if you were to average it out over those 11 quarters, so we're expecting to obviously look at the volumes, look at market conditions, and then decide how much will actually do each quarter. I think Joe, you also hit on one of our cultural imperatives, which is there's a lot of ambiguity in the world, and if you take a look back to last year, what we raised the largest pipe because we wanted to offset the possibility that redemption's would go up and that actually did happen. They truly appreciate that you're using automotive grade components, because the industrial market shocked by reliability has been the major issue with the LiDAR systems in the past, but they're actually trying to focus on how to actually deploy systems that make money within the next year. The second piece is that I think we're -- I don't want to misquote it because I don't have the exact number, but I think over 80% of the components are the same in this set of releases, which again reduces our complexity, increases our reliability, simplifies our design and, ultimately, we believe should actually reduce costs because you're using the same components and increasing volume on those components. Whereas in the automotive product, when you try to package it in the grill or on the roof or behind the windshield, size does matter and that's really what we believe is the key to our business model is that it was designed from the beginning to be software operating system focus, so that we can -- I think Joe brought up so we can work better with the compute platforms and that we can actually use the same hardware components across multiple markets."
