As we look forward sort of to the second quarter, we do believe we have opportunity to leverage store occupancy again also continue to be driven by the increased penetration of the digital channel as well as the fact that stores are now starting to improve and showing stronger business there, which we think will make up for the lack of the abatements now that we don't anticipate receiving in the second quarter as most of the restrictions have been lifted in the European market. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. So, I think that the work has been done the last couple of quarters and a lot of the improvement that you're starting to see in the apparel business particularly in May is a bit of a rebalancing, I think, of categories and really ensuring that the Anthropologie brand can meet both special occasions as well as more casual occasions in a way that she really loves the Anthropologie brand. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. But I will can tell you what we're going to do, and we're going to try to remain as disciplined as possible, because it's our belief and I think it's founded in the reality over and over again that lean inventories are the best, that fast -- speed to market is the best way to accomplish full-price selling and low markdowns, and we intend to continue to do that. Your line is now open. Your line is now open."
