    "content": " We believe Anthropologie is well positioned to deliver exciting fourth quarter results as October's double-digit comps have accelerated in November with a customer shopping early for holiday trim, decor, home and apparel. So they feel really good about our inventory position, the strength of our full price business, as well as now the customers returned to shopping from multiple occasions and we feel like we're in a good position to be able to deliver comps. I think both Urban and Anthropologie were more significantly impacted by this because their inventory volumes were a little bit lower than where Free People was running due to, obviously, the significantly strong chunk Free People comp and not to say that Free People wasn't impacted as well. And I think the other thing, I think is very important in driving the Anthropologie apparel business is the imagery that they're -- the team is now creating, and they -- and the -- all the marketing efforts that they're doing, I think that that's having a very significant effect on Anthropologie's apparel sales. And we think also is probably due in part to the consumer shifting up earlier, as well as us having more inventory to sell is partially a result of what we're seeing here an acceleration of sales for all three brands."
