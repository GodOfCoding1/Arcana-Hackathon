    "content": " Although supply chain costs will remain elevated throughout the first half of fiscal year 2023, we believe there is opportunity for us to improve our initial product margins versus fiscal year 2022 as the year progresses. Retail segment sales grew by over 200% versus fiscal year 2020 and they opened five additional standalone movement stores, bringing the total number to 20 at quarter's end. Based on current sales performance and plan, we believe our gross profit margins for the first quarter could be down more than 100 basis points to fiscal year 2022. In addition, we believe that the markdown rate in the first quarter will increase versus fiscal year 2022 when inventory levels were suboptimal and the markdown rate was at historically low levels. We believe favorable Q1 occupancy rates could partially offset lower merchandise margins compared to the first quarter fiscal year 2022, when store sales were severely impacted by closures in Europe and Canada, as well as capacity restrictions in parts of the United States. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. And please keep in mind, right, that the reason that your inventory could look higher versus fiscal 2022, we were significantly constrained last year and to the point where I feel very comfortable saying that we hurt sales. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. So, we believe that store sales for the year FY 2023 will be robust and up probably double-digits versus FY 2022, but we'll be up hopefully a little bit or maybe flat versus FY 2020. Your line is now open. You're correct in that right now as Melanie spoke to earlier, we believe gross profit margin will be down a little more than 100 basis points and that's versus fiscal 2022 and that will be largely driven by the freight pressures on IMU. Your line is now open."
