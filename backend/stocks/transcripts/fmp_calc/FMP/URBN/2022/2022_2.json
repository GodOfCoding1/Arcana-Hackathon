    "content": " We believe our retail segment comp sales growth could land in the mid-teens range, while the wholesale segment sales could decrease at a rate similar to the second quarter due in part to the realignment of the Free People brand customer base to focus on more regular price selling. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. I think you\u2019ve seen really healthy operating profit from Free People wholesale over the first course -- over the first half of this year in the high-teens and we would anticipate we certainly believe the brand can continue to execute at a high operating profit rates going forward, which should be favorable to what we saw in LLY in fiscal 2020 from the Free People wholesale brands, where they were more reliant on some closed out accounts and on some discounts and some give backs. Your line is open. Your line is open."
