    "content": " Second quarter operating income was $86 million, a 48% drop from last year's record profits, but a 10% increase versus FY '20. Early fall receipts have been well received by Free People's customer, and we believe that the brand's Retail segment performance could look similar in the third quarter to the second quarter. Now moving on to the Urban Outfitters brand, which delivered a negative 9% Retail segment comp versus the prior year, UO's negative comp was the result of disappointing performance in North America due to double-digit negative store and digital comp sales. As long as the economy does not get materially worse, we believe UO EU can continue to deliver positive Retail segment comps in the third quarter while the total Urban Outfitters brand could deliver results similar to Q2's results. So I think the -- we're seeing some large success that speaks to the right fashion in select national brands, brands that have resonated extremely well with the urban customer, really proud of those partnerships and the consistency that we've been able to perform. And certainly, feels like there's a lot of inventory out there right now and how quickly are people going to take their medicine and how promotional is the fourth quarter environment going to be is the area that we're not 100% certain on."
