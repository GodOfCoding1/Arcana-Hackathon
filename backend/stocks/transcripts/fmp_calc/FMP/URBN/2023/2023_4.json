    "content": " The strength in apparel, driven by a balance of interest in both occasion and casual apparel along with new customer acquisition has us optimistic that the Anthropologie brand can continue to drive nicely positive comps in fiscal 2024 with the first quarter of fiscal '24, looking similar to the fourth quarter of fiscal '23. Based on current sales performance and plan, we believe our gross profit margins for the first quarter could improve by approximately 100 basis points versus first quarter fiscal year '23. As a result, we believe that gross profit margins in FY '24 could improve by more than 200 basis points as a result of higher initial product margins and lower markdown versus the full year fiscal '23. So I think as Melanie mentioned in her prepared remarks, we are anticipating growing our operating profit rate here in fiscal '24, that will largely be driven by over 200 basis points of improvement in gross profit margin, which would be due to our improvement in IMU as well as favorable markdown rates on a year-over-year basis."
