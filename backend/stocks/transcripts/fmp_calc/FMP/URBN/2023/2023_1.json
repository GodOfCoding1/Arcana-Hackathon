    "content": " Last year, we reported comparable Retail segment growth of 10% in Q1 with Q2 accelerating 12 full comp points to a robust 22% While we still believe that we can grow sales in Q2 this year versus last year\u2019s impressive number, we believe our Retail segment comp sales growth could land in the low single-digit range and Wholesale segment sales could grow in the mid-single digits. starting to peel that battle a bit in Q3 and then actually being able to show improvement year-over-year in the fourth quarter as some of those strategies really begin to take hold, obviously, to get the full 500 of these strategies have a longer lead time as well as we're going to need to see a more steady ground and more normalization in the supply chain inbound freight costs than where we're at right now."
