    "content": " For example, any statements regarding trends and expectations for our financial performance this year and longer term, cash runway, revenue expectations and timing, new orders, products, services, technology, the timing of data publications, clinical and regulatory milestones, the outcome and timing of reimbursement decisions, future collaboration activities, cost expectations and our market opportunities, business outlook. Over the next couple of years, we expect some gross margin variability due to the fluctuate VA MVP volume, investments in new capabilities, such as dedicated production lines for liquid biopsy offerings, providing diagnostic tests, while we work to increasingly secure reimbursement expanding in China, adding our new facility and others. This year, 2022, is a little bit unusual, because we are setting up our new headquarter facility, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to cost us roughly $38 million or so of net cash this year, but going forward, the operating burn is going to definitely be below $85 million. I think the way that we will be augmenting our pharma business is a, with expanding our pharma business into many more time points because of the MRD product, but then also supplementing it with diagnostic revenue both from our NeXT Dx as it gets reimbursements and with our NeXT Personal test."
