With all of our progress on the mentioned milestones to date, we expect to be well positioned for entry into the clinical diagnostic market using our comprehensive tissue-based NeXT Dx test and we expect to begin selling a small volume of these tests to oncologist before the end of this year. Over the next couple of years, we expect gross margin variability due to headwinds from the lower VA MVP volume, investments in new capabilities such as dedicated production lines for liquid biopsy offerings providing diagnostic tests while we work to increasingly secure reimbursement, expanding in China, adding our new facility and others. We expect to get through these protocols through the next month, month and a half or so, but then expect to begin working with our first customer from whom we have orders from, and we expect to maybe realize or recognize a very small amount of revenue later this year in the fourth quarter ramping in 2023, obviously."
