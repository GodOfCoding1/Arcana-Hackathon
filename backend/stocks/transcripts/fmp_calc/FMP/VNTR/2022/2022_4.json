    "content": " Total company adjusted EBITDA in the fourth quarter was negative $57 million, compared to negative $8 million in the third quarter and $40 million in the prior year period. Although, we expect sales volumes to increase in the first quarter, this will be more than offset by higher cost of goods sold and lower average selling prices resulting in a meaningfully lower EBITDA result in the first quarter compared to the fourth quarter. Fourth quarter liquidity was similar to the third quarter as negative free cash flow of $48 million was mitigated by the receipt of proceeds from the completion of a sell leaseback transaction for our iron oxide Color Pigments manufacturing facility in Los Angeles, California, and a reduction in the amount of letters of credit with respect to the successful buy-in of our largest pension plan. Despite increased sales volumes thus far in the first quarter, business conditions remain challenging due to continued high energy and raw material costs and lower average selling prices compared to the fourth quarter."
