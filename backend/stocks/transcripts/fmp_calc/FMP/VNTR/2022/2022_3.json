    "content": " Based on our current order book and the demand environment, we expect TiO2 fourth quarter sales volumes to be lower than the third quarter by up to 20% compared to the third quarter. Our Performance Additive Segment delivered $9 million of adjusted EBITDA in the third quarter of 2022 compared with $19 million in the prior quarter, and $5 million in the prior year period. Notwithstanding a healthy demand environment for our Performance Additives products, we expect a significant decline in sales volumes as we have temporarily suspended production at our Duisburg Germany TiO2 and functional additives facility in response to lower TiO2 demand and high energy cost. Although we expect lower EBITDA in the fourth quarter as a result of the meeting actions, we expect cash flow to be positive as a result of working capital receipts release and proceeds received from the sale leaseback transaction."
