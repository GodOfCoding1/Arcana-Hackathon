For the year, EBITDA margin -- I mean, EBITDA increased 3.8% to $137.2 million, producing a margin of 29.6% of net revenues, which exceeded our guidance as expenses were still below normal in the first half of the year. For 2023, we estimate based on our current stock price, that our tax benefit associated with share based awards will be approximately $3 million for the first quarter and full year. For the first quarter of 2023, we expect our tax rate inclusive of the tax benefit from share based awards to be approximately 18.5% as compared to 9.7% in the same quarter a year ago."
