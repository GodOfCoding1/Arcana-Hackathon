    "content": " As we preannounced on January 10, for the full year 2022, we generated revenue in line with our guidance of $57 million, representing an increase of 6% compared to 2021. Turning to the fourth quarter, revenue totaled $15.2 million in line with the prior year period, driven by growth from the Cyclo G6 product family, US retina sales and other revenue being offset by declines in some retina products internationally. Looking closer at the Glaucoma business, Cyclo G6 revenue increased by 9% year-over-year to $4.2 million in the quarter. We achieved record international G6 probe unit sales and sold a worldwide total of 16,400 probes, representing growth of 8% compared to the fourth quarter of 2021. Now turning to our retina business; for the fiscal year 2022, product revenue increased by 2% to $31.7 million compared to 2021, despite some softness in international markets, leading to a decrease of 11% in the fourth quarter compared to the prior year period. Moving on to product revenues, the overall revenue from the Cyclo G6 product family in the fourth quarter was $4.2 million, up 9% compared to the same period in 2021. Our retina product revenue in the fourth quarter was $8.1 million, a decrease of 11% compared to the prior period. For the full year 2022, our retina product revenue was $31.7 million, up 2% compared to 2021. Other revenue, which includes royalties, services and other legacy products, increased 26% to $2.9 million in the fourth quarter compared to the same period in 2021. For the full year 2022, other revenue grew 20% to $10.6 million, compared to $8.8 million in 2021 on higher service, royalty, Topcon distribution and legacy product revenue. Our gross profit for the fourth quarter of 2022 increased to $6.7 million, up 11% for the same period last year."
