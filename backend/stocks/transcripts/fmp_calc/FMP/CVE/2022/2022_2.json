    "content": " Overall, the first half of 2022 delivered solid results, and we're positioned for an even stronger second half of the year, with net debt down to $7.5 billion at the end of Q2, we'll once again be looking to allocate 50% of Q3's excess free funds flow to variable shareholder returns. Given the current production levels, how should we be thinking about the potential projects that you have either underway or potentially underway at the timing to close as well as potentially the timing or ability to return production to at least 60,000 barrels a day or higher, just kind of given what you see currently on the asset and the relative underspending that it's seen more recently. And I think we have been talking about since the Husky acquisition, we've really been talking about organic, a lot of organic growth in the business, kind of brownfield growth, call it, capacity creep, debottlenecking and rather -- we're not focused on any large-scale projects."
