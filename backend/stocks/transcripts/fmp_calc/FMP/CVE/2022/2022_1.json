    "content": " When reported net debt is at the $4 billion floor, the company will target to deliver shareholders 100% of that quarter\u2019s excess free funds flow. So I think $4 billion from our perspective is the right level to, but we\u2019re going to commit giving back all the cash flow once we get there. Even with the cost pressures that we\u2019re seeing, I think we talked about $1.2 billion of total capital costs, $1.1 billion of insurance proceeds already received, with another $100 million to come. I think we are still \u2013 I think before you see the industry kind of announce an FID on the pathways foundational project, which is really the carbon capture and the transport of the CO2 down to the Cold Lake area for sequestration, we are going to have to get a lot more detail around the ITC, around other programs that are also going to be \u2013 I suspect, will be in place to help industry fund and cover the costs associated with that. But as we continue to see commodity prices stay even in this range, we expect we should get pretty close to that $4 billion debt target here by \u2013 hopefully, by the end of this year, and that\u2019s going to really pave the way for increased returns, both revisiting the base dividend along with the other two components we talked about.
