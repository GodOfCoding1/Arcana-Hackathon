    "content": " Grills revenue declined 16% to $150 million, with revenues impacted by lower unit volumes partially offset by higher average selling prices, driven by price increases taken in the second half of 2021, as well as the first quarter of 2022. And that's to really ensure that where we make investments, we have high a high degree of competence and to the extent that there's excess capacity within the P&L we will look to continue to kind of build top of funnel and/or rebuild top of funnel given some of the acceleration we've seen over the last two years. It's stabilized, which leads us to believe that 2023 and beyond we may start to see some building tailwinds on the container side, but in this year, we're holding guidance where it is on gross margin because one, we're sort of locked in not contractually, but effectively locked into kind of these elevated rates, which are holding a little bit of volatility from kind of week to week, month to month, but we expect the trend to hold through full year and to the extent that we see some tailwinds built, but will likely be captured in 2023. But in terms of the core business, which I would include meter in that equation, we still think that pre-pandemic gross margin levels make sense and that's something that we're targeting, I would say that we can't really pinpoint whether that's 22, '23 rebound, or '24 rebound. I think it requires a few sort of exogenous tailwinds as well, as the things we're doing internally to execute to ensure that we're making progress toward our internal targets on gross margin and the things that we can control, really tie back to the gross margin task force, as well as just some strategic initiatives that we have in place as we think about gross margin levers one of which is just continuing to drive operational efficiencies, which includes removing touches from the supply chain, it's about a assortment as you think about."
