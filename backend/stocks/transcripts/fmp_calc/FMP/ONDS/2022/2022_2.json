    "content": " All told, Airobotics has invested over $130 million in this technology platform and business development activity, which has resulted in a robust technology platform addressing high-value UAS markets. The decline in cash and cash equivalents was primarily due to spending related to research, product and business development Ondas Networks in American Robotics as well as the building of Scout systems. With this acquisition, not only will Airobotics help reduce redundant R&D spend and expand revenue opportunities with a new product line targeted at different markets, but we can also transfer the missing pieces of regulatory technology to Optimus, thus enabling the same type of automated BVLOS operation that the Scout system can conduct."
