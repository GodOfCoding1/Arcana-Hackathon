    "content": " We have outlined on a number of occasions how private wireless networks enable safe and efficient train operations, and specifically how new industrial broadband capabilities like Ondas's dot16-compliant system we call FullMAX and the value that provides rail customers with the ability to adopt new and advanced safety technologies. Once again, we consider these acquisition-related expenses to be non-reoccurring. Once again, we consider these acquisition-related expenses to be non-reoccurring. Also, you may recall that in May, 2020 when the FCC awarded the rails new 900 megahertz greenfield spectrum, one of the primary reasons cited for the award was the expected implementation of safety based applications, including increased support for rail integrity applications, continuous crossing monitoring, and advanced defect detection, which includes the hot bearing detectors, also known as hot box detectors that we've been hearing a lot about recently. Over the last 2 years, the rail industry has worked with Ondas, Siemens and other ecosystem vendors to develop a standards-based wireless system that would be robust and secure and would provide higher data capacity and flexibility in order to upgrade the private wireless communications network they own and operate starting with the 900 megahertz."
