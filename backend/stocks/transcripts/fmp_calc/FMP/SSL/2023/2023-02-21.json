Our speakers today are Fleetwood Grobler, President and CEO of Sasol; Hanr\u00c3\u00a9 Rossouw, Chief Financial Officer. In today's presentation, Fleetwood will cover the business performance, the financial performance will be covered in more detail by Hanr\u00c3\u00a9, and Fleetwood will conclude with a brief update on our ESG progress and Future Sasol. I'd now like to refer you to our forward-looking statement, which is summarized on the slide. During that time, we've had several key factors, notably the oil price that have continued to be supportive. However, other factors such as feedstock costs, chemical prices and slowing demand created substantial headwinds. We've also faced ongoing challenges in our South African business, both within and beyond our control. This changing environment also calls for a revised operational mitigation plan, which I will elaborate on. Looking at our Future Sasol aspirations, I'm particularly delighted by the key advancements made in our decarbonization journey reflected in several renewable energy power purchase agreements recently concluded and many others are at an advanced stage. Overall, the first 6 months of 2023 has been a challenging time, but I'm confident that Sasol has gripped the challenges that are within our control. Before we get into the detail, I would like to start by covering some of the key developments across the people, planet and profit framework over the last 6 months. Safety, as ever, is our first priority, and I'm pleased to say that we have been fatality-free since October 2021. We also sustained a recordable case rate of 0.27 for the period, which has remained flat compared to the financial year '22. There is no room for complacency, and we continue to keep safety at the core of our people's focus. On our planned pillar, the first half of the financial year has seen some key developments. In South Africa, we have concluded a total of around 550 megawatts of renewable energy power purchase agreements, a significant increase to the 289 megawatts announced earlier this year, paving the way for large-scale renewables integration into our value chain. Meanwhile, in Mozambique, our gas drilling campaign is continuing ahead of plan, which gives us more feedstock flexibility up to 2030. On the profit pillar, it's been a mixed performance as a result of a combination of macroeconomic and operational factors. Firstly, to improve the quality and stability of our coal supply in our South African operations, and secondly, to make the business as efficient as possible in order to navigate the areas that are seeing pressure from pricing and reduced demand. Despite considerable volatility over the period, the Board declared an interim dividend of ZAR 7 per share, in line with our dividend policy. Here, there were no fatalities for the first 6 months of the financial year. We have made good progress in embedding our safety principles across operations during this period, but we all recognize the need for a relentless commitment and focus on safety. And although we have seen the 12 month rolling high-severity injury rate decreasing from 16 at the end of June '22 to 7.6 at the end of December '22, we must keep striving to get this to zero. We also saw an increase in the number of lost workday cases in the period, resulting from elevated risks, which are playing out across our business. This mainly includes the number of security-related incidents related to movement of product and mining operations, which is something we are taking very seriously. This is a pleasing trend for the business given the complexity of our operations and the high number of activities, particularly during the total shutdown period in Secunda operations. The recent total shutdown was a major planned maintenance event, which historically takes place every 4 years on each side of the facility, involving nearly 50,000 workers and contractors on site doing extensive inspections and maintenance work. Congratulations to the Secunda team for completing this year's shutdown safely, on budget and with minimal schedule delays. Therefore, overall good progress on safety, but there remains work to be done. As I said at the outset, during the past 6 months, Sasol has faced a number of material factors that have combined to create a challenging operating environment. Looking at factors within our control, our South African value chain experienced operational variability, including lower productivity and coal quality in our Mining business, as well as the planned Secunda's each factory shutdown and unplanned outages. In the U.S., utilization rates were impacted by planned and unplanned outages, as well as the recent downturn in cracker rates to mitigate the effect of negative margins in a very challenging market environment. Looking at external factors, the weaker macroeconomic environment also had a very significant impact on our performance with lower demand across many products and correspondingly lower chemical prices. We also continued to experience this interrupted supply chains, high inflation and elevated energy and feedstock costs, which materially impacted our Chemicals business. In South Africa, persistent load shedding, infrastructure constraints, in particular, the poor performance of the national provider of rail and port logistics services and regulatory uncertainty continued to have a significant impact on our business as well as our suppliers and customers. Despite facing a challenging external environment, we remain committed to stabilize and improve performance of our own business by focusing on the areas within our control. With that context, clear, let me talk through some of the key elements of business performance. This was partially offset by the coal quality and productivity issues in the Mining business, which required increased external coal purchases, as well as utility cost increases. In order to improve productivity, we are now implementing the first phase of our full potential program, which I will unpack in the next slide. Secunda operations production for the first half of '23 was 2% lower than the first half of '22, mainly due to the planned total East factory shutdown and a few unplanned outages in this period. The Chemicals business recorded a 12% decrease in gross margin, mainly as a result of higher energy and feedstock costs. Total sales volumes were 5% lower, owing to a macro environment and divestment of the Wax business in the prior year. Continued supply chain challenges as a result of the flood damage in KwaZulu-Natal in quarter four of financial year '22, and strike action at Transnet rail and port services in the second quarter of financial year '23 negatively impacted the performance of Chemicals Africa. Furthermore, responding to weak demand, we reduced operating rates in the U.S. and Europe to match market demand and manage working capital in a low pricing environment. Looking at operational performance in South Africa, we successfully worked to maintain a healthy coal stockpile, well above our target of 1.5 million tons. We experienced unplanned outages on two of our reforming units in Secunda in November last year, Wonderformer  is back online, which provides an opportunity to utilize additional natural gas available. We expect the second reform to be back online before the end of the financial year, which will further improve our operational flexibility of the total reforming fleet. Coal quality and productivity are the key issues we are facing in South Africa, and our full potential program has been designed to provide a sustainable solution following a deep-rooted investigation into the underlying causes. The focus areas to improve productivity include prioritizing training initiatives, improving cutting time for each shift and reduce engineering breakdown times. We are seeing a changing landscape within the mining industry in South Africa in general as we must contend with increasing regulatory pressure, aging mines and more complex geology. In the previous decade, we installed additional oxygen gasification and reforming capacity in Secunda operations. And an inflection point has been observed in both the ash content and the percentage of sinks in our goal, specifically over the past year or two, resulting in a detrimental impact on gasifier performance. On coal quality, our understanding of the issues has evolved significantly over the last few months. Firstly, quality of coal mined to ensure that the right quality is targeted to get the optimal blend as feedstock to the Secunda facility, which includes options such as mechanical interventions, to assist the continuous minor operator with horizon control, which will limit the cutting of stone in the roof and in the floor of the coal seam. Secondly, to improve coal blending by maintaining a high stockpile, which minimizes variation of quality of coal to the Secunda factory. Lastly, implementing institute controls at the mining coal phase will assist in managing the contamination during the mining process. In the longer term, in order to address the issues, we have a robust pipeline of studies and projects which are at different engineering stages, and we will provide more clarity when milestones are reached. Furthermore, the appointment of executive leadership positions for mining was the right thing to do, and we are seeing the benefits in terms of operational learnings and a much higher level of transparency. For Secunda operations, we are focusing on initiatives to improve reliability or online time of the facility as a whole to maximize profitability of the SA value chain. Furthermore, we are actively progressing all opportunities to maximize the use of natural gas in the factory. Looking at operational stability in our international locations, ORYX GTL's performance for the first half of '23 was impacted by the delayed start-up of Air Separation Unit 2 following a fire in June 2. We anticipate the Ziegler unit to reach 100% available at capacity by the end of quarter three, post the implementation of the repairs in the legacy unit, leading to a substantial improvement in volume and margins within the Chemicals Americas segment. In Europe, we continue to elevate and evaluate buy versus make decisions for certain intermediate products and where feasible, substituting own production for cost competitive purchase product. As an example of this is in Italy, where we have purchased external intermediates and feedstocks to support the ongoing production of key products within the Essential Care Chemicals division. We are also progressing actions to reduce our dependency on natural gas, which includes switching to alternative sources of power generation, such as renewable and green sources at the Brunsb\u00c3\u00bcttel and Augusta sites. We expect to see an increase in volumes, mainly in the Essential Care Chemicals division due to the improved demand resulting from lower energy costs now in Europe, the absence of customer destocking and the reopening of China after the change of the zero-COVID policy. Given the factors I've outlined, covering both internal and external dynamics, I will touch on just a few financial metrics before I hand over to Hanr\u00c3\u00a9, who will expand on the detail. Our EBITDA increased by 1% to around ZAR 32 billion, while cash generated from operations increased 5% to ZAR 21 billion. This is mainly due to higher oil and refining margins, offset by higher energy and feedstock costs. In line with our commitment to maintain shareholder returns, as I've already mentioned, we declared an interim dividend of ZAR 7 per share. On that note, I will now hand over to Hanr\u00c3\u00a9 to take us through the detailed financial results for the reporting period. In summary, we faced a combination of macroeconomic challenges as well as our own operating challenges in this half, which resulted in a relatively flat financial performance, which is below what we would expect to deliver in this pricing environment. I'm confident that through the actions and initiatives that Fleetwood shared, we will recover business performance across our SA and international assets. Despite favorable oil prices and refining margins, we were faced with higher feedstock and energy costs, higher inflation and weaker demand growth. However, the weaker exchange rate negatively impacts the translation of our U.S. dollar-denominated debt, which I will talk about later. With the recovery of natural gas storage levels and lower seasonal gas demand in the United States and Europe, we expect to see a continued normalization of natural gas and ethane prices. Looking forward, we expect the volatile global economic environment to continue weighing on prices and demand in the short term. The South African economy is faced with underlying structural cost constraints, which are further exacerbated by ongoing disruptions from Eskom and Transnet affecting ourselves as well as our suppliers and customers. Notwithstanding these challenges, we strive to remain agile and focus our efforts on managing to market demand, as well as maintaining our cost and capital discipline through our Sasol 2.0 transformation program. Although cash generation and profitability, both at an EBITDA and EBIT level, remained relatively flat, the diversification benefit of our portfolio is evident in the EBITDA pie graphs, highlighting the changes in contribution from the various business units. Note that our usual EBIT comparison by segment is somewhat distorted by a number of non-cash adjustments for this period, as well as the comparative period. Non-cash adjustments for this financial year includes a net loss of ZAR 6 billion, mainly on re-measurement items resulting from impairments and reversals mostly impacting our Fuels and Chemicals Americas segment. Core headline earnings of ZAR 24.55 per share increased by 9% compared to the prior period, supporting sustainable returns to our shareholders with an interim dividend of ZAR 7 per share declared. Let me now turn to the segmental highlights, starting with the Energy business. In our Mining segment, adjusted EBITDA decreased by 4% compared to the prior period. This was largely due to a combination of lower productivity, which resulted in higher external coal purchases to ensure a healthy stockpile and coal mix to our Secunda operations, as well as lower export sales due to ongoing operational challenges at Transnet. Adjusted EBITDA for our Gas business was up by 3% compared to the prior period, supported by higher inter-segmental gas prices from Mozambique linked to higher oil prices. Our fuel segment delivered a strong performance with adjusted EBITDA increasing by 92%, benefiting from higher crude and refining margins and weaker exchange rates. The business was negatively impacted by a combination of factors, which included the scheduled Secunda shutdown, as well as other operational challenges. Our Africa segment was impacted by a combination of production challenges and supply chain disruptions, which affected the export of our chemical production - products as well as our ability to get certain products to local customers. However, the average sales basket price for the financial year was 5% higher, which supported a 10% increase in EBITDA. Chemicals segment, adjusted EBITDA decreased by more than 100%, mainly driven by the significant margin squeeze resulting from higher ethane costs and lower prices where inflationary pressure and weaker economic growth negatively impacted base chemicals demand. This was further impacted by planned shutdowns, as well as the unplanned outages on the Ziegler and polyethylene units. Chemicals Eurasia with adjusted EBITDA down 34%, continued to be impacted by the higher energy cost as well as feedstock costs as a result of the war in the Ukraine and China and the China lockdown. In mining, we expect productivity to remain between 900 to 1,000 tons per continuous miner per shift as we focus on ensuring the safety of our workforce while implementing the full potential program. In our Gas segment, we recently increased the volume guidance to 111 billion to 114 billion standard cubic feet as we are seeing the benefits of the drilling campaign. The impact of potential power outages on external customers and demand can however, affect our production volumes. Taking these factors into account, we reiterate our recently adjusted Synfuels production forecast of 6.6 million to 6.9 million tons for the year with our South African liquid fuel sales volumes to range between 52 million to 55 million barrels. Sales volumes for the Chemicals Africa business is expected to be 0% to 4% higher compared to the prior year following the recovery from supply constraints, which we experienced. In Chemicals America, we expect sales volumes to be 5% to 10% higher than the prior year, which included the ethane cracker shutdown. We anticipate that this volatility will continue throughout the rest of the financial year, which may have a negative effect on our operations and outlook. So far, the achievements from this program has given us some headroom to withstand the inflation impact on our business. Looking at our performance for the first 6 months of the year, we realized ZAR 2.7 billion in net sustainable cash fixed cost savings towards a full year target of over ZAR 5 billion through the implementation of the new operating model and reduction of external services, which continues to deliver sustainable benefits. We also realized ZAR 2.3 billion gross margin improvement, progressing well towards our target of ZAR 3.5 billion. However, given the high inflation environment, there is some risk in meeting the 2023 guidance on both cash fixed cost and gross margin. However, our commitment to the financial year 2025 targets remain steadfast. We continue to drive delivery of the financial year '23 targets with a focus on potential risks and mitigation actions, which is key for the success of the program. Our year-to-date maintained capital expenditure of ZAR 16 billion includes the total East factory shutdown, as well as progressing the PSA project execution, which remains within its overall approved budget and schedule. To date, minimal growth capital has been incurred with spend mainly towards progressing the Sasol green hydrogen pilot project, which aims to produce first green hydrogen by the end of this calendar year. In conclusion, I would like to emphasize three key points in our capital allocation framework. Firstly, we remain balanced in our capital allocation process, focusing on safeguarding shareholder return commitments, deleveraging the balance sheet and selective growth investment. I'm pleased to announce the launch of Sasol Ventures, a new corporate venture capital fund with a targeted investment of a modest \u00e2\u0082\u00ac50 million over the next 5 years. Secondly, a key priority remains sustainable returns to our shareholders. I'm pleased with the declaration of the interim dividend, as I mentioned earlier. And lastly, we continue to proactively manage our balance sheet, ensuring we maintain robust liquidity and optimize our debt maturity profile. As at the 31st of December 2022, our liquidity headroom was US$4.5 billion, which is well above our outlook to maintain liquidity in excess of US$1 billion. We successfully refinanced our 2022 debt maturities, and we are assessing all options to proactively address our 2024 maturities. Our current net debt of US$4.5, excluding leases, increased slightly compared to the comparative period, but we continue to work towards our goal of further reducing debt levels. With our greenhouse gas emission reduction goals firmly embedded in our future Sasol strategy, I am delighted that we have progressed several key milestones to realize our 2030 target. Once these projects are operational, they could reduce our Scope 2 emissions by approximately 1.8 million tons per annum. We are also working hard to conclude significantly more agreements this year towards our goal of 1,200 megawatt renewable energy procurement. In our Chemicals business, we have concluded a further 3 PPAs for Italy amounting to an estimated 18,000 tons per annum CO2 emission reduction by 2026. In the U.S.A., virtual power purchase agreement negotiations have progressed following the stabilization of solar panel imports post the market and supply chain disruptions in 2022. Further, Holiferm and Sasol Chemicals have expanded our collaboration to develop and market a sustainable surfactants. Since March 22, Sasol and Holiferm have collaborated on research and development on to accelerating innovation to help meet the growing demand for sustainable solutions in primary surfactants. This joint venture will focus on opportunities related to staff production with the JV's main purpose to develop, build, own and operate ventures producing SAF from nonfossil fuel feedstock based on Sasol and Topsoe's technologies. The long-term impact the JV will have in offering solutions to decarbonize the hard-to-abate aviation industry is truly exciting and aligns well with Sasol's purpose, innovating for a better world. As Hanr\u00c3\u00a9 mentioned, we have also today announced Sasol Ventures to advance Sasol's decarbonization and 2050 net zero ambitions through Venture Capital. In line with our green hydrogen ambition, three of our programs, namely Sasolburg green hydrogen production, high shift study to produce sustainable aviation fuels in Secunda and the Boegoebaai green hydrogen development program were setted  as strategic integrated projects by the South African government in December '22. This designation enables the program's implementation to be expedited, demonstrating South African government's commitment to supporting the private sector in developing the new green hydrogen economy. For the half year, we have invested close to ZAR 780 million globally in socioeconomic and skills development a clear affirmation of our commitment to remain a catalyst for positive change in our communities around us. A few highlights I would like to showcase for this period, our Techno-X, Bridge to Work and the Inhassarro Training Center. Celebrating its 20th anniversary Sasol Techno-X is one of South Africa, if not Africa's largest career guidance exhibition, bringing science and technology to life through interactive workshops and exhibition stands. Our first-ever virtual Sasol Techno-X was a resounding success, attracting over 35,000 learners from all over South Africa and neighboring countries. In August, we launched Sasol Bridge to Work, a multi-project program that intends to reduce unemployment in our communities of Mpumalanga, Free State, Gauteng and KwaZulu-Natal. In November 22, Sasol handed over the Inhassorro Training Center in Mozambique, which has begun operating from this facility comprising of five classrooms and three large workshops for practical lessons in mechanics, electricity and industrial welding. For us, the focus remains reaching our future Sasol ambitions. Growing shared value while accelerating our transition is our key objective, while always making sure that we have safe and reliable operations. We will continue our pursuit of zero harm, maintaining our cost and capital discipline and improve our operations at mining, unlocking the full potential of Lake Charles and value uplift remains an important priority. Through these efforts, we intend to enhance cash flow, which will support both disciplined growth investment and deliver competitive and sustainable shareholder returns. As we progress plans to meet our 2030 greenhouse gas reduction targets, we built the foundation for achieving our 2015 net-zero ambition. To conclude we are reporting on a period when we faced a number of operational challenges and headwinds, which have held back performance. At the same time, Sasol must transition to a lower carbon future in a responsible manner balancing the interest of our different stakeholders. I am pleased with the progress we are making, which places us well to meet our stated targets, underpinning a sustainable future for Sasol. Good morning, and welcome to this question-and-answer session for our 2023 interim financial results. To my left, Riaan Rademan, EVP of Mining; Priscillah Mabelane, EVP of the Energy Business; and Brad Griffith, EVP of our Chemicals business. Also participating online, we have Simon Baloyi, Charlotte Mokoena, Marius Brand, Vuyo Kahla and Harman Venold   I will be toggling between the two platforms to give everyone a fair chance to ask their questions. For now, we'll start with the questions on Chorus Call. Operator, if you could please allow caller number one to ask their question. The dividend payout ratio is 36% to 40% of core HEPS However, the first half dividend was a 28% payout ratio, which is slightly lower than your guidance. I think in terms of hedging, it's important that we maybe just take a step back, looking at our change in approach to hedging. I think given the deleveraging of our balance sheet, we've significantly scaled back our hedging. So we've dropped the coverage of our hedges, especially the oil hedges from around 50% for this past financial year to now around 25% going forward. So after the conclusion of this financial year, we've implemented swap contracts, so effectively not giving away upside in the use of zero cost collars which is still in existence till the end of this year. So those gains that you see on the balance sheet is then the previous unrealized gains at the end of the previous period where oil was trading well above $100 a barrel, that have now translated into gain. One aspect, though, that you would see, and we can talk about that in further detail later is the cash flow impact of the previous year's hedges. But important though that this year's remaining zero cost collars are very comfortable in the collar kind of - in terms of the third quarter, the ceiling there is $98 a barrel and for the fourth quarter, it's $123 a barrel. Again, let's just go back to the dividend policy. We've highlighted that the dividend will be declared on a payout ratio of 2.8 times cover effectively relates to a 36% payout ratio, and we would step up the dividend to a 2.5 times cover, which effectively is a 40% payout ratio if that then drops to below $4 billion sustainably. In the payment of an interim versus a full year dividend, we guided at the full year results that we'll use a 40-60 split. So effectively, the cover at the half year would be scaled back to allow them for the full year cover to be a bit of a catch-up. So that 40% out versus 60 full year resulting in the 3.5 times cover rather than the 2.8 average that we're aiming for, for the full year. In terms of operations, the last 12 months have been challenging. Does it affect both Secunda and Sasolburg or only one of these sites, and that comes from Keith McCaslin at Integral Asset Management. We have seen that our mining operations has been under pressure, mainly because of quality and productivity issues. We've also seen that our major supplier, which we've got a contract to deliver 4 million tons of coal is also under pressure and hasn't delivered the volumes per the contractual agreement that we planned for. To bolster that shortfall both from that long-term contracted as well as our own, we've engaged with a short-term supply of additional coal that is delivered to our facilities in Secunda. We believe that this is a short, medium-term measure, which we will not be able to sustain in the long term. And therefore, our focus now after we have assessed very thoroughly the impact of coal quality on our Secunda operations, we have now come up with a plan to bring us back to a blended quality over time where we know we will have optimized the value out of the Secunda value chain. So internally, I will touch on two or three measures that we are really focusing on with vigilance at this point in time. The first is, of course, everything is built on our safety remediation program, which we indicated last year, is our priority. This year, our priority is now to build from that bedrock and start to increase productivity. And secondly, it is about how to get better quality of the existing coal in our mines to Secunda. Now two things I've mentioned is that, one, is if we have increased productivity, the volume to our mines gives us more flexibility in the blending of the feed into Secunda. And secondly, it helps us to get just a better output from our gasifiers in terms of the gas it produced. So our other short-term measure, and I've alluded to that, we are very excited to look at de-stoning options on our own mining complex or our own mines to see how that can help us to reduce sinks and ash such that, again, the quality that we feed into our Secunda operations can be optimized. We've implemented now that at the first colliery Syferfontein, that will be running for the rest of this financial year. So in FY '23, we believe that this Syferfontein implementation will help us when you compare the first half to the second half that we will see better output from our own mines in the second half, and we will see an improvement in the quality that we bring to bear. We've received a number of additional cars back from maintenance, still not to the full supply, and we continue to work with them also to get additional railcars into the fleet, so that we can recover that. My first question you spoke in December about the aging mines, Bosjesspruit  and Twistdraai. Second question, what are your views on the Kinetico project, which is very close to Secunda. I would start off with the goal, and I'm going to ask Riaan to weigh in on that one. But suffice to say, as we go into our coal deployment strategy, Herath , our own mines have always been supplying in the region of around 34 million, 35 million tons per annum. And so currently, we do have a long-term contract on Isibonelo that supplies the 4 million tons going forward. Now if we look at the time to 2030, of course, we need to think about how to replenish the contract that comes to an end from Isibonelo, which is by 2025, '26 which we are in discussions with them, how to mitigate that. And in addition to that, what other sources could be at better quality coming into Synfuels that is warranting maybe an increase in costs compared to our own. In terms of capital allocation, we have always planned that Alexander Block needs to be operationalized towards the next year or 2. And of course, if we're looking at de-stoning options, we need to consider the capital outlay for that. But that will be done on a full-fledged business case, considering the benefits, the unlock of value and the quantum of capital. And then secondly, it will be optimization between productivity cost, unit cost and then obviously capital. Herath, thanks for the question. Secondly, our expectations is that this will actually be charged at global competitive prices for this very small volume as well. So as such until there is clarity on the regulatory framework from a certainty perspective to ensure that the gas market is sustainable, it's going to be quite challenging to engage on these opportunities to understand the available position for South Africa. Herath, thanks for the question. And in fact, we ran full rates until we started to see the margins collapsing during the August, September time frame. So during that period, then we both agreed to cut back operating rates for the polyethylene units and the cracker. And then, of course, you're familiar with the situation around the LDPE, where we mentioned in our results that we had numerous operating problems and mechanical issues that slowed bringing that unit back to market. In the case of the third and fourth quarters actually Sasol nominated higher volumes of ethylene for our market because we saw margins starting to open up, and we wanted to move some volumes of ethylene while Lyondell operates certainly a much bigger network, and they have to make their own decisions on the volumes. And then secondly, on the feedstock side of things, the gas in South Africa, you're talking about potentially bringing in additional gas to second . Obviously, you've put through quite a material impairment to Secunda Synfuels in the half. Could you confirm under those impairment assumptions, do you have Synfuels returning to the 7.6 million tons that its historically ran at over the medium term? Suffice to say is that we do want to get back to the number that we historically have seen as the potential but I would only be able to give that as a clear target once we've done our assessment of these options, the quality sources, the deployment. All of that, hopefully, we would conclude by this year. So in the past, we have seen the benefit of having ample gas from Mozambique could unlock anything between 100,000 and 150,000 tons in the Synfuel operations value chain. That is historically, we've seen that unlock through ample natural gas from Mozambique. And as of December, now we've got those infill well drill that we drilled is flowing. The other aspect that we have to consider is that, the total shut that is now happening every 4 years, but it's going to be on a different frequency going forward, is also impacting to the extent of about 100,000 tons. And so if you just look between that 200,000, 250,000 tons, that is immediately within our grasp in the near term to restore. And then on top of that, that's where we're now going to build the right quality of coal and volume that we need to bring into Secunda operations that will take us back to the historic type of output. And that output number, we can only share with you once we've done proper homework, done proper due diligence on alternative suppliers, done proper assessment on how de-stoning may or may not help us, as well as all the other interventions that we are running in parallel at this point in time. So I'm going to ask Priscillah, if there's anything on Mozambique gas and then the cost of coal, Hanr\u00c3\u00a9 to conclude with. I think anyway, you've answered it just to bring some data into the room. And all of these wells are performing in line with expectations, some slightly surprising us, and we see this as positive news for us. I think just on the question around the price for our purchased coal, Chris, I think you're in the right ballpark. I think important to note, though, that all coal is not created equal. And certainly, price versus quality is important. So of course, that also has a no impact on low-quality coals that we try to procure. But we do expect, as our productivity levels improve as Isibonelo perhaps also steps our performance that we will - we will buy less coal. So in terms of refinancing, a critical aspect for us, of course, is the revolving credit facilities that mature in 2024 as well as the US$1.5 billion debt. We've already proactively engaged with our banks to look at the refinancing of those facilities and the bond, as I've stated in the presentation. Certainly, in terms of the bond, the $1.5 billion, plan A would be to go to the bond market. I think in terms of the gas prices, I suspect that relates to the - to our domestic gas prices there, as you might have seen that we've not added the determination from NERSA to - for new prices. So we have just rolled last year's prices, and those discussions remain ongoing. I think suffice to say that there is in the industry, a general estimation that there is a slight recovery that is being building up, but let me have Brad's context on that. I think building on Fleetwood's point, we're seeing some mitigation in the energy and feedstock prices in the U.S. So when we look at this versus our outlook, we're still confident in our outlook on U.S. volumes. And I think margins then is going to depend on how we see the progression of the energy, especially the ethane price and the ethylene and polyethylene prices in terms of the large base chemicals segment. Of course, for our U.S. operations, Ziegler is another key factor, and we're expecting to restart the remaining capacity by the end of this quarter, so by the end of March. If I take Faisal's question, thank you for the question about this current quarter, it's quite mixed. I think one of the reasons why we saw such a drop off in the fourth quarter was December itself because we saw major consumer goods companies, automotive manufacturers, catalyst producers so abrasives producers cutting back to almost nothing of demand while they were destocking during that period. And so as we had indicated in our trading statement back last year, we've been adjusting our production to meet demand so that we were avoiding building up working capital at the end of the year. So we are seeing the rebound of volumes but to our outlook, I wouldn't say that anything is surprising to the upside and we continue to monitor it. I think we also commented that in Asia, where we often see the price points start to inflect one way or the other, we are seeing a bottoming out of pricing, especially as we see China starting to come back into the world economy with demand and production. I think following on from the questions on chemicals, the results show challenges on the offshore operations and what is Sasol strategy on offshore operations to sustainably mitigate the negative impacts we have on the results from . And I think on the first question with Bongani's  request, what are the challenges in offshore operations, yes, I think very much so if we look at the varied impacts of energy and the disruption of that high cost in Europe vis-\u00c3\u00a0-vis the whole U.S. play with demand and cracker rates. And we believe that it's not structural, but that it is going to - going to correct itself. We're actively managing the business to make sure that the potential that's there to mitigate the red numbers where we can mitigate that, we'll do that. But that also puts us in a very good position when energy prices recover when demand recover, we will have the firing power immediately to ramp up back into those supplies. And I think therein lies the actual outlook going forward is if we can master that, I think those businesses will perform very well going forward again. I think on the variable costs, earlier on during the presentation, Hanr\u00c3\u00a9 has covered a lot, some of the drivers with regard to feedstock, particularly on the coal side. But again, invariably, we are seeing quite a substantial increase in terms of utility costs. At the same time, we've also last year indicator that we have closed out on the separation, the ASUs with Air Liquide. So it's multiple factors, but those three are probably the most prominent cost drivers and available costs. I'm going to ask Priscillah to deal with the Mozambican drilling campaign because it's a couple of aspects that is always blending in, but I'm sure we can unpack that for you. As you will recall that we started with the drilling campaign predominantly looking at few wells, which buy three of those, which will work over wells as well as new wells to ensure that we restore the plateau going forward. And that goes back to the reference that Fleetwood made to say that we are seeing additional one stock and more guests going forward, which gives us flexibility for our business. In addition to that, we started with the PSA program, which also includes well drilling. We have so far drilled about 6 wells, and most of those are actually in line with our expectations, and we are progressing with the floor lines to connect those to our processing units. In addition to that, we have originally indicated a few more opportunities that we're exploring that are either at an FID level or at Gate 3 or 4, and those are also progressing according to plan. Our plan is that as we get into the year-end, we'll be engaging with the auditors. One of the encouraging factor that will be taken into consideration is that by the end of June, we are on track to submit our P50 analysis for PSA to Mozambique. So that will give us another lens in terms of what can we book as reserves versus resources, and we'll make all of that information available to only investors. Now you can imagine we are running about at a feed of 100,000 tons per day into Secunda operations, which means you can do the sum, if a stockpile is a certain level then you deplete that quite quickly. But we have, through the decades of experience have set that minimum stockpile to mitigate risk in terms of supply from our own mines and others at the 1.5 million tons. And so each one has got its own unique quality of - in terms of fines, ash, sinks and those parameters. So you can also then imagine if your stockpile is higher, your flexibility if one mine is now down, that's producing good coal and you've got stockpile of that mine that's now fallen away, you've got flexibility to then blend from that existing stockpile to make up for the good mine that has now fallen away for two or three days. So that is the flexibility we talk about is to get a ratable quality by mixing, it's like baking a cake every hour with the best ingredients that you've got. And so when we go forward, I think we are also thinking about how can we even increase that 1.5 million ton that even will provide greater flexibility in getting a better input of the blended quality into Synfuels. And as we sit here today, we are well above 1.7 million tons of stockpile. I think before we move over to Chorus Call, there's perhaps one more - another question on - relating to coal. It would be brownfields, although it is a reserve belonging to Sasol Mining that's not been exploited yet. As Fleetwood had said earlier, we probably look at FID by the end of this calendar year. Chorus Call operator, if you could please direct the next question. Firstly, just on the SA fuels division, you've touched on the high variable cost increase. Secondly, on the Mozambican gas, please would you mentioned extending gas to 2030. Thirdly, for Riaan, we saw going about coal quite in depth already. But just simply, what flexibility do you have to increase volumes to offset lower quality coal. I'm going to start off, and I'm going to ask Priscillah to weigh in on the fuel price, the crude oil and then the margin in the fuel itself. With respect to Mozambique natural gas and the flexibility of the volume, I will start off in terms of the positioning there. As a matter of fact, we have indicated that we have confirmed the extension of the gas plateau to 2028 and that we are currently working on other options to see whether we can increase that even further. We're working hard to achieve that, but we have not reached that point yet, but it's all in the making at this point in time. With respect to the flexibility that volume will bring to offset coal quality, I'm going to ask Riaan just to give you a very simple sort of high level explanation of how that may play out. And then I'm going to ask Priscillah to weigh in on the fuel part question you had, Adrian. So in terms of flexibility and output, we - we are focusing on both of those output. So - and as Fleetwood has explained, we will roll this program out at the rest of the operations as well going forward. As far as flexibility is concerned, in mining, and I will keep it short, I promised Fleetwood, I won't talk detail. So what you need to have a look at is creating petrom  Now what petrom means is if you have an area where there is not sufficient - well, there's some geological surprises that you were not aware of that you can move that production unit to another area. And then obviously, the other one that we had to make sure that we're in time with is so-called ventilation shaft, to create in areas where there is coal but not sufficient ventilation. Obviously, the Board - the Sasol Mining Board and the Sasol Limited Board has not limited us on Sasol  capital. So where capital is needed and it makes sense, it is a proof to help us, Fleetwood. I think the additional flexibility, Adrian, also comes back to what I've explained earlier. So if the productivity for your best quality mine increases, you can increase that stockpile and use more of that to mitigate some of the other mines that don't have that output and to blend that bad quality away if you want to call it like that. Just perhaps, Fleetwood, to explain a bit more on the gas as well. And then thirdly, we're then going to be looking at Peter  that FID will come through next year. We are busy looking at opportunities, the near fills, which is a third element that we have licenses and we're engaging with Mozambique government to see whether we can find good opportunities. As part of this drilling campaign as we move forward, we'll probably be testing a few of those wells to see whether there could be opportunities to extend that part to 2025 - sorry to 2030. But at this stage, these are opportunities that are in our funnel that we're working hard on and on track in terms of meeting the different stage cases and ensuring that they're economically viable. So what we've actually seen is that as our production was slightly lower in terms of our volume, in order to meet some of our obligations, we had to import. But at the same time as well, we have seen that some of our crude prices have been substantially high, particularly with Africa crudes, they are coming slightly higher in terms of spreads to what we've seen in the past. And we have now reviewed our crude strategy and trying to look at whether we can find partners to broaden our sourcing strategy and approach to be able to mitigate the resource because our scale and capacity does not warrant prices that we can negotiate, especially during a high demand and supply period where we're seeing that the - are loss of disruptions and increased demand for that West Africa crude. We are equally also continuously having discussions with our partners from a Saudi  perspective, to see how we can also reduce the spreads from that. So just on the refinancing, I feel a bit like a card player that's been asked to show his complete hand, but I'd be happy to show you some of my cards. But we've got planned B, C, D, E and the rest of the alphabet as well. In terms of the other options, certainly convertible bond is - ranks much lower. I think given the market conditions, as we noted last year - in the last financial year, it was an option - the only option available for us in terms of refinancing the 2022 debt maturity. Certainly, as you highlight, another option is to refinance into rand, that would help us in terms of our longer-term focus to reduce the dollar-denominated debt. So still to that point, we've got a total of $6 billion of dollar-denominated bonds and debt. The second question from Herbert, how does the headcount increase align with the Sasol 2.0 program? So as part of Sasol 2.0, we had a significant decrease from the 31,000 to the 28,000 people that we have as full-time employees. In terms of our full co justification at the time, it was required that we would increase headcount to man up for that 24/7 operations. And we still need to - then on top of that, deliver the full business output from the Fulco justification, that means this full potential per section per mine. That means to get the productivity and volume output up, so that it can pay for this additional FTEs that we had to employ, as well as that we need to also deliver on the mining committed to Sasol 2.0 targets that will start to play into delivery towards 2025. So I think in terms of our capital allocation framework, Hereth, the first allocation of capital, the first order is certainly just in terms of maintaining the business. And as we outlined in that commitment, though, after we've applied cash back into sustaining and maintaining our business, it is to return cash to shareholders. So I think that commitment remains firm, and we believe that we will continue to be able to de-gear the balance sheet even with this volatility. I've got to say in terms of the 6 months that we've just experienced, and I think there's been some concern around net debt levels increasing from 3.8 billion at the beginning of the period to 4.5 billion at the period end. So in terms of the guidance of Synfuels, we've got 3.2 million tons in the first half. Full year guidance, of course, 6.6 million to 6.9 million tons, so up to 3.7 million tons in the second half. And of course, also the movement in net debt covers the payout of a full year dividend. But certainly, there's no question around our commitment to not only the base dividend, but also then stepping up the dividend as we expect to see further de-gearing in the balance sheet. I think one last question that we have online, which I think Priscillah has already given quite a lot of color on, but perhaps if there's - Fleetwood, if you could just clarify. I think as we've indicated previously, we are continuing to work with partners to look at opportunities. At this stage, we still believe that for Sasol's on demand we don't necessarily need LNG before 2028. Nevertheless, we're also encouraged by the opportunities that were mentioned earlier that we're seeing in the South African market. One last question, perhaps for you, Hanr\u00c3\u00a9. So in terms of further returns to shareholders, definitely in terms of mechanisms to return further cash either special dividends or buybacks would be considered further than just the stepup of the dividend, as I've mentioned, from 2.8 to 2.5 times cover. From - on behalf of Sasol, we'd like to thank you once again for your participation today."
