    "content": " Total worldwide revenue for the 3 months ended June 30, 2022, reached a new quarterly high of $14 million, a 14% increase from $12.2 million in the same period of the prior year, and an increase of 19% on a constant currency basis. International revenue in the second quarter of 2022 was $5.3 million, a 5% decrease from $5.6 million during the same period last year and an increase of 4% on a constant currency basis. Despite this incremental headwind and continued macro uncertainties, we remain confident in our ability to achieve full year 2022 revenue within our previously communicated range of $55 million to $60 million, keeping in mind that we do expect some level of summer seasonality and continued sequential growth throughout the year. What we saw, and it's actually kind of -- I could go far afield with this, but basically, accounts that are the more deeply experienced sort of more deeply engaged accounts as you would expect, we're the first ones to come back. So we would expect to see some modest sequential increase in sales on a quarter-over-quarter basis between 2Q to 3Q, but I would weight more heavily the bulk of that $33 million if you're modeling to the midpoint of our guidance towards the back half of -- or towards the fourth quarter of the year. So that's about $1 million and we're not going to be in the business of trying to predict where exchange rates go, but certainly, currently where the dollar sits, that's going to impact our future sales into next year if things don't move. It's not like it's 0, but they're not doing what we -- China was growing compound annual growth, something on the order of 100% for a couple of years and then COVID hit, and we got frozen pretty good there."
