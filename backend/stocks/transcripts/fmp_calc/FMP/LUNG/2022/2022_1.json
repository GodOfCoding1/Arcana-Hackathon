Total worldwide revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2022, was $10.8 million, a 17% increase from $9.2 million in the same period of the prior year and an increase of 20% on a constant currency basis. US revenue in the first quarter was $6 million, a 40% increase from $4.3 million during the prior year period. International revenue in the first quarter of 2022 was $4.8 million, a 4% decrease from $5 million during the same period last year and an increase of 3% on a constant currency basis. We continue to expect operating expenses for the full year of 2022 to fall between $100 million to $105 million, inclusive of approximately $16 million of non-cash stock-based compensation expense, as we continue to build out our commercial operations, invest in our research and development programs and further scale our business.
