    "content": " Our total revenue growth is primarily attributed to the growing contribution from cloud revenue, which represented a record 59% of total revenue, up from 54% in Q2 last year and increased 27% year-over-year to a total of $311 million. Revenues from Financial Crime & Compliance, which represented 19% of our total revenue in Q2 and totaled $102 million, increased a record 31% year-over-year, driven by strong growth in both our cloud and premise business. We had a real record quarter in terms of the growth of Financial Crime & Compliance growing 31% year-over-year, which is \u00e2\u0080\u0093 far back as I remember, it's a record growth for Financial Crime & Compliance crossing the $100 million in revenue, which is just phenomenal."
