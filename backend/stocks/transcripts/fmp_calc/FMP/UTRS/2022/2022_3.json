    "content": " All statements made on this call that do not relate to matters of historical fact should be considered forward-looking statements, including statements regarding the markets in which Minerva Surgical operates, trends and expectations for Minerva's products and technology, trends and demands for Minerva's products, Minerva's expected financial performance, expenses and position in the market and outlook for fiscal year 2022, and the impact of COVID-19 and its variants on Minerva's operations and Minerva's customers' operations. Total revenue for the third quarter of 2022 was $12.6 million, a slight increase from the third quarter of 2021, but a small decrease of $0.4 million compared to the second quarter of 2022, which is line with the seasonality we've seen in past years whereby Q3 sales are slightly lower than Q2 sales. At the product level for the quarter, Minerva ES was $5.9 million or 47% of total revenue, up slightly from $5.8 million or 46% of total revenue in the third quarter of 2021. Genesys HTA was $3.6 million or 28% of total revenue in the third quarter of 2022, down from $3.9 million or 31% of total revenue in the third quarter of 2021 and Symphion was $3 million or 24% of total revenue in the third quarter of 2022, up from $2.8 million or 22% of total revenue in the third quarter of 2021. Gross margin in the third quarter of 2022 was negatively impacted by increasing costs in the current macroeconomic environment, as well as the small decrease in the overall volume of products shipped and by the changing product mix away from our Genesys HTA ablation product to Symphion, which today has an overall lower gross margin profile."
