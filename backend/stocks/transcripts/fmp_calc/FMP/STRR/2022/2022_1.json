    "content": " With the completion of our January 2022 equity offering for gross proceeds of $14.3 million, we're now well-positioned to fund our high-return internal growth investments, and to pursue acquisitions which could be either bolt-ons for our Healthcare or Construction divisions, or entry into new business sectors. In the first quarter, our Healthcare division revenue increased by 0.8% over the same period last year, to $13.4 million. Gross profit for the quarter increased by 22.2%, and gross profit margin increased by 4.2 percentage points over the same period last year, also due to increased percentage of higher-margin products sold. First quarter 2022 Construction revenue and gross margin percentage were $11.6 million and 13.6%, respectively."
