    "content": " On a segment basis as compared to the second quarter of 2021, our Healthcare division revenue decreased by 6.4% to $13.9 million, predominantly driven by a decrease in revenue from fewer total scanning days due to the national shortage of nuclear medicine technologists. This substantial improvement in consolidated adjusted EBITDA was due to operational improvement and a bottom line turnaround in our Construction division, where segment non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA swung from a negative $2.8 million in Q2 of 2021 to a positive $1.3 million in Q2 this year. On the wall panel side, we had a few projects that got delayed into the third quarter that we were hoping would be done in the second quarter, but our pipeline there remains as strong as it's ever been, as multi-family housing continues to be a very strong segment in the upper Midwest and that's the market that we serve with wall panels. The healthcare business is a bit different, because it's typically a doctor's office considering purchasing $0.25 million camera and a change in their operating methodology to allow us to do scanning on their behalf is a big decision."
