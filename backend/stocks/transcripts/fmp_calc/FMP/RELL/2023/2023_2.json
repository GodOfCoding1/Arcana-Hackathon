    "content": "  Net sales for the second quarter of fiscal 2023 increased 22.1% to $65.9 million compared to net sales of $54.0 million in the prior year second quarter due to higher net sales and our Power and Microwave Technologies, or PMT, Green Energy Solutions, or GES, and Canvys business units, partially offset by slightly lower sales in our Healthcare business unit. PMT sales increased by $3.8 million or 10.2% from last year's second quarter, driven by growth from our manufactured products for our semiconductor wafer fabrication equipment customers and distributed products for RF and microwave applications. Net sales for GES increased $7.4 million or 150.3% from last year's second quarter, GES combines our key technology partners and engineered solutions capabilities to design and manufacture products for fast-growing green energy market and power management applications."
