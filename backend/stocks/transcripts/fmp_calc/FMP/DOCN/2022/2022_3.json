    "content": " We set a goal of getting the growth rate above 30% by focusing on the most impactful opportunities we saw, from improving the customer experience to reducing churn, which was upper teens, driving expansion in our cohorts through adding relevant products and features such as managed databases and Kubernetes and building a sales capability to better penetrate our $70 billion addressable market. Excluding Cloudways, our high-spend customers, those that spend at least $50 per month grew 29% year-over-year to 122,000 and now represent 86% of total revenue, up 300 basis points from Q3 2021. Including the 20,000 greater than $50 customers within Cloudways, our total high-spend customer count increased to 142,000, a 50% increase year-over-year. Most exciting of all, despite the uncertain economy, we took decisive action that meaningfully increased our business capabilities with the Cloudways acquisition, which will help us better address the $70 billion SMB cloud market, which positions us for both self-serve and managed services customers. At our core, we focus on three key areas: revenue growth in excess of 30%, faster than the SMB cloud market growth rate, increasing profitability and growing free cash flow for shareholders."
