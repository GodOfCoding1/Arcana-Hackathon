    "content": "  Stacie Clements: Good afternoon everyone and welcome to PubMatic's Earnings Call for the Third Quarter Ended September 30, 2022. Today's prepared remarks have been recorded, after which Rajeev and Steve will host live Q&A. I would like to remind participants that during this call, management will make forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, statements regarding our future performance, market opportunity, growth strategy and financial outlook. Forward-looking statements are based on our current expectations and assumptions regarding our business, the economy and other future conditions. You can find more information about these risks and uncertainties and other factors in our reports filed from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our most recent Form 10-K and any subsequent filings on Forms 10-Q or 8-K which are on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission and are available at investors.pubmatic.com. All information discussed today is as of November 8, 2022 and we do not intend and under obligation to update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise, except as may be required by law. In addition, today's discussion will include references to certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP net income. As we suspected, Q3 marked an inflection point with respect to a deteriorating economic environment. However, despite the impact on global ad spend, we delivered adjusted EBITDA margins of 39%, above our expectations and significant free cash flow, highlighting the durability and differentiation of the PubMatic business. Year-over-year revenue growth in the quarter was lighter than we expected and more pronounced in the back half of the quarter, including in the U.S. which is our largest market. On the bottom line, our single omnichannel platform with fully owned and operated infrastructure gives us a high degree of operating agility to create leverage in our business and sustainable profitability. Despite the near-term economic pressure, I am confident in the medium- to long-term outlook for PubMatic because of our ability to consolidate activity on our platform and grow our market share. Historically, we have seen that in times of economic stress, our ecosystem leans into deeper partnerships with technology leaders that provide innovation, efficiency and automation. We are well positioned to continue to gain market share in this kind of an environment, even if absolute rates of growth are lower. With that investment, we widen the competitive gap and further strengthen our market leadership with a focus on positioning ourselves well for the economic upswing that will inevitably return. Today, we partner with nearly 1,600 publishers which provides a critical scale required by global ad buyers. Today, as consumer privacy is increasingly important and third-party cookies are going away, sell-side technology is becoming even more critical to the digital advertising ecosystem. This is manifesting in a variety of ways, all of which strengthen PubMatic's long-term outlook. There's no question that the open internet is gaining share of digital ad budgets at the expense of walled gardens, in part due to content quality and diversification. This, along with the shift to fast-growing video and connected CTV formats, is foreseeing buyers and publishers alike to seek greater transparency into and control over their advertising strategies which independent technology providers like PubMatic are best positioned to provide. Without a technology partner like PubMatic, the majority of publishers will not be able to do this which is becoming fundamental table stakes in commanding higher CPMs and monetizing premium inventory. For example, Wunderkind ran a month-long test campaign using audiences sourced through PubMatic compared to various alternatives. These performance benefits highlight the value that marketers see in moving their targeting efforts to the sell side, closer to the publisher and the consumer. What's more, our strength in data activation and addressability is also unlocking growth opportunities in the fast-growing retail media market. As retailers are increasingly looking for incremental revenue opportunities, data monetization becomes an even more important aspect of their businesses. Kroger Precision Marketing, for example, works with PubMatic as a scalable technology provider to help their brand and agency clients to activate their retail data science and CTV, video and display inventory. Supply Path Optimization, or SPO, is a way for buyers to consolidate ad spend and gain greater control and efficiencies. In Q3, over 30% of activity on the PubMatic platform was SPO-related. We continue to expand SPO relationships as we did with Havas Media Group North America in Q3, adding new capabilities, workflows and data integrations for buyers. In September, we acquired Martin to bring more robust solutions to buyers and accelerate our SPO efforts. As automated buying of CTV becomes ubiquitous across the ecosystem, we are seeing more interest in programmatic buying or unified auctions. As an omnichannel platform, we have been singularly focused on scaling this automated approach to CTV buying and selling. Finecast, a subsidiary of WPP focused on addressable TV buying, bought 10% more inventory when compared to nonprogrammatic approaches as a result of the application of data, automation and the granular inventory access our platform provides. Advances in data-driven advertising technology, like Connect, will further fuel the growth of programmatic CTV. We recently released a suite of enhanced capabilities for OpenWrap OTT, helping publishers drive more revenue and increase flexibility and control while also making it easier to extend their monetization strategies to CTV. Multicultural media company, My Code, saw benefits from managing all of their inventory types in one place, allowing them to compare, manage and optimize across platforms. Similarly, True Digital, a business unit of the leading telco conglomerate in Thailand, saw increased fill and higher CPMs for their CTV inventory with OpenWrap OTT. Stepping back, we've built a resilient software business that enables publishers and buyers to grow their businesses and compete effectively in the digital advertising ecosystem. Accordingly, in this environment, we are focused on 2 operating objectives: first, continued investment in long-term innovation. This unlocks incremental revenue opportunities today but more importantly, should result in outsized gains when ad spending inevitably reaccelerates. Key areas of innovation include supply path optimization, accelerated by our acquisition and integration of Martin, CTV, addressability and retail media. And second, we are focused on maximizing the efficiency of our CapEx and OpEx investments that have already been made. Over the last 3 years, we believe we have expanded our competitive moat as a result of significant CapEx investments in our infrastructure and impression processing capacity. On the OpEx front, we feel confident with the scale of our go-to-market teams in the near term and will lower the rate of head count growth with a bias towards selective hiring in engineering and innovation in order to be well positioned for when ad spend growth reaccelerates. Our long track record of profitable growth and significant cash flows, coupled with our strong balance sheet and 0 debt, gives us confidence that we will come out of the downturn stronger than most. Although revenue came in light due to global ad spend deceleration, we continue to gain market share. Importantly, amidst these conditions, we made targeted investments for future growth and strengthen our financial position. On revenues of $64.5 million, we achieved adjusted EBITDA of $25.3 million, a 39% margin. With this backdrop, I want to remind investors about several fundamental reasons why we are confident that we can continue to navigate through the current headwinds and be well positioned to accelerate our growth when the operating environment stabilizes. Our omnichannel platform supports numerous programmatic ad channels and formats, enabling thousands of advertisers across 20-plus verticals to reach the audiences they want. With more than 60,000 advertisers purchasing our publishers' inventory in Q3, we saw spending in aggregate across the top 10 ad verticals increased approximately 19% year-over-year. Travel, food and drink and business were each up over 40% year-over-year which helped offset softness in shopping, technology and personal finance. We saw a similar pattern in the depths of the pandemic and based on our prior experience, we anticipate that this format will return to growth. With the likelihood that difficult economic conditions will continue in the coming quarters, the durability and strength of our financial model is the second fundamental factor that gives us confidence we can successfully manage through this volatile period. To begin with, we have built a business with a high degree of control over our unit economics. For example, through innovation and focus, we have been increasing our revenue mix towards high-value channels and formats like mobile and video. Over the last 2 years, we have strategically invested to grow our competitive moat and ensure we avoid supply chain disruptions. Looking ahead to 2023, we see many opportunities to optimize our infrastructure and expect to be able to significantly lower our CapEx. In aggregate, we anticipate these efforts will lead to higher gross margins and improve free cash flow margins as ad spending normalizes. Innovation, customer focus and initiatives like supply path optimization helped us achieve strong net dollar-based retention. On a trailing 12-month basis, our net dollar-based retention was 120%. For 19 of the last 20 quarters, we have generated positive cash from operating activities with the only exception being the pandemic quarter of Q2 2020. For the trailing 12 months through Q3, we generated approximately $96 million in cash from operations and $50 million of free cash flow which represented a growth of 40% and 91%, respectively, compared to the prior year period. At the end of Q3, we had no debt and $166 million in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. Excluding our recent acquisition of Martin, our overall ending Q3 cash position would have been $194 million. With our strong balance sheet and efficient business model, we believe our position in the ecosystem will continue to grow via new and expanded customer relationships. Beyond our current balance sheet, we have enhanced our financial resources with a new $110 million undrawn committed credit facility. In Q3, we increased our India-based head count by 46% year-over-year compared to a global head count increase of 29%, supporting further innovation and cost efficiency in 2023 and beyond. In Q3, SPO represented over 30% of activity on our platform. With our recent acquisition of Martin, we added key technical talent and new tools to fulfill buyer requests for more robust measurement and reporting capabilities. In spite of the top line headwinds that increased through the quarter, our Q3 adjusted EBITDA came in above expectations. Operating expenses in the third quarter were $33.3 million, up 19% year-over-year, reflecting the combination of increased head count for growth and stock-based compensation. Note, Q3 net income includes a noncash impairment charge of $6.4 million related to an equity investment made several years ago. Non-GAAP net income which adjusts for unrealized gain or loss on equity investments, stock-based compensation expense, acquisition-related and other expenses and related adjustments for income taxes, was $12.4 million or 19% of revenue. Nonetheless, based on the unique strengths of our business, our omnichannel platform, our financial strength and our ability to continue making investments in innovation, we anticipate continue to grow faster than the market. In terms of tailwinds, we anticipate our omnichannel video revenues will continue to grow and SPO activity to increase. Given the range of macroeconomic pressures, we believe there could be a wider range of outcomes in Q4 than we typically see, especially as our Q4 revenue tends to be back-end-weighted. As communicated last quarter, we proactively initiated cost-saving measures to unlock several million dollars by the end of the year relative to our original planned expenses. Note, included in our Q4 adjusted EBITDA expectations are the incremental operating costs of approximately $1 million for our recent Martin acquisition. Based on our Q4 revenue guidance, the applied full year revenue range is $257 million to $260 million or 14% growth at the midpoint. With digital advertising projected to grow less than 10% in 2022, we are well positioned to continue to grow our market share. Consistent with the revenue range and cost-saving plans already in place, we anticipate our full year adjusted EBITDA range to be between $98 million and $101 million or 38% margin at the midpoint. Based on equipment availability and logistics, the bulk of our CapEx occurred in Q3 which reduced our period gross margin and our free cash flow. With much of our multiyear CapEx investment plan completed, our team is now focused on optimizing these investments. With regard to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar, we anticipate the impact on our revenues to be neutral to positive because the transactions flowing through our platform are largely denominated in U.S. dollars. On the expense side, we also expect the U.S. dollar's strength relative to the Indian rupee and U.K. British pound sterling to have a neutral to positive impact. In closing, there are multiple reasons we are confident in our long-term prospects despite the difficult macro conditions dampening global ad spend. Maybe just comment a bit more on kind of what you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re seeing and -- but to the extent you get to the end of the month or the end of the quarter and there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s budget left, you also get those dollars as opposed to IO orders which become too hard. And then just second, it sounds like display will be a drag on the fourth quarter. With respect to programmatic, certainly, the pros are that it's data-driven and provides a level of transparency that many other forms of digital advertising does not provide. But overall, the long-term secular trend is incredibly positive for programmatic advertising. And so quarter-to-quarter, there might be some variations but the reality is the long-term trend is moving in the right direction. Now with respect to the display format, as I referenced in my comments, this is a path we saw during the pandemic and it was one of the first formats to really feel the pressure of shifting buying. It's a very long-term, stable format. Overall, of course, our growth would be much higher if that format was more stable. Now just as a reference point, though, last quarter, Q2, our display format business grew 19%. And overall, as an omnichannel platform, we really find pockets of growth when there's softness in other areas\n Our next question comes from Brent Thill at Jefferies. Rajeev, maybe just walk us through kind of what you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re hearing from some of your barrier partners about what they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re seeing and what some of the explanations. And what we are focused on and I think what's most important to me personally, is that we continue to consolidate ad spend and gain market share. So if we just look at some of the Q3 numbers that are out there, Meta was down minus 4% to minus 5%. Google and their network business, minus 2%. I think Snap was plus 6%; Pinterest, plus 8%; Roku, plus 12%. So clearly, there's a step function down for our Q4 guidance but we think the vast majority of that is driven by the macro environment. So first of all, significant profit margins and that gives us the agility and the ability to focus on long-term innovation in select high-growth areas. And then as we highlighted, we're going to be very focused on optimizing the infrastructure and the capacity that we've already put in place and that allows us to commit to reducing CapEx by half at least next year which will be reflected in gross margins as well as on the bottom line. I mean I can start and maybe, Steve, you want to chime in on it but I would say it's too hard to say at this point. I know everybody is looking for the bottom, of course but I think we got to kind of take it 1 month at a time and see what's out there. Obviously, the big unknowns, right which you know well, are what happens with inflation and then resulting interest rate changes and then what happens with the war in Europe. And I think from our perspective, again, we feel really good about our ability to be very agile in this environment given the strong profitability and balance sheet that we have. From my perspective, as CFO, what I focus on is the fact that we can grow faster than our peers, that we can leverage our very efficient business model and that we stay ahead in terms of investments for future growth. So wherever that bottom is, we feel very good about the point that we're going to be when we exit this current cycle. It's hard to say what that growth rate will be over the coming quarters but historically, we've proven that we can grow faster than market and I don't see any reason why that premise doesn't hold true. And I really want to reinforce the point that Rajeev made that going into this cycle, we feel that we're on the front foot. And as Rajeev said, we're now turning our attention to further optimization of our infrastructure and selected targeted growth investments. So overall, we feel really good about where we are in the cycle and our ability to exit very strongly out of it. And Steve, can I just clarify that the end of October -- or you said things got a little tighter at the end of the quarter. And just to set the context, in terms of the expectations for the fourth quarter, there's clearly a seasonal uptick that occurs every calendar year. And when we took a look at the numbers, we factored in not what -- how we exited Q3 but what's happened up to today's call. For the first part of this fourth quarter, it's roughly flat year-over-year. Now having said that, we have other categories that are -- continue to perform strongly like travel and automotive. So the benefits of our business that we've built is that it does have a level of diversity in it and so we can manage through, at some level, these puts and takes. And when we put together our Q4 guidance, I took a look at the year-over-year trends, bottom up from a publisher by publisher perspective. And the one thing I'll call out is going into the fourth quarter, we had expected mid-30s seasonal sequential growth versus Q3. So clearly, softness is in the business right now. And then the other question is, how are you thinking about OpEx not only this year but just in general next year, you talked about CapEx. So in terms of the expectations for Q4, it is really as straightforward as I just outlined. Clearly, we had a bit of an uptick benefit from political spend this year but that was never a significant part of our expectations. Now with respect to OpEx, the -- I really want to underscore the point of how we think about the opportunity ahead of us. Ultimately, as we've shared in the past, it's all about innovation and doing that cost effectively. And what we saw back in the pandemic period, the down quarter of Q2, we were one of the only companies that consistently invested right through and we saw the benefit of that in the succeeding quarters and years. So from our perspective, we're going to obviously keep a close eye on OpEx. Rajeev and I commented on our focus on optimization and that's going to continue to flow throughout the organization, that we expect increased productivity in all the functional areas. And there will be some growth in OpEx, not at the same rate as we've seen it historically. And now with the Martin acquisition, providing the tools to consolidate more ad spend onto our platform. In fact, in the fourth quarter, I assumed roughly $1 million impact cost and that's included in our financials. So starting, Rajeev, last quarter, we talked a little bit about the challenging macro potentially being a tailwind SPO, right, with advertisers really focusing on ROI. So in terms of the deal cycle, there's a wide variety of ranges. So we could see from an advertiser perspective, maybe a couple of months, a holdco to get a deal in place could take 12 to 18 months. That can be a matter of, again, a couple of months, whereas a holdco, you've got to go region by region, country by country and bring those trading teams on board. I think what we typically tend to see on the first part of your question is that in a time of economic stress, that there is a consolidation within our ecosystem. And that was part of the reason why we made the acquisition of Martin is really to build upon the 40-year investment that we've made in supply path optimization and continue to have that as a very strong lever of spend consolidation on our platform and therefore, share gains. So we are absolutely talking every day with our buy-side customers and partners about what are the challenges, what are the opportunities, how data-driven advertising, how the ROI that can be driven from real-time bidding can increase accountability and increase client outcomes and grow their business and grow our business. The other question I wanted to ask was on the CTV side and obviously, a lot of focus on the streaming services switching to AVOD. Yes, I think we definitely are going to see a shift towards a bit of -- that's going to be driven both on the sell side and the buy side. So from a buyer's perspective, you can imagine that if we go back a couple of years, there was only a handful of really large platforms, CTV streaming platforms that buyers could buy from. Now you fast forward to today's environment or next year's environment and in any given geo, there may be dozens of high-scale inventory sources. And so in that environment, obviously, buyers want to buy across all of those scaled supply sources. And so the operational complexity, the economic complexity, making sure that clients are getting strong ROI, that really requires a bidded approach. And so we're going to, I think, continue to see pressure from the buy side. And as that pressure comes from the buy side, I think similarly, we're going to see the sell side want to match how buyers want to buy. And again, economic pressure, whatever recessionary environment we're headed into, is only going to accelerate or increase that pressure. So I think, first and foremost, I'll give you the kind of the functional prioritization which really is around engineering and innovation. So as the weight of ad spend growth decelerates, what that allows us to do, given our profitability and our balance sheet, is to really think about how do we maximize share gains when the upturn inevitably happens. And so to do that, we're going to -- we're shifting our focus of investment towards products, towards engineering, towards software, towards infrastructure so that we can make sure that we have the right products. The first is supply path optimization to making sure that we have the right capabilities and products for buyers so that as this -- as we anticipate a spend consolidation may happen, we're in the right position to bring those dollars onto our platform. So obviously, there's huge growth of consumption of that ad format and of course, advertisers love it because of the rich opportunity to tell a story to the consumer. I think Europe, in particular, was called out prior as a place that was experiencing some macro pressure earlier. The expectations we had for the third quarter for EMEA payment line, we believe it was going to decelerate and it did decelerate. As a reminder, in Q2, our Americas business grew 27% year-over-year. And the third quarter, we saw that decelerate to about 10%. The core verticals of shopping, personal finance, technology had all decelerated August onwards. And given that Americas represents roughly 2/3 of our overall revenue, clearly, that was felt through that business unit. Now having said that, we delivered really strong robust EBITDA, 39% EBITDA margin in the third quarter despite that shift in the top line. And really, it underscores the control that we have over the various levers in our business. The balance is display and display is -- which is both mobile web display, app display as well as desktop display, is under pressure right now given the overall macro conditions. But because we have this mix and the fact that the mix is growing over time, we feel really that we're well positioned as the cycle progresses, not just from a financial perspective but also what happens when we come out of it. I have a big picture question as we think about kind of the market growing 10% or lower which I think you guys referenced earlier, versus kind of guidance for 14% growth for 2022. But again, when I look at our rate of growth relative to the market, historically, we've been growing at roughly twice the rate of growth in the market. We don't see any reason why we shouldn't continue to grow faster than the market, even if it's at a lower rate on an absolute level as the macroeconomic environment clearly indicates a deceleration. And we think we're very well positioned and I would say, uniquely positioned in terms of our balance sheet with no debt and then the ongoing profitability in the business. So I think there will be more opportunities for consolidation in the future, whether it's organic or inorganic. I think core to the point of view we have is that we feel really good about our business in terms of the model, in terms of the fundamentals that I outlined in my prepared comments. And we think by virtue of the fact that we are one unified platform, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to be able to deliver innovation on quicker cycles. And we have a credible asset, as I commented on earlier, in terms of our R&D organization in India that we have been growing over time and they are all pointed towards high ROI investments. And if you factor all those things together by, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d say, definition, we should end up consolidating the business because there are going to be companies that cannot keep pace on any of those or altogether those fronts. I just want to kind of underscore the magnitude, I think, of our owned infrastructure advantage. As Steve mentioned, we're going to reduce the CapEx by at least half for next year. If you're in AWS or something like that, maybe you can reduce your infrastructure bill by 10%, if you really focus on it but it's going to be hard to get significant gains beyond that. So that's just, I think, an example of the significant advantage that we have. And then secondly, if I think about your CTD publisher wings, it steadily continues to increase over the last few quarters. So I think we're seeing growth really in 2 areas, both is in net new -- one is a net new and the other is in the penetration -- deeper penetration of the existing publisher base. So we're seeing growth, I think, from both of those categories. In terms of the types of publishers, there's really 3 or 4 types of publishers that we're going after. So one is kind of the Tier 1, really large platforms, broadcasters that are pretty scaled in terms of their monthly users. So again, I think we're going to see penetration, new publisher acquisition but also with the likes of SPO, bringing more dollars to the existing publishers that are in our stable. First, Rajeev, I appreciate your comments on Retail Media as a growth opportunity. And then, Steve, I just wanted to kind of get a finer point on some of the optimizations you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re talking toward. If I step back, if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re getting more utilization on the data center and then also having this mix shift dynamic away from lower-priced desktop to potentially having more mobile video, that seems pretty positive from a mix dynamic. So in terms of the retail media question, it's definitely a long-term growth opportunity for us. I think you're right, there's obviously a handful of companies that are going after it. But we think between our programmatic kind of DNA and infrastructure, the global capabilities that we have, multiple ad formats and then the investment that we made in Connect, our data and addressability platform to manage first-party data, identity data, contextual data, all of those pieces put us in a good position to field competitive product. We're already working with the likes of Kroger, eBay, Asda, Rakuten, Groupon, Bed Bath & Beyond and many others. In terms of the components, there's on-site advertising and there's offsite. The area that we're working hardest on right now is for on-site, it's sponsored listings. So in terms of time line, I think this year and next year are significant product innovation and building time frames. But I'll start out with the owned and operated part of the infrastructure which we've -- you've heard from us for many earnings calls, is really a strength of ours on numerous fronts. So we decide when we want to invest, when we want to pare back, when we want to even move equipment because it's all our equipment. And so clearly, over the last couple of years, we made a strategic decision to increase the competitive moat and be able to process more impressions. And as we look ahead in terms of this part of the cycle where the macro conditions are such that it's natural that ad spending is going to come down for some period of time, that we then are able to leverage the infrastructure that we already built. And from a cash generation perspective, these are high ROI outcomes because we've already incurred those costs. From a GAAP P&L perspective, we depreciate the equipment over 3 years and we typically keep the equipment in service 4, 5, 6 years. Throughout the company's history, we've always looked at opportunities to continue to drive productivity. And in times like this, when we're making very conscious decisions to focus, let's say, our investment in technology, engineering and not as much in GTM, it's really right for us to continue to improve workflows, automate workflows, et cetera. Obviously, with the kinds of EBITDA margins that we have been able to achieve, in the high 30s last year, last couple of years above 40, I expect that the long-term trajectory of both gross margin and EBITDA margin will be up to the right. And it's really a function of how we organize ourselves, how we execute against the opportunity and how we are able to consistently invest in innovation and then when it's required to focus on optimization. And so we feel that, as I mentioned earlier, we are on the front foot going into this cycle and we feel really excited about the gains that we're going to make over the coming quarters from a competitive perspective. Maxwell, so we haven't seen a significant trend towards consolidation on the publisher side at this point. And in Q2, we announced and expanded -- I think it was Q2 grew then global relationship. I think on the sell side, it's possible that we will see some publishers consolidate due to operational investments and maintaining multiple SSPs. And while we can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t control the macro, our business model provides resiliency and highlights our ability to execute and create differentiated outcomes."
