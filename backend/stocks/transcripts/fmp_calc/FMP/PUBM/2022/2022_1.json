    "content": " In Q1, PubMatic continued its outstanding track record of durable growth, market share gains and profitability, with revenue of $54.6 million, representing year-over-year growth of 25%, the seventh straight quarter above our long-term target of 20-plus percent. We are maintaining our full year revenue guidance of $282 million to $286 million or 25% growth at the midpoint, supported by the anticipated robust second half growth from our SPO relationships, continued ramp-up of our CTV business, and political ad spending. And I see now the opportunity really to provide to advertisers, I think what they've always wanted, which is the great high-quality content that the Open Internet is well-known for some great premium content brands, but also now with heavily consented data flows where the publisher -- sorry, where the consumer is able to say exactly what data they're willing to share or not willing to share and to be able to do that at scale. And we've gotten to this point where we can really achieve the benefits for our publishers, deliver business -- incremental business to them and incremental revenues and profits to our business by managing this carefully, but also having the foundation to be able to deliver incremental profitability because of the cost advantage, not just on infrastructure, but also on innovation."
