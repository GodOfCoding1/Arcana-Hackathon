    "content": " In the third quarter of 2022, JBT achieved its guidance for bottom line growth and had a few high points, including posting record adjusted EBITDA at FoodTech even without the impact of this year's acquisitions and despite FX, with considerable progress in price cost realization. AeroTech orders were $113 million and as expected declined year-over-year due to the timing of some large projects, however, the pipeline for other infrastructure projects and demand for mobile equipment remain strong and we expect solid orders in the fourth quarter. Now with regards to guidance, for the fourth quarter, which includes Bevcorp, we expect FoodTech year-over-year revenue growth of 18% to 19.75%, that breaks down to 17% to 18% organic growth, 9% to 10% from acquisitions, offset by an 8% foreign exchange impact. And then from an expense perspective, I think this year, it's close to $10 million to $15 million in expense and next year, we would expect in the corporate area that's going to be closer to probably in a range of $5 million to $10 million, probably closer to $5 million with the majority of the expense flowing through the businesses to line up with the revenue."
