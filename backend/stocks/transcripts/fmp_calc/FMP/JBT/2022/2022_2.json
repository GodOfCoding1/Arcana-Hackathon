    "content": " We are operating with a record backlog and we're on track to deliver low double digit adjusted EBITDA margins in the back half of 2022 Finally, none of the progress would have been possible without JBT's talented and engaged workforce. And about 25% of improved margins is from improved productivity around certain projects that impacted us in the first half, as well as in other quarters just continuing to improve pricing as we continue to catch up, especially in some of our businesses in FoodTech in the back half of the year. In terms of the overall split, Walter, it's about -- we're about \u00e2\u0080\u0093 JBT\u00e2\u0080\u0099s about 60%, North America 40% kind of rest of world of which call it 30% or so is Europe, at the highest level. I'll take the first half and then Brian probably follow up on like, the more -- the longer term question you added in there, but I think first of all, certainly we are seeing FX impact on our orders, I'd say that's a pretty significant impact, bringing the orders, making orders a little bit lower. And more generally, kind of the your question about kind of short-term impact long-term impact, we definitely saw what I would say in the quarter, some pullback and what I would call some short cycle stuff, as they look -- as our customers look to entrench a little bit and try to take the cost out of their immediate quarter. So, yes, so as we -- I would say this we're, we've done a ton of pricing actions in the front half of the year, we expect that start seeing some of that benefit as we move into the back half year getting through some of the higher cost backlog that we saw."
