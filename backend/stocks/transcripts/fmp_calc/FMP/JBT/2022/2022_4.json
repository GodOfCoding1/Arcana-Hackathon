    "content": " For the year, FoodTech generated adjusted EBITDA of $290 million with margins of 18.2%. FoodTech margins improved each quarter sequentially, adjusted EBITDA margins of 19.7% in the fourth quarter as we continue to close the gap on price cost and benefit from higher volume. All this considered, that represents an adjusted EBITDA range of $310 million to $335 million from FoodTech in 2023, a year-over-year increase of 11% at the midpoint. We are forecasting adjusted EBITDA of $330 million to $350 million, which represents a year-over-year gain of 21% at the midpoint. The corporate expense of 3.2% of sales, excluding any LIFO M&A and restructuring charges, as well as interest expense of $7 million to $7.5 million, we are projecting GAAP earnings per share of $0.50 to $0.60 and adjusted EPS of $0.65 to $0.75. FoodTech orders of $432 million were up 24% sequentially, exceeding our expectations with improvements in Europe and Asia."
