    "content": " While we are pleased to see this level of initial excitement, and have both the people and the product needed to fulfill it, we cannot yet comment on how quickly this demand will translate into revenue, given it can take 30 to 45 days for a person with ALS to get on treatment to the payors medical exception process, which is standard for any new launch, especially in orphan diseases. Although, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen strong interest in Canada thus far, we do not expect this to translate to meaningful revenue in the near-term, given that the reimbursement process takes 6 to 12 months, and there are only a small number of people covered by private insurers at this time. So, I did not mention that patients today are getting free drugs through the Amylyx Care Team in the U.S. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve just started to see our initial \u00e2\u0080\u0093 now that we have product and channel, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re starting to see a solid initial bolus of demand from physicians across the country."
