    "content": " What I'm excited by and impressed by is that amidst a remarkably unique period, our team was able to make the right adjustments to position the company for continued future success and also deliver global adjusted EBIT growth of plus 15% in the first quarter. Impressively, the APAC business continued with step-change execution and driving high-value product penetration with price/mix growth of 12% in the quarter. During the first quarter, net sales increased 7% to EUR 110.8 million driven by strong price/mix growth of 14%. In the short term, for fiscal year '23, we expect EBIT margin to be below our target range of 11% to 16%, as the team navigates this period of unprecedented inflation and a slowing housing market. In the first quarter, the North America team delivered outstanding net sales growth of 28% to USD 740.1 million. Also, as I mentioned earlier, we continue to invest in our growth initiatives with SG&A up 33% versus Q1 of FY '22 and up 15% versus Q4 of FY '22. Let's now shift to Page 15 to discuss how the team and I expect to deliver differentiated results in fiscal year '23, including growth above market and strong returns. First and especially in periods of market uncertainty, we want to preserve strong liquidity and flexibility; second, we deploy our capital first to drive organic growth, including capacity expansions, innovation and marketing; third, we want to maintain our net leverage ratio at below 2x; and fourth, when there is available capital, we return capital to shareholders. As Sean previously disclosed, for North America, we expect fiscal year '23 net sales growth of 18-plus percent with an EBIT margin range of 28% to 32%."
