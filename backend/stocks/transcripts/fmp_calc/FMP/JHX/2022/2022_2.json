    "content": " Notably, we see strong volume growth of 14% in Q2, but more importantly, we want to sell a continued and significant step change in price mix growth of 9% resulted in 23% net sales growth in Q2 in North America. Not only did we see a strong volume growth of 15% in quarter 2, but more importantly, we want to sell a continued and significant step change in price mix growth of 8%, which resulted in a 23% net sales growth in Q2 in Europe. The strong top line results in the second quarter were translated into robust bottom-line results, execution on lean manufacturing and focus on high-value product mix helped to offset the high inflationary environment, leading to adjusted EBIT growth of 12% to AUD 60.6 million at an adjusted EBIT margin of 30.8%."
