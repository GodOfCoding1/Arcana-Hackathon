    "content": "  The three strategic initiatives are number one, expanding the James Hardie brand from a premium professional brand into a market-leading consumer brand that focuses on marketing directly to the homeowners to create true demand of our products; number two, penetrating and driving growth in existing and new markets such as repair and remodel; and number three, commercializing global innovations that allow us to expand into other exterior looks and to take advantage of the adjacent opportunities in each of our regions.
