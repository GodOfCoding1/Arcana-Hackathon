    "content": " In addition to fixed income, our U.S. equity products have gathered over $2.5 billion in year-to-date net inflows, representing 13% annualized growth in this suite alone. It's actually positive on our performance year-to-date when the SBR 100 is down 20%, highlighting again the strong relative performance, but globally, this strategy, we have it in UCITS form and ETF form has taken a $500 million this year. So initially, the customers for the digital funds will be -- will only be available through WisdomTree Prime as infrastructure and that's with requirement with the D2C wallet application that we've been referring to over time, and I think this could happen fairly quickly. We'll give you more guidance next quarter, but roughly what we've said in the last 2 quarters -- in the earlier comments as well as last quarter is that, we're rolling out WisdomTree Prime, and we're not expecting a significant increase in WisdomTree's overall expenses."
