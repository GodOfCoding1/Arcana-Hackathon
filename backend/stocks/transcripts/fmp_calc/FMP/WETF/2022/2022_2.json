    "content": " In terms of today's growth despite a very challenging market environment, WisdomTree has executed against plan and delivered another impressive quarter generating nearly $4 billion of quarterly inflows, bringing year-to-date net inflows to $5.7 billion and delivering a best-in-class 13% annualized organic growth rate. It's been building and growing for several years, while tomorrow's growth will be driven by a combination of sustaining our current momentum and adding to it our digital assets growth initiatives. We will continue to leverage the efficiencies of having an established and well-managed ETF franchise, setting the table to start seeing top line revenue from digital assets in 2023 without a significant uptick in costs for steady, disciplined and responsible march continues that see a massive growth runway ahead for WisdomTree. And with respect to the growth -- the revenue, as I said, we see this creating a tremendous opportunity for WisdomTree as savings, investing and payments all converge onto this new infrastructure, and as I said in the earlier part of the call, we expect this part of our business in digital assets to start achieving revenue in 2023, and all of that without a significant uptick in costs."
