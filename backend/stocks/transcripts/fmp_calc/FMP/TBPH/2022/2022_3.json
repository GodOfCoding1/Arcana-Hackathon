    "content": " We closed the sale of our royalty interest in TRELEGY ELLIPTA to Royalty Pharma for approximately $1.1 billion in upfront cash, $250 million in potential milestones and outer year royalties and Royalty Pharma invested in the ampreloxetine program. And as a result of the deal with Royalty Pharma, we were able to initiate a $250 million capital return program, which included purchasing GSK\u00e2\u0080\u0099s entire holdings at $9.75 cents a share and launching a Dutch auction tender offer for up to $95 million of the Theravance Biopharma ordinary shares, a tender offer that's currently open. Understanding the YUPELRI opportunity in the community or outpatient setting we have also been encouraged by the growth trends seen in the retail script data where total prescriptions in Q3 have increased 21% year-over-year and new-to-brand prescriptions have increased 26.9% over Q3 of 2021, with both metrics once again reaching new quarterly highs launched to-date. The carefully structured deal that closed during the third quarter delivers three components of value, an upfront cash payment of approximately $1.1 billion in exchange for all of our units in Theravance Respiratory Company or TRC LLC, which represented our 85% economic interest in the royalty rights on worldwide sales of GSKs TRELEGY, ELLIPTA. At the closing of the deal, we paid down the non-recourse TRELEGY notes for approximately $425 million, and by early August we successfully retired 100% of the company's $230 million convertible notes These two deals made Theravance Biopharma debt free during the third quarter, while also having sufficient excess cash to design outward return program outlined on Slide 17."
