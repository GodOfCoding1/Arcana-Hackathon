    "content": " And probably, in my mind, one of the most important highlights of the quarter is we're sitting at $134 million in at the end of the quarter, which really puts us in a good position to not only take advantage of interesting opportunities, but also just patiently watch and see how markets develop. As Chris mentioned, we have very strong loan production for the first half of this year, a little over $1 billion compared to about $489 million for the six months of 2021, which is a 110% increase in production. If you look at the right-hand side, the portfolio yield and cost of funds, you can kind of see you go back to Q2 of last year, when interest rates were higher, we were charging more on the loans and of course, our debt costs were a lot higher at 4.81%. And you can see as Q1 came into play as rates came down in the second half of 2021 into the first quarter of 2022, we lowered the WAC on the loans, still maintaining that spread and we've been very aggressive now going into Q2 and through Q2 as interest rates have gone back up on the financing side. In terms of total dollars, we ended the quarter at $4.9 million, which is a 5.2% increase from Q1 and a 24% increase from June of last year, and that's really as a result of just the growth of the portfolio. So we're able to doing those deals, ending up the second quarter with about $134 million in available liquidity, $46 million of that being the cash that you see on the balance sheet and then another $88 million in loans that are unfinanced, that we can put on lines at any time and draw the liquidity off of."
