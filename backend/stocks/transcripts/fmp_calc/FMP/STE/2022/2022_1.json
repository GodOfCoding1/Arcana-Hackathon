    "content": " In addition, on today\u2019s call, non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted earnings per diluted share, adjusted operating income, constant currency organic revenue growth and free cash flow will be used. This improvement, combined with additional foreign currency benefit and higher expectations for Cantel\u2019s Medical business, has increased our expectation for total reported revenue to $4.6 billion. I think we probably are getting a little lift this past quarter from a faster procedural recovery than we anticipated, but that\u2019s our forward-looking statement that we\u2019ve had consistently in terms of our objectives for growth."
