    "content": " In fiscal year 2021, we reported a consolidated adjusted net profit of $20 million or $0.19 per share compared to $83 million or $0.82 per share in the prior year, and generated total adjusted EBITDA of $721 million compared to $1.1 billion in the prior year. On January 13 of this year we successfully completed the sale of all of our interest in Teekay LNG to Stonepeak, bringing in gross cash proceeds of approximately $641 million to Teekay Parent. Based on TNK\u2019s closing price yesterday, our current position is valued at $125 million or $1.23 per Teekay Corp share. 07:19 Lastly, as mentioned earlier, our net cash position is over $300 million equal to over $3 per Teekay Corp share and we can't stress enough the importance of having financial strength and flexibility as a critical ingredient to achieving higher returns and allowing us to be opportunistic and counter-cyclical."
