    "content": " However compared to Q1, our tanker business results were weaker due to lower spot tanker rates and the expiration of certain fixed rate time charters that were secured during last year's strong tanker market. Although the near term outlook is uncertain due to the continued impact of COVID-19, we believe many of the leading indicators for tanker market recovery continue to improve including planned increases and OPEC+ production, declining global oil inventories which are below five year average levels, as well as positive tanker fleet supply fundamentals with heightened scrapping and a very limited amount of new tanker orders."
