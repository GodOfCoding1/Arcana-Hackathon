Adjusted segment income increased approximately $12 million and margin grew 420 basis points due to higher revenue, including strong project deliveries, which typically carry higher-than-average incremental margins. I'm just wondering what's driving that, whether on the organic or inorganic side, and I mean just given the really strong margin execution there in the third quarter, it seems like the unchanged 14% guidance on the margin front for the year.
