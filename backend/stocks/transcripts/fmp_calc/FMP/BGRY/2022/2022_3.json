    "content": " This expansion includes a strategic new application of our technologies for a critical operation, a corporate-wide master purchase agreement construct, and we issued a warrant to purchase our common stock that fully vest when FedEx purchases $200 million in products and services by the end of 2025. Moving to orders, since our last earnings call, we secured new orders of $26 million through early November, which brings total orders this year to over $50 million so far. Adjusted EBITDA, which is defined as loss from operations adjusted primarily for depreciation, stock comp expense, the FedEx warrant provision and changes in the fair value of warrants was negative $26.1 million in the third quarter, an improvement of over $4 million from Q2 and an almost $6 million improvement over the first quarter of this year. While we had the busiest quarter ever in terms of execution, we expect certain customer projects will be slightly delayed for the remainder of this year, and we are, therefore, updating our revenue forecasts for 2022 to be between $65 million and $70 million, excluding any impact of the FedEx warrant."
