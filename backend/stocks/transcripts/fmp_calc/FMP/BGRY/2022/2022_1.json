    "content": " Along those lines in the first quarter, we secured a new logo with an industry-leading retailer, launched new products which addressed critical market needs and broaden our unique product portfolio that rapidly built a $100 million pipeline for a new product that we launched only a few months ago. Our new BG FLEX mobile solution is yet another example of our ability to build on our standard product modules, to deliver the automation our customers need to compete in today's on-demand economy. That's why some of the world's largest retailers, e-commerce providers, and logistics companies choose Berkshire Grey, and why every one of our anchor customers has expanded their deployments with us with new orders. I think what we'll see is, as we mentioned, and we don't really don't guide to order numbers, but like what we experienced last year, we expect to see a significant increase in order activity from all of our customers in the second half, both from our anchor customers and from new prospects as well."
