    "content": " At FOX Entertainment, Rob Wade has settled into his new role as CEO and has already launched two of the season's biggest hits; Accused, ranked as the most watched debut on any broadcast or cable network in two years, and Special Forces: World's Toughest Test is this season's number one unscripted program. Notwithstanding the absence of Thursday Night Football, our overall revenue growth was led by a 4% increase in advertising revenues where in the quarter, we saw continued strength in political advertising of the stations, which when viewed across the full fiscal first half, nearly matched the political record set during the 2020 presidential cycle. Next question, please, operator. Next question, please, operator."
