    "content": " It's no surprise that FOX\u00e2\u0080\u0099s big news Saturday remains the number one window in college football with viewership up 15% over last year, and FOX continues to be the primary home for baseball's post season, where our coverage across FOX started in October and culminates with the world series throughout this week. This top line momentum was led by 8% growth in our advertising revenues, where in the quarter we continued to see healthy scatter demand for our leading news and sports properties, and generated meaningful revenue reacceleration at TUBI. Quarterly adjusted EBITDA was $1.09 billion, up 3% as our revenue growth was partially offset by higher expenses led by continued investment in our digital initiatives and increased rights amortization at FOX Sports. So we're not in a position as I think a lot of the cable, general entertainment channels, which are \u00e2\u0080\u0093 you know are more at risk to people going to SVOD services and streaming to get that type of content, whereas you know there's only one place you can get FOX News and there's only one place you can get FOX Sports. Operator, next question please. Operator, next question please."
