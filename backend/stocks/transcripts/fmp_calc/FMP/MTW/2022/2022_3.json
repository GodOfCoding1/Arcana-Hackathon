    "content": " Good morning, everyone, and welcome to The Manitowoc conference call to review the company's third quarter 2022 financial performance and business update, as outlined in last evening's press release. Our adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter was $24 million, an increase of 20% year-over-year. Our net operating working capital year-over-year increased $112 million, $156 million on a currency-neutral basis, primarily due to the acquisitions, increased volume, supply chain disruptions and inflation. On a sequential basis, net operating working capital was up $18 million, primarily due to higher inventory as a result of missed shipments in the quarter and lower accounts payable as a result of adjustments to our build schedules. And then just going back to the third quarter top line, end of second quarter, I think you said shipments missed by about $40 million."
