One is, as we talked about, there's more inflation rolling through, particularly on the polymer side, and we've seen polymers continue to go up quarter-on-quarter kind of in the low double digit range, I think around 10%. Your line is open. Your line is open. Please go ahead, your line is open. Please go ahead, your line is open. What I'll say is that when you take a look, and you almost have to think about it in vis-\u00c3\u00a0-vis your product line segments, so, you take a look at our SP segment, and we have done a tremendous amount of work in that '17, '18, '19 timeframe, making investments in NPI, making investments in material science and engineering and we have engineered lots of these overly dependent single source, highly constrained polymers out of our supply chain. Please go ahead, your line is open. Your line is open."
