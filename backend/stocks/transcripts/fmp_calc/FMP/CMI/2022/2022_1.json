    "content": " Our first quarter revenues in North America grew 12% to $3.7 billion, driven by improved pricing and higher aftermarket demand. First quarter revenues in China, including joint ventures were $1.5 billion, a decrease of 31% due to lower sales in on-highway and construction markets. First quarter revenues in India, including joint ventures were $621 million, an increase of 8% from the first quarter a year ago. Second, we also delivered solid profitability in the quarter as gross margins improved compared to a tough Q4 of last year, Tom said we returned $518 million to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases and we\u2019ve raised our full year outlook, despite the many challenges around the globe. For the Engine segment first quarter revenues increased 12% from a year ago, while EBITDA increased from 14.4% of sales to 15.4% as the benefit of stronger volumes and pricing actions more than offset lower joint venture income and increased input costs. In the Power Systems segment revenues increased 14% in the first quarter, and EBITDA decreased from 12.3% to 9.5% of sales as the benefits of stronger volumes were more than offset by higher supply chain expenses. We are raising our full year 2022 expectations for company revenues to be up 8% from our previous guidance of 6%, primarily driven by strong demand in North America, while maintaining our guidance for company EBITDA margins at approximately 15.5%.
