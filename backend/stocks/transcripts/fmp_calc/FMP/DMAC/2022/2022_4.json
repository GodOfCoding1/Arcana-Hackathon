    "content": " In our pivotal Phase 2/3 ReMEDy2 trial, we switched to the new PVC IV bag formulation, which does not retain any of the DM199 effectively delivering up to twice as much DM199 to study participants. Yesterday, we also announced that we have initiated a Phase 1C open label, single ascending dose study of the IV dosing of DM199 in the IV bags made from PVC used in the ReMEDy2 trial. First, for some reason the FDA is not satisfied that the results of the In-Use study provided sufficient basis for adjusting the IV dose levels going forward in ReMEDy2. Enrollment in the Phase 1C study began last week, and the first three cohorts, which gets us to 0.5 micrograms per kg dose level we propose to use going forward should be complete in April with preliminary data available in May."
