    "content": " To address this, we've recently brought on a nationally recognized clinical support service firm to assist us in engaging with those study sites that can benefit from us providing supplemental staff resources, to support both the recruitment of patients and the management of the patient's participation in the study as they transition from the hospital to an intermediate care facility and ultimately to their home. As we discussed in our last call, we are prioritizing clinical study sites that have the highest enrollment potential, ideally those that can enroll one plus patient per month. Our target has been for our projections for the interim analysis next year is to get to a 0.25 enrollment rate per site per month, so basically one patient per site every four months. But importantly, our clinical team has been very active in understanding the challenges of running clinical trial today in particular and with the staffing challenges that we're having at the hospital and bringing in a consulting company to help us to provide those additional resources when these hospitals need is I think is really going to help in terms of getting sites on board and having these sites recruit the new patients for us. And then lastly, did you mention that maybe a few months from now, we would start \u2013 we would have a better idea of how that 0.25 patients per site per month enrollment is going and maybe even color on the sites that you're focusing to do one patient per month?"
