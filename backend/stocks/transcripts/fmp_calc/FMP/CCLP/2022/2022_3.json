    "content": " If you were to go back a year ago, lube oil on average was running in the third quarter, let's say, $7.50 a gallon, and it's running -- going in the fourth quarter, it's running between $11.50 and $12.50. I'd say in the last 6 months to let's -- I would say, I'm already thinking about Q3 -- I mean Q4 and Q1 are kind of what we're already working on those price increases. So I think anything at 1,000 horsepower and up because those are getting multiyear deals, that they have price inflators on them so that we don't have to go back and necessarily renegotiate every single unit, every single time even it's on term. But an 1,875 horsepower unit 2 years ago, when we walked in the door, we're being deployed here, those cost maybe $1.8 million -- excuse me, $1.4 million to build them. So when you just think about the cost of building a new one today and what that's pricing at to get, let's just call it the same economics, you're going to have to move your price a lot on the existing fleet to get it into market or you have the ability to move that in the market, and it's -- they're in very high demand. We weren't getting necessarily 2- and 3-year terms for some of these units, we were getting on the midsize units 1,000, 1,500 -- you're getting 1 year terms a year ago, maybe 15 months ago. So I think the 1,000 horsepower and up, you still have a lot of torque across that entire fleet spectrum that's going to come up to reprice again this year because last year, we weren't able to get inflators on the fleet contractually. And this year, we're also able to take let's say 1,000 to 1,500 horsepower last year, we were getting 1 year terms."
