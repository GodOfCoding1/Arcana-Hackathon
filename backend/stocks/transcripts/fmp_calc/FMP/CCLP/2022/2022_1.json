It depends on a lot of various factors related to the cylinders and the stages and so forth, but on just a simple taking the engine off and putting electric motor drive on and putting a VFD on that goes with it that can control it, you're probably talking about $500,000 or $600,000 versus building a brand-new electric might cost you $1.2 million in that size range. But say in the 1,300 horsepower range, give or take, it's going to cost you $1.2 million to build new and $500,000 to convert."
