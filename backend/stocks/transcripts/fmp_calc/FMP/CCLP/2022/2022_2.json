    "content": " As we think about capital allocation over the coming quarters, we'll continue to focus on spending our money to deploy our existing fleet first that being compressors or coolers, amine plants international opportunities for any product line, including the electric motor drive conversions of existing units. Distributable cash flow was $10.3 million, compared to $10.3 million in the second quarter of 2021, and we'll pay our second quarter distribution of $0.01 per unit on August 12, with a distribution coverage of 7.3 times. So I would say, based on what we're deploying this year, it's probably 15,000 to 17,000 horsepower that we're converting to electric so another 1% to 1.5% of our fleet will go from gas to electric by the end of 2022."
