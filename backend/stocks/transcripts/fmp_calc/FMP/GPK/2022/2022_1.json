    "content": " We're operating well and doing what we said we do including delivering another quarter of net organic sales growth, pivoting to a positive price to commodity input cost relationship, driving margins higher and executing a very significant step-up in adjusted EBITDA. The drivers of the 36% year-over-year increase in sales were $222 million in pricing and $385 million of higher volume mix from organic sales growth and acquisitions, slightly offset by $11 million of unfavorable foreign exchange. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. Mark, please go ahead. Your line is now open. Mark, please go ahead. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. Just given the incredible uncertainty that we've seen, our mark-to-market today at $475 million is clear to us, but the mark-to-market has moved up every month for the last year, and so hence, the little bit of a wider range. Your line is now open. I think, look, our confidence is high in the $40 million, and I would actually say it will probably be a bit indexed to 2023, quite frankly, given some of the opportunities and things that we're seeing in terms of the teams executing there."
