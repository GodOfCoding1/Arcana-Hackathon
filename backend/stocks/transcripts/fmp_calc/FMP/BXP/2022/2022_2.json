    "content": " All of these movements with -- after all of these movements, our current development pipeline of 11 office, lab and residential projects as well as View Boston, the observation deck at the Prudential Center aggregates 4.2 million square feet and $2.6 billion of investment that we project, based on delivery date and lease-up assumptions, to add more than $190 million to our NOI over the next 5 years at a 7.5% average cash yield on cost when stabilized. So Steve, you ask an interesting question because if I actually parse down where our availability is, other than Northern Virginia, where we actually have operating assets with vacant floors that would likely be what I would refer to as sort of techy because it's either cybersecurity companies or web services companies or defense contracting companies which have a technology bend to them, the vast majority of our portfolio is really, in terms of our availability, is in our CBD assets, which are not primarily geared towards technology tenants aka Embarcadero Center is a very different asset than, as an example, Salesforce Tower or 680 Folsom Street."
