    "content": " The combined unit output of these two plants improved 29% versus the third quarter of last year, demonstrating REV Drive's ability to impact our business and deliver bottom line results. Fire and emergency third quarter segment sales were $230 million, a decrease of $40 million compared to the prior year's quarter. The decrease in EBITDA was primarily result to lower shipments and mix in the transit bus business, inefficiencies related to supply chain disruptions and inflationary pressures partially offset by increased shipments of terminal trucks, street sweepers and price realization. Commercial segment backlog at the end of the third quarter was $531 million, an increase of 70% versus the third quarter of last year. The increase in adjusted EBITDA was primarily result of increased shipments of higher margin Class B units, favorable mix of Class A and Class C units and price realization partially offset by inflationary pressures and inefficiencies related to supply chain disruption and labor constraints. The last year certainly has presented some challenge to all \u00e2\u0080\u0093 everyone in the industrial manufacturing space and despite the supply chain labor and inflationary pressures, I and the leadership team remain really confident and positive on what's ahead of our business in the REV Group overall."
