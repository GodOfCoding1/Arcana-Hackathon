    "content": " In the first quarter of this year, consolidated revenue was $11.9 million, up 6% compared to Q1 of 2021. Specifically, in the first quarter end user demand grew 25% to 918 units compared to 737 units in the first quarter of 2021. And importantly, we see the positive trends in the U.S. continuing early in the second quarter, as end user demand for ILUVIEN is now up over 30% year-to-date through the end of April versus the same period in 2021. This new indication is helping create momentum coming out of COVID-19 restrictions as Spain is achieving positive overall sales results, with end user demand up over 31% year-over-year in the first quarter. During the first quarter of 2022, our consolidated net revenue increased 6% to $11.9 million compared to $11.2 million in the first quarter of 2021. U.S. net revenue was $6.9 million for the first quarter of 2022, an increase of 23% from the $5.6 million reported in the 2021 period. As Rick shared, U.S. end user demand, which represents units purchased by physicians and pharmacies from our distributors, increased 25% in the first quarter of 2022 to 918 units compared to 737 units in the first quarter of 2021. In the first quarter of 2022 Alimera's U.S. distributors sold approximately 8% more units to end users than they purchased from Alimera, reducing inventory during typically seasonal slowdown of January and February. Total consolidated operating expenses were $14.4 million in the first quarter of 2022, an increase of 19% compared to $12.1 million reported in the first quarter of 2021."
