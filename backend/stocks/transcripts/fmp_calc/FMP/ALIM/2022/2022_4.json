    "content": " Today's conference call includes adjusted EBITDA and adjusted net product revenue, non-GAAP financial measures that Alimera believes can be useful in evaluating its performance. We reported net product revenue for 2022 of $54.1 million, a 13% increase over 2021 driven by record global end user demand growth in both our U.S and international segments with 23% and 21% growth, respectively. For the fourth quarter of 2021, our consolidated net revenue was approximately $14.1 million, which was flat compared to the fourth quarter of the prior year, but negatively impacted by $600,000 due to the exchange rate deterioration. As a result, our Q4 2022 operating expenses were $14 million, which was down 5% from the same quarter of the prior year and down 7% from the prior quarter this -- in 2022."
