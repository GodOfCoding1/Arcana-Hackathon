    "content": " In Q3, our San Diego multifamily portfolio continued its favorable rent growth, where we saw leases on vacant units rent at an average of approximately 31% over the prior rates, while rates on renewed units increased an average of 13% over prior rents with virtually no concessions in Q3. Third quarter FFO increased approximately $0.05 over the second quarter of '22 and is comprised of the following: First, the Embassy Suites Waikiki hotel increased by approximately $0.02 per FFO share during the high season of Q3 over Q2. And third, nonrecurring accelerated revenue recognition related to TI overages and an accelerated deferred rent payment which occurred in Q3 will not reoccur in Q4 and thereby decrease FFO by approximately $0.03 per FFO share. In the third quarter we executed 13 leases totaling approximately 59,000 rentable square feet including on comparable new lease for approximately 18,000 rentable square feet with increases over prior rent of 55% on a straight-line basis approximately 25,000 rentable square feet of comparable renewal leases with increases over prior rent of 19.6% on a straight-line basis and approximately 16000 rental square feet of non-comparable new leases."
