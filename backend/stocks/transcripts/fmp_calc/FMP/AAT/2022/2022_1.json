    "content": " Same-store cash, NOI was strong in Q1 2022 ending at approximately 18% growth year-over-year for the first quarter what's even more important from my perspective is add if you exclude the collection of rents received in Q1 2021 related to rents that were previously build and uncollected in 2020 of approximately $1.2 million same-store cash, NOI growth would have been approximately 21% instead of 18% as reflected in our supplemental. From our initial guidance issued on our Q4 2021 earnings call, that had a range of $2.09 -- $2.17 with a midpoint of $2.13, which is approximately an 8.5% increase at the midpoint over our 2021 actual of $2 per FFO share. In the first quarter, we executed 19 leases totaling approximately 170,000 rentable square feet, including approximately 13,000 rentable square feet of comparable new leases with increases over prior rent of 30% on a straight-line basis. Approximately, 91,000 rentable square feet of comparable renewal leases with increases over prior rent of 16% on a straight-line basis including renewing Autodesk and 46,000 rentable square feet at Landmark in San Francisco. And approximately 66,000 rentable square feet of non-comparable new leases with Torrey Preserve in San Diego and City Center Bellevue, accounting for 52% and 27% of this activity respectively. We have an additional 25 thousand rentable square feet of new leases and lease documentation in Bellevue, we signed approximately 18 thousand rentable square feet of expansions with another 5 thousand rentable square feet of new leases and lease documentation, City Center Bellevue as 96% leased with an additional 1% up per signature. That's all really helpful, guys. That's all really helpful, guys."
