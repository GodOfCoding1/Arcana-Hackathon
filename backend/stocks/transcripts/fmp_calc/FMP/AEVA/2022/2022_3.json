    "content": " This is resulting in rapidly growing commercial momentum as more customers experience firsthand how the unique capabilities and scalability of Aeva's 4D LiDAR can enable next-generation automation across automotive, industrial and beyond. The unique combination of high performance, product maturity and scalability of our solution is the first for the industry and drawing inbounds from a broad range of customers looking to implement our 4D LiDAR for passenger vehicles, commercial trucks, mobility and industrial automation. Commercializing a new product is not trivial, and Aeva team made good progress in the first full quarter of Aeries II deployment, enabling us to increase the production output by 300% and shipped to more than 25 customers globally in the third quarter. And to your question about the form factor, actually, so with Aeries II, since we are dramatically reducing the size of the unit sensor, our Aeries I system, it's actually -- it's not the first time that I think the customers are realizing, \"Oh, wow, the maturity and the size, in addition to the performance, for an FMCW technology, which was never possible before, is now possible with what Aeva is driving and delivering.\""
