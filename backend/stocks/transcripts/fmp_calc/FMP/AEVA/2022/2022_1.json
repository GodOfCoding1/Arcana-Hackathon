    "content": " We continue to make progress on our first industrial precision product with Nikon, while also receiving significant inbound interest for additional industrial automation sensing applications, which are uniquely achievable with Aeva's FMCW LiDAR on chip technology due to superior precision. We continue to see growing consensus among automotive and non-auto customers that FMCW 4D LiDAR with a differentiated ability to instantly measure non-inferior velocity, enables us faster detection at higher confidence levels to safely bring higher levels of autonomy to a variety of perception applications including automotive and industrial markets. Aeries II incorporates the world's first 4D LiDAR on-chip solution that delivers direct velocity measurement for every pixel, together with 500 meters of range, camera level resolution and a designed for automotive grade and reliability. Beyond that, inbound interest continues to grow and we are developing a common perception platform that utilizes our core LiDAR on chip module to meet demand and accelerate adoption in the growing industrial automation market and fourth, on preparing the supply chain and processes for commercial deployments. Since introducing Aeries II earlier this year, it's been incredibly exciting to see the growing commercial momentum to utilize Aeva's unique 4D LiDAR on chip technology. And to your follow-up question on general kind of adoption timelines and if that's accelerate or slowdown, I think, what I can say is, since our analysis of course of the Aeries II, we are seeing a growing interest across the board both in automotive and non-automotive for adoption of new technologies and especially, I think, LiDAR being a key factor of that, is what we are seeing."
