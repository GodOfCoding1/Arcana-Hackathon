    "content": " We believe Aeries II offers a combination of performance and level of maturity that OEMs have been looking for, enabling us to advance to the next phase of development with our strategic customers and progress forward on a number of other engagements across automotive and industrial automation. The start-up Aeries II delivery is a significant achievement that represents five years of development of Aeva\u00e2\u0080\u0099s FMCW technology, with up to 500 meters of range, instant velocity detection and camera level resolution, we are excited to demonstrate to more customers, how Aeries II can unlock new levels of automation and machine perception across automotive and industrial applications. A number of applications within those segments currently use 2D and 3D LiDAR, but after working with Aeva for the past two years, SICK will expand to leveraging Aeva 4D LiDAR and our unique FMCW technology to deliver superior performance in automation applications that limit the use of camera and 3D LiDARs."
