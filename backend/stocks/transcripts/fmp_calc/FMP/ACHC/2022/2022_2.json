    "content": " This conference call may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including statements, among others, regarding Acadia's expected quarterly and annual financial performance for 2022 and beyond. Acadia has demonstrated consistent execution with favorable results through the first half of 2022, and we believe the strong demand trends across our service lines will support continued growth. Excluding this income, Acadia's adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter of 2022 was $157.3 million and adjusted income attributable to Acadia stockholders per diluted share was $0.84. As noted in our press release, due to our strong financial performance through the first half of the year, we have increased our financial guidance for 2022 as follows: revenue is in a range of $2.56 billion to $2.6 billion; adjusted EBITDA, including income from Provider Relief Fund in a range of $591.5 million to $621.5 million. Of the 7.8% that we reported for the second quarter, the onetime payments that we highlighted contributed about 1%, but we would attribute most of the revenue per day growth more than -- somewhere between 5% and 6%, certainly to rate increases that we're broadly receiving across our payers."
