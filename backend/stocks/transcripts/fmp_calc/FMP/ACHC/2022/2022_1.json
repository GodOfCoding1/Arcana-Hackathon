    "content": " I'm also very impressed with our diversified offering of comprehensive services within behavioral health, which are focused on real patient needs that continue to be undertreated in the strong growth pathways across our businesses to serve those patients. We have seen a strong revenue per day performance, which we saw throughout 2021 and continued into the first quarter, and we would say that the most significant component of that is rate increases that we are seeing broadly across many of our payers and many of our service lines. That business has grown and we've opened new clinics and continue to see a strong performance from our CTC service line, and reimbursement has improved as many states have added Medicaid coverage and have been focused at a state level on more treatment options and more locations for the opiate use treatment. We want to make sure that if staffing does impact our volume, it's only temporary and we bring the right resources to fix the situation and continue to support the strong inquiries and demand that we're seeing across our service lines and markets. At the end of the day, having come from and having worked in numerous payers, payers want quality care and they clearly are looking for superior outcomes, and I think that's why we've been able to see the rate increases that David was talking about earlier. So before we end the call, I do want to acknowledge Acadia's committed facility leaders, clinicians, and over 22,000 dedicated employees across the country, who just continue to provide quality patient care for those seeking treatment for mental health and substance use issues."
