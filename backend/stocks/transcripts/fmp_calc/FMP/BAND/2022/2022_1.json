    "content": " Non-GAAP gross margins of 53% for the first quarter, we\u2019re up 1 percentage point from the prior year\u2019s quarter, driven by improved pricing and product mix as well as continued excellent execution within our cloud operations and services groups. Messaging is growing well, 35% year-over-year in Q1, and it\u2019s driven by broad use cases and that includes customer engagement that you would see in retail and healthcare. Number two, we do need to win new large enterprises and we\u2019re demonstrating our ability to do that in this quarter yet again, and would prefer to have large customers that grow longer and higher with us."
