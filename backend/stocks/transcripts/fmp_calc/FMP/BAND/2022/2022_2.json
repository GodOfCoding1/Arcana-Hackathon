    "content": " This growth was offset by 13 points from the previously discussed headwinds, those being: lower usage revenue from the cohort of 40 DDoS-impacted customers, the 2 large customer dynamics we referenced at the start of the year and the absence of revenue from legacy businesses that we divested earlier this year. Instead, we believe our business of providing mission-critical cloud communications represents durable demand as we power global mission-critical cloud communication services for the Internet giants, the entire Gartner Magic Quadrant in UCaaS, CCaaS and Meeting Solutions and serve the large global enterprise market for both their customer-facing and internal communications needs with a long-held balance of growing our business profitably."
