    "content": " To support the working capital needs of our VMC 1200 production ramp, we recently secured an expanded USD 30 million credit facility with Royal Bank and the Export Development Bank of Canada while maintaining existing financing to support bus production. New orders, including a USD 100 million purchase order for 1,000 VMC 1,200 vehicles from Pioneer Auto Group helped us grow our backlog to over USD 150 million with the vast majority of which are for electric vehicles, specifically the VMC 1200, which has rapidly become our most in-demand product. During the fourth quarter, the company fortified its balance sheet through an opportunistic use of the company's at-the-market or ATM program, generating $5.3 million in net proceeds. Supplementing this, as Will noted, the company's credit facilities were expanded by $30 million to support VMC 1200 production. One is when you talked about the Ferndale plant getting fully up and running and operational and it has a CO, you had talked about it on the last call that potentially it was a -- the final solution would take another, I think, $3 million of capital. So we said the backlog is 1,000 trucks, and that's about just over $100 million for the truck side. For 2023, right now, our backlog for buses is -- it's about $50 million for 2023."
