    "content": " We delivered Q4 underlying sales growth of 9.2%, that was driven by 13.3% price, with volumes down 3.6%, and that resulted in full-year growth of 9% with price up 11.3% and volumes down 2.1%. Beauty & Wellbeing reported 7.8% underlying sales growth for the year, 7.5% price and positive volume of 0.3%. Home Care reported 11.8% underlying sales growth for the year, 15.9% price, with volumes lower by 3.5%. In-home Ice Cream, which is 60% of the total also grew in the year with strong price growth and this came on top of lower volumes, which reflects a step down from elevated sales during the lockdown period. In the fourth quarter, in-home delivered positive underlying sales growth with lower volumes for the reasons that I've just described as well as higher levels of pricing and some choices we made to step away from unprofitable volumes. As Alan just said, full-year underlying sales growth was 9%, driven by price at 11.3% and with volumes modestly down by 2.1%. Underlying sales growth contributed 9%, as we've just seen, and we saw a negative impact from acquisitions and disposals of 1% with the inclusion of Prestige Beauty brands Paula's Choice and neutrophil offset by the exit of the Global Tea business. We reacted quickly to the cost inflation and implemented price increases through the year with underlying price growth stepping up sequentially across the quarters and reaching 13.3% in the fourth quarter, contributing to a full-year increase of 11.3%. Yes, good morning everybody. Yes, good morning everybody."
