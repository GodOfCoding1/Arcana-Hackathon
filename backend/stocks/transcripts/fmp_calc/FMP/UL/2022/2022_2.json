    "content": " Underlying operating margin was 17%, and that's a reduction of 180 basis points versus the same period last year and within the 16% to 17% guidance that we gave with our first quarter results. Now of this second half spend, 80% is now covered through contracts and inventories and hedging, reducing the levels of uncertainty for the second half, but also meaning that it takes a little time for spot price falls, if they're sustained, to enter fully into our cost base. In Latin America, well, Alan just covered a lot of it actually through the competitiveness discussion, but pricing was 21.7%, volumes down 4%, that's less volume impact than we saw in the first quarter despite higher pricing."
