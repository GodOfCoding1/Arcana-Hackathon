    "content": " We generated revenue of $142.1 million in 2022, a 23% year-over-year increase and above the high-end of the initial guidance that we gave at the beginning of the year and also above the high-end of last quarter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s guidance. Our operating loss for the year was $31 million, a 15% improvement over last year and over $5 million better than the high-end of the guidance we gave at the beginning of the year and $2 million better than the high-end of the guidance we gave in November. The output of that work was a 2023 strategic plan that aligns us around four focus areas in our business: accelerating revenue growth, building a scalable foundation for profitable growth, delivering an experience that turns customers in the champions and fostering an effective and engaged team that lives our values.
