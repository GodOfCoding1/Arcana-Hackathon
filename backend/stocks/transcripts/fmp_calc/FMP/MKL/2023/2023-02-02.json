    "content": " In 2022, we experienced adverse development on certain of our general liability and professional liability product lines within our insurance segment in the 2016 through 2019 accident years, primarily arising from unfavorable claim settlements and increased claim frequency and severity trends. Net unrealized investment losses included in our comprehensive income in 2022 totaled $1.1 billion net of taxes, reflecting a decline in the fair value of our fixed maturity portfolio, resulting from increases in interest rates. We reported a net loss to common shareholders of $250 million in 2022 compared to net income to common shareholders of $2.4 billion in 2021, largely attributed to the year-over-year swing in changes to our public equity portfolio valuation. We set out at the beginning of 2021 with our 10-5-1 goal within our global insurance underwriting operations to deliver $10 billion in annual gross written premiums in five years, targeting $1 billion in annual underwriting profits, or simplistically speaking, achieving a 90% or better combined ratio."
