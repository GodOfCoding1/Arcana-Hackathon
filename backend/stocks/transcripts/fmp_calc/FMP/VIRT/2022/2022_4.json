    "content": " In my remarks today, I will focus on Virtu's fourth quarter and full year 2022 financial and business performance, 2022 milestones and the progress we've made toward our key strategic initiatives and goals. Our Market Making segment, which earned an average of $4.2 million per day in adjusted net trading income for 2022 comprises our customer wholesale business where we received flow from 250-plus retail platforms, as well as our noncustomer or proprietary market-making business. Our noncustomer business, which provides liquidity across asset classes globally experienced a strong quarter, as well as a strong overall year, as our ongoing investments in our growth initiatives, particularly around options Market Making continued to perform well. While the integration of our businesses and increased internalization means that efforts to improve one Market Making business often generates benefits across our entire Market Making segment, this quarter's Market Making results were driven by improvements that we deployed to existing strategies in both our customer and noncustomer Market Making businesses. To give you some additional perspective, our noncustomer Market Making business was flat year-over-year from '21 to '22 and up 11% from the third to the fourth quarter of 2022. For the fourth quarter 2022, our adjusted net trading income, which represents our trading gains, net of direct trading expenses, totaled $274 million or $4.4 million per day, which is a 43% decrease year-over-year. And we have weeks, months, quarters where our energy business is doing quite well and then natural gas will go through a period like it did over the last couple of years, where there's frankly no volatility and the price is pretty consistent and the opportunity set within natural gas and energy declines significantly."
