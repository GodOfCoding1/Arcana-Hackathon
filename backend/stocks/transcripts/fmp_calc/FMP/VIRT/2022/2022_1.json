    "content": " The second thing I would say is the retail business is meaningfully different than our noncustomer Market Making segment, which I assume you\u2019re referring to when you say institutional in the sense that in the retail business, we\u2019re in the market continuously and we need to be in the market continuously and we have an arrangement with our 250-odd clients that when they send us market orders, they\u2019re printed and done. So that\u2019s kind of like an indication of what the opportunity is and that\u2019s what we track internally along with obviously retail buy versus sell balances, which can have an impact on trading in a way that won\u2019t impact our noncustomer Market Making business. And if you look at just the Market Making segment, if you convert the adjusted net trading income results for example this quarter $382 million and just look at the gross trading income of $516 million, that percentage is 74% and that\u2019s the highest level since first and second quarter of 2020 in those kind of frenzy days. We\u2019re adding direct counterparties to roll out our V crypto solution, which again getting back to one of the core assets and the strengths of this firm, which I think people don\u2019t value in the way that we do is we have this network of relationships built over the last 30 years with over 250 retail brokers that frankly use us for  execution, trust us, know that we\u2019ll be there and provide superior execution quality for their liquidity needs."
