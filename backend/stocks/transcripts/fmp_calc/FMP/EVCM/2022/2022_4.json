    "content": " Measure and report our payments ecosystem growth through TPV, we ended the quarter with an annualized TPV of approximately $10.9 billion, which represents 19% year-over-year growth. Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA was $35.2 million, representing a 21.7% margin, while full year 2022 adjusted EBITDA was $119 million, representing a 19.2% margin. Our adjusted unlevered free cash flow for the quarter was $26.1 million, representing 17.4% year-over-year growth and a 16.1% margin. I think, again, from a strategy standpoint, really optimizing our marketing and sales motion and product packaging to drive more new adoption of the embedded payments and then deepening the integration and the payment workflow capabilities in those systems-of-action software to really drive more payment wallet share from those customers. Well, I think payments -- and the reason we continue to iterate that and discuss it in our -- both in the call, we've done in several quarters past is when you look at the $10.9 billion we're currently processing versus close to almost $100 billion opportunity that we have, we're at the very, very early stages of the opportunities."
