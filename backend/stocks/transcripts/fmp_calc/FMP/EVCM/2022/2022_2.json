    "content": " As a quick reminder, ever Commerce provides vertically tailored end-to-end SaaS solutions that support the highly diverse workflows and customer interactions of professionals in home services, health services and fitness and wellness services use to automate manual processes, generate new business and create more loyal customers. Adjusted G&A expense was $26 million, or 16.5% of revenue, up from 15.4% of revenue in the prior year period due to investments in scalable operations in our public company infrastructure which have been significant following our July 2021 IPO. our adjusted unlevered free cash flow for the quarter was $22.3 million, representing 13% year-over-year growth and a 14.2% margin. So I think the core value proposition of EverCommerce's core solutions and then really focused on that main system of action is really built for these environments in general, to help these businesses be more successful, manage the business more efficiently and grow even in difficult times. Maybe first one, just on -- Marc, on the expenses side, just given the company talking about the growth opportunity, I was just curious, this is the first time we've seen kind of the adjusted dollars for sales and marketing and R&D go down a little bit quarter-over-quarter. Obviously, we've got the road map historically on embedded payments, and that's where we came from, and that's where we've had the strongest penetration to date, but continuing to integrate things like customer experience solutions across those systems of action software are core to the playbook now and things that we continue to follow up on in back of our embedded payment strategy to continue to take advantage of that trend."
