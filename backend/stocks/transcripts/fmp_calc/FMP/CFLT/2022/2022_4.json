    "content": " As Jay discussed earlier, we've made a decision to accelerate our path to profitability by one year from Q4 '24 to Q4 '23 and while resourcing the company to deliver approximately 30% annual revenue growth rate in 2023. Additionally, compared to last year, we have improved visibility into our FY '23 revenue streams as approximately 60% of revenue comes from current RPO, coupled with the strong growth in $100,000-plus ARR customers, which contribute more than 85% of revenue each quarter. For the full year 2023, we expect revenue to be in the range of $760 million to $765 million, representing growth of 30% to 31%; non-GAAP operating margin to be approximately negative 15% to negative 14%; and non-GAAP net loss per share in the range of negative $0.28 to negative $0.22 using approximately 297 million weighted average shares outstanding. As we think about the glide path over time, we very clear about being above 125% from a total company standpoint and also looking at just higher net retention rates for our cloud and our hybrid customers as that's like where the puck is going. And in an environment like this where there's some pressure and there's less kind of net new software projects overall coming out, having that existing installed base to grow into is obviously a really nice second dimension of growth beyond just kind of landing with the new things."
