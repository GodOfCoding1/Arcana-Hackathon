    "content": " First quarter premium revenue grew 19% year-over-year to $7.5 billion, driven by strong membership gains in Medicaid and Medicare. Our reported Medicare MCR was very strong on the quarter at 86.5%, which is below the low end of our long-term target range, even after absorbing 190 basis points of COVID-related pressure. Specifically our increased 2022 earnings guidance reflects the favorable impacts of strong first quarter performance, underlying strength in the business in the rest of the year, the margin associated with the increase in our premium revenue, the combination of which is largely offset by a $0.50 per share increase in projected net effect of COVID. We are confident in our 2022 outlook that features revenue growth rates consistent with our long-term targets, and after tax margin at the midpoint of our long-term guidance range and strong earnings per share growth of 26%. Now, when we look bottoms up and we look at any given state where those members came from, that are in our increased roles, a good component of it is what's sometimes referred to as the woodwork effect, the people that were previously uncovered, but because of the pandemic realized it's a great time to come into the Medicaid pool and get covered, they're certainly going to stay with us."
