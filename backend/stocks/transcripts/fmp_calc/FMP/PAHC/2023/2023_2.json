    "content": " Finally, we are reiterating our full fiscal year 2023 net sales guidance of $950 million to $1 billion and adjusted EBITDA guidance of $113 million to $118 million. Consolidated net sales for the quarter ended December 31, 2022, were $244.6 million, reflecting an $11.9 million or 5% increase over the same quarter one year ago. GAAP-based net income and diluted EPS decreased 59% driven by higher SG&A and interest expense, offset partially by lower income tax expense, but primarily due to a $6.6 million charge pre-tax were closer to $4 million after tax charge to the P&L in the second quarter. Consolidated adjusted EBITDA increased $1.8 million or 6% in comparison to the prior year's quarter driven by higher adjusted EBITDA in both the Animal House and Performance Products segments, offset by lower mineral attrition and adjusted EBITDA, an increase in corporate expenses. The Animal Health segment posted $163.8 million of net sales for the quarter, which represents an increase of $12.9 million or 9% versus the same quarter prior year. Within the Animal Health segment, we reported a $5.5 million or 6% increase in MFAs and other versus the same quarter prior year. In terms of profitability for the segment, Animal Health adjusted EBITDA was $37.1 million, a 10% improvement over the same quarter prior year due to higher gross profit on higher sales and margin improvement, partially offset by an increase in SG&A. Net sales for the third quarter were $61.6 million, $2 million more than the prior quarter, but a $5 million or 8% decline versus the same quarter prior year, driven by a decrease in demand for trace minerals. Looking at our Performance Products segment, net sales of $19.2 million reflects a $4.1 million or healthy 27% improvement driven primarily by increased demand for copper-based products and higher average selling prices for copper-based products and ingredients for personal care products. The negative $45 million in free cash flow for the 12 months ended December 31, 2022, was driven primarily by a $58 million increase in inventory over the same period representing approximately 1 month of additional inventory on hand, which is intended to mitigate the risk of supply chain disruptions, which impact the company's ability to fulfil customer orders on a timely basis. As Jack mentioned, in addition to reiterating guidance for net sales of $960 million to $1 billion and adjusted EBITDA guidance of $113 million to $118 million, we are iterating guidance for adjusted net income, adjusted diluted EPS and our adjusted effective tax. Net income of $34 million to $38 million, which is a reduction from the $39 million to $43 million range previously communicated and reflective of the after-tax effect of the $6.6 million of environmental cost charges to the P&L in the second quarter."
