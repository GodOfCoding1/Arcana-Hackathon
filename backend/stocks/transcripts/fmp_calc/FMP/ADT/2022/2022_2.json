    "content": " We released our strong second quarter results this morning, showing substantial year-over-year improvements in total revenue and adjusted EBITDA, solid free cash flow generation, and for the first time since our IPO, positive adjusted net income of $50 million or $0.06 per share. We have great momentum in our core engine, the consumer business, solid demand for ADT products and services, is driving subscriber growth, higher average pricing and a record RMR balance, while also improving our operating efficiency. Our residential installation revenue per unit increased 23% year-over-year in the second quarter and 7% versus the first quarter, on the strength of the doorbell launch earlier this year. Our revenue growth, combined with efficiency improvements, drove a 10% increase in adjusted EBITDA to $597 million. The highlight for the quarter was the outstanding performance of our core consumer and small business or CSB segment, which delivered total revenue of $1.1 billion, an increase of $66 million or 6% versus last year. Our Solar segment posted revenue of $215 million and an adjusted EBITDA loss of $15 million, driven by reserves for the lender insolvency and challenges converting sales to installs as we solidify processes and structure to manage our rapid growth. Adjusted free cash flow was $185 million, up 13% in the quarter, on higher recurring revenue flow-through and lower net subscriber investments. And Ashish, on the economic side, what you saw here in the quarter is that the 23% increase in installation revenue per unit, that was largely driven by some of these Google devices that Jim just mentioned."
