We are also seeing good traction with SAC efficiency and our consumer and small business segment, with record high installation revenue per unit that was up more than 30% versus prior year, aided by higher attachment rate for our Google Doorbell sales and increased pull-through of additional products. Our new solar business also delivered strong results in the first full quarter since our December acquisition of Sunpro, with a revenue of $192 million and adjusted EBITDA of $17 million.
