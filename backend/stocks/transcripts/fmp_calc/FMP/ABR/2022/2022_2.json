    "content": " We also recorded $17.6 million of mortgage servicing rights income related to $1.2 billion of committed loans in the second quarter, representing an average MSR rate of around 1.48% compared to 1.57% last quarter, mostly due to a greater mix of larger loans in the second quarter that contain lower servicing fees. Our $15 billion investment portfolio had an all-in yield of 5.82% at June 30 compared to 4.74% at March 31, mainly due to significant increases in LIBOR and SOFR rates, which was partially offset by higher rates on runoff as compared to new originations during the quarter."
