    "content": " We also recorded $15 million of mortgage servicing rights income related to $975 million of committed loans in the first quarter, representing an average MSR rate of around 1.57% compared to 1.88% last quarter, mainly due to having a greater mix of Fannie Mae loans in the fourth quarter versus the first quarter, and those loans contain higher servicing fees. Our overall net interest spreads in our core assets decreased to 2.21% this quarter compared to 2.38% last quarter, and our overall spot net interest spreads were also down to 1.93% at March 31 from 2.01% at December 31 due to yield compression on new originations as compared to runoff and from debt cost increasing more than asset yields as a result of rising interest rates and LIBOR floors that are still in effect on certain loans in our portfolio."
