    "content": " Although we are not prepared to discuss specific plans for 2023, we are positioned to deliver on all of our commitments: significant free cash flow generation, the return of at least 30% of cash flow from operations in the form of dividends, supplemental share repurchases and debt reduction and an investment program that generates mid-single-digit growth. During the second quarter, Coterra generated discretionary cash flow of $1.49 billion in the quarter, which was up 21% quarter-over-quarter, driven by strong operational execution and robust commodity prices."
