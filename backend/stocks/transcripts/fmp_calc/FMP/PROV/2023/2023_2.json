    "content": " For the three months ended December 31, 2022, loans held for investment increased by approximately 5% compared to September 30, 2022 ending balances, with the increase in single family loans more than offsetting the small declines in the multifamily commercial real estate and construction loan categories. Our net interest margin was unchanged at 3.05% for the quarter ended December 31, 2022, compared to the September 2022 sequential quarter as the net result of a 27 basis point increase in the average yield on total interest earning assets and a 28 basis point increase in the cost of total interest bearing liabilities. Notably, our average cost of deposits increased by just 7 basis points to 20 basis points for the quarter ended December 31, 2022, compared to 13 basis points in the prior sequential quarter, but our borrowing costs increased by 99 basis points in the December 2022 quarter compared to the September 2022 quarter."
