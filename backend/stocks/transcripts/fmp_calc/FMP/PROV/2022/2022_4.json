    "content": " For the 3 months ended June 30, 2022, loans held for investment increased by approximately 5% as compared to March 31, 2022 starting balances with an increase in single family more than setting small declines in the multifamily commercial real estate and construction loan categories. Our net interest margin expanded by 32 basis points for the quarter ended June 30, 2022, compared to the March 2022 sequential quarter, as a result of a 32 basis point increase in the average yield in total interest-earning assets and one basis point decrease in the cost of total interest-bearing liabilities. The 2.93% net interest margin this quarter was positively impacted by approximately 11 basis points as a result of lower net deferred cost - loan costs associated with fewer loan payoffs in the June in 2022 quarter in comparison to the average net deferred loan cost amortization of the five previous quarters and the $94,000 deferred loan fee recovery from a legacy restructured loan that paid off this quarter. In the September quarter, we have modeled approximately $101 million of our loan portfolio that will be repricing upward, and we have modeled based upon June 30 data that, that $101 million will be readjusting upward by approximately 82 basis points. And it wouldn't surprise me that even though we expect net interest margin to expand, as we think about the near-term quarters or future - near-term future quarters, I don't know that we would expect another rise of 32 basis points in the near term future quarters even though we expect an increase\n Okay. And if I think overall funding costs as well and primarily in borrowings, we have $20 million of Federal Home Loan Bank advances maturing in the September quarter for weighted average cost of those advances are 175 basis points."
