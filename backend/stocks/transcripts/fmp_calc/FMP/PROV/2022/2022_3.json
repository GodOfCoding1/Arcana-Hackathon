    "content": " During the most recent quarter, we also experienced $53.6 million of loan principal payments and payoffs which is down from a $72.5 million in the December 2021 quarter, and at the lower end of the quarterly range. Additionally, our single-family and multi-family pipelines are similar in size to last quarter, suggesting our originations and purchases in the June 2022 quarter will fall in the range of recent prior quarters between $60 and $94 million. For the three months ended March 31, 2022, loans held for investment increased by approximately 5% compared to December 31st, 2021, with increases in the single-family, multi-family, commercial real estate, and construction loan categories. Our net interest margin compressed by three basis points for the quarter ended March 31, 2022, compared to the December 2021 sequential quarter. Additionally, our borrowing costs decreased by approximately 17 basis points in the March '22 -- '22 quarter compared to the December 2021 quarter, primarily due to a $39,000 prepayment fee in the December quarter that was not replicated in the March 2022 quarter. The 2.61% net interest margin this quarter was positively impacted by approximately 4 basis points as a result of lower net deferred loan costs associated with fewer loan payoffs in the March 2022 quarter, in comparison to the average net deferred loan cost amortization of the previous five quarters. And to the extent than that we're able to originate and purchase that recent range of 60 to 94 million and pay off volume comes down, it once again suggests a positive dynamic with respect to growth of the loan portfolio in the June quarter. In the June Quarter, we have approximately $67 million of loans that we'll re-price and they will re-price upward from their current interest rate."
