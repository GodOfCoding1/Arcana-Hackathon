    "content": " During the most recent quarter, we also experienced $72.5 million of loan principal payments and payoffs which is up from $53.9 million in the September 2021 quarter and still tempering the growth rate of loans held for investment. 03:35 For the three months ended December 31, 2021 loans held for investment decreased by approximately 1% compared to September 30, 2021, the decreases in the multifamily and commercial real estate loan or categories partly offset by growth in the single-family and construction loan categories. 05:46 Our net interest margin compressed by 7 basis points for the quarter ended December 31, 2021 compared to the September 2021 sequential quarter as a result of an 8 basis point decrease in the average yield on total interest-bearing assets, and no change in the cost of total interest bearing liabilities. Notably, our average cost of deposits decreased by 1 basis point to 12 basis points for the quarter ended December 31, 2021 compared to the prior sequential quarter. 06:45 Additionally, our borrowing costs reduced by approximately 22 basis points in the December 2021 quarter compared to the September 2020 quarter primarily due to a $39,000 prepayment fee in December that was not incurred in the September 2021 quarter. The 2.64% net interest margin this quarter was positively impacted by the approximately 3 basis points, as a result of the $90,000 recovery of loan interest income on a partially charge-off loan that paid in full in the December 2021 quarter and negatively impacted by approximately 1 basis point as a result of the $39,000 prepayment fee incurred on the prepayment of FHLB advance described earlier."
