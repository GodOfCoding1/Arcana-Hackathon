    "content": " As we grow our datapoints, we're able to discover new places where our drugs work such as the ones I outlined with ATRT and brain mets or we can find new indications or new uses of drug -- new drug targets such as LP-284 which again wasn't even in our portfolio less than two years ago, I said less than one year ago. During the year, we expect to bring multiple assets into focused clinical trials in 2022, where there's demonstrated patient need or where there's really no proven therapy, for example, brain mets or ATRT, while remaining focused on capital efficiency."
