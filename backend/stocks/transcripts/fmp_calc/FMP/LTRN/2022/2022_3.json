    "content": " Today, we have several notable advancements to share with you, including updates about the advancement of our Harmonic clinical trial for LP-300 in never-smokers with non-small cell lung cancer, updates on the IND statuses of 184 and 284 and the clinical trial indications for those drugs. It's important to note that in a previous Phase 3 multicenter clinical trial, a subset of never-smoker patients with non-small cell lung cancer receiving LP-300 with chemotherapy showed increased overall and two year survival of 91% and 125%, respectively compared to patients who just received chemotherapy alone. Moving on to our next drug program, we're currently developing LP-184 for two major classes of cancers, solid tumors, including genetically defined pancreatic and bladder cancers and central nervous system cancers, including GBM or glioblastoma, and brain mets and also ATRT. Later this quarter and this year Lantern will be presenting new preclinical data at several scientific conferences, including the Society of Neuro-Oncology\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Annual Meeting in Tampa, that's coming up in the 16th through the 20th, the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium in early December, we're presenting some exciting new data and the American Society of Hematology, ASH in New Orleans in mid-December, where we'll be talking more about 284. Ultimately, we believe many of our programs, as they further develop, can be partnered out for several hundred million or potentially even billions of dollars in addition to providing multiple shots on goal, our maturing development pipeline with two Phase 2 assets, the upcoming launch of multiple Phase 1 trials and additional assets under development, should provide a steady flow of catalysts, news and data moving forward to track an increasing level of interest from both investment communities and biopharma companies."
