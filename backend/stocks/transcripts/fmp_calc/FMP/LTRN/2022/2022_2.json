    "content": " Today, we have several notable advancements to share with you, including updates about the launch of our Phase 2 trial, for LP-300 in lung cancer, the Harmonic trial, the pathway towards Phase 1 first-in-human clinical trials for LP-184 and LP-284 updates on the expansion of RADR, as well as several operational and financial highlights. It's important to note that in a previous three \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Phase 3 multi-centered clinical trial, a subset of never smoker patients with non-small cell lung cancer receiving LP-300 with a chemo doublet showed increased overall and two-year survival. In addition to the Phase 2 trial for LP-300, we continue to advance multiple preclinical programs, and we also expect to launch three first-in-human Phase 1 trials over the next 12 months for our drug candidates, LP-184 and LP-284. Conducting two Phase 1 trials with LP-184 will allow us to maximize the potential of a compound for these different cancer types and very importantly, generate sufficient data for partnering or licensing interest in these clinically distinct cancers."
