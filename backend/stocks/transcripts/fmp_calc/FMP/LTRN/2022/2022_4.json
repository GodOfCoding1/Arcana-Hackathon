    "content": " This is really also the future of drug development, specifically in cancer where there's so much data available, and that data can be used to accelerate programs, derisk the identification of patients who will respond to the drug, or diseases that will best benefit from the therapy and progress those potentially life changing medicines with reduced cost and reduced time. STAR-001's powerful anti-tumor mechanism, synthetic lethality, coupled with the collaborations that we've done with internationally recognized institutions including Hopkins and the Greehey Children's Cancer Center at UT Health San Antonio, make it well positioned to rapidly advanced these CNS focused therapies in a targeted and efficient clinical development pathway. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we made a one-time, $1 million upfront payment to Allarity Therapeutics to take the rights to LP-100 back into our control, which we are now looking at combining with PARP inhibitors in a combination program aimed at cancers with homologous repair deficiency, or HRD cancers."
