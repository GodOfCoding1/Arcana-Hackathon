    "content": " We generated $105.3 million in total revenues, including SimpleNexus, a 50% increase over the third quarter of fiscal \u00e2\u0080\u009822. However, we think it is important in uncertain times to provide even greater visibility into our current thinking as we factor in the impact of the three headwinds I mentioned earlier, and the overall macro environment we are currently planning for nCino to be a rule of 30 company next fiscal year with a mix between total revenue growth, and non-GAAP operating income margin trending towards 20% and 10% respectively. We also had significant expansion deals with existing customers in the community and regional market, including a $7 billion Colorado bank expanding their use of nCino from commercial lending to add deposit account opening and treasury sales and on-boarding, and a $7 billion bank in Hawaii, adding retail lending and deposit account openings. Subscription revenues for the third quarter were $88.3 million, an increase of 55% year-over-year, representing 84% of total revenues. Non-U.S. revenues were $15.9 million or 15% of total revenues in the third quarter, up 36% year-over-year or 55% growth in constant currency. One moment for our next question. One moment for our next question. One moment for our next question. One moment for our next question. One moment for our next question. One moment for our next question.
