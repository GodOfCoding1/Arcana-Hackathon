    "content": " Total revenues were $109.2 million in the fourth quarter, an increase of 46% year-over-year and $408.3 million for fiscal '23, an increase of 49% year-over-year. Organic subscription revenues were $77 million for the fourth quarter and $285 million for the full year, representing 30% and 29% growth year-over-year, respectively. As Pierre and Josh noted, SimpleNexus had another strong quarter in a challenging mortgage market, organically growing total revenues by 27% and subscription revenues by 28% year-over-year. Approximately $5 million of restructuring charges accrued in the fourth quarter of fiscal '23 will be reflected in cash from operations in the first quarter of fiscal '24, Capital expenditures should begin to moderate as we complete improvements to our facilities in Wilmington this year, and we expect to generate positive free cash flow for the full fiscal year '24. First, we are assuming unique and historically high annualized subscription revenue churn of approximately 6% for the combined business from independent mortgage banks impacted by adverse conditions in the mortgage market, the remaining PPP churn and over $3.25 million from two bank operating system customers that are being acquired by noncustomers.
