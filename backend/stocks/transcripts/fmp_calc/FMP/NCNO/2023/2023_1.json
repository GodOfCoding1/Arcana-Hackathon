    "content": " Our team executed extremely well in the first quarter, highlighted by our strong topline performance with $94.2 million in total revenues, an increase of 51% over the first quarter of fiscal 2022, which includes the addition of SimpleNexus' revenues for the first full quarter. As Pierre mentioned, they had a strong start to the quarter with the count of new customers added in the quarter across all their solutions up 80% from the first quarter last year, including a larger mix of banks. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. So we always like to look around what's going on to be actually aware of what's happening in the market, but I can tell you right now we are laser focused on integrating SimpleNexus on cross-selling it into our customer base and making sure that we pay the right amount of attention to the independent mortgage bankers base, which is where they come from, so that they feel actually appreciated and loved and that's the focus of that market. So we like what we've done, but as I've explained before, we look at our acquisitions as architectural pieces that we add to the puzzle because it's all done in the architectural design of a single platform that is well integrated and that is client centric, and then focused on the delivery methods through the end user, whether it's a bank officer or end customer. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. Your line is now open."
