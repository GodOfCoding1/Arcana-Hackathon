    "content": "  For the first quarter 2022, PMT reported a net loss attributable to common shareholders of $29.6 million or $0.32 per common share as fair value declines in its credit sensitive strategies due to credit spread widening and a tax provision in its taxable REIT subsidiary more than offset strong performance from the interest rate sensitive strategies. Now, I would like to discuss PMT\u2019s credit sensitive strategies, which primarily consist seasoned investments in organically created CRT from PMT\u2019s production, investments in non-Agency subordinate bonds from private label securitizations of PMT\u2019s production and opportunistic investments in GSE CRT."
