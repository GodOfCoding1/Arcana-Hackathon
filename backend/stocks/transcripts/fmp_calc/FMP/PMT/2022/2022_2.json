    "content": "  PMT reported a net loss of $81.2 million, or $0.88 per common share for the second quarter, as fair value declines in its credit sensitive strategies due to continued spread widening more than offset strong performance from its strategies excluding the impacts of market-driven fair value changes. During the quarter, we repurchased 1.9 million shares of PMT\u00e2\u0080\u0099s common stock for $28 million at an average price of $14.72, significantly below current book value per share; and in July we repurchased an additional 510,000 shares, for an approximate cost of $7.3 million at $14.30 per share. Losses on PMT\u00e2\u0080\u0099s organically-created CRT investments also included $20.2 million in realized gains and carry, $4.5 million in net recoveries of previously-realized losses, primarily related to L Street Securities 2017-PM1, $2.4 million in interest income on cash deposits, $9.7 million of financing expenses, and $100,000 of expenses to assist certain borrowers in mitigating loan delinquencies they incurred as a result of dislocations arising from the COVID-19 pandemic."
