    "content": " Everybody wants to try the product, the enthusiasm and the response, staff, etcetera, is always robust, but we're getting them to look at something that as providers, they really haven't ever paid attention to or looked at before and beyond that it's an area of the face in medical aesthetics that they're also not experts in. And I think we're very comfortable operating in that environment because we have a year and a half of real world experience that I think has validated everything we are trying to teach and build with this market, a wide range of patients, very consistent product performance and no AE surprises that we didn't see in our clinical studies and probably more so a real world rate that is reflective, if not a little bit less than an already low rate of side effects seen in the clinical studies."
