    "content": " Total revenues relating entirely to net product sales of UPNEEQ increased by $7.8 million to $10.0 million in quarter three due to an increase in sales volume, reflecting expanded commercialization into eye care markets and effective in February 2022, medical aesthetics market. Harnessing technology to further support growth, this platform will enable a full suite of expanded functionality and efficiency for both providers and patients, including subscription and auto refill capabilities, which notably will serve to reward patients for frequency of use, while enabling providers to earn an ongoing revenue stream from refills after initiating treatment without any direct patient interaction required. Your line is open. Your line is open. So again I think unique in a lot of ways, but also an opportunity to further create opportunity with the BDMs in a practice to deliver value because their ability to identify, diagnose and treat patients will now pay dividends moving forward without having to continue to remember to ask if patients need more when they're in for whatever other services they're getting in a perpetuity cycle. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open."
