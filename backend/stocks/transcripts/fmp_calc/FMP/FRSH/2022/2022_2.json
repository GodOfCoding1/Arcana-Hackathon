    "content": " I would now like to hand the conference over to Vice President, Investor Relations, Joon Huh. These forward-looking statements are based on Freshworks' current expectations and estimates about its business and industry, management's beliefs and certain assumptions made by the company as of the date hereof, all of which are subject to change. These statements are subject to risks, uncertainties, and assumptions that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. For a discussion of material risks and other important factors that could affect our results, please refer to today's earnings release, our most recently filed Form 10-Q and other periodic of filings with the SEC. Freshworks assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements in order to reflect events or circumstances that may arise after the date of this presentation, except as required by law. During the course of today's call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures, reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures are included in our earnings release for our second quarter 2022 results, which we issued earlier today and is available on our Investor Relations website at ir.freshworks.com. I encourage you to visit our investor relations site to access our earnings release, periodic SEC reports, a replay of today's call, or to learn more about Freshworks. I will start the call with the recap of our results, then highlight our latest product updates and close with what we are seeing in the current market environment. Overall, we had a solid second quarter. In Q2, we added nearly 1,800 net new customers. Today, 23% of our customers use more than one Freshworks product. Overall, I am really proud of our team and the progress we made in Q2, continuing our mission to deliver business software that people love to use. On the product front, let me start with Freshservice where continued demand in the mid-market is creating sustainable growth for our business. Companies like Toshiba, Dynatrace and WD-40 are using our easy to use ITSM solution to support their global workforces. One of our largest Freshservice deals this quarter was sourced by a regional channel partner in Africa, and this was closed alongside Device42, our technology partner for enterprise asset management that we announced last quarter. In Q2, we also strengthened our enterprise grade IT operations management capabilities with enhanced alert management and on-call management features. Using these new Freshservice capabilities, a large bank in Southeast Asia, nearly 4,000 employees, was able to cut down their IT related alerts by approximately 60%. For example, AMEX Global Business Travel, the publicly listed global travel management company, uses Freshservice for both their IT and HR departments to deliver exceptional support to over 13,000 employees. Now, let's shift to the customer side of the business where conversational engagement is a key part of our strategy to help companies reach and retain their customers wherever they are. In Q2, we brought back our Freshchat brand, previously known as Freshdesk Messaging, to better communicate our ability to create a seamless, conversational experience combining bots and live agent experience to our customers. With Freshchat, businesses can use bots to automate transactional first level of support and gracefully hand over to a human agent for more complex use cases without sacrificing customer experience. After the launch of CRM for e-commerce in Q1, we took our conversational engagement strategy, a step further by re-architecting our standalone Freshchat product to work on top of our unified customer record platform, or UCR, along with Freshsales and Freshmarketer. Today, brands sell more and more through digital channels and their customers expect instant support on these third-party messaging apps like WhatsApp or Apple Business Chat, for example. With the addition of Freshchat to the UCR, we can now sell to the marketing, sales or support organization first, and then expand into the other departments by showcasing the power of unified customer communications. In Q2, we added integrations for Instagram and Google Business Messages. A leading digital bank and payments company, with millions of customers and a long time Freshworks customer, expanded their use of Freshchat in Q2, an increased overall customer satisfaction. Thousands of agents are now armed with live messaging capabilities that go beyond the website to provide customers with a seamless experience across iMessage, and then mobile app. In Q2, we built new Freshdesk Omnichannel integrations, with telephonic providers like Five9, to optimize agent productivity when supporting customers across chat, email, social and voice seamlessly. A new integration with workforce management software company, Injixo, also helps larger companies better manage their contact center team staffing, scheduling and workloads. Thomas Cook, a popular global travel company, has a customer operations team of 80 people responsible for managing over 20,000 contacts every week. Companies of all sizes are realizing the importance of streamlining and automating customer communications across all channels to help customer facing sales, marketing, and support teams, understand and serve their customers better. Overall, we had a solid quarter despite the changing macro environment. In Europe, we are pleased that we improved our execution and achieved higher close rates compared to Q1. Among our global customer base, we are seeing a varying degree of impact across segments. Our SMB customers are feeling the macro pressures, and we are seeing this translate to higher churn, especially at the lower end of SMB in companies with fewer than 50 employees. In contrast, our larger customers in mid-market enterprise are showing more resilience and they continue to grow their investment with us. As our business has moved more upmarket, our largest customers today represent the majority of our business at approximately 57% of our ARR. As a result, our overall churn rates for the company were roughly the same quarter-over-quarter as the higher SMB churn was offset by improvement in mid-market and enterprise statements. Additionally, we are seeing steady increases in the average revenue per account, reflecting our ongoing customer expansion and larger deal sizes. In an environment where companies are spending more conservatively, I'm confident that Freshworks' affordable products will continue to deliver incredible value to our customers around the world and continue our long-term growth. As Gi mentioned, we're pleased with our solid execution in the second quarter. We maintained our strong expansion motion, with 115% net dollar retention adjusting for constant currency, while adding new business and customers across our three broad product categories in customer support, sales and marketing and ITSM. Although, the negative impacts from FX increased throughout the quarter, we beat expectations for revenue, non-GAAP operating loss and billings growth in Q2, demonstrating the resiliency of our business model in a changing macro environment. In fact, Q2 revenue growth would have been approximately 1% higher if currency rates remain the same from our Q1 earnings call. With FX volatility increasing over the past several quarters, I'll spend more time on the call today talking about constant currency comparisons both year-over-year and compared to our prior estimates last quarter. So, you'll get a better view of our underlying business fundamentals. As I normally do, I'll review our financial results from the recent quarter, provide background on key metrics and close with our expectations for the upcoming quarter Q3, and full year 2022. I'll focus most of my financial results discussion around non-GAAP numbers, which exclude the impact of stock-based compensation and related expenses, payroll taxes on employee stock transactions, amortization of acquired intangibles and other adjustments. Revenue grew 40%, adjusting for constant currency or 37% as reported to $121.4 million in Q2. We maintained a healthy expansion rate for our products, similar to Q1, with additional agents receipts being the largest driver of this expansion. We're also seeing a steady increase in our multi-product adoption, up 1% again to 23%. From a product line perspective, Freshservice continues to deliver strong growth and was the largest contributor to ARR growth in the quarter. We maintained steady non-GAAP gross margins at 82%, which was in line with the prior quarter and continues to be at robust levels as we scale the business. In Q2, non-GAAP operating expenses increased to $115.4 million. As we mentioned last time, our annual merit cycle takes effect during the second quarter each year, resulting in higher personnel costs. Additionally, for sales and marketing, we had increases in travel activity, field marketing initiatives and in-person events, including our Global Jam event, which contributed to the higher expenses quarter-over-quarter. As you would expect, rising inflation resulting in elevated supply costs and travel expenses for the business. Our revenue beat, combined with effective cost management, led to a non-GAAP operating loss of $15.8 million and $1.7 million ahead of our expectations for Q2. The consistency of net dollar retention, or NDR, adjusting for constant currency, over the past five quarters reflects the ongoing expansion activity in the business and also our ability to effectively manage churn over this time. Now as we look forward into Q3, we expect FX rates and a slowing economy to impact our overall expansion rates, resulting in a reported NDR ticking down to about 110%. Customers contributing more than $5,000 in ARR grew 22% to 16,212 in the quarter and continues to represent 86% of our ARR. With a meaningful number of customers falling below the threshold of $5,000 in ARR because of FX moves, we're also providing the growth of this metric on a constant currency basis for Q2, which was 25% year-over-year. For larger customers contributing more than $50,000 in ARR, this customer count grew 42% to 1,648 and now represents 43% of our ARR. Adjusting for currency, this customer cohort grew at 48%. Lastly, our total customers grew to over 59,900 with a net add of nearly 1,800 customers in Q2 as our average revenue per account continued to increase in the quarter. Q2 calculated billings outperformed our expectations as this metric grew 33% year-over-year, despite a negative 5% impact from FX movements. Other factors also impacting this growth rate include billing duration mix and reserve activity, each at positive 1%. Adjusting for these factors, our normalized calculated billings growth rate was approximately 36% in Q2, up slightly from the prior quarter. Given that calculated billings growth can fluctuate quarterly due to these factors, we're providing a preliminary view for Q3 billings. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of approximately $1.2 billion, similar to the prior quarter. We expect to continue net settling vested equity amounts for the foreseeable future, resulting in quarterly cash usage of approximately $16 million at current stock price levels. For free cash flow expectations, we are maintaining our prior estimates. We expect free cash flow to be negative $20 million for the full year of 2022, with estimates of negative $10 million for Q3 and slightly positive for Q4. We feel good about our cash balance, and we are well-positioned for durable growth. We have approximately 322 million shares outstanding on a fully diluted basis using the treasury method as of June 30, 2022. For the third quarter of 2022, we expect revenue to be in the range of $124.5 million to $126.5 million, growing 29% to 31% year-over-year. Adjusting for constant currency, this reflects growth from 31% to 33% year-over-year. Non-GAAP loss from operations to be in the range of $14.5 million to $12.5 million, and non-GAAP net loss per share to be in the range of $0.07 to $0.05, assuming weighted average shares outstanding of approximately 286.7 million. For the full year 2022, we expect revenue to be in the range of $493 million to $497 million, growing 33% to 34% year-over-year. Adjusting for constant currency, this reflects growth of 35% to 36% year-over-year. Non-GAAP loss from operations to be in the range of $42.5 million to $38.5 million, and non-GAAP net loss per share to be in the range of $0.18 to $0.16, assuming weighted average outstanding shares of approximately 284.6 million. These estimates are based on FX rates as of July 29, 2022. As you know, we're trying to provide our best view of the business as of today and have taken all of the following items into account in arriving at our estimates. As the dollar has strengthened versus these currencies, this has resulted in a negative impact of approximately $4 million to our full year 2022 revenue compared to our previously provided estimates. While we improved our execution quarter-over-quarter with higher close rates and productivity from our field teams, this region is feeling a greater impact from the current macroeconomic environment. Smaller customers are feeling the macro pressures, so we're seeing slower growth in this segment, especially on the very low-end of SMB. While we may see higher costs in certain areas, we plan to manage the business overall to deliver on our efficiency goals for the year. We are delivering real value to our customers with our products in this changing macroeconomic environment, and we remain confident in our long-term growth opportunities. You talked about in the very small end of the business, seeing some churn there potentially, and that's factored into some slow growth there factored into the guide. It sounds like you had some real good results there, that enterprise customer cohort growth at 25% constant currency, holding very nicely there. How much of that would you attribute to the effort to move upmarket, some productivity and some of the hires you've had. So, in the really lower end of the SMB is where we saw an increased churn. Conversations continue with customers where people are talking about being more conservative in their spending, et cetera. But overall, I think we've not done anything significantly new to close more enterprise deals or anything like that. So, the primary land is through ITSM, but the people use SaaS license management, project management. They're also planning to add on enterprise service management and ITOM, but we don't have separate land products for each one of those. You called that about 23%, I think, of customers are doing multi-product. I can take that, Ryan. I mean, it picked up 1% this past quarter from 22%, and it's just steadily been growing. A lot of it is coming from our omnichannel solution still on our Freshdesk side, but we're starting to see it now on the ITSM side as well as we add new modules that people can adopt. I can take that, Ryan. So, I think Europe, we are seeing a little bit more pronounced macro impact than the rest of the regions, especially like I think North America and like we have EMEA, which is Asia-Pacific, Middle East, Africa. I also think because of the ongoing war, the currency effects. And we did call out that compared to last quarter, we actually felt that our teams executed better. But -- however, we are monitoring the situation, because the macro is a little bit more pronounced in Europe compared to other regions. So, we -- for euro and the British pound, we have multiple currencies, specifically the bigger currencies that we have exposure to our dollar GDP in Europe. Pat, we have about 25% of revenue exposure to euro and pound. So, here's my real question. So, my real question is, we all understand that the impact of the stronger dollar in terms of the difference between constant currency growth and reported revenue growth. So, to the customers there, the price looks the same, except as we translate it back, obviously, we're getting less USD for it. Thanks for taking the question. So, first one, I want to follow-up on a prior comment on the number of seats or users. As we're thinking about the macro this year, I know there's a lot of moving parts in ARR. We also have our cross-sell motion that adds to that, and then customers moving up the addition chain that they're using product. Now going forward, when we look at the back half of the year, half of the adjustment we made to revenue was on FX. Anecdotally, if companies are not hiring, right, we would expect that they would not be adding more agents. So, we do think there might be some pressure on the expansion side. And maybe just a follow-up, I'd be curious -- obviously, the close in Europe, that sounded better. No, we're not commenting on July specifically or the quarter beyond what the guidance we gave. And obviously, we're talking about our expectations today. So, we're kind of building on what we think is going to happen this quarter based on what we know as of today. Girish, on Freshchat and overall on the unified customer architecture, it seems like you have now three products kind of architected that way. So, now we have marketing, sales and conversational support and bots, all integrated into a single customer record. And we are working on moving Freshdesk, which is our largest business, onto the platform. And we will quickly -- we'll update on that as soon as it's ready, but we are making progress on that front. The billings guidance for next quarter, I know it's everybody's favorite subject, but it seems like a big decel from 33 at least in USD to 25. It seems like revenue, it seems you're assuming about a one point headwind for next quarter, maybe DR has a bigger impact from FX. I mean, what we've built in is kind of what we talked about in terms of the macro stuff. So, we are seeing on the SMB side, right, we said the churn has picked up a little bit. Europe, we are expecting it to -- we're cautious, right, as we go into Europe, and we're looking at it right now. Now again, the 25% we're talking about is going to be the as reported number. We don't like billings as a proxy for how we're doing necessarily, because there's so much noise in it. And so, we're kind of -- the number we can speak to is kind of what we see, what would be in the system and then what we would see based on historical trends, but they haven't been perfect, but that is a preliminary view of what we see today. Well, I think what we're saying is that the macro environment -- I think the macro environment from a quarter ago -- FX has continued to move against us, right, as -- if you consider that macro. SMB, I do think, is getting impacted from three to six months ago. A quarter ago, we were talking about some of the go-to-market issues in Europe and so forth. So, I think specifically on Europe, we invested last quarter, as we said, in ongoing training and sales enablement of our reps. And we saw that translate into a better execution, resulting in higher conversion rates in the field in Q2 when compared to Q1. Specifically on the other areas of improvement, I think we are also looking at what are the more efficient places in which we could channel investments like, for example, we are looking at investing more in Freshservice for the short-term as it brings more mid-market customers. So, that's an area that we are currently working on. And because we are multi-product, we have the ability to kind of adjust the levers that we have with our control and control the spend accordingly. Understanding that gross retention, as you called out, seeing more pressure in that sub 50 cohort. And this has been something that's kind of been in the region of high teens, low 20s. And then what we just kind of indicated is that hey, we actually have seen churn pick up a little bit on the SMB side. So, it's actually picked up for all of the SMB, but actually, it's probably worse than that 0 to 50 bucket. That being said, our mid-market enterprise business has proven to be even more resilient, and it's kind of outweighed any of the negative impacts of that churn. So, we're still -- kind of our overall churn rates have stayed roughly the same. Thanks for taking the question. So, first of all, I'd like to start off by saying one of the key value propositions of Freshworks is that we are not just easy to use and easy to set up, but we are also more affordable compared to expensive enterprise vendors. And anecdotally, we have seen that businesses come to us when they want to save costs. So, now having said that, as we look at the recessionary environment and as we look at the different parts of our business, we are clearly seeing areas where we could channelize our investments better. Longer term, our priorities haven't changed because we believe that there is enough growth left in each of our three large markets. Thanks for taking the question. And I actually had three topics I wanted to touch base on, churn, competition and cash. But if I look at the mix of the business relative to, let's say, SMB, while it's 70% plus of the logos, it's only 14% of ARR. I guess, the impact of logos, but it doesn't feel like it could be a huge material impact, unless you saw churn creep up in the mid-market large enterprise space. So, it's not quite aligned that way. Now of our ARR base that we would say is SMB, it's just over that 40% number. And in that, yes, we are seeing a little bit of -- the churn pick up a little bit. And then what we highlighted is in that 1 to 50, which is kind of the low-end of SMB. That being said, you're right that the broad -- the majority of our ARR is coming from that mid-market enterprise, and that base has remained really resilient and is kind of offsetting any negative pressure right now that we're seeing from the SMB side. So, think of SMB as the kind of more 40% of the ARR base, and that's really where you're starting to see some churn pick up. And then on competition, obviously, as things start to get tough in the environment, you have some private companies that you compete against that obviously, funding might become an issue, you have larger competitors that are in the process of being acquired. Just wondering if you've seen any sort of unusual behavior on the -- bad or good behavior on the competitive front in the last, let's say, three months. If you look at the value proposition of why people choose us or competition, it continues to be the same rapid time to value, easy to use, easy to onboard and more affordable pricing. Also, we have seen the larger enterprise vendors actually reporting like longer sales cycles and so on. So -- but I will call out -- okay, we are not seeing any impact on private funded companies doing any rational behavior yet. Obviously, if I think about the track record of the business, you've been generating positive free cash flow in fiscal 2020. In 2021, it looks like you'll burn a little bit of cash flow this year. So, you're not going to consume much of that $1 billion in cash that you have. So, we have a roadmap to where we want to go in terms of our product portfolio, and we have a corporate development team that constantly looks at any opportunities that may come up and which we want to kind of look at. But especially given the private markets have been, like really super high, I think the valuation resets will probably take some more time for the founders to kind of adjust to the new price. It's something interesting comes, which gives us a technology advantage on a go-to-market advantage, we may consider that, but we don't have to acquire for revenue. It's more like anything that is really good teams, tech, or a go-to-market advantage is why we are looking at it. I think from a -- hey, Brent, it's Tyler. The conversion rates, we're actually really happy with in Q2. And so, we kind of looked at it -- that's why it was execution based. And then, obviously, it's hard to parse out these things, right, on these broader macro things and to really remove all the variables. So that's why we're still calling out, because Europe is, in general, still under some pressure. Thanks for taking the question. We have not broken out the kind of the percentages of where expansion is coming from, but it is -- by far, the majority of our expansion does come from agent and seat expansion. I guess want to just kind of a follow-up to, I think Brent's question on the competitive environment. Obviously, it's a well-known vendor in the space. And so, it's like pretty much every deal, we go head-to-head and most of the time. But I think having said that, like quite recently, we saw some like two encouraging wins, one in the FinTech space, both are the north of 50k kind of deals. And I think we would hope that if they get taken private, there's some -- we are doing everything that we can in order to kind of execute better and continue to win. One of the questions I've received from different shareholders and different stocks over the last couple of three months pretty heavily is on share-based compensation and expectations going forward for a variety of reasons, whether it's where stock prices are right now or other maybe company-specific reasons. But your share-based comp in the quarter as a percentage of revenues trended at about 40%, which is higher than the typical SaaS company. We did have grants last year and even grants this year that we're taking that expense, and a lot of that's taken over a four-year kind of straight line method. And so, it's still going to run at kind of creates for the foreseeable future. Just given the strength you're seeing in the mid-market with Freshservice, I'm just wondering if you could put maybe a finer point on the go-to-market tweaks there as you start to lean in some of the stronger. Just if you could put a little bit of a finer point on that, I think that would be super helpful. Let me take the question, and welcome, Nick, to the Freshworks coverage. And so, Freshservice, clearly -- okay, overall, longer term, we are continuing to do a lot more in Freshservice. So that is what can help us drive a little bit more in the short-term, right, because mid-market enterprise deal pipeline gen, which if we start today, it may take at least one or two quarters for it to build. But primarily, the most important priority is in addition to the R&D investments that we have done in the year, but primarily, the most important -- the most immediate thing that they're considering is how can we do more in the digital SMB segment for Freshservice. At this time, I'd like to turn the call back over to Freshworks for closing remarks. If you have any questions, please feel free to reach out, and we'll talk to you next time."
