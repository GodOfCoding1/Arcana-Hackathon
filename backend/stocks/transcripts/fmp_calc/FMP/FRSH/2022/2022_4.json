    "content": " In Q4, we added approximately 1,800 new customers to our growing base and ended up with more than 63,400 total customers, including the San Francisco 49ers, Finchoice, Mahindra, Supara, St. We also improved our non-GAAP operating margin by 8 percentage points in Q4 on a year-over-year basis, and we generated positive free cash flow of $4 million in the quarter. So if you really think about Freshservice for Business Teams, one of the things I would like to tell you is even before the launch, we knew that almost 4,000-plus customers of Freshservice were actually using it outside of IT, like in departments like HR facilities, legal and finance."
