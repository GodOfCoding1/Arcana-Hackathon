    "content": " Fourth quarter revenues were $125 million, in line with our guidance and down 22% sequentially, reflecting the downturn in the semiconductor industry. And I think what's going to happen is as we come back in the second half, I expect the days to start tapering down each quarter in Q3 and Q4, though even in Q4, it will be above our model because if you looked already historically, as we had talked about in 2018, when we were out of sync with the analog, we always see the downturn first. And so when the inventory is depleted, we should see a rebound and also it's been, as Sandeep mentioned, it means almost a year since the pandemic-driven demand for appliances has really over stimulated that area, and that should eventually come back to some normal consumption, and we are looking forward to that as well. And by adjusting for that $65 million that you called out, kind of excess channel inventory, I mean, it looks like the revenue will be growing about 12% a year."
