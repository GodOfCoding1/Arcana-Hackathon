    "content": " And hello to everyone on the call, for the first quarter of 2022, total written premiums, the leading indicator of our future core and Ancillary revenue growth increased 41% to $451 million. Franchise generated core revenue of $18.3 million during the quarter, an increase of 54% from the year-ago period. Franchise core revenue growth is driven by strong new business production from franchisees, increased retention to 89% from our already industry leading levels and growing franchise count. Corporate core revenues were $18.2 million in the first quarter, an increase of 23% compared to the year-ago period. Total operating expenses for the first quarter of 2022, excluding equity-based compensation, were $40 million, up 38% from a year ago. The increase in compensation and benefits is being driven by our ongoing investment in headcount across the organization, particularly the hiring of corporate agents in support of franchise channel growth, service agents to manage our largest revenue stream, renewals, recruiting and on-boarding functions to continue our growth trajectory, and systems developers to ensure our technology is on the cutting edge for our clients and internal users. Total revenues for 2022 are expected to be between $197 million and $212 million representing organic growth of 30% on the low end of the range to 40% on the high end of the range, driven by high levels of core revenue growth and historically average contingent commissions. We're continuing to not only chase that backlog, but also recruit brand new agencies and franchises in the system and we feel like the 2022 signings will continue to make up a large portion of the operating franchise growth this year."
