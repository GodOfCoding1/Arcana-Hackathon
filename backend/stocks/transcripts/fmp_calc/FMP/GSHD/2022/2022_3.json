We're currently focused on enhancing service levels for our clients, building a healthy franchise business, optimizing productivity of corporate agents, opening new growth opportunities through technology, innovation and partnerships, and building the people, processes and systems that are prepared to operate at a much larger scale. Total revenues for 2022 are expected to be between $194 million and $205 million, representing organic growth of 28% at the low end of the range to 35% on the high end of the range, driven by continued high levels of core revenue growth offset by weaker than historical average contingent commissions as a result of carriers profitability challenges, they are just recently addressing."
