    "content": " Moving to slide 15, a three month average cash conversion cycle is 20 days down two days from last year\u2019s first quarter, reflecting the impact of the Sirius acquisition. Our expectations for the first half split, a low single digit sequential increase from Q1 to Q2 on an average daily sales basis, this equates to close to 20% year-over-year reported net sales growth in the second quarter, which is roughly 230 basis points above our Q2 implied growth rate expectations from last quarter. My first question is just regarding the strength you\u2019re seeing across corporate and SMB customers in terms of the remote enablement as it seems like there is a second wave of work from home trends and can you elaborate on that and also, just in terms of the back to office trends. Yes what we are seeing is customers across our commercial segments, kind of as we mentioned last time getting on with it meaning living within the current environment and making decisions about their back to work strategy, which means they\u2019re bolstering their capabilities in offices. And we\u2019re also seeing what usually, typically follows that and what was delayed a bit over the last couple of years which is an investment in the hybrid infrastructure to support all the needs of the coworkers and the expectations both at the workload and application level and everything required to create a stronger and more robust infrastructure for those devices. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. As we said last quarter, we\u2019re really, really focused on integrating the businesses and bringing them together and going to market as one CDW and not really parsing out dollars and assigning creditors, as we\u2019d like to say. Thank you very much."
