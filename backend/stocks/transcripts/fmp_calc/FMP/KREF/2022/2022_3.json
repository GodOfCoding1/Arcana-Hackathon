    "content": " This quarter and subsequent quarter end, we sourced and closed two new non-mark-to-market, in Matt's term, financing facilities and completed a second upsize on one of our existing non mark-to-market facilities to $1 billion. So, you'll continue to see us land and multifamily, industrial, and life science, which we think are kind of the strongest from a tenant demand perspective, but just given the market environment and the competitive landscape, what we're doing is very much, it's very much a lenders market today. Yes, so 100% was collected in the third quarter, We've obviously had the October payments, we've collected 100% there, regardless of whether the loan is risk rated three, four or five, in some cases, right, there's interest reserves on all of these loans, we have a 5-rated asset that doesn't require an interest rate reserve, it's covering instead service. But just in terms of how we're underwriting today, we're really just looking at the current rent environment and the current occupancy environment and you're trying to stabilize at a debt yield that's well north of today's cap rates because our view is, those are gravitating higher over time as the equity market kind of adjust to again the new interest rate environment."
