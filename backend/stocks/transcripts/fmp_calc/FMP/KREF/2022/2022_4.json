    "content": " Notably, we increased the borrowing capacity on KREF's corporate revolver by $275 million to $610 million and extended the maturity date through March 2027. This team originated $2.7 billion on behalf of KREF in 2022 across 25 loans, concentrated our efforts in the growth property types, with nearly 70% secured by multifamily and industrial properties and another 22% secured by life science properties. In the public capital markets, we closed $1 billion managed multifamily CLO earlier in the year, providing KREF with $848 million of non mark-to-market and non-recourse financing the two-year reinvestment period. You've seen us, it'll be very transparent and pretty front footed as it relates to not only increasing reserves, but as you saw this quarter, modifying loans and trying to get to the other side and create the right basis for us and for sponsors so that they can lease in what's a difficult operating market for Office. Thank you very much. So, if you're looking at $55 million, we see all of that runs to a loss, assuming your reserve where your view at the appropriate level for the assets, resolved or monetized, but just trying to think about the timing of when that's going to hit. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you very much."
