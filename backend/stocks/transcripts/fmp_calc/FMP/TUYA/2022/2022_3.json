    "content": " Tuya-enabled energy saving products including smart circuit breakers, utility meters, and charging-related products recorded a 155% year-over-year revenue growth in the first three quarters of the year. The decline was mainly driven by a 57.4% year-over-year decrease in our IoT PaaS revenue, which decreased to $30.9 million for the quarter. Moving on to cash, net cash used in operating activities for the third quarter of 2022 decreased by 70.6% to $13.5 million from $46.1 million in the third quarter last year, thanks to the significant reduction in operating expenses. The upstream chip developers, especially those focused on smart device chips, IoT communication chips and consumer products, recorded year-over-year revenue decline in Q3 similar or even greater than the first two quarters. As one of the products from our software and hardware enhancement strategy, the revenue we generated from the voice capability product line grew by over 110% year-over-year in the first three quarters of this year and over 140% year-over-year in the third quarter."
