    "content": " Total event revenue in Q1 this year was 6.4 million and is up over 5 million to last year, with more than 3 million of the increase coming from private event sales at American Golf. While it did come in below last year's first quarter it was expected given we exited five of our traditional golf courses after Q1 last year, which together contributed 1.3 million in course EBITDA in Q1. On the American Golf side of our business, we helped 55 courses across nine states at the end of Q1 with 1 owned, 32 leased and 22 managed courses with their Drive Shack entertainment golf business, we currently have four venues in Orlando, Raleigh, Richmond and West Palm and are committed to one additional lease in Manhattan on Randall\u2019s Island, which we expect to open in late 2023. That's up nearly 20% to Q1 of last year, of the 1.6 million increase, 1.3 million was driven by higher event sales, which was up 160% versus Q1 of last year. American Golf\u2019s total revenue for Q1 was just under 42 million, excluding management fee revenue and was up 6% to last year's first quarter. With that we will require approximately $75 million of new capital to fund the remaining two venues planned to open later in 2022 and get the development for the 16 new venues off the ground this year, so that we remain on track with our 2023 opening timeline. For Q1, we generated total company revenue of $69 million, up 7.9 million or 12.9% compared to last year's first quarter total company revenue of $61.1 million. When we break this down the entertainment golf side of our business, which includes our Drive Shack and Puttery venues generated a total revenue of $14.2 million in Q1 this year, an increase of $6 million, or 72.4% compared to $8.2 million in the first quarter last year. The increase to last year was due to a $1.6 million increase in total revenue at our four Drive Shack venues, with 1.3 million of the increase driven by higher event revenue this year. Excluding managed course reimbursements, American Golf\u2019s total revenue increased 1.8 million, or 3.3% compared to total revenue of $52.9 million in Q1 last year, which included managed course reimbursements of $13.8 million. The $8 million decrease in profitability is due to the impairment charges I just mentioned, which were offset by approximately $2.6 million and other income from insurance proceeds received this year for damages at two of our American Golf courses last year. The net loss applicable to common shareholders for the first quarter this year was $20.4 million or $0.22 per share, compared to last year's first quarter net loss applicable to common shareholders of $12.3 million or $0.15 per share. Last year, adjusted EBITDA included approximately $1.3 million from five American Golf courses that were exited after the first quarter last year. In addition, we made strategic investments in headcount and other related expenses throughout 2021 to support the development and growth in Puttery and approximately $1 million of incremental expense related to these investments was realized in the first quarter of this year that has yet to be incurred in the first quarter last year. It is important to note again that the $1 million in total company adjusted EBITDA for Q1 this year was in line with our expectations, and we remain on track to deliver adjusted EBITDA of $18 million for full year 2022."
