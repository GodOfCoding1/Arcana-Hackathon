    "content": " Our cost of care, excluding depreciation and amortization, was $113.6 million for the third quarter, an increase of 49% versus the prior year, driven by growth in the number of centers we operate and the number of team members supporting our significantly larger patient base. I would note that for patients who were new to Oak Street in 2021, we were generating historically normal profitability on that cohort of patients in 2022 despite the headwinds we experienced from them last year, which speaks to the efficacy of our care model and the degree to which we engage patients relative to the market at large. And I think that's one of the things that is making us incredibly confident in the trajectory of the business, as we're seeing what we hope would trend out this year, it's kind of getting to a more normalized period, it's trending that way. There's not like a slower or a much faster ramp for new centers, it's generally pretty consistent from kind of your first couple of months to a couple of years in on kind of the number of patients you're adding per center per day. One thing I'd add is that to the extent that we have more centers in a period than otherwise expected, that would lead to greater losses in the period, all else equal, just given the fact that, obviously, new centers are going to -- we're going to invest in those centers for the first couple of years to get to the breakeven."
