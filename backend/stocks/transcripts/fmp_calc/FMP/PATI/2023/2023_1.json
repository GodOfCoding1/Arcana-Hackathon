    "content": " Operating revenues for the quarter were $22,850,000 up $2,279,000 from the same quarter last year, due to rate increases, higher fuel surcharges and improved business mix. It's certainly not going to decline for us, because we're going to partner with people and customers that are looking for quality service and they want to guarantee that they've got that supply, compared to selling diesel fuel or gasoline at a margin, the freight portion of this thing is while it adds up to a lot of dollars on a per gallon basis, it's pretty small, comparatively. Then we go to our partners and say, \u00e2\u0080\u0098look, we've had driver pay go up, we've got in\u00ef\u00ac\u0082ation, we got this, and we need a rate increase of x and if they said, well, that's just more than we can stand, then what we would do is work with them to exit or downsize and if they can get somebody to haul it for them at a low price, and we can add business with somebody else at a higher price, then that's what we've done in a number of different markets. But we really are and have aligned ourselves with some good partners and good customers and folks that we've done business with for a long time, and I think the whole world has had to wake up a little bit to the supply chain and driver shortage and that it's real, and it's frankly not going anywhere anytime soon."
