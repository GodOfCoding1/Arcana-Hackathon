Last year's quarter included $133,000 or $0.04 per share from gains on real estate net of income tax. Operating revenues for the quarter were $23,501,000 up $2,646,000 from the same quarter last year due to rate increases and higher fuel surcharges. Depreciation expense was down $299,000 in the quarter and gains on sale of assets was $163,000 compared to $46,000 in last year's quarter. The operating profit for this quarter was $913,000 compared to $269,000, excluding gains on real estate sales in last year's third quarter. The company's net income was  or $1.85 per share compared to $585,000 or $0.17 per share and the same period last year. The prior year\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nine months results included net income of $1,170,000 or $0.34 per share from gains on real estate net of income taxes. Diesel prices have increased to record levels causing our fuel expense to increase by $2,713,000 over last year while insurance and losses increased by $462,000 due mainly to a maximum limit COVID claim of $372,500 and the negative worker's compensation adjustment on a prior year claim of $380,000. Excluding the Tampa land sale and the one time transaction bonus per management adjusted operating profit for the nine months was $879,000 compared to an adjusted operating loss of $792,000 in the same period last year. As stated earlier, the COVID case and the prior year worker's comp claim resulted in a negative charge of $752,500 to the first nine months. I think you mentioned it's going to be about $6.6 million for the year, $6 million on the new tractors with maintenance around a million a year, is that a good number to use in a normal year?"
