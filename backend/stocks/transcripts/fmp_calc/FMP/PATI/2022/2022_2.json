    "content": " Today the company reported second quarter net loss of $490,000 or a loss of $0.14 per share for the quarter ended March 31, 2022, compared to net income of $484,000 or $0.14 per share in the same quarter last year. Last year's quarter included $1,037,000 or $0.31 per share from gains on real estate, net of income tax. The depreciation expense was down $265,000 in the quarter and gains-on-sale of assets was $119,000 compared to a loss of $113,000 in last year's quarter. The company's net income was $5,949,000, or $1.63 per share, compared to $262,000, or $0.08 per share, in the same period last year. Diesel prices have increased to record levels, causing our fuel expenses to increase by $1,316,000 over last year's second quarter, while insurance and losses increased $333,000 due mainly to the two claims mentioned earlier. But what -- I think what I would say is that since the driver pay increases, the driver turnover has stabilized, while you still see churn in the new drivers, it's way down from what it was pre-pay increases as is the turnover for our senior drivers, drivers -- I should say, drivers that have been here for more than a year."
