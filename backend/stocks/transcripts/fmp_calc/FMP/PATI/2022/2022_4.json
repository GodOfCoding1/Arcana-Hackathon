    "content": " Today, the company reported a net income of $470,000 or $0.13 per share for the quarter ended September 30, 2022, compared to net income of $40,000 or $0.01 per share in the same quarter last year. Operating revenues for the quarter were $22,882,000, up $2,425,000 from the same quarter last year, due to rate increases, higher fuel surcharges and an improved business mix. Depreciation expense was down $285,000 in the quarter and gains on sale of assets was $97,000, compared to the loss of $26,000 in last year's quarter. The operating profit this quarter was $484,000, compared to $58,000 in last year's fourth quarter. The company's net income was $7,190,000 or $1.98 per share, compared to $625,000 or $0.18 per share last year. The prior year's results included net income of $1,170,000 or $0.34 per share from gains on real estate net of income taxes. The operating revenues were up $6,614,000 at $87,882,000, due to improved rates, higher fuel surcharges and an improved business mix, despite being down 2.5 miles, because of the lower driver count and the closing of our Nashville operation. Our fuel expenses increased by $3,658,000 over last year, while insurance and losses increased by $906,000, due mainly to the maximum limit COVID claim of $372,500 and a negative workers compensation adjustment on a prior year claim of $380,000 and the fourth quarter accidents detailed earlier, resulting in a loss of $270,000. Excluding the Tampa land sale and the one-time transaction bonus for management, adjusted operating profit for the year was $1,363,000, compared to an adjusted operating loss of $734,000 last year."
