    "content": " Today the company reported first quarter net income of $6,439,000 or $1.74 per share for the quarter ended December 31, 2021, compared to a loss of $222,000 or a negative $0.14 cents per share in the same quarter last year. That continued reduction in driver count versus last year's first quarter due to turnover and the driver shortage largely offset by improved transportation freight rates negotiated with our customers to offset higher pay driver pay, higher fuel cost and other cost increases and increased profit margin. 3:29 Operating profit this quarter was $8,541,000, compared to an operating loss of $301,000 in the same quarter last year, excluding the sale the Tampa terminal and a one-time transaction bonus. We began replacing tractors in the first quarter of this fiscal year and while we are seeing some delays due to supply chain issues, we anticipate buying 30 track replacement tractors, and a handful of trailers with capital expenditures of approximately $6 million and depreciation, excluding lease right of use amortization of approximately $6.5 million during the fiscal year. So you had 5%, and getting six plus percent rate increases, probably the driver pay would eat up about one in three quarters percent of that 6%, rest would have been for other cost increases. We're doing everything that we can do, including the things that I mentioned about doing the registered apprenticeship working with DOL, DOT, DOD, on ways that we can attract drivers to our company and to the industry and so it's just, it's going to continue to be a battle for a while, I just don't see anything changing in the next 3, 6, 8, 10 months."
