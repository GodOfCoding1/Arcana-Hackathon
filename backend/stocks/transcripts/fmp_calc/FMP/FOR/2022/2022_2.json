    "content": " To that point, I'm excited to announce that during the quarter, Forestar sold a package of 787 undeveloped and partially developed lots from seven projects located across Texas for a total purchase price of $54.7 million. We plan to invest approximately $1.75 billion in land and land development during fiscal 2022 subject to market conditions, and are continuing to target a three to four year owned inventory of land and lots. And I'm curious whether or not this has given you an opportunity to gain more share from finished lot developers and whether or not, you're seeing builders look at you and say, we don't want to buy your product because margins to us are lower, we can do this with the land banker and self-develop. One of the things that I think when you look at our results and what we've been able to do, and I think it's, we're kind of proving it out, I think we're just really good at delivering lots. But no, I think we were very thoughtful and how we put the package together, we really looked at how we could learn the most to make it something that we can hopefully capitalize even more on into the future, because clearly, there's a lot of money out there looking to invest in the built for rent space, and we'd like to get our fair share of it."
