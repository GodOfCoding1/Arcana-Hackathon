    "content": " Although, we do anticipate seeing that sometime later this year that we expect landowners to maybe get a little more realistic about some of the pricing and the terms, I mean, some of the -- some of it wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t prices as much as it was terms that really tightened up and as far as short through diligence periods in closing on entitled land was kind of became the norm there for a while for other land buyers. Maybe potentially staging lots in a partially completed fashion so that we can quickly react when demand changes and turns around, I think everybody\u00e2\u0080\u0099s out there experimenting a little bit with some reduced starts, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not necessarily every subdivision, but in many places where maybe spec inventory had grown or the builders loaded up on some finished lots, we expect some moderation for time being. Another question I had was, your full year guide seems to imply pretty strong a year-over-year decline in volumes in the fourth quarter, and obviously, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not going to 2023 yet, but you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re just directionally, so we think about 4Q is being maybe a good run rate for the next the following year or it could have been some reacceleration in fiscal 1Q 2023 as maybe some of the delays you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re seeing in 4Q kind of get delivered in 1Q. But when you kind of triangulate the 14.25% pretax margin, it seems like, you did on the SG&A side, $24 million this quarter and last, if you kind of extrapolate and keep that at $24 million, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re looking at 6.5% SG&A and then that would require a 20 percentage type of gross margin for the fourth quarter for it to flow through."
