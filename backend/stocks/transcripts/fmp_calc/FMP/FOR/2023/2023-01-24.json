    "content": " In the first quarter, net income attributable to Forestar was $20.8 million or $0.42 per diluted share, compared to $40.5 million or $0.81 per diluted share in the prior year quarter. Our pre-tax income for the quarter totaled $27.9 million, compared to $53.5 million in the first quarter of last year. In the first quarter, SG&A expense was $22.9 million or 10.6% as a percentage of revenues, compared to $21.5 million in the prior year quarter. During the first quarter, we invested $237 million in land and land development, a reduction of 38%, compared to the prior year quarter. It's always challenging that what product mix is going to sell and what dates $90,000 I think is probably the highest we've hit on a quarter, but we also had some sales in the West."
