    "content": " The insurance business posted a BRL 3.7 billion income in the quarter, an increase of 135% over 12 months, explained by the comparison basis with last year and 12.8% in the quarter. Fees performed solidly with an increase of 6.7% on an annual basis, benefit primarily by the strong performance in line of credit cards, which favored by client base growth and by higher spending. The cost of risk increased slightly in this quarter and represented 2.5% of the portfolio, reflecting the origination mix plus the higher delinquency in retail both in individuals and small companies. In the expanded loan portfolio, we expect to close the year with a movement compatible with the range from 10% to 14%, close to the center, considering a stronger comparative base in the second half of 2022 and adjustments we continue to make in our origination according to the scenario of service."
