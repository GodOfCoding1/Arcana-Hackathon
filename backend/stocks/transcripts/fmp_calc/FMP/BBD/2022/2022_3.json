    "content": " Of course, when you talk about portfolio over 30 days there, the growth rates are higher than it used to be before and that's the reason why we still believe that delinquency is going to go up a little bit in the first quarter of 2023, and you're stabilized in the second quarter and then gradually will decrease in the second half of 2023. Regarding to adverse selection, we don't think so basically, we at times like that we try to work the more we can with existing clients with clients that we know the most with clients that we do understand their profile, their track record of payments, and we have increased it by more than 60% our penetration into high income segments. As I said, in a question in the English call, which saw a continued trend in terms of increasing NPLs, especially in the segments we have already mentioned, I'd say in the second quarter call, we had hoped that the provisions in the year maybe wouldn't be much higher than the top range of the call."
