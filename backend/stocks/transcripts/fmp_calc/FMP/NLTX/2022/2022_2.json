    "content": " Through the ongoing Phase 1 clinical trial, we expect to learn a tremendous amount about the biological effects of de novo proteins in patients and how to continue expanding the capabilities of our technology. Now we are entering the next phase of de novo protein design technology, which involves adding machine learning and neural networks to computational methods in order to develop new molecules. We \u00e2\u0080\u0093 I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t believe that the addition of intermediate doses will change anything in terms of what we will be presenting next year, and you should expect to see a data set that will include safety, tolerability, biomarker data, pharmacokinetics and any anecdotal anti-tumor activity that comes from the clinical trial."
