    "content": " I'm happy to report a solid third quarter financial performance, reflecting strong demand for our product and services expertise across our core strategic growth pillars of 5G monetization, cloud adoption, digital modernization and network automation. As I mentioned before, while we are closely monitoring the uncertain global macroeconomic environment and potential headwinds, we are confident in our unique business model that enables mission-critical product and services, aligned with the strategic needs of our customers, highly recurring revenue streams and long-term customer engagement\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 More broadly, we believe that connectivity continues to be a cornerstone of society, essential to supporting hybrid environments to work, education, entertainment and much more. Tying everything together on Slide 11, we remain well on track to deliver accelerated revenue growth of roughly 10%, on a pro forma constant currency basis for the full fiscal year 2022. While we are experiencing strong growth momentum in our business, our expected normalized free cash flow outlook of $650 million in fiscal 2022 equates to a conversion rate of roughly 100% of non-GAAP net income. We are on track to deliver full year fiscal 2022 revenue growth of roughly 10% on a pro forma constant currency basis, in line with the midpoint of our new guidance range of 9.6% to 10.6%. Bringing everything together, we are on track to meet our guidance for pro forma non-GAAP diluted earnings per share growth of approximately 12% for the full year of fiscal 2022, roughly consistent with the midpoint of our guidance range of 11.2% to 12.5%. Overall we are firmly on track to deliver double-digit total shareholders' return for the second fiscal year running in 2022, assuming the midpoint of our pro forma non-GAAP earnings per share growth guidance of roughly 12% plus our dividend yield."
