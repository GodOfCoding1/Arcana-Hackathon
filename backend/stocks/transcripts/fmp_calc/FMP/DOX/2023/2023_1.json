    "content": " 12-month backlog of $4.09 billion was also a record high, up approximately 7% from a year ago on continued sales momentum, and we delivered non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.45, which was above the guidance range, primarily due to better profitability on a higher revenue base and a lower-than-expected non-GAAP effective tax rate. Amdocs was recently commissioned by CTM, a leading telecom operator in Macau, to modify its online charging and billing infrastructure to support 5G standards We recently extended our managed services relationship with Vodafone Romania, which selected Amdocs to modernize its revenue management systems with a modular platform, enabling it to launch and monetize new products and services at speed. Bringing everything together, we are raising our outlook for non-GAAP diluted earnings per share growth to a new range of 9% to 13% for the full year fiscal 2023, and the midpoint of which represents an improvement of about 100 basis points compared with our prior guidance."
