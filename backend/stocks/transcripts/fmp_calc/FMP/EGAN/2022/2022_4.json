    "content": " For the first quarter of fiscal 2023, we expect total revenue of between $24 million to $24.5 million, which would represent growth of 12% to 14% year-over-year. Adjusted for constant currency, that would equal $103.2 million to $105.3 million, representing growth of 12% to 15%; and non-GAAP net income of $3.8 million to $4.8 million or $0.12 to $0.15 per share; on a GAAP net loss of $3.7 million to $4.7 million or a loss of $0.04 to $0.15 per share, where we estimated share-based compensation expense of approximately $8.5 million and depreciation and amortization of approximately $500,000."
