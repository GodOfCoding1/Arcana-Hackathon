As Ashu mentioned, we delivered record total revenue in the quarter of $23.9 million, up 21% year-over-year and up 4% sequentially and ahead of our guidance and consensus estimates. For the first nine months, total revenue was $68.4 million, up 18% year-over-year. SaaS revenue for Q3 was $20.7 million, up 23% year-over-year and up 1% sequentially. Legacy revenue in Q3 was $1 million, down 13% year-over-year, but up sequentially. The number of 1 million ARR customers increased 31% year-over-year, and our total RPO increased 35% year-over-year to $84.2 million. For Q4, we expect total revenue of between $23.1 million to $23.5 million, representing growth of 14% to 16% year-over-year. Adjusted for constant currency, we expect Q4 total revenue of between $23.6 million to $24 million, representing growth of 17% to 19%. Looking at total revenue for FY 2022 if you add the midpoint of our currency adjusted Q4 revenue through the total revenue through Q3, we get to $92.2 million which is ahead of the high end of our previous guidance for the year."
