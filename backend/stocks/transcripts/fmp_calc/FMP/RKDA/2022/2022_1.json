    "content": " These topics include; one, key financial highlights for the quarter; two, a decision we have made to wind down a legacy co-packing business that was part of the Arcadia Wellness acquisition; three, the launch of GoodWheat; four, an update on our long term strategy; and five, how the recent Bioceres announcement regarding HB4 soy will impact Arcadia. In exchange for our membership interest, we received $5 million of cash upon closing, stock in Bioceres that was sold in 2021 for $27 million, $1 million in post closing payments, as well as future milestone and royalty payments. Total revenues recognized for first quarter of 2022 were $3.2 million compared to $828,000 in first quarter 2021. The additional grain and body care product sales generated additional cost of revenues in the first quarter of 2022 compared to the same quarter in 2021, $3.5 million versus $856,000 for an increase of $2.6 million. Research and development expenses have continued to trend downwards, $395,000 this quarter and $1.2 million this quarter last year, for a decrease of $764,000 as we continue our focus on commercialization. We recognized $4.4 million in this first quarter of 2022 compared to $4.1 million in the first quarter of 2021, an increase of $283,000. While the loss from operations of $4.6 million in first quarter 2022 was $700,000 favorable to the $5.3 million recognized in first quarter of 2021, an unrealized noncash gain in the amount of $7.5 million related to the Bioceres stock we held was recorded in the first quarter of 2021. I'd also like to note that we recognize noncash income of $322,000 in the first quarter of 2021 for the change in fair value of common stock warrant liabilities."
