    "content": " And finally, our use of cash from operations improved by $7.9 million or 41% during the first 9 months of 2022 compared to the same period last year. Total revenues recognized for third quarter 2022 were $1.9 million compared to $2.4 million in the third quarter of 2021, a decrease of 21%, but resulting in a positive gross margin of 28%. And as mentioned earlier, third quarter year-to-date revenues were $4.3 million higher than third quarter year-to-date 2021 for an increase of 94%. SG&A expenses were $1.2 million favorable for the quarter due to the impairment of property and equipment that was recognized in third quarter 2021, with an immaterial amount recognized in third quarter 2022. Also impacting the total operating expense favorability this quarter was the $1.5 million lower SG&A expense recognized in 2022 as compared to 2021, primarily driven by reduced employees, lease and consulting expenses. Cost of product revenues for the first 9 months of 2022 was $8.3 million or $3.3 million higher than the $5 million in the first 9 months of 2021, the result of higher revenues recognized during the same period. And as discussed on the second quarter call, a gain on the sale of Verdeca in the amount of $1.1 million was recognized in the second quarter of 2022 with a $2 million milestone seed  from Bioceres triggered by the Chinese approval of HB4 Soy. Loss from operations was $4.1 million lower as we just reviewed, and offsetting this favorability was $2.9 million greater non-cash income from the change in fair value of common soft warrant and option liabilities in third quarter 2021 compared to third quarter 2022, along with the $1.1 million gain on extinguishment of the PPP loan in third quarter of 2021. Loss from operations was $8.7 million lower third quarter 2022 year-to-date versus 2021 year-to-date, but 2021 included a $10.2 million gain from the sale of Bioceres shares that was not present in 2022."
