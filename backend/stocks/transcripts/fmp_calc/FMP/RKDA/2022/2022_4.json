    "content": " For the full year, despite the fact that we exited several business lines resulting in lost revenue, our 2022 revenues increased 47% versus 2021 and our reported gross margins were positive for the first time in Arcadia's history. In 2021, our cash used in operations was $25.9 million compared to $14 million in 2022, a decline of almost 50%. Compared to last year, Q4 revenues were down $1.2 million with about three quarters of the variance due to revenues from brands that were no longer part of our product portfolio. SG&A expenses of $18 million were $4.9 million or 21% lower than prior year, primarily driven by a reduction in headcount, lower facilities costs and lower consulting fees as 2021 included body care acquisition costs that were absent in 2022. The net loss attributable to common stockholders was $716,000 unfavorable to prior year as 2021 included benefits of $10.2 million related to the sale of Bioceres stock as well as a net favorable variance of $5.7 million from the change in the fair value of warrant and option liabilities. Next, our short-term and long-term inventory declined from $6.9 million at the end of 2021 to $3.3 million at the end of 2022, as a result of the following factors; one, the write-offs associated with the legacy businesses. Last, we ended 2022 with $20.6 million in cash and cash equivalents as our use of cash declined significantly from a use of $25.9 million in 2021 to a use of $14 million in 2022. And subsequent to the end of the year, we raised net proceeds of $5.5 million in March that is not included in the $20.6 million cash balance at the end of 2022."
