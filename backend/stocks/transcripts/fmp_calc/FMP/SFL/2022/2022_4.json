    "content": " The company generated gross charter hire of approximately $208 million in the fourth quarter, including approximately $7 million of profit share, approximately 84% of the revenue coming from our fixed charter rate backlog, which currently stands at $3.6 billion, providing us with strong visibility on our cash flow going forward. In the fourth quarter, the liner fleet generated gross charter hire of approximately $99 million, including approximately $6.5 million in profit share related to fuel savings on seven of our large container vessels and one car carrier. At the end of the fourth quarter, SFL\u00e2\u0080\u0099s liner fleet backlog was approximately $2.4 billion, with an average remaining charter term of approximately 4.5 years or 7.2 years if weighted by charter hire. Our tanker fleet generated approximately $49 million in gross charter hire during the quarter, compared to approximately $42.4 million in the previous quarter. The net charter hire from these vessels was approximately $12.1 million in the fourth quarter, compared to approximately $11.5 million in the third quarter. SFL generated approximately $23.7 million in gross charter hire from the dry bulk fleet, including approximately $400,000 of profit share. So for the fourth quarter, we report total operating revenue according to U.S. GAAP of approximately $198 million, which is less than approximately $208 million of charter hire actually received for the reasons just mentioned. In addition, the company has seven debt-free vessels at quarter end, with a combined charter fair value of approximately $180 million based on average broker appraisals."
