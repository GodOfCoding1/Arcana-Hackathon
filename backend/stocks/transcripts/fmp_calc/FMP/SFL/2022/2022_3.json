    "content": " The company generated gross charter hire of approximately $178 million in the third quarter, including approximately $11 million of profit share, with approximately 82% of revenue coming from our fixed charter rate backlog, which currently stands at $3.8 billion, providing us with strong visibility on our cash flow going forward. In the third quarter, the liner fleet generated gross charter hire of approximately $98 million, including approximately $10 million in profit share contribution related to fuel savings on some of our large container vessels. SFL generated approximately $27 million in gross charter hire from the dry bulk fleet in the third quarter, including approximately $1.2 million of profit share. For the third quarter, we report total operating revenues according to U.S. GAAP of approximately $167 million, which is less than approximately $178 million of charter hire actually received for the reasons just mentioned."
