Overall, we are confident of the launch momentum and are raising the guidance for 2022 Cortrophin revenues to $40 million to $45 million. For the 3 months ended June 30, 2022, we posted total net revenues of $73.9 million, up $25.2 million, or 52%, as compared to the prior year period, driven by revenues from the Novitium acquisition and the late January launch of Cortrophin. Net revenues for generic pharmaceutical products were $49.9 million during the 3 months ended June 30, 2022, an increase of 46% compared to the $34.2 million for the same period in 2021. Net revenues for branded pharmaceutical products were $8.5 million during the 3 months ended June 30, 2022, a decrease of 23% compared to $11 million for the same period in 2021. Contract manufacturing revenues were $4.4 million during the 3 months ended June 30, 2022, an increase of 89% compared to $2.3 million for the same period in 2021, due to an increase in the volume of orders primarily related to the addition of Novitium contract manufacturing revenues. Net revenues of our rare disease pharmaceutical products were $10.2 million for the quarter, consisting entirely of sales of Cortrophin Gel. Operating expenses increased by 35% to $86.8 million for the 3 months ended June 30, 2022 from $64.2 million in the prior year period. Cost of sales, excluding depreciation and amortization, increased by $13 million to $35.3 million in the second quarter of 2022, compared to $22.3 million in the prior year period, driven primarily by $7.9 million in costs related to Novitium product sales and $2 million related to an increase in the sales of products subject to profit-sharing arrangements. Excluding the impact of acquisition accounting, stock compensation and the impact of our Canada operations, cost of sales on a non-GAAP basis as a percentage of total adjusted net revenues increased 2.4 points from 42.8% in the first quarter of 2021 to 45.2% in the current year period, primarily as a result of increased generic volumes in a period of declining average -- excuse me, in a period of declining average selling prices, lower sales mix of established brand products and increased sales of products with profit-sharing arrangements. Research and development expenses were $4.2 million in the second quarter of 2022, an increase of $1.4 million from the prior year period due primarily to Novitium-related activities, partially offset by a decrease in expense associated with the completion of our Cortrophin Gel development efforts. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased to $32 million in the second quarter of 2022, or 70%, compared to $18.8 million in the prior year quarter, reflecting a $12.5 million increase in sales and marketing expenses related to our launch of Cortrophin Gel as well as increased expenses related to the addition of Novitium headcount and activities, partially tempered by a $1.6 million decrease in transaction expenses related to the Novitium acquisition. Depreciation and amortization increased by 22% in the second quarter of 2022 to $13.8 million from $11.3 million in the comparable quarter in 2021, primarily due to the amortization of intangible assets acquired in the Novitium acquisition. We recognized restructuring activities of $2.6 million of expense in the 3 months ended June 30, 2022, in relation to the previously announced closure of our Oakville, Ontario, Canada facility. Given the positive momentum behind the Cortrophin launch, we are raising our Cortrophin-specific net revenue guidance to $40 million to $45 million from the previously announced range of $35 million to $40 million. On a total company basis, we are reiterating our previously issued guidance of: net revenue between $295 million and $315 million, representing approximately 36% to 46% growth as compared to $216.1 million recognized in 2021; total company research and development expense of between $16 million and $18 million; adjusted non-GAAP EBITDA of between $54 million and $60 million; and adjusted non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of between $1.34 and $1.62."
