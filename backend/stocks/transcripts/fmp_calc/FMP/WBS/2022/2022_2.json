    "content": " We're adding, as you can see, 4.8% loan growth, also a lot of new logos, a lot of new companies, a lot of new relationships in business banking and commercial and we really require our teams out there to make sure those are full relationships with deposits and cash management. The reason we always talk about that 8% to 10%, and we go back and forth on people telling us we'll never make it and then telling us it's too much and then figuring out whether or not we're going to go above that is, I think we've been able to sustainably grow our loans, particularly on the commercial side and now we're getting good traction on the consumer side as well in that 8% to 10% range. And as you can tell, probably from Glenn's earlier response on deposits, we are not sort of factoring that in as a major driver in the next couple of quarters, although, we do see a clear path to $1 billion pipeline in that area of relatively low cost deposits with existing relationships that we're working with. I will tell you that the portfolio of leveraged loans is about 85% to 90% in the sponsor and specialty world, which is good news because it's in industries and sectors that have repeatable, protectable, sustainable cash flows, those are tech and infrastructure, health care services, stuff that we've been doing for a long time with sponsors we've known for 15 or 20 years. Jason Soto, our Chief Credit Officer and his team, they're well aware of where there is more vulnerability and it's coming through, I think, in our risk selection, which is why a little bit, we're not projecting the same level of loan growth for the balance of the year."
