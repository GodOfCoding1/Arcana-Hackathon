    "content": " These categories grew between three and 5% per year, and although we're not ready to provide formal 2023 guidance given next year's wrap of pricing to recover inflation as well as healthy demand, we would expect revenue growth to be very strong. Your line is open. Maybe to start off, Steve, thanks for sharing your thoughts on what you think the sort of normalized earnings power can be of the business as it's currently constructed now and I realize this is not guidance for '23 per se, but if we look at for starters, I think you mentioned in the prepared remarks for the first time in quite a while, right Peanock  finally turned positive in the third quarter as pricing is sort of better caught up to costs. So if we think about that $80 million in Peanock lag, right over the last year or so, I guess why would that be expected to be a drag at all in '23, specifically if it's already turned positive unless I guess you're expecting incremental inflation from here for which you would need to take incremental pricing. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. As, you know, I think you heard in our prepared remark service in October did take up to sort of 96% or so and while supply chain is a, is a big factor we've also seen some additional inflation and some of our non-trad commodities, things like boil lids other, you know, commodity derivatives like casing and corn syrup, you know, which we'll price for as needed. Your line is open. Your line is open."
