    "content": " Third, our guidance for 2023 reflects the compelling opportunity we expect to capture as a new TreeHouse, including top line growth of 6% to 8% and significant profit improvement, with adjusted EBITDA expected to be in the range of $345 million to $365 million. Beyond the 2023 guidance, Pat discussed earlier, we believe that over the next three years plus, we can deliver annual growth of 3% to 5% in revenue; 8% to 10% in adjusted EBITDA; and free cash flow of at least $200 million. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. What we've heard and I think everyone's heard over the past few months is, I guess, one retailer or a couple retailers took pricing from the manufacturers but didn't raise it at the store level, just to kind of accelerate or some customer traffic, accelerates some private label share. And then second one, on Pat's commentary on the supply levels, I mean, the service levels, I was a little surprised you said they wouldn't expected them to be back to normal by the end of the year, that's I think that's still 10 months away. Your line is open. I would say though, if we guided our units to flat, if you go back to slide, well, I think it's what's Slide 5 in our deck, it suggests that our core retail business has to grow nicely, right, low-single digits in order for that to happen. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open."
