    "content": " Also, quarter revenue exceeded the high-end of our guidance range by over $2 million, with a 25% EBITDA margin exceeding the high-end of our EBITDA guidance by more than $4 million. Quarterly revenue came in at a record $85.3 million, which represented 28% year-over-year growth and a solid beat versus our previously issued guidance of $81 million to $83 million. Towards the end of the quarter, we announced that we had reached an agreement with 360, one of our pre-IPO investors, to acquire its 23.4 million ADS equivalents, a 20.6% stake in Opera, for $128.6 million. Our full-year revenue guidance is now $323 million to $326 million, representing 29% year-over-year growth at the midpoint. For the fourth quarter, we expect revenue of $88 million to $91 million, representing 23% year-over-year growth at the midpoint and adjusted EBITDA to be $17 million to $19 million, a 20% margin at the midpoints. In terms of cost expectations, we build in another 1 to 2 percentage points in cost of revenue and we maintain our previous expectation of around $30 million in marketing cost, even though Q3 came in lower."
