    "content": " Because over the same period, our annualized ARPU from browsers and Opera News has grown over 80%, leading to over 70% growth in revenue from our user base and that's before considering our ad hoc audience extension. Revenue came in at a record $77.8 million, which represented 29% year-over-year growth and a solid beat versus our previously issued guidance of $71 million to $74 million. Our operating cash flow was well below adjusted EBITDA this quarter, most importantly, because the reduced marketing spends in isolation translated to an $11 million reduction in accounts payable and a normalization of accounts receivable after receiving some early payments in Q1 and the revenue growth in Q2. Given the continued momentum in our business, we are raising our full year revenue guidance to $313 million to $319 million, representing 26% year-over-year growth at the midpoint. For the third quarter, we expect revenue of $81 million to $83 million, representing 23% year-over-year growth at the midpoint and adjusted EBITDA to be $14 million to $17 million."
