It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been very interesting, number one, receiving the patent, but number two, getting that news out there because what it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s done is, number one, obviously, gotten us some interest from parties who want to use the KAI technology as a \u00e2\u0080\u0093 on a commercial aspect, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also gotten us a lot of attention from other companies in the ecosystem who start to bring up the M&A conversation, because they think that this type of a technology can really give them a key differentiator in the marketplace versus what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s already out there."
