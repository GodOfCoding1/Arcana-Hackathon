    "content": " Revenues from small appliances and others decreased by 39.3% to RMB 155.9 million from RMB 257.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2021, primarily due to the continued product portfolio adjustment within this category. The operating expenses decreased by 19.4% to RMB 274.7 million from RMB 340.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2021, primarily due to a decrease in selling and marketing expenses, partially offset by an increase in general and administrative expenses. In greater details, research and development expenses decreased by 23.6% to RMB 74.7 million from RMB 97.8 million for the fourth quarter of 2021, mainly due to a decrease in research and development experts and related salaries, as well as the company's continued efforts in R&D efficiency improvement. Selling and marketing expenses decreased by 29.7% to RMB 151.1 million from RMB 214.8 million for the fourth quarter of 2021, mainly due to a decrease in logistics and marketing expenses. General and administrative expenses increased by 74.5% to RMB 48.9 million compared to RMB 28 million for the fourth quarter of 2021, primarily due to an increase in the estimated allowance for accounts and notes receivables from a third party client recognized in the same period. And in the past few months of 2022, the overseas sales of air conditioners and other home appliance products reached more than RMB 60 million."
