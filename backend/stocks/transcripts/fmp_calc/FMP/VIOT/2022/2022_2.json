    "content": " We successfully navigated challenges caused by the pandemic and weak macro industry environment in the first half of the year and made progress in developing new products and enhancing brand awareness, moving forward, we will continue to focus 4 aspects; first, streamlining SKUs and the continuously optimizing product portfolio; second, devoting more resources to improving product competence, building by selling products and providing a more immersive scenario experience. Revenues from small appliances and others decreased by 38.1% to RMB118.5 million from RMB191.5 million for the second quarter of 2021, primarily due to the product portfolio adjustment within this category, and decreased demand of small appliances products. Gross margin increased to 22.1% from 21.2% for the second quarter of 2021, primarily driven by the Company's continued efforts to shift the business and product mix toward higher gross margin products, and partially offset by the decreases in selling prices of some products for clean-up due to the product portfolio adjustment in this quarter. In more detail, research and development expenses increased by 20.4% to RMB79.7 million from RMB66.2 million for the second quarter of 2021, mainly due to the increase in research and development experts and related salaries and expenses, as well as the increased input in new product development. Selling and marketing expenses decreased by 24.6% to RMB162 million from RMB214.8 million for the second quarter of 2021, mainly due to the decrease in marketing expenses, partially offset by the increased expenses on advertising activities that enhance the Company's branding recognition."
