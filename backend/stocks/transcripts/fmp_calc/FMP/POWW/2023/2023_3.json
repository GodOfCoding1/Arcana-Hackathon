    "content": " I've spent the last 17 years in the firearm and ammunition sector and I've always seen AMMO Inc.\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ammunition and marketplace businesses following the acquisition of GunBroker.com, as best-in-class for their space and potential. We are facing headwinds in the market today along with the rest of the industry, but remain excited about the new direction of our two segments in upcoming quarters with our marketplace enhancements coming online in the first half of our next fiscal year and the shift in our manufacturing strategy, which will drive profitability. As our sales volume fell in the reported quarter, we anticipate another quarter of margin compression to do these increased costs, but expect to swiftly transition to more profitable sales activity starting in the first quarter of our next fiscal year by shifting our focus to more sales of our premium brass and large caliber ammunition rounds. Looking forward to our next fiscal year, we expect the new direction of our company to increase profitability through increased sales of our brass casings and a performance rifle ammunition that will increase the gross margins of our ammunition segment."
