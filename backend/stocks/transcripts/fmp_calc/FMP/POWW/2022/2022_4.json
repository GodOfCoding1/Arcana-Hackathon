    "content": " First, we are at capacity in our current facility, delivering 400 million rounds of loaded ammunition this past year, that has caused us to build our new 160,000 square foot world class facilities, where we expect to increase our capacity to 1 billion rounds once fully operational. Whether you're a buyer or seller, we're currently adding new products and product lines to the GunBroker website with north of 7.3 million registered users and adding an average of approximately 55,000 new users on a monthly basis this past year, we strongly believe we will be the preferred destination in the space, because of these initiatives with our two businesses. This increase was the result of our increased production capacity, coupled with strong demand from our customers resulting in 107.1 million of additional sales of bulk pistol and rifle ammunition, an increase of 4.7 million in sales and proprietary ammunition, an increase of 1.3 million of sales from our casing operations, and 64.6 million in revenue generated from our marketplace Gunbroker.com. Moving on to operating expenses, our operating expenses increased by approximately 34.8 million over the prior year, but more importantly, decreased as a percentage of sales from 26.8% in fiscal 2021 to 21.5%, a 25% decrease in the reporting period. As a result of increases in revenues from increased production, as well as our acquisition of Gunbroker.com, we had a net income of approximately 33.2 million for our fiscal 2022 or $0.27 per diluted share, compared with a net loss of approximately 7.8 million for $0.14 per diluted share in fiscal 2021. We are well-positioned to make a swift transition into our new facility in just a few weeks, and we are guiding our 2023 fiscal year to revenues of $300 million to $310 million, EBITDA of $82 million to $85 million and adjusted EBITDA of $108 million to $111 million."
