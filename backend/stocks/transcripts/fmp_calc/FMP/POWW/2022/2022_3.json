    "content": " As a percentage of net sales, operating expenses declined by 18.8% year-over-year to 18.4% in the third quarter of fiscal 2022 from 22.7% in the year earlier period, due to the mix of higher margin marketplace revenues plus operating efficiencies related to our increased scale. Just wanted to start off with the guidance for fiscal 2022 and just the implied guide for the fourth quarter, it seems like pretty confident that we can do the $80 million that would be required to kind of get to the $250 million for the full year. And just -- I was just kind of doing high level math, but assuming GunBroker kind of sustains at that $17 million run rate that it's been at, I guess the core ammo segment is going to take a pretty big step-up in terms of revenue production in the fourth quarter. This is something that you're seeing -- our margin has compressed a little bit from the prior quarter, but something that we have fully expect to be benefit from heading into our next fiscal years as soon as our new facility opens up. And just as we head into summer 2022, what type of utilization rates would be expect on demand facility, just I guess maybe in that first quarter--\n I think that's going to be kind of something that we look to gearing up to. Last quarter, I think Fred indicated in the new facility with already a purchased -- already purchased equipment, you could save a penny a bullet on street game edition that I wanted to try to get some additional color on that like, how much of the ammunition that's produced now is street ammunition."
