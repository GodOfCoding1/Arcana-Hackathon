    "content": " And when you consider that the CPI had increased over 15% since 2019, this means that in today's dollars, if our expense growth in 2019 would have followed the increase in the CPI Index, we would have had $300 million of operating expenses in the quarter, versus the $273 million we actually incurred. Shifting to our capital improvement program, we remain on track to invest $100 million to $110 million into the portfolio in 2022, with over $80 million of it targeted for a number of ROI redevelopment projects, which we expect will generate cash and cash returns of 10% or higher when these transformed and re-merchandized hotels and resorts stabilize over the next two to three years. Splitting the impact of LaPlaya due to the hurricane, our Q4 outlook would assume same-property RevPAR of down 1.6% to up 1.3% to Q4 2019, with adjusted EBITDA of $74.3 million to $82.3 million, which is roughly in line with 2019 if you add back LaPlaya's impact. Yes, I mean I think -- well, first of all, I think we feel very good about the bridge that the resorts this year are going to run right now they're forecasted to run about $60 million over 2019 levels. So, that obviously will move around a little bit, but I think given where our view of the world is unless there's a significant change in the outlook due to the macro challenge, having some sort of dividend as we get into the second half of 2023 is likely would be required, because we used up our NOLs and our positive income would require one. Yes, I mean, Copley is going to be pretty -- looks like it's running pretty darn close to '19 EBITDA, give or take $1 million or $2 million, depending upon how the last three months end up."
