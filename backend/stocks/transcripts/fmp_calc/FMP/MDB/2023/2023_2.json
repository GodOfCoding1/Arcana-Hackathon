    "content": " As you think about where we're entering the second half of the year, right, as we start off the third quarter, given some of the slower growth that we've seen and the expansion of existing cohorts, that starting ARR is at a lower point as we look at the second half of the year, and so that will also affect fiscal '23 results. So we're getting a lot of positive feedback on time series, much like in search, where essentially customers like the one unified and seamless platform, a very elegant developer experience and the ability to essentially drive cost out of the business. I do believe some of these niche companies are going to struggle in this environment because -- we've always talked about this, and I think it only becomes even more imperative is customers don't want to use a net new technology for every net use case. So I wouldn't take it as any kind of judgment or try to do any math unless some sort of incremental value of workloads or slicing and dicing it that way, just simply us, saying, us looking at the market, having a long-term orientation, continuing to see strong new wins, no increases in customer churn, continuing to have the value proposition resonate and being sort of at the top of the customer priority list. Two, what they've also seen is that they're the net beneficiary of our growth and the Atlas growth on their platforms because customers not only -- obviously, Atlas drives more underlying consumption of storage and compute but customers themselves end up using other ancillary services. And so, we feel really, really good about the opportunity to add both new customers as well as new workloads onto our platform, and that's a huge priority for us in the back half of the year as well."
