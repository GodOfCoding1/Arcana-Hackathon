    "content": " Atlas revenue grew 50% year-over-year, representing 65% of revenue and we had another strong quarter of customer growth ending the quarter with over 40,800 customers. We had another strong quarter of new business acquisition, adding approximately 500 net new direct sales customers and we continue to have success in new workloads in existing accounts. In addition, due to slower Atlas consumption growth during fiscal 2023, we recognized several million dollars of incremental revenue in Q4 from a small portion of our customers that reach the end of their contracts without having consumed their entire commitment. It's important to keep in mind that the growth in our Atlas customer count reflects new customers to MongoDB in addition to existing EA customers, adding incremental Atlas workloads. Thank you so much. Thank you so much. Thank you so much. We still -- because of the wide variety of relational applications, there's still a lot of corner cases where you need a little bit more manual intervention, but we're getting great feedback on Migrator and our whole strategy is to reduce the switching costs of moving off relational applications to MongoDB and you're going to see us continue to invest in that area. Thank you so much. And so -- and that's really tied to the fact that our own end customers, their own business is slowing down so their need to upgrade those clusters as they -- either those existing apps grow or as they add new apps is not as high as it was say as it was two years ago."
