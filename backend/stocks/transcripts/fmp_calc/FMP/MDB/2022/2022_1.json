    "content": " Please go ahead, sir. We think that as customers recognize their need to be digital first, due to the pandemic, it's not like they're going to suddenly say, well, I'm going to go back to my more costly and more inefficient distribution channels, I think they're going to recognize that having a strong digital presence is critical to growing their business. And one of the biggest factors when you think about what will the Atlas trajectory look like, over time is how rapidly does the field enterprise channel adopt public cloud, right, and we sort of said for a while, that's the biggest swing factor overall in terms of the Atlas numbers. Clearly, you can see in the mix of results from Q1, in some of the vignettes that Dev shared in terms of the narrative, it was a very strong quarter for Atlas, when you look at the mix of deals in the enterprise channel, roughly two thirds of the new business was coming from Atlas, which is a very significant kind of high watermark. Well, obviously, you have to remember that if someone's going to choose Atlas, by definition, they've already chosen MongoDB because Atlas is the -- obviously the service offering that underlies MongoDB. The distributed capabilities, the ability to easily shard data, the ability to use capabilities to partition data, whether it's for privacy and security regulations around data in different parts of the world, or whether it's for performance, moving some data closer to end -- some end users in different parts of the world, all this capabilities gets far better exposed in Atlas than someone trying to do that in their own data centers. Please go ahead, sir."
