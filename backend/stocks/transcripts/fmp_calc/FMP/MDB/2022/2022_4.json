    "content": " Crossing over the $1 billion mark five years after reaching the annualized $100 million mark is clear evidence of the value MongoDB's application data platform offers customers, large and small, all over the world. One of the largest North American banks chose MongoDB as its modern database standard to fuel modernization, improve uptime and power a highly available, always-on secure customer experience for the bank's 10 million of retail customers. On a sequential basis, this quarter's strong Atlas revenue performance was driven in part by the exceptionally high in-quarter expansion of existing customers that we experienced and previously called out in Q3. To summarize, MongoDB delivered excellent fourth quarter results, we continue acquiring new customers at a strong pace, and our revenue growth is a testament to the breadth of platform adoption and our increasing strategic importance to our customers. Yes, I would just add, Brent, I'm not exactly sure which math you're doing, but if you're looking at sort of Atlas revenue -- average Atlas revenue for average Atlas customer, part of that today's point, will very specifically come from the fact that we're seeing increased adoption of Atlas among direct sales customers, right, which will be at a higher spending level than self-serve customers. No one's going to move 100 workloads overnight, but you have a great opportunity because we are so fractionally penetrated in even our existing accounts even though they may be large customers, and they're spending a lot of money with us, there's still thousands of apps that we can win, whether they're new apps or building or existing apps that they want to modernize."
