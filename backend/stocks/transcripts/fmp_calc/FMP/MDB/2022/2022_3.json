    "content": " We talked about Atlas and the success in Atlas and the stronger expansion than we typically see which is great and then it was also a really strong Enterprise Advanced quarter as people commented on and some of the questions and the follow ups and so I think there, continue to be sort of multiple legs of the growth we continue to add customers, we continue to find the customers that we're adding are behaving attractively, consistently with their kind of like kind cohorts from beforehand so the changes that we've made in terms of making it easier to adopt MongoDB and easier to get in the platform are working and are having the desired effects and I think it's just sort of the combination of all those things going really well resulting in a really strong quarter that certainly beat our expectations."
