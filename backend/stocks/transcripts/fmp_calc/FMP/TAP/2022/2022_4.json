    "content": " The uncertainty these broad consumer trends that all companies are facing in 2023 are a driving factor in our more modest guidance for this upcoming year, despite our relatively more optimistic outlook for the medium term where we anticipate delivering higher top and bottom line growth rates than we expect in 2023. The biggest drivers were lower brand volumes in the Americas given the industry softness as well as cycling a significant prior year distributor inventory build in the U.S. Conversely, EMEA and APAC financial volumes increased, resulting from a fairly resilient consumer in the UK and cycling Omicron-related restrictions in the prior year period. Year-to-date this year, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not going to give you a an absolute number because obviously, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not that far into the year, but I would tell you that our trading performance has improved from a volume perspective as we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve gone through, which is not terribly dissimilar behavior than we saw after the spring price increase, where we saw some muted volume after that, and we saw muted volume after the fall increase and bouncing back. So from a midterm guidance point of view, obviously, we look at the total basket of our P&L and look at what we expect from a pricing point of view, what we expect from our brand performance point of view as the plans and the additional ad spend that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re putting in place in 2023, has an impact, our innovation pipeline, what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s happening with our brands in EMEA, APAC, Canada rebounding as we increase investment in Canada as well."
