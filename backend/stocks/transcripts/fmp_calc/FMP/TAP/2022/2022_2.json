    "content": " Last quarter, our share the U.S. Hard Seltzer segment grew by 25% from just over 7% in the first quarter to over 9% in the second quarter, and our Hard Seltzers are currently growing share of the total beer industry. For the second quarter, we delivered another quarter of top line growth on a constant currency basis and achieved income before income tax at the favorable end of our anticipated range, while we continue to invest in our business, reduce net debt and return cash to shareholders. These factors were partially offset by strong financial and volume growth both in EMEA and APAC due to higher brand volumes and factored volumes, along with growth in our U.S. Net sales per hectolitre on a brand volume basis increased 7.1% driven by global net pricing and positive brand and channel mix, with premiumization delivered across both business units. Americas financial volumes decreased 8.1%, largely due to cycling higher U.S. shipments due to the prior year period inventory recovery efforts as well as 2.2% lower brand volumes, including impacts related to the Quebec labor strike. MG&A increased 14.2% as we cycled lower relative G&A spending in the prior year and increased marketing spend, accelerating investments behind our national champion and premium brands, especially in the U.K. supporting Carling, Madri and Staropramen fueling on-premise strength. Our brands are growing share, not only in the United States from a dollar point of view, but also in Canada and also in our third other big market, which is the U.K. We've accelerated the in-housing of Simply into the Fort Worth brewery for 2 -- I mean, we weren't planning to do that until next year, frankly, but demand is so strong that we brought it in-house, and we did that in a record time."
