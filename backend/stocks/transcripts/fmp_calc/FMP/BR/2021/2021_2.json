    "content": " Recurring revenues grew 7%, operating margin increased a 150 basis points year-over-year to 11.2%, and we continue to demonstrate our ability to expand margins even a ramp \u2013 while ramping up the investment spend that Tim highlighted earlier, which we said we would accelerate during last quarter\u2019s call. Issuer solutions\u2019 revenues rose 14% driven by higher revenues from virtual shareholder meetings, which also helped drive growth across a broader set of issuer products and offset the impact of lower revenue in our transfer agency business. Both our wealth and capital markets product revenues benefited from new client onboardings and the impact of the 24% increase in trading volumes versus the second quarter of fiscal 2020, with higher growth coming from the retail side of our clients\u2019 businesses. As we enter the second half of the fiscal year, we expect the growth in trading volumes to slowly significantly lap last spring\u2019s spike in volatility, which coupled with the lower license activity will put pressure on GTO growth. I\u2019ll turn it back to Tim and let him talk about 2022, but I do think we should expect some modest acceleration and recurring revenue growth, and adjusted EPS as we \u2013 if our outlook continues as we expect for fiscal year 2021, if we\u2019re able to make those investments, they\u2019ll contribute to some modest acceleration as I said in Investor Day through 2022 and 2023. The second point I\u2019ll make and then I\u2019ll turn it to Tim to see if he has anything, is that the investments has been a key part of the financial model in strategy for growth, a key part of our capital allocation program prior to my joining and it\u2019s going to \u2013 we\u2019re going to continue to remain committed to support the future growth."
