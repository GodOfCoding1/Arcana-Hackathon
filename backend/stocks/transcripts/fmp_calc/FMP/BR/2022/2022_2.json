    "content": " David, as a reminder, our guidance for fiscal 2022 was made with the expectations of normal distribution revenue growth - we thought that we would drive 100 basis points of margin expansion above our three-year objectives of 50 basis points in margin expansion, and now that we see these elevated levels of distribution revenues, double digit in the second quarter, and I think we can expect similar type of growth for the balance of the year, that distribution revenue, particularly when it\u2019s concentrated in our customer communications business, comes with no margin, and we have been alluding to the postal rate increases throughout the past few quarters - that\u2019s starting to come through, and that\u2019s direct pass-through revenue with no margin on it, either."
