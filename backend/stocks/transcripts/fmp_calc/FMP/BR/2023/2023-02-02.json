    "content": " Recurring revenues rose 12%, driven in part by the continued strong performance of Broadridge trading and Connected Solutions, or BTCS, where our market share gains are driving growth. As a result, we're reaffirming our full year guidance for 6% to 9% constant currency recurring revenue growth and 7% to 11% adjusted EPS growth. Recurring revenue grew 8% to $840 million in Q2 '23, marking a second consecutive quarter near the higher end of our full year guidance range of 6% to 9%. ICS recurring revenues grew 10%, all organic to $467 million, with regulatory at 9% and double-digit growth across all other product lines. Where recurring revenues rose 11% to $163 million, driven by new client wins in print and growth in our higher-margin digital business. Recurring revenues grew to $373 million or 6%, driven by new sales and continued strength in our capital markets, including BTCS, Capital Markets revenues grew 12% to $235 million, again propelled by strong growth from BTCS, new sales and higher fixed income trading volumes. Looking ahead to the second half of fiscal '23, we expect the combination of higher contest activity and lower mutual fund activity will have us trending towards the low end of the $240 million to $260 million range that we've seen in recent years. And we do think the fact that it's not sort of going back to levels of a couple of years ago, sort of not the growth rate, but the overall level really underscores a fundamental lift that has taken place driven by free trading, app based investing, younger investors being involved in the market. Again, equity position growth of 9% is flat to last year and the testing that Tim just mentioned continues to be in line with what our expectations were in our original guidance and what we have as well at that mid to high-single digit level."
