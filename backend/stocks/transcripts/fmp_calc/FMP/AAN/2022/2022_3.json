    "content": " In the quarter, our customer lease renewal rate was 86.3% for all company operated Aaron's stores, which was down 340 basis points from the prior-year quarter and below pre-pandemic averages. Also, our lease portfolio size for all company-operated stores ended the third quarter slightly ahead of our internal expectations at $125.8 million, a decrease of 4.8% as compared to the prior-year quarter. Consistent with the second quarter of this year, this year-over-year increase is primarily the result of the acquisition of BrandsMart and higher occupancy, shipping and handling and other miscellaneous expenses at the Aaron's Business, which was partially offset by lower advertising costs at the Aaron's Business and a gain related to the sale leaseback transactions initiated during the quarter. At the Aaron's Business, total revenue decreased 8.7% in the quarter to $412.9 million, primarily due to the lower lease revenues, which were attributed to a lower lease portfolio size during the quarter and the corresponding decline in customer payment activity that Steve discussed earlier. Operating expenses at the Aaron's Business decreased $1 million in the quarter as compared to the prior-year period due to lower performance-based compensation and other operating expenses, partially offset by a higher provision for lease merchandise write-offs. Adjusted EBITDA for the Aaron's Business was $42.5 million in the quarter compared with $66.8 million for the same period in 2021 due primarily to a decrease in gross profit and a higher provision for lease merchandise write-offs, partially offset by lower personnel costs. That's something that we're looking at each quarter, as well as I want to highlight that, in the third quarter, we did reduce net debt $46 million, which is in line with that second point in our capital allocation priorities."
