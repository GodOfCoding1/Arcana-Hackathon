    "content": " Customer demand and payment activity progressively worsened through the quarter, leading the second quarter revenues, earnings and earnings per share for the Aaron's business coming in lower than prior year quarter and below our expectations. In the second quarter, our customer lease renewal rate was 88.5% for our company operated Aaron's stores, compared to 92.4% in the government's stimulus aided second quarter of 2021. We ended the second quarter with a lease portfolio size for all company operated Aaron's stores of $130.8 million, a decrease of 1.5%, as compared to the prior year quarter. At the Aaron's business, total revenues in the quarter were $430.2 million, compared to $467.5 million for the second quarter of 2021, a decrease of 8%. In the second quarter of 2022, adjusted EBITDA for the Aaron's business was $48 million, compared with $78.6 million for the same period in 2021. This expected decline was due primarily to the normalization of customer demand following a strong second quarter in 2021, which we believe benefited from last year's government stimulus. Anthony, your line is now open. Anthony, your line is now open."
