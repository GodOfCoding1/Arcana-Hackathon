    "content": " In the first quarter, we delivered financial results consistent with our expectations for the quarter and we remain on track with the 2022 outlook we provided for The Aaron's core business in our February 23 earnings release. On a two-year basis, same-store revenues were up 9.6%. 12:20 More specifically, the company ended the first quarter with a lease portfolio size for all company-operated stores of $131.7 million, an increase of 2.3% compared to a lease portfolio size of $128.8 million on March 31, 2021. On a two-year basis, same-store revenues were up 9.6%. As expected, this increase in write-offs was primarily due to lower customer payment activity this year as compared to the government stimulus-aided first half of 2021, where lease renewal rates were 300 basis points to 400 basis points higher than what we experienced pre-pandemic and the continued product cost increases in our lease merchandise. 22:27 Excluding the BrandsMart acquisition, the Aaron's core business annual outlook for total revenues, adjusted EBITDA and annual same-store revenues remains consistent with the outlook provided on our fourth quarter 2021 earnings call. When combined with our existing e-commerce and GenNext growth platforms at Aaron's, we continue to believe that the consolidated business will deliver total revenues of over $3 billion and adjusted EBITDA greater than $300 million by 2026."
