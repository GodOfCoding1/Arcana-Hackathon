    "content": " We are pleased with the progress we have made in the first half of the year and making PDF Solutions the go-to manufacturing data analytics platform for the industry, which helps us build recurring revenue streams and provide greater visibility and predictability of our financial results. During the second quarter, revenue contribution from the integrated yield ramp was $3.6 million, down from last year, primarily due to gain share contracts that ended in second half of last year, which we have spoken about in prior calls. But I also want to point out, when you think about moving manufacturing to high labor cost areas like the United States and Europe, what you first need to think about is how can we use software and analytics and machine learning to drive down what has been a very, very labor-intensive part of the industry, whether even the front-end fabs have an awful lot more of engineering and grunt work that goes on when we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been inside fabs all over the world for decades."
