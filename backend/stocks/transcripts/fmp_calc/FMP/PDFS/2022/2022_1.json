The piece that we're still working on I think the runtime licenses on Cimetrix's comes down to when customers ship, as I said in my prepared remarks, we had anticipated them shipping a little bit more this quarter than they actually shipped. Second, specifically within the quarter, look, it's also that time of the year starting with Q1 where we start to accrue some personnel-related bonuses and things like that."
