    "content": " As Adnan will discuss in more detail, 2022 was another record year for total revenue in a year where our analytics business achieved tremendous growth, growing 40% year-over-year. As a result of customer partner commitments to PDF and our strong product development, analytics revenue grew 40% year-over-year in 2022 to over $130 million. During the year, we also bought back 22.5 million of PDF stock at an average price of just over $24 per share, which we believe was an effective way of returning cash flow stockholders and which allowed us to keep our weighted average diluted shares essentially flat for 2022 compared to 2021. And I'm curious, when you look at the IYR businesses, average about 4.5 million a quarter for the last year or so, is that our new baseline there or were there's some one-offs this year that caused to be a little higher, meaning that most of the growth this year will come from analytics?"
