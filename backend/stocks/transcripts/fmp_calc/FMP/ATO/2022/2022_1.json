    "content": " As a reminder, beginning in the second quarter of fiscal '21, and through the end of last fiscal year, we've reached agreement with regulators in various states to begin refunding excess deferred tax liabilities, generally over a three to five-year period. Excluding the impact of these excess deferred tax liability refunds, operating income increased $16 million over the prior year quarter. The $227 million period-over-period increase reflects increased system modernization spending in our distribution segment, spending to close out Phase 1 of APT's Line X and Line S2 projects and project timing. We remain on track to spend $2.4 billion to $2.5 billion in capital expenditures this fiscal year with more than 80% of this spending focused on modernizing a distribution and transmission network, which also reduces methane emissions. So our effective tax rate for the first quarter was about 5.9% that we're anticipating, including the excess deferred tax liabilities and effective income tax rate in the 7% to 9%, given that we are refunding these excess deferred tax liabilities over the next three to five years, that effective tax rate should be in place in that general range over that time period. I think at our fourth quarter call that we added 45 industrial customers last year that we anticipate once they're fully online or utilized somewhere between 12 BCF and 14 BCF of natural gas, that equates to around 200,000 residential customers."
