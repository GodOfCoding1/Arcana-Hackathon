    "content": " In terms of our investment activities, we continue ramping up our CapEx, expanding 27% on a sequential basis and 71% when compared with the same quarter of the last year, totaling close to $1.2 billion in the quarter and accumulating $2.9 billion as of September, being on track to fully deploy our updated target for the year. During the quarter, total production remained essentially flat when compared with the previous quarter, though recording a 2% increase year-over-year, boosted by a strong 7% expansion in our crude oil production which averaged 225,000 barrels per day in the third quarter. On the financial front, the third quarter resulted in another quarter delivering sound operating cash flow which increased by almost 19% sequentially to about $1.6 billion on the back of positive working capital valuations besides similar adjusted EBITDA levels. Therefore, as our financial situation has continued improving, I would like to highlight, as in the previous quarter, that our healthy liquidity position comfortably covers our debt amortizations for the next 18 months, given a very manageable debt profile with just $50 million coming due before year-end and another $941 million coming due in 2023. But most likely, we are going to get closer to the level that we have seen in this quarter in terms of new well activity and probably also incorporating another drilling rig in the first quarter of next year, probably for a total of 15 drilling rigs in our Vaca Muerta operations."
