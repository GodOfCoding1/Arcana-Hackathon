    "content": " During the quarter, our total hydrocarbon production averaged 504,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, remaining essentially flat vis-\u00c3\u00a0-vis the previous quarter, but consolidating a 9% growth when compared to the previous year, primarily leveraging on the very positive performance of our shale operations. Nevertheless, our investment plan for the year is allowing us to keep interannual production growth at a healthy pace, with total hydrocarbon production standing 9% above the same quarter in 2021 and more recently, resuming sequential growth with preliminary production figures for July, increasing to 512,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. However, when we segregate lifting costs for our shale oil core hub operations, we managed to achieve a 5% sequential reduction to $3.50 per barrel as efficiencies implemented during the quarter, combined with higher levels of production, more than compensated the general cost pressures. More specifically, with regards to our shale operations, both shale oil and shale gas continue showing remarkable growth compared to the previous year, while also marking fresh new quarterly production records. In terms of efficiencies within our shale operations, during the quarter, we achieved further significant improvements in drilling and fracking performance, averaging 248 meters per day in drilling and over 200 stages per set per month on fracking, increasing by 13% and 23%, respectively, when compared to the previous quarter and setting new quarterly records for both metrics. This expanded CapEx activity should in turn allow us to achieve further oil and gas production growth, raising our year-over-year target for hydrocarbon production growth by about 1 percentage point and even more relevant, increasing our end of year oil production target by about 6%, now estimating an average of about 230,000 to 235,000 barrels per day in the fourth quarter, leveraging on an estimate of 85,000 to 90,000 barrels per day in shale oil production in that period. So that is increasing our total activity there by about 20%, which also correlates with the comments that we made in terms of increased oil production expected for the fourth quarter of this year in our shale operations."
