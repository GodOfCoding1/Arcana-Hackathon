    "content": " In the first quarter fiscal year 2023, Aviat delivered revenue of $81.3 million, which represents growth of 11.1% versus Q1 of last year. Gross margin expansion of 80 basis points versus Q1 of last year; adjusted EBITDA of $10.9 million, a 13% increase versus the same period prior year; non-GAAP EPS increase of 12%; strong debt free balance sheet. For the first quarter, we reported total revenues $81.3 million as compared to $73.2 million for the same period last year, an increase of $8.1 million or 11.1%, driven by strong growth in Asia-Pacific and Latin America, as well as the contribution from Redline acquisition. First quarter GAAP operating expenses were $23.7 million, an increase of $6.2 million from the prior year, driven by the acquisition of Redline operating expenses, including a one-time restructuring charge of $2 million as well as M&A related costs. First quarter non-GAAP operating expenses, which exclude the impact from restructuring charges, share-based compensation and deal costs, were $20.5 million. First quarter non-GAAP net income, which excludes restructuring charges, share-based compensation M&A related cost and non-cash tax provision was $8.8 million compared to $8.1 million for the same period last year. Our cash and marketable securities at the end of the first quarter were $22.9 million from $47.8 million the prior quarter, primarily due to the Redline acquisition, related restructuring spending and continued strategic investment in inventory to derisk the supply chain. I think historically if we look at, for example, what Ceragon was doing, they're doing roughly $20 million a quarter, but that's spread across two operators as opposed to just Airtel. If you used -- if we were to have used a Q1 of FY 2022 rates this quarter, our revenue would've been about $1.2 million higher, and about $500,000 higher quarter-over-quarter."
