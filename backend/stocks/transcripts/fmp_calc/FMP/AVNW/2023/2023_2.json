    "content": " In the second quarter of fiscal year 2023, Aviat delivered revenue of $90.7 million, which represents growth of 16.5% versus Q2 of last year. For the second quarter, we reported total revenues of $90.7 million as compared to $77.9 million for the same period last year, an increase of $12.8 million or 16.5%, driven by strong growth in Asia-Pacific, Europe and Latin America as well as the contribution from the Red Line acquisition. Second quarter GAAP operating expenses were $22.6 million an increase of $2.7 million from the prior year, driven by the inclusion of Redline operating expenses and $0.9 million restructuring charge in the quarter. Second quarter non-GAAP net income, which excludes restructuring charges, FX impacts, share-based compensation M&A related costs and non-cash tax provision was $11.1 million compared to $8.5 million for the same period last year. Second quarter non-GAAP EPS came in at $0.94 per share on a fully diluted basis compared to $0.71 per share for the same period last year, an increase of 32%. It's going to be more favorable for us, but we've -- I think we said we have $60 million of funnel, and we're starting to execute on that."
