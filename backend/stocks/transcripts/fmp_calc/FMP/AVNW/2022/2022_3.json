For the third quarter, we reported total revenues 74.5 million, as compared to 66.4 million for the same period last year, an increase of 8.1 million or 12.2%, driven by strong growth in North America and Africa. North America, which comprise 66% of total revenue for the third quarter was 49.0 million, an increase of 7 million or 16.7% from the same period last year driven primarily by our private networks business. Moving on to net income, last year\u2019s income included a onetime 92.2 million benefit from the release of a valuation allowance against the company\u2019s deferred tax assets related to our NOLs, based on the company\u2019s significantly improved profitability and outlook.
