    "content": " Consolidated revenues for the first quarter 2022 totaled $93.2 million compared to $32.4 million in the first quarter of 2021, an increase of 188% year-over-year. Our gross profit in the first quarter of 2022 was $10.1 million, a significant increase compared to $1.3 million in the same period the prior year. Manufacturing operating income for the first quarter of 2022 was $8.5 million compared to manufacturing operating loss of $6 million in the first quarter of 2021, and was positive for the fourth consecutive quarter. Consolidated operating loss in the first quarter of 2022 was primarily driven by the strong manufacturing operating income, offset by stock-based compensation that, as previously discussed, is largely tied to movement in the company's stock price. In the first quarter of 2022, we achieved positive adjusted EBITDA of $3.3 million compared to an adjusted EBITDA loss of $1.8 million in the same period last year. George, this is Jim. George, this is Jim."
