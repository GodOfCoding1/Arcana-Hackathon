    "content": " We delivered revenues of $364.8 million, an increase of 80% year-over-year and above our previously provided outlook on deliveries of 3,184 railcars, an increase of 84% year-over-year. We delivered full year adjusted EBITDA of $8.4 million versus a loss of $7.2 million in 2021, an improvement of $15.7 million. We delivered our first positive full year of operating cash flow since 2017, generating $11.5 million versus a use of $55.4 million in 2021, an improvement of $66.9 million. Consolidated revenues for the fourth quarter of 2022 totaled $129 million compared to $75 million in the fourth quarter of 2021, an increase of 71.9% year-over-year with railcar deliveries of 1,150, an increase of 90.4% year-over-year. Consolidated operating loss for the fourth quarter of 2022 was $6.2 million compared to operating income of $63,000 in the fourth quarter of 2021. In the fourth quarter of 2022, we achieved a positive adjusted EBITDA of $1.2 million, which was equivalent to the same period last year. For the fourth quarter, our adjusted net loss was $8.1 million or $0.31 per share compared to an adjusted net loss of $3.1 million or $0.14 per share in the fourth quarter last year. Adjusted net loss excludes the impact of certain noncash and nonrecurring charges such as the $4.5 million impairment on leased railcars, the onetime Mexican VAT cost of $1.9 million and noncash income of $4.7 million due to the change in the fair market value of the warrant liability. As I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve highlighted the last two quarters and Jim touched on earlier, our operating cash flow has significantly improved with cash generated from operating activities of $11.5 million in 2022, positive for the first time since 2017 and compared to cash used in operating activities of $55.4 million in 2021, a $66.9 million improvement. For the full year 2023, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re forecasting revenue of between $400 million and $430 million, up approximately 14% year-over-year at the midpoint of the range. And then, in addition, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to see a lowering of our borrowing costs and interest expense related to the reduction in ABL fees, which is approximately $3 million a year on an annual basis as part of this refinancing."
