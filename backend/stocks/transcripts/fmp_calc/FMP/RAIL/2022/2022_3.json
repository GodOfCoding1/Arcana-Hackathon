    "content": " As you saw in yesterday's earnings release, FreightCar America delivered 47% top line growth and 783 cars in the third quarter, an increase of 55% year-over-year, which again set a new high watermark for deliveries out of our new facility. Consolidated revenues for the third quarter 2022 totaled $85.7 million compared to $58.3 million in the third quarter of 2021, an increase of 47.1% year-over-year. Our gross profit in the third quarter of 2022 was $4.6 million, a significant increase compared to $1.5 million in the same period the prior year. In the third quarter of 2022, we achieved a positive adjusted EBITDA of $1.6 million compared to an adjusted EBITDA loss of $3.5 million in the same period last year. For the third quarter, our adjusted net loss was $5.4 million or $0.21 per share, an improvement compared to an adjusted net loss of $15 million or $0.63 per share in the third quarter last year. Sequentially, cash used in operating activities increased from the prior quarter by $11.2 million, primarily driven by increased inventory levels associated with both the startup of our third production line and higher production volume in the fourth quarter. Matt, this is Jim. Matt, this is Jim."
