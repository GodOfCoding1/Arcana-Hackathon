    "content": " In addition to expected regulatory fever for TSHA-120 in GAN by mid-2022 and first in human preliminary Phase 1/2 safety and efficacy data for TSHA-102 in Rett syndrome by year end, we remain focused on continued clinical development of the first generation construct for CLN7 disease in partnership with UT Southwestern and under the leadership of Dr. Ben Greenberg, Vice Chair of Clinical and Translational Research and Principal Investigator during the course of 2022. Please proceed with your question. Please proceed with your question. Please proceed with your question. So it\u2019s really going to be a whole host of endpoints that will share including safety and safety is going to be probably one of the most important ones because there\u2019s always this notion around overexpression and the data from our NHP study or NHP talks study not only demonstrated the safety of our construct at four \u2013 doses up to fourfold above what the starting dose will be in the clinical setting, but also proof of mechanism the ability to down regulate the expression of MECP2 in the presence of wild type in the presence of wild type MECP2 and so again, for us, it\u2019s quite exciting. Please proceed with your question. Please proceed with your question. The those select for the clinical trial for a gene therapy study, getting the dose Rett the first time is really important, because you\u2019ve got to make sure you give enough drug to make sure the drugs are effective, but also make sure that there\u2019s no safety or tolerability issues, because once you\u2019ve given gene therapy, drugs, you can\u2019t take it away again. Please proceed with your question. Please proceed with your question. Please proceed with your question."
