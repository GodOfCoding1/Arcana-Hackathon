    "content": " Another bucket is looking at specific Rett type behavioral assessments, such as the Rett Syndrome Hand Function Scale, the Rett Syndrome Behavior Questionnaire, and there's two or three others that we include in with the adults study and the pediatric study. For example, we've already mentioned the autonomic dysfunction, this breathing dysrhythmia that both children and adults with the Rett have, and it's due to autonomic dysfunction in the brain, when they have these alternating periods of very rapid breathing, which is correlated with high levels of anxiety, and then hypoxic excess, where they don't breathe at all for a while and start to go a little blue and cyanosed, and this causes incredible stress to the family. The other point I will make is that, the other precedent is in the \u00e2\u0080\u0093 if you look at the Acadia trofinetide study where they use an analogue of IGF-1to try and encourage the growth of synapses in the brain, which are missing in Rett syndrome, as you know, they saw changes in the Clinical Global Impression of severity scale and in the RSBQ, which is a caregiver rated Rett syndrome general development questionnaire."
