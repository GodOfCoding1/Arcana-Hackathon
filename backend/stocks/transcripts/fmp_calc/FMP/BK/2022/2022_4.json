    "content": " Excluding the impact of notable items, we reported earnings per share of $4.59, which was up 8% year-over-year and a return on tangible common equity of 21%, reflecting our solid underlying performance against the backdrop of a complex operating environment in 2022. In Asset Servicing, investment services fees were down 1% as the impact of lower market values at a stronger US dollar were mostly offset by the abatement of money market fee waivers, higher client activity and net new business. Net new assets were $42 billion, reflecting a very healthy level of growth from existing clients while flows related to dividends and year end capital gain distributions were naturally more muted than in the prior year quarter, and average active clearing accounts were up 4% year-on-year."
