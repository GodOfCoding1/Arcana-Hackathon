    "content": " This increase primarily reflects the abatement of money market fee waivers as well as continued underlying momentum across security services and market and wealth services, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of a stronger US dollar and lower market values across both equity and fixed income markets. In Issuer Services, investment service fees were up 10% reflecting higher depository receipts revenue and lower money market fee waivers, partially offset by the impact of the previously disclosed lost business in the prior year in Corporate Trust. In Treasury Services, investment services fees were up 10%, reflecting the benefit of lower money market fee waivers as well as higher payment volumes on the back of growth from both new and existing clients."
