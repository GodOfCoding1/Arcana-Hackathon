    "content": " During the first half of the fiscal year 2022, we generated total revenue of RMB101.5 million, increasing by 21.5% as compared to the same period of the fiscal year 2021, of which, the revenue generated from the sales of publicly raised fund products increased by 5.3%, and the revenue generated from the sales of privately raised fund products increased by 91.6%. In the first half of the fiscal year 2022, the growth of the outstanding ending balance of our public raised fund products outpaced the growth of the number of active clients for our publicly raised fund products, and the outstanding ending balance of our public raised fund products per client continued to increase, demonstrating the snowball effect brought by the automatic investment on a dollar-cost averaging basis management system highly-recommended by the Company. In the first half of the fiscal year 2022, the transaction value of privately raised fund products, all of which were privately raised securities investment fund products, was RMB882.6 million, increasing by 69.7% as compared to the same period of the fiscal year 2021, demonstrating our efforts in cross-selling privately raised fund products to clients of our public raised fund products. In particular, net revenues generated from distribution of public raised fund products for the reporting period were RMB55.5 million, US$8.7 million with withstanding of 5.3% period-on-period increase from RMB52.7 million. The increase was primarily due to first, the increase in transaction value of privately raised fund products; and second, performance-based fees of RMB3.0 million recognized in the first half of the fiscal year 2022, as compared to nil in the first half of the fiscal year 2021. The decrease was primarily due to a 74.3% decrease in performance-based fees generated by our actively managed fund of funds to RMB1.8 million, US$0.3 million for the first half of the fiscal year 2022, from RMB6.9 million for the same period of the fiscal year 2021."
