In total, the progress we've made on organic and inorganic initiatives drove record top and bottom line growth with EBITDA margins reaching 18% in the quarter, tracking well towards our midterm target of 20% and contributing to record quarterly earnings of $1.49 per share. Value-added sales, which excludes the impact of pass through precious metal costs were $309.2 million for the quarter, up 30% from the prior year. We delivered adjusted earnings of $1.49 per share in the fourth quarter, up 32% as compared to the prior year despite substantial interest headwind. Adjusted EBITDA in the quarter was $55.6 million or 18% of value added sales, up 40% from the prior year. EBITDA, excluding special items, was a record at $44.3 million and a record 25% of value-added sales, up 96% compared to $22.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2021. Fourth quarter value-added sales were $104 million, up 16% versus the prior year and up 2% organically. EBITDA, excluding special items, was $17.1 million or 16.4% of value-added sales in the quarter, an increase of 8% from the prior year. EBITDA, excluding special items, was $4 million or 14.6% of value-added sales, down from the prior year due to the lower sales volume. Adjusted EBITDA for the year was $196 million or 17.1% of value-added sales, up 37% from the prior year. Despite this, we expect to deliver another record year for VA sales and earnings with adjusted EPS in the range of $5.50 to $5.90 per share, representing an 8% increase at the midpoint. Phil, your line is live. Phil, your line is live."
