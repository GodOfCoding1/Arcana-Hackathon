    "content": " 10:26 EBITDA, excluding special items was $18.9 million, or 17.2% of value-added sales in the quarter compared to $10.9 million in the first quarter last year, an increase of 73%. First quarter value-added sales were $28.5 million, down 20% compared to the prior year period, but up 3% when excluding the discontinued consumer electronics application and PCR COVID testing declines mentioned last quarter, as well as the unexpected temporary Shanghai shutdown. So whether it's a dynamic pricing model that's taking into account, what's happening in the world, whether it's the HCS acquisition, which performed really well in Q1 and is expected to perform well as we go rest of the year, making sure that we hit the right things on the clad strip project, the general demand and new product pipeline."
