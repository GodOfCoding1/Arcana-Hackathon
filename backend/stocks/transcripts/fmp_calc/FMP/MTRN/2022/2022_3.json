    "content": " Our organic outgrowth initiatives combined with continued strength across most of our end-markets led by semiconductor, industrial, aerospace and energy delivered a robust 15% organic growth in the quarter. Value added sales which exclude the impact of pass-through precious metal costs were 290.4 million for the quarter, up 35% from the prior year. As we look to the fourth quarter, we expect the electronic materials business to deliver another strong quarter of year-on-year growth attributed to our diversified semiconductor portfolio, as well as organic initiatives on pace to deliver continued above market growth. I mean, when you look at our order book, from, just from end of last year to kind of where we're at right now, and we're our order books up about 13% from end of last year to now and I think it's just a testament to the type of organic growth, our teams are driving the projects that our teams are driving."
