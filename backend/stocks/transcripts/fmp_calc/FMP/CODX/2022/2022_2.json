    "content": " We believe that several factors contributed to the second quarter's results, including a reduction in mandated testing for travel and public venues, a reduction in public funding assistance for testing programs and an increase in overall weariness for the disruption to daily life after a multi-year pandemic, specifically the Omicron variant earlier this year. And I believe that as you see this thing progressed, that people \u00e2\u0080\u0093 you'll see people take it upon themselves to protect their own families and their own selves both in an at-home environment at businesses, in their business situation, restaurants, there's a whole lot of things that companies are going to need to do in terms of operationalizing testing, so that they don't end up being on the negligent side of liability when either customers or employees become sick and potentially die. To conclude today's call, I want to highlight the growth we have experienced over the past couple of years that are putting the company closer than ever to realizing our long-term vision of making high-quality gold-standard PCR testing affordable and available to all. Every hurdle along the way has been followed by opportunities to grow and improve, which is why even despite a decrease in revenue for the quarter, we are still able to report $96 million in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities on June 30, 2022, an increase of over $6 million from December 31, 2021, not withstanding the additional expense of acquiring and incorporating two new entities and the  R&D spending during that period."
