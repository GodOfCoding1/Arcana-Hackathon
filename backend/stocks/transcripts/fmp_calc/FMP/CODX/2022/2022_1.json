    "content": " This quarter was a momentous period in the company's history as we continue to integrate Idaho Molecular Inc. and Advanced Conceptions, Inc., providing Co-Diagnostics with all existing and future assets and intellectual property related to our upcoming Co-Dx at-home point-of-care diagnostic platform. Co-Diagnostics believes that in addition to ultimately representing the future of at-home and point-of-care testing, our new powerful platform also has the potential to help build a cloud-based pathogen surveillance system to thwart future outbreaks, all while giving individuals the power to know their COVID or other infectious disease status, any time, any place, anywhere. Despite these dynamics, we continue to believe that we are at an important point in our growth trajectory that will enable us to expand into new verticals, new markets and innovative molecular diagnostic solutions, such as our forthcoming Co-Dx PCR home testing platform. Two years ago this month when we first conceived our Co-Dx PCR home platform, we only had the slightest understanding of the importance it would have not just to our company but potentially to the world at large to think that gold standard PCR diagnostics tools right on your kitchen counter, which were inconceivable at the beginning of 2020 are now on the cusp of becoming widely accessible following our product launch."
