    "content": " In particular, I am pleased with the steady growth in our security business, which accounted for 22.1% of adjusted gross billings in the first quarter, up from 19.4% in the same period last year. First quarter services revenue totaled $63.1 million, increasing 13.5% from the same period last year on rising customer demand for consulting and suite of managed services. As Mark noted, fiscal 2023 started off with a 10% year-over-year net sales increase to $458.4 million, driven by strong performance in the technology segment where net sales were up 12.1%, totaling $448.8 million. We reported strong adjusted gross billings of $701.9 million, 10.9% above the $633 million reported in the first quarter of fiscal 2022, highlighting market share gains and our focus on higher growth areas. First quarter 2023 financing segment revenue was $9.6 million compared to $16.3 million in the last year's first quarter resulting from the reduction of sales of leased equipment, portfolio earnings and transactional gains, reflecting the variability of this business. We saw the same dynamic in the Technology segment as gross profit was $105.7 million, up 10.7% relative to the prior year's quarter. More specifically product gross margin increased 20 basis points to 21.6%, driven by a change in mix, while service margin was 35.6% compared to 39% a year ago, primarily due to higher third-party costs tied to staffing our professional services. As we move to the bottom line after factoring in foreign currency transaction losses, consolidated net earnings in the first quarter of fiscal 2023 were $22.3 million or $0.84 per diluted share compared to $23.5 million or $0.87 per diluted share in the last year's first quarter."
