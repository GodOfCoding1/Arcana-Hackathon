    "content": " Although our technology segment gross margins decreased from last year, due to product and customer mix along with a lower gross to net adjustment, our overall results highlight the positive operating leverage in our model as segment operating income was up 43.9%. Services revenue grew 16.3% in the first quarter, with gross margins of 39%, up 140 basis points from last year's first quarter. Security represents 20.8% of our trailing 12-month adjusted gross billings and almost $500 million on a standalone basis, reflecting its significance within the total solutions approach we bring to customers. Our consolidated net sales for the first quarter were $416.6 million, a 17.4% increase from the $355 million reported in last year's first quarter. In our technology segment, revenue was up 17.3% to $400.4 million compared to $341.2 million in the last year's first quarter, reflecting robust growth in both product, revenue and service revenue of 17.5% and 16.3%, respectively. Our financing segment was up 18% to $16.3 million, mainly due to increased sales of off lease equipment of $5.1 million, up from $3.9 million last year. Technology segment gross profit increased 9.9% to $95.4 million, while the gross margin of 23.8% declined 160 basis points, mainly as a result of lower product margin due to competitive pressure from enterprise customers and our lower proportion of sales of third-party maintenance and software subscriptions in the first quarter. Consolidated net earnings of $23.5 million were $1.75 per diluted share or up 35.5% and 34.6%, respectively from $17.4 million or $1.30 per diluted share in the last year's first quarter."
