    "content": " The $5.4 million increase for the second quarter of 2022 compared to the preceding quarter was primarily driven by an $8.1 million increase in net interest income, partially offset by a $0.6 million increase in provision for loan losses, a $0.6 million loss on sales of securities and a $2 million increase in income tax expense related to our increased pretax income. Core net income, excluding the effect of tax credits and accelerated depreciation from our solar investments, a non-GAAP measure, for the second quarter of 2022 was $20.9 million or $0.67 per diluted share compared to $14.3 million or $0.45 per diluted share for the first quarter of 2022. Deposits at June 30, 2022 were $7.3 billion, an increase of $317.7 million from the first quarter of 2022. Deposits held by politically active customers were $1.3 billion as of June 30, 2022, an increase of $131.5 million as compared to $1.1 billion as of March 31, 2022. Total loans, net of deferred loan origination costs at June 30, 2022 were $3.6 billion, an increase of $178.2 million or 5.1% compared to March 31, 2022. The increase in loans primarily driven by a $92.9 million increase in residential loans, mainly from direct originations, a $39.8 million increase in multifamily loans, a $36.9 million increase in our consumer and other loans due to solar loan originations from existing flow arrangements and a $19.2 million increase in commercial and industrial loans, offset by a $13.2 million decrease in the commercial real estate portfolio as we selectively derisk our exposure in metropolitan areas. Core noninterest income, excluding the effects of tax credits and accelerated depreciation from our solar investments was $8.7 million for the second quarter of 2022 compared to $7.2 million in the first quarter of 2022. The increase of $1.5 million was primarily related to onetime beneficiary income on BOLI, as well as higher gains on sale of nonperforming commercial loans. Noninterest expense for the second quarter of 2022 was $34.3 million, a decrease of $0.1 million from the first quarter of 2022. The decline of $0.1 million from the preceding quarter is primarily driven by a $0.9 million decrease in data processing expense related to the pass-through of certain trust department operating expense to related funds, offset by an expected $0.3 million increase in compensation and employee benefits and a $0.4 million increase in residential lending foreclosure expense. Nonperforming assets totaled $65.3 million or 0.82% of period-end total assets at June 30, 2022, an increase of $4.2 million compared with $61.1 million or 0.80% of period end total assets at March 31, 2022. The increase in nonperforming assets was primarily driven by the restructuring of $6.5 million in loans that are part of one borrower relationship as well as two loans totaling $5.2 million that were moved to nonaccrual in the second quarter of 2022, partially offset by one $3.5 million nonaccrual multifamily loan that was paid off. While nonperforming assets increased, overall credit quality improved as criticized assets declined $43.5 million or 24.3% to $135.8 million on a linked-quarter basis. The allowance for loan losses increased $2 million to $39.5 million at June 30, 2022, from $37.5 million at March 31, 2022, primarily due to increases in loan balances, offset by improved credit quality. At June 30, 2022, we had $60.1 million of impaired loans for which a specific allowance of $6.1 million was made compared to $58.2 million of impaired loans at March 31, 2022, for which a specific allowance of $4.6 million was made. That said, we feel confident that we will achieve the high end of our proposed ranges of core pretax pre-provision earnings of $110 million to $120 million, which considers the effect of the forward rate curve for the remainder of 2022 and net interest income of $220 million to $230 million, which considers the effect of the forward rate curve for the remainder of 2022. Generally speaking, we estimate a range of $4 million to $4.5 million increase in annual net interest income for each 25 basis point increase related to yesterday's Fed decision and a range of $3 million to $4 million increase in annual net income for each 25 basis point move in short-term forward curve rates for the remainder of this year. We feel the combination of the, let's call it, $500 million we have in cash right now, $230 million or so of that is in short-term maturing repo agreements that -- or resale agreements that we see turn to cash as we head into the fourth quarter to fund the growth initiatives. We're carrying on average about $200 million, probably more than we would like and we would see that cash balance coming down, deposits coming down in the fourth quarter with the political runoff and that should free up a little bit of margin return as well."
