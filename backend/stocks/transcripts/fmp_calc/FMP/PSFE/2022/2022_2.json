    "content": " Our second quarter revenue of $379 million and adjusted EBITDA of $103 million were in line with our guidance range for the quarter, despite greater than expected FX headwinds. Revenue was $191.8 million, a decrease of 13% compared to the prior year, reflecting FX and soft iGaming activity in Europe, which we have also seen in the results from gambling operators who continue to report declines in the region through the first half. Adjusted EBITDA for the Digital Commerce segment was $71.7 million in the second quarter and down 16% on a constant currency basis, reflecting lower revenue, business mix and SG&A from recent acquisitions. Looking ahead, we also expect FX parity versus the euro for the second half, leading to a 1.05 exchange rate for full year, which is a 10% decline versus our original expectation of 1.17 and a 5% decline from our expectation in May or roughly $40 million in revenue. For Q3, we expect revenue in the range of $350 million to $365 million and adjusted EBITDA in the range of $90 million to $95 million, reflecting a moderation of growth rate from U.S. For the total company, adjusted EBITDA is expected to be between $400 million and $415 million, reflecting lower margins year-over-year, primarily driven by business mix.
