    "content": " Adjusted operating profit in the quarter increased 16% to $682 million, driven by the contribution from COVID-19 vaccine distribution and growth in Specialty Products distribution to our providers and healthcare systems, which was partially offset by higher operating costs, and supported a company's oncology growth initiative. In the June quarter, revenues were $881 million, an increase of 34% and adjusted operating profit increased 62% to $139 million, driven by higher volumes of technology and service offerings to support biopharma customers, organic growth from access and generic solutions and recovery of prescription volumes from the COVID-19 pandemic."
