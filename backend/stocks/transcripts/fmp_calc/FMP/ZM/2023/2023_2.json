So when you look at the difference in the guidance and previously, we had expected online to be approximately flat for the year and now we are saying it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to be in the range of 7% to 8% down, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s really where the majority of that is coming from on a base of about $2 billion. And I know that you saw \u00e2\u0080\u0093 you said, hey, there is some linearity creating some challenges at the back end of the quarter, but to also kind of outperform on new customers there with some of those challenges is pretty nice, and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m just trying to understand how much momentum you see in that going forward in the face of some of these linearity issues. Thanks for taking the question. Thanks for taking the question. Thanks for taking the question. Thank you so much, Kelly."
