    "content": " During this call, we will make forward-looking statements, including statements regarding our financial outlook for the second quarter and the full fiscal year of 2022, Zoom\u2019s growth strategy, business aspirations to lead the evolution to hybrid work and the continued impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business. In terms of the specific packages themselves, we aren\u2019t going to disclose the actual breakout of that, but a lot of what you saw disclosed in the revenue coming from new customers is the opportunity they saw to up-sell either Zoom Phone or Webinars or Rooms as people are thinking about going back into the office spaces again. Also, what\u2019s more important is that when it comes to the comp room or Zoom Room setup, customers like consistent experience meaning when they are back at home, because the future is about a hybrid. So that\u2019s another driver for our customers to standardize on Zoom platform, for Meetings, for Webinar or the Phone, again, a lot of innovation in the pipeline for the Zoom Rooms. Also, Sterling, I would like to add a little bit more, if you look at Q1 or Q2 last fiscal year in terms of revenue growth driven by a lot of online buyers like for Zoom consumer SMB business. And inside of that, every time when we work together with our channel partners or carriers, take British Telecom, for example, when we are working together with our potential prospects, after they valued our Zoom service, it\u2019s just they not only realized this service works so well, but also look at \u2013 we shared the roadmap with them. So today, you look at a lot of enterprise customers very rapidly deployed on-prem solutions, that\u2019s a huge opportunity for every \u2013 the cloud business service provider, including Zoom."
