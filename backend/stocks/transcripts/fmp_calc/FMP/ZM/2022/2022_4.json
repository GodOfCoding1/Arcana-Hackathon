    "content": " Much of the Zoom Phone growth came from strength in large customers with a number of customers with more 149% year-over-year, and the number of customers with more than 10,000 paid seats growing 122% year-over-year. And as you heard from some of the highlights we talked about earlier, we had a very strong performance from Zoom Phone in Q4 as well and also Zoom Rooms as customers are really thinking about the future of hybrid work and how they're going to keep everyone collect connected as they bring them back to the office. Several years ago, after the launch of Zoom Phone, many of our customers told us they would like to standardize on Zoom platform for unified communications. For the first year, for sure, right, we are going to target those customers who really want to standardize on Zoom platform, probably started from Meeting, for those customers who deploy both Meeting and Phone, now they look at the contact center. In terms of looking forward, international absolutely is a really important part of our growth strategy, and we do continue to expect it to grow at a rate that is higher than the U.S. And so that's -- and we will continue to also add -- invest in sales capacity internationally at a rate that is higher on a percentage basis than we would be doing in the U.S. as well. And sometimes customers already deploy Five9, they are going to deploy more the features from Zoom, also deployed the Zoom contact center or deploy Genesys, if that's what suited okay."
