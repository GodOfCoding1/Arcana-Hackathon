Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. So you know if you have \u2013 if you're running $10 million through a plant and your variable cost of supplies, tooling and hardware and oil and filters and other is 5% of your revenues, well if your revenues go down $2 million then its 5% of $8 million rather than $10 million. Your line is open. So that's going to \u2013 you know that should go away after this quarter, that\u2019s what we\u2019re anticipating and then there's $1 million of other ancillary costs as associated with legal, accounting, things like that, that were associated with the acquisition. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Yeah, and our target still is by fiscal \u201923, it\u2019s to pay down at the minimum $400 million of debt and I think all the way through this quarter already we played down about $100 million through the fourth quarter and so we\u2019ll continue every quarter reducing that, allocating our capital to get to our target and get that leverage down."
