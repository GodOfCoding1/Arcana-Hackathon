    "content": " Looking ahead, we expect to end 2023 with 135 to 140 reps and sales guidance for Q1 suggests a record $43.8 million quarter or 13% organic growth. With that, I will turn the call over to J.J. Q4 2022 sales were $41 million, an increase of 4% on a reported basis and 8% organically versus Q4 2021. For the full year 2022, sales were $161.7 million, an increase of 5% on a reported basis and 9% organically. Q4 2022 operating income was $7 million, reflecting an operating margin of 17%. We expect Q1 2023 sales of $42.6 million to $45 million, which represents a reported increase of 11% at the midpoint and 13% organically. For the full year of 2023, we expect sales of $174.3 million to $178.3 million, which represents an increase at the midpoint of 9% on both a reported and organic basis. We also expect operating income of $30.6 million to $33.3 million, which represents an increase of 19% at the midpoint and 7% excluding special items. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a little bit less new in Europe for us, and then we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been here for 4 years in the U.S. And then the last question, just as I think about gross margin through the course of like \u00e2\u0080\u009823, do you expect to exit like \u00e2\u0080\u009823 with a higher gross margin than \u00e2\u0080\u0093 I mean, obviously, implied in your guidance was 64.8% versus 65.4%. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re looking at closer to 10% or 11% this year, and you can do the same thing we just did with gross margin, look at the Q1 OpEx sort of guidance that you can impute with the year full year and then sort of assume a cadence throughout the year to get there. Your line is now open. Your line is now open."
