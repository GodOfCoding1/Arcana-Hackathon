So -- but I would say we've done most of the hiring at this point\n Just sort of the last the area that I just wanted to ask about, it feels like if I'm sort of listening to the comments, both on the direct labor and sort of maybe some of the newer hires not being as productive and then not coming through in gross margin improvement and on the sales side, you sort of alluded to maybe high turnover and sort of also sort of talked about, well, maybe they have a little less access and that's causing them to be slower coming up. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open."
