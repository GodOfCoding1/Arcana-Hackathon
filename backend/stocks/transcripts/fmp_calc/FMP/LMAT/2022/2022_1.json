    "content": " Thanks, J.J. On today\u2019s call, I\u2019ll cover four topics: Q1 organic sales growth of 13%; continued sales force growth to 112 reps; going direct in Korea and the stronger U.S. dollar. Sales were $39.6 million in Q1, a 13% organic increase versus the year ago quarter. Indeed, full year 2022 organic sales growth is increasing slightly in today\u2019s guidance to 8.2% from 7.5% in the February 24 guidance. Q1 2022 operating income was $7.9 million, flat versus the prior year period as 14% operating expense growth offset sales increases. Turning to guidance, we expect Q2 2022 sales of $40.1 million to $42.1 million, which represents a reported increase of 1% at the midpoint versus Q2 2021 and 5% organically. For the full year 2022, we expect sales of $160 million to $164 million, which represents an increase of 5% at the midpoint versus 2021 and 8% organically. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. What you are maybe talking about is, I think in theory, we always sort of talk about, yes, maybe $1 million of sales deserves one sales rep as a real high-level talking point, but I don\u2019t think you have ever heard us come on this call and say 130 or 140. Your line is open. Your line is open."
