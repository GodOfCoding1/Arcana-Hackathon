Your line is now open. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. I think that part of the loan growth that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re seeing or experiencing maybe businesses trying to get ahead of inflation a bit in terms of acquiring inventory today as opposed to something that might have a 10%, 20%, 30% rate increase. Your line is now open. And I do think that at least for the near-term, that cushion will allow continued spend activity, albeit, as Terry mentioned, in a little bit different categories, certainly from goods to services and a little bit more in terms of non-discretionary, but we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re still seeing strength there. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. Your line is now open."
