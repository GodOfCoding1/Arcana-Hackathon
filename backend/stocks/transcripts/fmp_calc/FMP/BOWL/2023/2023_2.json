    "content": " Notably, our growth was strong across various business lines, walk-in retail, leagues and events, the last of which grew far beyond the estimated $10 million headwind that we faced in the prior year resulting from the Omicron response. In the second quarter of fiscal year 2023, Bowlero generated record Q2 revenues of $273 million and record Q2 adjusted EBITDA of $97 million. Compared with the prior year's Q2, revenue grew by $68 million or 33% and adjusted EBITDA expanded by $30 million or 45%. As we highlighted in the first fiscal quarter, this incredible performance serves as a testament to three key differentiators: the benefits of QMS, which is our algorithmically powered management system; management's ability to lead in all macro environments; and the continued uptick in demand we see across the business. Despite any macro headwinds that maybe in play, in the first 31 weeks of the fiscal year 2023 ending February 5, revenue growth remained incredibly robust, growing 55% versus pre-pandemic levels with same-store revenue increasing 35% on the same basis. As highlighted on Slide 6, center level revenue increased $67 million or 33% over the comparable prior year period with positive momentum across each of our guest segments, walk-in retail, group events and leagues and tournaments. This strong topline growth translated into continued material growth in center level EBITDA, which jumped 43% year-over-year and an astounding 63% over the pre-pandemic period, reaching $118 million. On a consolidated basis, as shown on Slide 7, adjusted EBITDA margin was 35.5% and surged almost 685 basis points above the comparable pre-pandemic metric despite some input cost inflation that we highlighted during last quarter's conference call."
