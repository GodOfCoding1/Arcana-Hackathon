    "content": " In summary, Bowlero's Q3 FY '22 performance accelerated and continued to outpace pre-pandemic levels, further demonstrating that the business continues to be very well positioned to produce improved performance through a combination of organic growth, and center additions. The best manifestation of that is, again, looking back at, '08 or '09, as Tom said, that the business we were running at the time, lower unit count, more urban, highly exposed to events saw steeper declines in revenue than the AMF centers business did, but we actually expanded EBITDA from '08 to '09, because we saw the problems coming, we got ahead of it from a cost management perspective."
