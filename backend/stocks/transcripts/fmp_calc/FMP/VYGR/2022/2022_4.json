    "content": " For the last year, Novartis has been evaluating our capsids, their decision to license capsids for two CNS targets triggers $25 million in option exercise fees and Voyager is eligible to receive up to $600 million in associated development, regulatory and commercial milestone payments as well as mid to high single-digit tiered royalties based on the net sales of Novartis products incorporating the licensed capsids. Novartis also retains the right over the next 18 months to expand the scope of options to evaluate and license capsids for up to two additional CNS targets, subject to their availability for $18 million per target and the $12.5 million fee per target upon exercise of the option to license a capsid as well as milestones and royalties. And one final questions for me, I know it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s difficult to with given your potential milestones from the three collaborators, but curious if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re able to provide any cash funding guidance based on the $320 million in performing cash and if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re planning for any capital expenditures related to in-house manufacturing, scale up or etcetera, in the next few years. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open."
