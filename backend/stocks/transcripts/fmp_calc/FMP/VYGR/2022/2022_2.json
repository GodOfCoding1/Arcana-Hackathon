    "content": " As shown on Slide 13, on the left panel -- sorry, as shown on Slide 15, on the left panel because of loss of function mutations in the GBA1 gene there is reduced GCase activity in the relevant brain regions of patients who had Parkinson's disease or dementia with Lewy bodies who are GBA carriers. Preclinical data that were presented at the ASGCT conference earlier this year, shown on Slide 20 demonstrates that IV delivery of siRNA gene therapy leads to robust SOD1 knockdown in all regions of the spinal cord and significant improvements in motor performance, body weight and survival in the G93A SOD mouse model. Our therapeutic hypothesis has been an antibody targeting tau may block the neuron-to-neuron spread of tau at several plausible extracellular sites as shown on the right side of this slide, and that this may attenuate the progression of diseases such as Alzheimer's disease. Slide 26 shows that our antibody in a rosy pathological tau betting model is also differentiated in terms of biological activity from internal antibody that is equivalent to one that has failed to show efficacy in a Phase II clinical trial, just presented this data on the right side of this, on the panel on the right side of the slide at the AAIC meeting in San Diego."
