    "content": " In the second quarter of 2022, we continue to build on three previous quarters of positive momentum with revenue of $74.3 million, an improvement of 54% year-over-year. Revenue for the second quarter was $74.3 million, up 54% from the second quarter of 2021 and our third consecutive quarter of double-digit percentage revenue growth over the prior year. Limelight contributed $61.5 million, supporting a 27% year-over-year growth and Edge Cap contributed $12.8 million for the 16 days and the results were included. Pro forma operating expenses, excluding stock-based compensation, restructuring and acquisition-related expenses were $28.9 million or 39% of revenue up from 32% last year. Also, immediately following close, we began taking steps to implement our target operating model, resulting in a restructuring charge of approximately $4.4 million primarily related to severance benefits for 51 employees across the business. For the full year 2022, we are updating our guidance as follows, we expect the revenue range of $380 million to $390 million and adjusted EBITDA range of $13 million to $16 million. As we look beyond this year, our preliminary outlook for 2023 indicates a revenue range of $550 million to $560 million in adjusted EBITDA of at least $65 million."
