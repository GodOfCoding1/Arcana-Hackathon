    "content": " We believe the data from our SOLOIST Phase III trial provides compelling support for unique label for sotagliflozin and recent and worsening heart failure, which would provide us with a strong entry point into heart failure market. If approved, the overall heart failure market is already a very large multi-billion dollar market and is anticipated to further grow at nearly 20% per year for most of this decade, which we feel could enable peak blockbuster potential for sotagliflozin. Now only did they project that the market will grow at this tremendous rate over the next decade, but they also forecasted that that growth would be largely driven by the adoption of SGLT inhibitors for the treatment of heart failure, which we are now seeing play out with major heart failure treatment guideline revisions, both in the United States and in Europe. This loan facility provides us with access to a committed source of funding to support commercial preparations and the potential launch of sotagliflozin in heart failure, along with substantial financial flexibility, as we approached the planned resubmission of our NDA for sotagliflozin in heart failure and expect the top-line results from the two Phase II proof-of-concept studies of LX9211 in neuropathic pain. So we believe that it reaffirms the uniqueness of the SOLOIST population, where a hundred percent of the patients had been hospitalized and 50% of them were started on sotagliflozin during their hospitalization and the other 50% within three days of the relief from the hospital of those patients for a heart failure hospitalization."
