    "content": " Expanded development of our global network of Spokes, marrying customer demand, and building feedstock for our Rochester Hub, enhanced our global position with additional battery supply chain participants including recently being named as a preferred battery recycling partner for KION, a leading global forklift and warehouse trucks supplier, and strengthen our balance sheet with the US Department of Energy's loan commitment for $375 million, which will enhance our financial flexibility for future network expansion. With multiple commercial contracts and similar favorable supply demand dynamics, we are locating our Spoke network in key regional segments including Germany which represents the largest market for both battery manufacturing scrap and the expected supply of end-of-life lithium-ion batteries. In terms of where that Black Mass will go, we do have optionality to bring it to the Rochester Hub in the near term or the medium term, but that said, from a geopolitical perspective, policy perspective, economic perspective and closing the loop domestically, we would see over time that it makes sense to close that loop you know in a domestic sense as well speaking to Europe as a broader jurisdiction."
