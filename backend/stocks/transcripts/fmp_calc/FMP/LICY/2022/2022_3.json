    "content": " We maintained our first win percentage in battery recycling in North America and Euro, which is underpinned by commercial contracts and strategic partnerships with the Rochester Hub as the key future value driver, and we are traditionally funded to complete our current project pipeline with potential for debt financing from both traditional and government sources in support of our future growth. We highlight here key IRA benefits broadly for the recycling industry and our business namely up to $250 billion in clean energy loans to the DOE loan programs office or LPO, up to $60 billion in five year production tax credits, which provides for 10% of the cost of producing critical materials, including lithium cobalt pinnacle, and up to $10 billion in advanced energy project tax credit, which allocates up to a 30% investment tax credit for developing clean energy facilities in the U.S. And importantly, this includes recycling facilities.
