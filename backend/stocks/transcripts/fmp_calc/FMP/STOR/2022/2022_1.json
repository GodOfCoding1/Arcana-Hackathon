    "content": " Our first quarter revenues increased 22% from the year-ago quarter to $222 million, primarily reflecting the very strong growth in our real estate portfolio. Revenue from net acquisition activity increased approximately $25 million, which includes a full quarter's revenue from our net acquisition activity in 2021, plus a partial contribution from a large volume of first quarter acquisitions. Interest expense increased by $2.2 million from the year-ago quarter, primarily reflecting borrowings we made during 2021 to support growth in our real estate portfolio, partially offset by a lower overall cost of debt. And Sherry mentioned it in her remarks, I think, in a really nice way, where she talked about the fact that we feel we're in a good place as it relates to capital needs this year, with 2/3 of our equity available or raised through our dispositions and our ATM, also the distribution we're expecting and also 85% of our debt. And I think what's happened recently is that you've seen some of the money that is really reliant on asset-based financing, has had to take somewhat -- a little bit of a pause or a sideline because they've seen -- we've seen the debt costs arise so substantially and cap rates were compressing. So -- and it's kind of neat that we have this business model that really helps us control our destiny on the spread side, because we're out there knocking on doors and asking further rate and aligning with customers as in the current market and the current environment."
