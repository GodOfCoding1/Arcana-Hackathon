    "content": " We have made progress in the FDA reviews of both of our NDAs, announced the agreement to acquire Sunosi and continue to advance the rest of our rich late-stage pipeline, which includes AXS-05 in Alzheimer's disease agitation, AXS-12 in narcolepsy and AXS-14 in fibromyalgia. Between a pending FDA action on our NDA for AXS-05 in depression and the expected closing of our acquisition of Sunosi, Axsome is poised to potentially make two important new medicines available to patients living with serious CNS disorders in the coming months. We believe that our current cash balance, along with the remaining committed capital from the $300 million term loan facility is sufficient to fund anticipated operations into 2024 based on our current operating plan, which includes the potential launch of AXS-05 in MDD and the acquisition and commercialization of Sunosi. Can you give us some more metrics in terms of how you're thinking about the sales organization as you go into launch several products here in terms of some of the metrics around the size of the Sunosi and dedicated for us and 05 and 07 dedicated sales forces, how they're kind of interact... We plan to target at least 85% of high-value prescribers, which is more than 25,000 HCPs."
