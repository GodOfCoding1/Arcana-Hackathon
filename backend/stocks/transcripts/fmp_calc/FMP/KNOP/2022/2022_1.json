    "content": " We're also in discussions as to several further charter opportunities, and we believe we've seen a noticeable upturn in market activity in Brazil in this first quarter of 2022. And to round up this slide with some important metrics at March 31, 2022, we had $594 million of remaining contracted forward revenue excluding options, and $96.3 million in the available liquidity, which included cash and cash equivalents of $41.3 million, and we've got no debt maturities until the third quarter of 2023. On slide 4, in the first quarter of 2022, whilst we generated good numbers across scheduled operations, our revenue, operating income and adjusted EBITDA were all predicatively affected by the off-hire incurred due to the vessel drydocks that were taking place. Finally, as over half of our net debt is effectively fixed rate, principally through the use of interest rate swaps, the mark-to-market non-cash valuation of those swaps, that is a major part of our realized and unrealized gain loss on derivative instruments in our income statement has shown a significant gain in the first quarter of 2022, reflecting upward market sentiment for US dollar interest rates going forward. As many of the changes here were explained previously on slide 3, I won't say too much more other than at the end of the first quarter, we had remaining forward contracted revenue of $594 million, excluding options, average remaining firm charters remaining at 1.8 years, and charters had options to extend these charters by a further 2.4 years on average."
