    "content": " And although in the second quarter we announced the redelivery of the Hilda Knutsen, we can confirm that the partnership sponsored Knutsen NYK in similar fashion to the Bodil Knutsen arrangement, have agreed to time charter the vessel for a 90 day period plus three further 30 day option periods, albeit at a reduced charter rate but to help support the Partnership\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cash flow in the short term. And I think, the outlook for us hasn't changed in terms of what we've been saying for several quarters now that the impact will depend on the signing of new charters at good rates, and that's what we were doing yesterday, it's what we're doing today and it's what we will be doing tomorrow. And I think that's really, as you've said, you've pointed out the North Sea vessels that we've got there, and that's exactly why we're looking at every angle, including the conventional market, to the maximum extent we can to make sure that we can not only get through this but also look after the long term interest of the unitholders and get us back to a sustainable place. Anyhow, I'm happy as a shareholders for many, many years now that we're going to in the near future do some more dropdowns with conditions as they are until we get good contracts for our vessels, because it's obvious you do not want to operate in the spot market even though rates are high."
