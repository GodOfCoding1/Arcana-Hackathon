    "content": " In addition, during the fourth quarter or since three of our vessels, the Windsor Knutsen, the Torill Knutsen and the Ingrid Knutsen, have operated for at least some time in the spot market, either performing conventional tanker voyages or offshore loading voyages, and each has been able to generate a positive contribution from those activities. I guess, it's less interesting from a standpoint of moving forward you are going to have all the ones that worked in the voyage or spot market in the fourth and first quarter to-date will be moving on to charters with Knutsen NYK."
