    "content": " IDACORP\u00e2\u0080\u0099s third quarter 2022 earnings per diluted share were $2.10, an increase of $0.17 per share from last year\u00e2\u0080\u0099s third quarter, reflecting the impacts of customer growth, weather, a midyear regulatory order, all partially offset by higher costs. As you can see on Slide 5, Idaho Power\u00e2\u0080\u0099s year-over-year customer growth was 2.5% for the 12 months ending September 30, and we believe our outstanding power reliability, affordable prices and commitment to customer satisfaction continue to help attract customers to Southern Idaho and Eastern Oregon. Further down, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll see a $10.6 million increase in operating income from the change in net per megawatt hour revenue, the Idaho regulatory order for the Jim Bridger Plant, which increased retail rates on June 1 led to much of that increase. The $1.8 million increase in depreciation expense further down the table reflects higher plant in service compared with the same period in 2021 as well as the accelerated depreciation of the coal-related assets at the Jim Bridger plant, which began on June 1 of this year. Three items that led to higher net power supply expenses in the third quarter were higher and more volatile wholesale energy market prices in the Western U.S., higher energy usage by our customers and below average generation from Idaho Power\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lower cost hydroelectric facilities due to low water conditions. Finally, at IDACORP, an increase in net income of $2.2 million was primarily due to changes in tax basis adjustments between the periods at our subsidiary IDACORP Financial Services, which was a comparative negative in last year\u00e2\u0080\u0099s third quarter."
