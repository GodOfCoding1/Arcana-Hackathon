    "content": " I think as we've -- if we stay just with AlloSure Kidney or with AlloMap, I think we have really strong margins greater than 75%, we've operating margins in the 20 high range there as well as we had previously talked about when we're at scale. As you know we've established this multimodal approach firstly with heart and we're the only company with multimodal approval and that's sort of demonstrating the increased clinical utility and I think that we starting down the hot side as we look at Kidney has been not just adding AlloMap kidney, but also looking at iBox, literally call this combination multimodality, which is something we're excited about. Yeh, I think that when you talk about the recent data, you're talking, I don't think we've the -- that will cover ATC we've published on the kidney side the ADMIRAL data and we talked about the cable data, which is our long-term data on the kidney side and onshore what we just recently talked about was the long-term data for sure in both these long-term study showed the increased outcome of survival versus those using unit statistics. So, I think for us, I think, particularly if we take firstly, the hot side, what we've seen is I think Ankur may have alluded to it and also myself is, we have AlloMap on the international guidelines and we were just ISHLT last week and I think with the data we are generating and reducing working with obviously extensive centers in KLOs, there is consideration now AlloSure for example to underwrite. I think it's easy to just focus on one successful offering, two successful offerings, three successful offerings but in terms of -- if you look at AlloSure, AlloMap, and HeartCare but for us as a company, it's really important to sustain ourselves but continue to drive a pipeline one that's building innovation."
