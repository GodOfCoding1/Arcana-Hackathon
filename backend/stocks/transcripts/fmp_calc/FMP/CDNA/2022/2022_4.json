    "content": " Our solid cash performance was driven by improved cash collections infrastructure that we invested in significantly during 2022, which led to record collections for testing services in Q4 at 110% of our testing service revenues. For the fourth quarter, we achieved our highest ever cash collections at 110% of revenues for testing services, representing approximately 10% year-over-year increase and demonstrating strong operational progress on this initiative. That said, transplant volumes in Q4 2022 only grew 2% sequentially and this downward sequential trend has continued into Q1 2023, with current quarterly data for the first 7 weeks showing a negative or minus 3% sequential decline with decreases across all organs, including kidney, heart and lung. In Q4, we recorded total revenues of $82.4 million, up 4% year-over-year and as compared to last quarter. In Q4, product revenues increased 11% year-over-year to $8.6 million, while increasing 19% as compared to last quarter and Digital and Patient Solutions revenue increased 190% year-over-year to $8.4 million, driven primarily by our acquisition of the transplant pharmacy last year and up 13% as compared to last quarter. It should be noted that market growth is still in early stages of recovery post COVID and have been uncertain as seen in the current Q1 2023 quarter-to-date data that shows sequential declines in transplant volumes across kidney, heart and lung. And I think what we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve signaled is that we expect the cash collections to exceed the testing services revenues as we now play a bit of catch-up with, for example, some of the delayed processes and collections of past such as Medicare Advantage and also as we also add more commercial pay coverage on a regional basis."
