    "content": " Regarding Q3 results, overall revenue for the quarter was up 5% year-over-year, and down slightly sequentially to $79.4 million, primarily driven by testing services, with lower market growth than we projected. For example, using 2021 volume numbers, we would have collected over $100 million of incremental adjusted EBITDA if our current commercial tests enjoyed the same broad coverage as AlloMap Heart, the gold standard at about 70%. But I just want to get across again, kind of the notion is, you need coverage and collections talking about this ASPs has been a bit of a red herring, because you're talking about there has been no price, they would actually look at the slides were presented as well, over the last seven quarters. Now, when I start to look back the last three quarters where we had seen the transplant volume to recover from a high single digit declines since the third quarter of 2021, to a mid single digit growth in the last quarter, that growth of 4% actually came in at the low end of our expectations. And I think, there's still more education that has to be done in the community side about usage of AlloSure and other donor-derived cell free DNA and its utility, I think it's important not to just try to put something out, but to provide the right education supported by strong clinical data with multicenter prospective studies, and transplant specific tests."
