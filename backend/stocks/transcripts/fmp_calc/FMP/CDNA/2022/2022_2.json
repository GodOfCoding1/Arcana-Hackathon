    "content": " For the quarter, we saw solid sequential growth in all organs, particularly encouraging is the continued strong uptake of our AlloSure Lung, where the volumes grew to over 1,400 tests for the quarter and greater than 95% attach rate for AlloSure Heart. This change in midpoint from $340 million to $330 million is primarily driven by revised ASP assumptions due to higher mix of commercial patients, including growth in our AlloSure Lung test and shift of Medicare to Medicare Advantage patients."
