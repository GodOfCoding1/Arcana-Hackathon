    "content": " This includes delivering on our advanced EU data privacy requirements, Ray BAUM\u00e2\u0080\u0099S Act compliance, browser support for Firefox, enablement of GSP partners like Vodafone and Charter, the introduction of device-as-a-service, new unique integrations for RingCentral Contact Center, a revamped resource center, 60-plus new integrations into key third-party tools to simplify customer workflows, and expansion to additional digital customer engagement channels like LinkedIn for example. This includes: one, evolving our partnerships to improve overall economics for all parties; two, reducing support functions in sales while investing in front line sales capacity; three, lowering upfront commissions costs across our partners and direct sellers while also allowing top performers to earn more; and four, continuing to be disciplined on marketing spend, which thus far has yielded better leads, with improved conversion rates, and at a lower cost. Our non-GAAP operating margin of 14% set another quarterly record and was up over 300 basis points year-over-year, driven by efficiencies generated across the business, most notably in sales and marketing. And in terms of your question around the cuts we made and whether that is one of the factors in the guide, what I would say there is the actions we took, and I think we covered this partly in last quarter as well, but I think it's worth reiterating, they were really around being more productive and improving the productivity of our sales motion, and we didn't make any cuts to sort of front-line sales, and I think that's a really important point."
