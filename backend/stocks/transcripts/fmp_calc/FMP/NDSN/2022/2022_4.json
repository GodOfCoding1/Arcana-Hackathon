    "content": " Also a company record, adjusted operating profit was $707 million or 27% of sales, which reflects a 15% increase over the prior year, or on a constant currency basis growth of 21%. Adjusted diluted earnings per share were $9.43, a 22% increase from the prior year, and EBITDA for the full year increased to $807 million or 31% of sales. Operating profit for the quarter was $110 million or 31% of sales, which is an increase of 8% compared to the prior year operating profit of $103 million. Fourth quarter operating profit was $52 million or 29% of sales, which is an increase of 2% compared to the prior year operating profit of $51 million. Turning to Slide 9, we will see advanced technology solution sales of $147 million increased 21% compared to the prior year\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fourth quarter. Yes Mike, so the reference there is to our MFS segment, which saw--you know, in the quarter had nice 15% growth and the operating profit grew, but it was negatively impacted, I would tell you, by approximately probably $5 million due to some manufacturing inefficiencies. To your point, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re carrying into Q1, so part of the first half growth, organic growth of 4% to 5%, you can probably think about that as roughly split - half would be pricing given the timing of price realization last year, and half of that would be volume. As the cost pressures and inflation change throughout the year, we will be responsive, and again we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re targeting and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been successful in maintaining incremental operating profit margins of 40% to 45% on the organic growth - we delivered that in Q3 at 43, we delivered that for the full year at 55%, which was actually ahead of our target, so that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s how we think about it and, to your point, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll continue to manage that."
