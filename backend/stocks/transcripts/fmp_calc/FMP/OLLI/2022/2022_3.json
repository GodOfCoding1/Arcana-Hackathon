    "content": " Inventories increased 11% to $524 million in the quarter compared with $472 million a year ago, primarily due to the increased number of stores, the timing of merchandise receipts and higher supply chain costs. Full-year gross margin of approximately 36.1% to 36.2%, operating income of $129.5 million to $133.5 million, adjusted net income of $98.8 million to $101.8 million and adjusted earnings per share of $1.57 to $1.62, both of which exclude excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. I don't think we're going to see -- I'd love to see a 40% then if I can get it, I'm going to get it and deliver it, but I'm probably closer to let's call it a 39% right now with regards to full-year 2023. Your line is open. So it's the implied margin guide that we're given is really related to the $17 million, $18 million of lower sales volume for the quarter. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. But I'm kind of curious how you think about the promotional environment that you'll be playing in \u00e2\u0080\u009823 versus what you're playing in today and how you think about the sales gross margin trade-off just from a high-level perspective, I guess, implicit in that 39% gross margin, you've got to have some sort of comp assumption."
