    "content": " Additionally, in the first quarter, we generated approximately $20 million of life insurance sales down 13% compared with the first quarter of 2021. First, the prescribed 20 year treasury yield mean reversion point for statutory calculations was reduced from 3.25% to 3%, resulting in a $250 million to $300 million unfavorable impact in the quarter. First quarter adjusted earnings excluding the impact from notable items were $315 million, which compares with adjusted earnings on the same basis of $416 million in the fourth quarter of 2021 and $428 million in the first quarter of 2021. While net investment income was lower sequentially, the first quarter was approximately $115 million above quarterly run rate expectations, primarily due to a 5.4% alternative investment yield. The underwriting margin was lower sequentially and was lower than our quarterly run rate expectation by $100 million to $120 million on an after-tax basis, which included $58 million of pretax net claims related to COVID-19. We believe the go-forward market impact, along with expenses returning to our quarterly run rate expectation will lower adjusted earnings by approximately $40 million compared with adjusted earnings less notable items in the first quarter. I think in the past, you've talked about taking up to roughly $500 million of first dollar risk, but it doesn't sound like this was used during the quarter. And if I could just sneak in, in your $40 million reduction of quarterly earnings guide, you called out a lower separate account balances and return to expense run rates."
