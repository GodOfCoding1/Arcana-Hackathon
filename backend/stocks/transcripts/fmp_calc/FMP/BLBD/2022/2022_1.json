    "content": " As we discussed during our last earnings call, the first half of this year's production is primarily comprised of units that should have been produced in fiscal year 2021, if we had access to the volume of components needed to support our production demand. This was 106 units less than the fiscal year 2021, but only $1 million less in revenue due to an increase in our average selling price by $4,000 and stronger parts sales. Our adjusted EBITDA was $4 million, $2 million less than the first quarter of 2021, and our adjusted free cash flow was negative $34 million, driven by high levels of raw and work-in-process inventory caused by supply chain disruptions. In fact, our average bus revenue per unit increased from 94,000 to 98,000, which was largely the result of a higher mix of alternative power buses, 56% of bookings versus 46% last year due to the outstanding success of the new 7.3-liter engine in our gasoline and propane units. Parts revenue for the quarter was $17 million, representing an improvement of $4 million compared to the prior year first quarter. In the first quarter of fiscal 2022, adjusted net income was negative $2 million or $2 million lower than last year. Starting on the left at $5.8 million, lower bus volume in the period of 1,149 units, down 106 units, was offset by higher parts volume of 1.9, resulting in a $0.2 million favorable impact. Additionally, in the other category, our joint venture results from Micro Bird were close to $1 million lower versus the prior year, but they have been also affected by supply chain shortages, predominantly the microchip shortage, which is impacting the chassis allocation from Ford and GM."
