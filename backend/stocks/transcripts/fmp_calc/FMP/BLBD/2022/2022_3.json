    "content": " Blue Bird has it's relative historical market share of that backlog with 6,300 units with $700 million and 63% of that being an alternative to diesel. Consolidated net revenue of $206 million was $9 million higher than prior year of that bus net revenue was $187 million, up by $5 million versus prior year. Our average bus revenue per unit increased from $90,000 to $108,000 which was largely the result of pricing actions taken over the past 10 months as well as the higher mix of electric buses - 3.5% versus 1.5%. Operating efficiencies however, deteriorated by $4 million from last year, driven by higher freight costs approximately $500 more per bus and supply disruptions and parts shortages generating rework in the plan. In summary, the fundamentals of our industry are strong demand is robust and Blue Bird's backlog of $700 million and 6,300 units this proof of this. Can you just talk about -- I mean, everyone is aware of what's going on in the market, but I would think it's still heavy lifting to some extent to go back and try to get some repricing of buses that are still in backlog, especially in light of the fact that, as you said, some of these customers have been waiting for a very extended period of time to get buses. As you heard during our prepared remarks, demand for buses remains incredibly strong with a backlog of 6,300 units or $700 million."
