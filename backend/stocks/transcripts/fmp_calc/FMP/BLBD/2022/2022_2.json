    "content": " But producing those buses came at a high cost due to increasing material costs, rapidly rising freight costs and production inefficiencies due to the part shortages as well as being compounded by buses priced in the first half of the calendar year '21, but built nearly a year later. Our adjusted EBITDA was negative $11 million, $18 million less than the second quarter of fiscal year '21, and our adjusted free cash flow was positive $22 million, $23 million better than the prior year. In late April, the EPA announced the details surrounding the release of the first $500 million of the $5 billion clean school bus rebate program, which is part of the infrastructure spending bill. In the second quarter of fiscal '22, adjusted net income was negative $10 million or $12 million lower than last year. Starting on the left with $7.5 million, higher bus volume in the period of additional 442 units and higher parts margin of $2.6 million resulted in a $6.5 million favorable impact. Plant efficiencies deteriorated by 9.7 million from last year, driven by higher freight costs, approximately $1,000 more per bus and supply disruptions and part shortages. So looking at the entire picture, our underlying operating performance would have yielded approximately $25 million of adjusted EBITDA on 3,000 units with price cost get closed and with smooth supply chain and operations performance."
