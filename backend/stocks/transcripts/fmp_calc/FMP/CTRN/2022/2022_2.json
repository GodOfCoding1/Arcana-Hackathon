If you have not received a copy of the release, it's available on the company's website under the Investor Relations section at www.cititrends.com. Before I provide an overview of our second quarter performance and the strategic direction we are taking the business in the near-term as a result of the current challenging macro environment, it's important that we provide you with a high-level view of our customer base. To begin, let me be fully transparent, our customers are facing one of the most challenging economic environments in history, inflationary pressures across their household necessities, including rent, utilities, food and gas are outpacing their wage growth. Our lowest income household bracket those with an annual household income of $25,000 and below, accounting for approximately 50% of our customer base have been hardest hit from these extreme macro pressures. Even though tough times persist, what's most important to share is that our customers believe that our store experience is more engaging than ever, and our city crew delivers on our purpose each and every day by welcoming their existing and new customers, like a friend, helping them show up for whatever comes their way. With this backdrop acknowledged, what we are clearly seeing is a decline in the number of discretionary shopping visits. But when they do visit Citi Trends stores, our conversion rates are extremely strong and have been consistent week to week since the beginning of the year, plus our average basket size is holding up nicely compared to last year's record stimulus aided spending levels. Given these trends, we are confident that our customers remain loyal to the Citi Trends brand and our assortments for the entire family continue to resonate. Hard at work, they have identified opportunities to capture more market share, particularly in our ladies and footwear cities by adapting to changing consumer trends. Additionally, we continue to play offense by introducing new or expanded assortments that I had mentioned previously, including the continued rollout of our Q line, adding more everyday essentials to the mix, building a ladies missy size and assortment and capitalizing on the strength of our casual men's business. On the expense side, our number one priority is to lower our SG&A expenses to align with the lower sales expectations. As the second quarter unfolded, we couldn't adjust expenses overnight, but we aggressively created a plan and have already taken action to rightsize our expense structure and build efficiencies across our business functions, assuming a lower sales base brought on by primarily macro conditions. Let me assure you, we are taking swift and aggressive actions on approximately $10 million in expense savings for the second half of 2022 or about 7% of total SG&A expense, including a 10% staff reduction. Overall, we are controlling what we can control, and we are on track to significantly reduce SG&A deleverage versus both 2021 and 2019 during the second half. Before I turn it over to Heather, I want to highlight a few metrics about our business during the second quarter and year-to-date. We ended the quarter with no debt, $28 million in cash and $103 million in liquidity. With that, I'll turn the call over to Heather, our new CFO, who I am extremely pleased to have a member of our leadership team. And as you can imagine, it's been a busy and productive two months since I joined in late June. I've been immersed in getting to know the business, meeting our corporate, stores and distribution center teams, as well as our customers. I have quickly gained great admiration for the Citi Trends business model with its unique value proposition, servicing the apparel, accessories and home needs of African-American and Latina family and its deep commitment to making a difference in the neighborhoods we serve. I'm excited to take on the CFO role and will leverage my background and experience in retail to identify opportunities to further transform the business model as, I believe the potential for growth remains significant. As David mentioned, the macro environment remained difficult throughout the quarter with persisting headwinds from extreme inflationary pressures impacting all of our customers, but most notably our lowest household income cohort. Importantly, our teams have remained nimble and focused delivering strong margin in the quarter and working tirelessly to right-size our expense base. Our balance sheet is healthy and we ended the quarter with ample cash, well-managed inventory and our $75 million revolving line of credit remains unused. In addition, as mentioned in our earnings release, we expect to close a sale leaseback transaction in our Roland, Oklahoma distribution center in September adding $36 million of cash to our balance sheet all of which positions us well to continue to navigate this dynamic operating environment, while remaining focused on our strategic initiatives. As mentioned in our earnings release, we are comparing select operating results for the second quarter and first half of 2022 and relative to the same periods in 2019, in order to provide a more normalized comparison of performance. Total sales for the second quarter were $185 million, a decrease of 22% versus Q2 '21 or an increase of 1% versus Q2, 2019. Comparable sales decreased 25% compared to last year, lapping a 26% increase in Q2, 2021 versus Q2, 2019, representing a three-year staff of 1%. Sales in the quarter were approximately 90% of first quarter 2022 sales, consistent with pre-pandemic historical results. Importantly, as David mentioned, our year-to-date average basket size contracted only 5% compared to the first half of 2021, a period impacted by unprecedented government stimulus assistance. Gross margin was 38.1% in the quarter compared to 40.8% in Q2, 2021 and 37.3% in Q2 2019. With regard to the supply chain environment, we have successfully navigated inbound and outbound freight headwinds, resulting in substantial cost mitigation, with only a 20 basis point increase in Q2 2022 versus Q2 2021. While SG&A expense dollars declined 9.2% versus Q2 2021, the softer top line resulted in outsized pressure on our SG&A rate. As David noted, the management team has been working to aggressively lower our expenses aligned to our revised sales expectations and we look forward to reducing SG&A deleverage versus last year by more than 50% for the second half of the year. And finally, 2022 diluted loss per share was $0.31 compared to diluted earnings per share of $0.03 in Q2 2019 or $0.06 on an adjusted basis. Total sales for the first half were $393.2 million, a decrease of 25% to prior year and a 1% increase to 2019. Comparable sales declined by 27% versus 2021, on top of a 30% increase in 2021 sales versus 2019, a three-year stack of 3%. EBITDA in the first half of 2022, adjusted for the gain on the sale of a distribution center, was $12.1 million versus $65.1 million in 2021 and versus $19.6 million in 2019, as adjusted. Year-to-date, earnings per diluted share of $3.34, $0.12 as adjusted for the first quarter sale-leaseback transaction, compared to $4.63 in the first half of 2021 and $0.68 in 2019 or $0.76, as adjusted. Excluding packaway goods, inventory increased 8% versus Q2 2021 and decreased 4% versus Q2 2019. Average in-store inventory increased only 3% in dollars versus last year, a decrease of 4% in units. Average in-store inventory decreased 13% in dollars versus Q2 2019, a 26% decrease in units. As it relates to our buyback program, year-to-date, we repurchased approximately 331,000 shares at an aggregate cost of $10 million, leaving approximately $50 million remaining on a program. Capital allocation remains a primary focus of our Board of Directors and in light of the dynamic macro environment, we are carefully evaluating our cash and investments to ensure we maintain adequate liquidity. In light of the challenging macro backdrop, we have revised our outlook for the year and have pivoted quickly to managing and aligning our expense structure to a more normalized sales environment based on predictable historic trends. For the full year, this represents an 8% to 10% decline from the midpoint of previous guidance of $870 million. Finally, as David mentioned, we are prudently reducing our capital expenditures by approximately $10 million to ensure we have additional liquidity to chase opportunities as they arise, resulting in 2022 capital expenditures of approximately $22 million for the year. With these factors, we expect second half operating income to be approximately in line with the results from the second half of 2019. Year-end cash balance is expected to be approximately $85 million to $100 million, including the proceeds from the Roland sale-leaseback transaction. In summary, Q2 proved to be a challenging quarter with meaningful inflationary headwinds impacting our customers' discretionary spending. As we expect this uncertain selling environment to persist through the balance of the year, we will continue to aggressively and diligently manage inventory, control expenses, and fortress the balance sheet. Regarding the topline, I can assure you that we are getting better every day and delivering the right trends at the right value across our 617 stores. As we have seen across our 76-year history, it shows us time and time again that when macro challenges subside, our customers return to Citi Trends. Citi Trends customer is local, loyal and resilient, and we will remain dedicated to our neighborhood to serve the entire family for their apparel, home and accessories needs in both tough times and good times, all anchored by our Citi life purpose to live bold, live proud and respect all. As the rest of the year unfolds, we are in the process of deploying our Citi reimagination plan across our BUY and Move, sell and support functions by being hyper focused on areas we have consistently acted on and shared with you. They are as follows; number one, our products, continuing to broaden the appeal of Citi Trends to new multicultural lower-income households in search of trend-right apparel, home and accessories at prices that don't break the bank. Number two; our fleet, continuing to upgrade our customer experience via our CTx remodel program and by providing better tools to our store management teams to increase sales productivity. Number three; our infrastructure, including important investments in our BUY and MOVE functions that will contribute to a smarter, faster and data-centric customer and associate solution. Number four; our balance sheet, along the strength of Citi Trends, our focus is on the here and now and applying fresh and innovative thinking to managing OpEx, working capital and cash usage. Whether it's paying out our customers lay away when they are a bit short or pitching in for families in need during these tough times, we will ensure we never loose our focus in supporting our customers and associates in the neighborhoods in which they have. We continue to believe there is significant wide space to expand the Citi Trends brand, and we look forward to reestablishing growth once the operating environment fully normalizes. As always, I want to thank the entire Citi Trends team, all the women and men that are the face of our brand, creators of our culture and drivers of our customer engagement and their hard work and endless efforts in making a difference in the neighborhood we serve never goes unnoticed. Please proceed with your question. And I know that there's remodels happening to the CTX format, et cetera. But with your CapEx budget getting cut to $22 million, wanted to get a sense for the remainder of the year openings. As you're aware, we have trimmed our store growth assumptions from the beginning of the year to be a bit more prudent in this environment and also to be able to continue to open successful new stores. As we look at the rest of the year, we are going to slow our growth a bit here. We've had some difficulty in, I'll call it, the supply chain of new stores, largely driven by landlord and billing delays, things outside of our control, which has pushed some stores later. We have tons of great stores in the pipeline for 2023, and we're in the midst, as you can imagine, of working through our here and now plans so that we can deliver the second half as indicated in the call today. And then in terms of the change to sales guidance and I think when we compare versus 2019 now, the picture becomes a little clear that we've just reverted to similar levels. But I did want to get a sense in terms of your more recent trends kind of the cadence of sales over the last couple of months and here in the first month of Q3, have you seen any improvement, or is this just kind of stabilized at a lower level than you had expected. With regards to the year-to-date trends, as we mentioned in one of our comments in the call, absolute transactions and our convergence have been extraordinarily consistent. And so, we believe, as you heard in the call, this idea of having a loyal resilient customer and those that have the means to come back on a regular basis and shop relatively frequently, which is a hallmark of the brand has definitely been the case. We're just seeing an absolute lower level of footsteps in the door given the pressures on the -- in particular, the low-income bracket of our total target audience. As we look at the second half, we have definitely chosen after a lot of rigor and analysis as best we can and as you know, it's hard to predict through these times. We've sort of indicated, as you could tell on the guide that it's going to kind of maintain that stable level. But we've got a little bit of improvement built in there, which we think is prudent given what we're seeing in a little bit of early Q3 read. But overall, it's a stable trend as supported by strong conversion, strong basket, strong UPT  all the right metrics, selling the right levels of performance, but it's just that with that pressure on-track number of people coming in the door. But in terms of the sale-leaseback transaction, when taken in combination with what was done with the first DC, clearly, you guys you're going to have very strong cash balance by the end of the year. On an annualized basis, Jeremy, the rent expense for the two distribution center leases, is just shy of $8 million. You can think about it as a 1% on an SG&A rate basis, assuming $800 million of sales. And so, does that imply then the total \u00e2\u0080\u0093 so in terms of the expense cuts that you've had, I don't know how much of that's coming out of the stores versus the DC versus corporate. But I think that would imply that actually your levels are lower, your staffing levels are lower than 2019, given the $8 million increase in your rent expense. It's \u00e2\u0080\u0093 there is, I would call it, consistent with 2019 from a headcount perspective. There is \u00e2\u0080\u0093 if you think about stores and DCs, we've been dealing with wage rate increases overtime. There's -- the headcount changes, like David mentioned, that we're into everything from what do we spend on pen and paper to how do we improve -- further improve productivity in DCs and the stores. Well, best wishes on the second half of the year and definitely been dealt a tough hand. Please proceed with your question. However, there has been a slight skew towards more of the essential centric basket amongst the lower income cohort, e.g., they are picking up more of what's in our expanded Q line, think soaps and lotions and HBA and even some things like batteries and such. So we're seeing a slight skew in their basket, which makes sense to us, especially as we've grown that business and sought to create a bit more of a one-stop local neighborhood store where you can get far more than apparel. And then, I would say that, the higher income cohort is -- and we'll frame that as sort of the 40 to 50 carriers . And that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s as you know, from the last couple of years, be driven by, in most cases, changes in our quality trend, features and benefits, embellishments and so forth and thereby enabling us to capture a bit higher AUR. So it's almost like there's two ends of the spectrum, the lower income cohort, enjoying some of the very new assortment enhancements that we've been making over the last year and then the higher income cohort loving what trends we're putting down. Our guy, as I mentioned, the strength of our men's casual business is -- he's just locking with us, and we're enjoying his loyalty and a pretty big increase in his dedication and devotion from his wallet to us. The good news is, well over 60% of our unit mix is well under $10 in our store. So we have never, through these last two-and-a-half interesting and different years than we could have predicted really wavered from being extreme value. So, that's great to see that our merchants are maintaining a strict adherence to the value equation, especially during these tough times. And then on the category mix front, it's been really nice to watch the box present a slightly different look from a category mix standpoint. It's creating incremental sales in the box, offsetting some softness throughout the rest of the box. We're seeing a distinct set of indicators as we continue to test and roll our more, I'll call it, multicultural positioning out to the marketplace. In fact, we're playing offense in that area, and we're appealing to more and more multicultural customers within our current fleet that's been around for a while and also within new stores built in the last two to three years. And like during the call, we're playing offense despite a lower sales expectation, we're fortunate enough to be able to have a liquidity and a great team to chase the right trends. And then I'll give a nod to what I said during the call of doing better in footwear and ladies, we think we have distinct opportunities to expand our footwear usage occasions that we kind of paused a bit during the pandemic years, and we're ready to roar back into some usage occasions that we have not been a part of, so to speak. And then on the ladies front, it's really been a master class in catching up with and responding to the most current trends. example, where to work and a slight change we're seeing in kind of the casualization of apparel that's different from what we saw during the pandemic year. So, all that's in motion, and we're seeing really good traction. And then CTX, I know that's been a big topic in the performance of those stores have outperformed others. I'll take the CTX question, and then I'll turn it over to Heather for SG&A and inventory. But quickly on CTX, we are so pleased with the results that we've seen year-to-date. So, no real differences even despite continued macro pressures, these stores that we've completed a Rockin Roland, we couldn't be more pleased with how they present the brand, how our associates get so excited about showing up to work every day to serve a host of new and existing customers who continue to say, what do you do with my old City Trends, but I love the new ones. So we're seeing and hearing just great feedback, and we're going to do a handful more this year because of the strong performance we've seen year-to-date. So as we mentioned, yeah, we have $10 million of cost reductions in the second half of the year. So we are working hard, diligently aggressively, can't pepper enough words in here to capture the other $6 million. And it's been identified where we're going to find those savings, just going after it and banking it in the P&L. There are some one-time items that will reset in 2023, but we are firmly dedicated in making sure that we continue to lever SG&A into the New Year. Please proceed with your question. And as you think about those pressures that you highlighted, do you feel like that the plan is getting passed from higher gas prices to now higher utility prices and food. You had probably recall in the last earnings call, we talked about speaking to our customers and associates in a couple of informal focus groups and what we heard then was gas by far was the biggest concern followed by rent, utilities and actually food was in kind of fourth place. And the good news is we saw a pretty good, at least qualitative correlation in terms of, \"Oh, gosh, what a release, gas prices coming down in some of our midsized markets, where we do a lot of volume and where we saw it kind of or hurt, I should say, in most of the -- these gas prices are just really hurting us. So quickly on that point, when the gas prices came down, we did feel both relief based on talking to customers and associates and there's a lot going on, when they were coming down because it's sort of during back-to-school and some paydays steps. But overall, we did see some interesting sales response and traffic response to or during the time period of gas prices coming down, I think we're cautiously optimistic that, that could be a nice little tailwind provided they stay down. If maybe, it was even gone up a little bit in our neighborhoods in the grocery stores they shop in, which is typically are passing on price aggressively to the consumer. I think across the country, roughly 50% more days than last year. So as we've looked at our cut three cohorts of back-to-school time period, grouping early back-to-school mid, late is how we call them. We've seen some early and mid tax free holidays produced some nice gains as compared to 2019 and help the 2021 high, so to speak. And then my last question just firstly, how you arrived at the back half \u00e2\u0080\u0093 it looks like you're sort of extrapolating the three-year geo stacks from the second quarter of roughly down 5.6 into the back half of the year. It is how we got there, Chuck, maybe mixed with the dose of what has been our traditional quarter-to-quarter builds or debuilds prior to the pandemic that -- kind of few bunch of datapoints into the blender and got to the relationship that I'm sure you're kind of back into in terms of absolute volume compared to two, compared to one and Q4 as well. But those relationships, we believe, for the rest of this year, given the uncertain environment we're operating will kind of largely hold up, kind of Q2 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 kind of in a more stabilized way about  Q1 volume mapped extraordinarily well to history. Please proceed with your question. I take you back to the beginning of the year highlight that our merchants during the supply chain disruption period of late \u00e2\u0080\u009921 and early \u00e2\u0080\u009922, we're all aware of. So, as Heather commented on, we're possessing some really nice hacker inventory that built during November, December, January and now we're literally starting August, and that'll take place through November, December to deliver back to school, fall on holiday. And that's so germane to our model because what's in that pack-away are really great values and a mix of product that we don't always get our hands on right, given our model, these are kind of opportunistic buys. So that's one part of our process and it's literally coming out of our buildings as we speak, going into our 600 plus stores and we're liking what we're seeing. And then the rest of their days, so to speak are really spent on identifying the right trends that we can get across men's, women's, kids, accessories, home footwear and the like and making sure we latter back to our customer. Meaning, we're including more than our lifeblood African-American communities, and we're adding more and more apparel,  home, et cetera, that appeal to a broader audience, namely Latinx customer that we have, so many in our current communities and neighborhoods and that we're so pleased to serve, but we can serve them better. I would tell you, we're ahead of schedule and we are going after it with full vigor to broaden the appeal of the brand as we buy the good, suitable for now, really two large audiences, African-American and Latinx populations. And as we move forward, we're pretty excited about what we have for the rest of that pool for fall and then holiday and gift giving, roundout the year. How do you balance that looking long term versus short term, as far as cutting into the muscle of the business or -- and sort of -- I'm sure, you've thought about that, but just sort of a deeper dive there, just a little bit. The overall picture, though, John, is definitely a picture of balancing both the individuals that we really need for this business to pick, but also recognizing that we're evolving how we work. So some of what we're going through is a product of, as you've heard us speak about, investing in data and technology, for example, that will make certain functions more efficient and productive. And we'll also have a much better handle on how effective our systems and improvements in infrastructure are and we're nothing but optimistic about those improvements as we've done a couple already this year with huge success, and we're already seeing benefits associated with them that allow us to be more productive. You're absolutely right, we're being cautious."
