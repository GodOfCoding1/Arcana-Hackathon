Revenue from our real estate operations segment in the third quarter of 2022 totaled $6.9 million compared to $892,000 in the third quarter of 2021. Revenue from our leasing operations segment in the third quarter of 2022 totaled $3.1 million, compared to the $5.4 million in the third quarter of 2021. The decrease in revenue and operating income primarily reflect the sale of The Santal in December 2021, partly offset by increased revenue at Lantana Place and Kingwood Place, The Santal had rental revenue of $2.3 million in the third quarter of 2021. Purchases and development of real estate properties included in our operating cash flows, and capital expenditures included in our investing cash flows totaled $57.2 million for the first nine months of 2022, which was primarily related to the development of Barton Creek properties, including The Saint June and Amarra Villas, The Saint George and Magnolia Place."
