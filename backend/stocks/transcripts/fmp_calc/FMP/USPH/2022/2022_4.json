    "content": " Our net rate improved to 104.28 in the 2022, fourth quarter, up sequentially from 105.53 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 I'm sorry, up from 103.53 in the final quarter of 2021, in spite of the Medicare rate change, PTA reimbursement change and the sequester relief phase out in 2022 per contracting and OPS teams have worked hard to overcome some of these headwinds and that hard work is definitely paying off. Our operating results which include the impact of higher interest expense was $0.58 per share in the fourth quarter, and it was $2.70 for the full year of 2022. The revenue from our industrial injury prevention business were $18.9 million in the fourth quarter which was a $5 million, or 37.6% increase over the previous year. Our interest expense increased from $191,000 in the fourth quarter of 2021 to $2.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2022, which was due to an increase in our debt primarily related to acquisitions that we've closed during and since the fourth quarter of last year. In our segment of comprehensive income, you'll note that our swap agreement currently has a mark to market value of $5.4 million, which means the current expectation is that we will pay $5.4 million less in interest expense of the remaining \u00e2\u0080\u0093 the remaining term of our five-year swap agreement that we would have paid without the swap at a variable interest rate. We believe the progress we've made with commercial and other rate wins in 2022 and that we expect to continue to have in 2023 will enable us to offset the headwinds in 2023 related to the 2% Medicare rate reduction that became effective on January 1, as well as the full year impact active the phase out of sequestration relief, which occurred during 2022, which together represent an impact on our revenue in 2023 of approximately 44.3 million."
