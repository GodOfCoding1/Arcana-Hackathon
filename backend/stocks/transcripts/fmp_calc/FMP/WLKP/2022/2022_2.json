    "content": " Westlake OpCo benefited from strong operating performance in the second quarter across all of our ethylene units, which were impaired with favorable third-party ethylene sales margins, drove consolidated net income, including OpCo's up $84 million for the second quarter of 2022. In this morning's press release, we reported Westlake Partners second quarter 2022 net income of $16 million or $0.47 per unit. Second quarter 2022 net income for Westlake Partners decreased by $9 million compared to second quarter of 2021 Partnership net income of $25 million, as the partnership benefited from a buyer deficiency fee of approximately $9 million in the second quarter of 2021 related to outages that occurred last year. When current market ethylene margins are low, the ethylene sales agreement ensures that the Partnership continues to receive a fixed net cash margin of $0.10 per pound, or 95% of its sales providing predictable and consistent cash flows to its unitholders, insulated from the market ethylene price volatility."
