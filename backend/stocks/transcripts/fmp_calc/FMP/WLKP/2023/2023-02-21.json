In this morning's press release, we reported Westlake Partners fourth quarter 2022, net income of $17 million or $0.48 per unit. Fourth quarter 2022 net income for Westlake partners of $17 million decreased by 13 million, compared to the fourth quarter 2021, net income of $30 million. Distributable cash flow of $20 million for the fourth quarter of 2022 increased by $5 million, compared to fourth quarter of 2021, due to distributable cash flow of $15 million, due to lower maintenance capital spending and the timing of certain receivables from Westlake. Despite the headwinds, the net income from weaker third-party sales margins and higher interest rates, our full year 2022 MLP distributable cash flow of $76 million increased by $6 million compared to MLP distributable cash flow of $70 million for the full year of 2021 and our distribution coverage for 2022 was 1.14x.
