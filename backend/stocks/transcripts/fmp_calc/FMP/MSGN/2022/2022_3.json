We're currently having discussions with potential partners, including leading filmmakers and global artists to create content that'll be specifically designed for the MSG Sphere and this does include original attractions, which will be able to run multiple times a day, year round and the attractions will really drive the high utilization of the venue as well as concert residencies, which will help build out our recurring base of events and to create and produce this content, we're close to completing our studio in Burbank, MSG Sphere studios and this is for our creative, production and engineering teams, as well as artists and partners to develop, optimize and preview these unique content experiences that are being developed for Sphere."
