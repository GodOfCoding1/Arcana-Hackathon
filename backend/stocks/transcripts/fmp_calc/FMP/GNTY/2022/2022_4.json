    "content": " Some we look at all-the-time and made some decisions on this quarter that we're not exactly what we had projected as didn't, as I think as many banks though, saw we did see that outflow of deposits and to remain competitive we increased our cost of interest bearing deposits for the quarter more than we had projected that we thought we were going to do prior to the quarter. As Cappy mentioned, our loan demand continued to be strong in the fourth quarter because loans in the pipeline from earlier in 2022 continued to close and fund up during the quarter, but our pipeline is certainly slowing down now, partially because of the higher rates, but also because we're really tapping the brakes on growth as we prepare for a likely downturn in the near future. So non-maturing deposits continue to be a strong part of our overall deposit structure, but we're going to defend our core relationships because a lot of it is just the reality that customers haven't seen any yield in three or four years and they're looking forward. You guys had kind of talked about it, I believe it was the range of, 22 to -- $23 million to $24 million for fee income next quarter, but it sounds like it's going to be a little bit less than that just given some of the market pressures and other things that you mentioned in your prepared remarks. I think it's $209 million (ph) sounds like you could kind of maintain that balance for a while, but would love to appreciate maybe the puts and takes and kind of what's in the budget versus, different options that you could see throughout the year on that. And I think probably a lot of banks as we're really trying to defend our core funding base, really defending asset quality, and trying to defend earnings and from just the different expense structures that have been under pressure the last couple of years and obviously fee income."
