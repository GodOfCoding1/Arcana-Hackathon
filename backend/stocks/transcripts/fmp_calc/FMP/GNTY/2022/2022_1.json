    "content": " And looking at the growth for the quarter ex-PPP and warehouse lending, we had a nice increase of $157 million, that's 8.6% of those loans when you when you take out PPP and warehouse. As Cappy mentioned a moment ago, excluding PPP and warehouse loans, our loans increased about $157 million or 8.6% during the quarter. And so if rates increase as expected, which we estimated as 50 basis points in both May and June, and 25 basis points in each of the remaining fed meetings during 2022, then $346 million or 27% of those variable rate loans will reprice by year end."
