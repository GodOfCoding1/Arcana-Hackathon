    "content": " Then, diving into a little bit of that on the asset side, total loans were up $144 million at 6.8% for the quarter and that's ex-PPP and warehouse lending. Then looking at our deposits, they were up $11 million for the quarter and up $120 million year-to-date, that's 4.5%. Basic earnings per share year-to-date are right at 2.71 -- $2.71 compared to last year's $2.55, again, that is for the first-three quarters or year-to-date. So guidance on our non-interest expense for 2022, we'll probably have a total expenses of $78.5 million that's still within our 2.5% of asset metric, probably going to be about 2.43%, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 9.5% increase over 2021 expenses. And then projecting \u00e2\u0080\u009823, we're looking at anywhere from around $83 million to $84 million which again will be in within our 2.5% of average assets and show about a 7% increase over 2022 expenses. So if rates continue to increase as we expect in the fourth quarter, $354.5 million which is about 15.7% of our total loan portfolio will reprice by year end. So we're like every bank, I'm assuming that's on CECL, we're anticipating significant increases in our reserves just given the factors of going into this slowdown and the velocity of rate increase that we've seen."
