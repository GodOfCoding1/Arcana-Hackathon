    "content": " And you can see our total assets at the end of Q2 were $3.28 billion, that's up $91 million during the quarter and that's up $195 million for the year for the first six months. Our total loans ex-PPP and warehouse were up $140 million for the quarter at 7.1% and a total of $297 million for the year-to-date for the first six months, roughly 16%. So -- and looking then at the income statement or on the earnings, our second quarter earnings were good, as Ty has already alluded to, is $10.8 million, that's $0.90 per basic share and $0.89 per diluted share. But we're -- we think if our loan loans stay flat during the second half of the year, then we'll probably be in good shape compared to some of our peers. And as Cappy mentioned a moment ago, excluding PPP and warehouse loan changes, our loans increased by about $140 million or 7.1% during the quarter. So, we ran a model that says, if rates increase is expected, which we assumed would be 75 basis points in July, 55 basis points -- sorry, 50 basis points in September and 25 basis points in each meeting in November and December, then $453.6 million of those loans will reprice by year-end."
