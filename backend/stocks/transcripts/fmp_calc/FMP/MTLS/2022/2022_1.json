    "content": " We are pleased to report first quarter revenue of almost EUR53 million, up 16% from the first quarter of 2021 and driven by growth in all three segments, in particular, in Materialise Manufacturing. Thanks to the AMWatch software, the data generated during the production phase can be fed to the co-am data lake for constant monitoring and analysis, which brings us in the Check phase, where quality control is done with a variety of tools such as tensile benches, CMM measurements or metallurgical analysis tools and also those generate data; data that needs to be saved and linked to what happens in the manufacturing process. Encouraged by our good results of the first quarter, including the solid order intake of our Manufacturing segment and further encouraged by the continued strong performance of our Materialise collaborators who are currently working in extremely difficult circumstances in both Ukraine and Shanghai, we maintain our guidance for the full year."
