    "content": " In the second quarter of 2022, we recorded \u00e2\u0082\u00ac58.1 million in revenues, representing a growth of almost 15% compared to last year\u00e2\u0080\u0099s period. Also, and importantly, deferred revenue for maintenance and license fees further increased \u00e2\u0082\u00ac3.8 million compared to the end of last year, mainly driven by the strong sales performance in our medical segments. Compared to last year, in our contract manufacturing business, the industrial goods and medical device projects grew 25% while automotive projects remained stable at the low level of 2021. As the entire automotive sector is under immense time pressure to launch new electric passenger cars, the timely shift of focus over ACTech sales teams to electrification has allowed ACTech to gradually return its revenues to normal business levels at sustainable margins. Importantly, deferred revenues from software license and maintenance fees further increased and were up \u00e2\u0082\u00ac3.8 million compared to the end of last year, further, under scoring the strong software sales performance within our Medical segment. And then finally, we also mentioned that we continue investing in other new business lines like eyewear and motion, and also that takes time, but you would not invest in that if you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have an outlook of higher revenue over the next years with also nice margins to realize."
