    "content": " In the third quarter of 2022, we recorded \u00e2\u0082\u00ac58.3 million in revenues, representing a growth of almost 12% compared to last year\u00e2\u0080\u0099s period. Also, deferred revenue from maintenance and license fees further increased \u00e2\u0082\u00ac3.2 million compared to the end of last year, which was driven by strong sales performances of our Medical segment. Our adjusted EBITDA for the quarter amounted to \u00e2\u0082\u00ac5.1 million compared to \u00e2\u0082\u00ac9.7 million last year and was impacted by both our continued investment, in particular, in our CO-AM Software Solutions, but also, by inflation-related higher expenses, in particular, revenue ratio costs. Importantly, deferred revenues from software license and maintenance fees further increased up \u00e2\u0082\u00ac3.2 million compared to the end of last year, further underscoring the strong software sales performance within our Medical segment. In other words, we expect our revenues to increase by at least 10% compared to last year, and we expect to post a full year adjusted EBITDA this year between \u00e2\u0082\u00ac20 million and \u00e2\u0082\u00ac25 million."
