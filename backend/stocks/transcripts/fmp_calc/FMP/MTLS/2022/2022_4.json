    "content": " EBITDA decreased to a negative amount of \u00e2\u0082\u00ac1.441 million that was impacted by the accelerated R&D investments in our new CO-AM business, which in Q4 also include the expenditures of Identify3D, and also by the effect of non-recurrent restructuring expenditures resulting from the consolidation of Materialise and the Link3D and Identify3D development and sales teams and the write-off of capitalized expenditures. Encouraged by our strong sales results in 2022 and building on our continued investments in our existing and new businesses, we believe that in 2023, we will post yet another solid top line growth of more than 10% with revenues totaling between \u00e2\u0082\u00ac255 million and \u00e2\u0082\u00ac260 million. Assuming that inflation stabilizes in 2023, our continued sales growth will gradually result in a stronger adjusted EBITDA, which we currently anticipate will grow by more than 30%, totaling between \u00e2\u0082\u00ac25 million and \u00e2\u0082\u00ac30 million in 2023 with positive contributions from Materialise Medical, Materialise Manufacturing and Materialise Software in that order."
