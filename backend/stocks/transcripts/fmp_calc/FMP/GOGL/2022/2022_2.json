    "content": " Looking into the next quarter, Q4, we have secured $29,000 per day for 25% of our Cape days and $22,000 per day for 27% of our Panamax days. Our derivatives and other financial income, we have seen, impacted our P&L significantly in the last quarters and also this quarter came in with a gain of just below $20 million, which compares to a gain of $32.9 million in Q1. Having a look at our cash breakeven, our CapEx and debt maturities on the next slide, we can see that following the $275 million refinancing last quarter, our next debt maturity falls due in Q3 2024."
