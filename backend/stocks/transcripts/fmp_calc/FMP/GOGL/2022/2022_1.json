    "content": " Looking at this quarter, Q2, we have so far secured $28,000 per day for 78% of our Cape days, $27,000 per day for 77% of our Panamax days. If you look at our cash breakeven for the both segments, you can see that the cash breakeven has increased somewhat due to the increase in reference rate or LIBOR during the quarter, which has impacted the Panamax cash breakeven by approximately $400 per day and the Cape approximately the same within the adjustment for this financing. Looking into the next quarter, we have taken up 15% of our Cape days at $38,500 per day and 33% of our Panamax days close to 35,000 per day."
