    "content": " We delivered net income of $15.4 million in the fourth quarter compared to $35.2 million in the comparable period last year, primarily due to the combined impact of intangible asset impairment, restructuring charges and restructuring-related items as well as additional Fortune Brands Home & Security allocations and onetime separation costs in the fourth quarter of 2022. Net income was $155.4 million compared to $182.6 million in the prior year, primarily due to higher pre-spend corporate allocations from FBHS, separation costs and the full year impact of asset impairments and restructuring charges and restructuring-related items, partially offset by the benefit of higher gross profit, including net cost savings as a stand-alone company and excluding separation costs, restructuring charges and restructuring-related items, asset impairments and defined benefit actuarial gains and losses, adjusted net income increased 30.5% year-over-year to $260.4 million."
