    "content": " We delivered revenues of $10.4 billion at an industry leading growth of 27% plus in constant currency terms, I\u2019d say, crossing $10 billion of revenue is a significant landmark for us, and we are now even higher. We\u2019ve guided for quarter one at 16% to 18% year-on-year growth as guidance, which converts in sequential terms to 1% to 3%. We don\u2019t break it out the engineering spend, engineering-as-a-services revenue of our aggregate, but specifically for this question, it is little over 10% of our revenues and it has had a fabulous year, it has grown in healthy 20s, this year as a growth. So \u2013 and considering now, we are one year in that journey, and obviously supply side challenges have some implication in the near term, but how one should look medium-term margin trajectory for Wipro, because acquisition is also part of growth story for us and integral part of revenue growth whether this 17% to 17.5% is a good range to understand from medium-term perspective or how one should look Wipro\u2019s margin reduction?"
