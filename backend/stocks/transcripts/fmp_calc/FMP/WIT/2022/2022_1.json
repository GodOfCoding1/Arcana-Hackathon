    "content": " And my second question, if I look at the guidance, excluding the impact of Capco and Ampion, growth guidance for the September quarter may likely be in the range of 1% to 3% in constant currency terms. We\u2019ve done better this quarter, 18.8%, but it doesn\u2019t change our \u2013 the way we are seeing our margin profile. First for Thierry, just wanting to \u2013 just wanted to understand here that this year, of course, we\u2019ve been doing great the first quarter growth is \u2013 and the second quarter guidance ensures that we will be able to flow much higher than double-digit growth rate on an organic basis also even if you exclude the capital asset integration. I would have only a point I will add is, Dipesh, while we have had good numbers in terms of profitability for a couple of \u2013 last three quarters or so, from a modeling standpoint, you should continue to model and sort of a single-digit positive margins for that business, which I think is a very good outcome given where it is SRE segment. Kawaljeet, as Thierry respond to that \u2013 and Saurabh respond to that question, I want to just add one point to what I said that even if you take the aggregation of Capco out, we would like to clarify that the sequential growth is ahead of company growth rate on \u2013 without Capco basis in top ten as well as on a Y-o-Y basis, it\u2019s a double-digit number. If we are looking now at the revenue growth performance per sector, 23% BFSI, now, of course, influenced by Capco, but 14% quarter-on-quarter from consumer, 12% quarter-on-quarter from ENU, 12% from communications, those are very strong performance."
