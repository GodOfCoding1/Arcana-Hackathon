    "content": " Earlier today, we reported our third quarter results, as you know, I'm pleased to share that we have delivered: one, another quarter of double-digit revenue growth; second, record order bookings of over $4.3 billion, led by large deals signing of over $1 billion, a margin expansion of 120 basis points, a huge surge in cash conversion and the fourth straight quarter of lower attrition. The second is also that if you look at it from a consolidated Wipro Limited standpoint, there would -- there was a restructuring cost which was sitting in the employee cost line which was not counted towards the segment margins of 15.1% in quarter 2, but it was sitting in consolidated line, which is not present now, so that reduce -- that shows a downward path on the employee cost. And the reason I asked that question is for the past 6 quarters, whatever metric you have disclosed ACV or TCV is up greater than 24% year-on-year, while growth in that period has gone from 25% plus Y-o-Y to a guidance of around 8% at the higher end in the coming quarter. And second is clearly the immediate component, which is it converts into next quarter or in a 2-quarter phenomena, et cetera, you have to appreciate the fact that we have won a very large component of TCV and something that we also covered in Thierry's speech is that a large component of that is in cloud and infrastructure services, which are typically long ended contracts over 4 to 5 years."
