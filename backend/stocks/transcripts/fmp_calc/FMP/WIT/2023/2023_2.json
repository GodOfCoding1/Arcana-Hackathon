    "content": " You could imagine -- I believe actually the banking sector should be holding pretty well and they are -- one, it's a sector that is used to adjust rapidly to market changes, but also it's -- it's an industry where a lot of efforts will have to be done around driving simplification, alignment, streamlining and compliance is also another important topics for banks going forward. Today, the performance -- what's clear is if we look at our own business, the growth we see in Americas and Europe are -- I don't know if the comparison help, but I think they are in the ballpark, they're similar.
