In addition, our Loungefly brand more than doubled to $50 million primarily driven by bag and wallet sales, a rebound in some of Loungefly's most important wholesale partners, including theme parks, and improving product availability relative to Q4 2021. SG&A for the quarter was $78 million or 25% of net sales, leveraging a 167 basis points year-over-year due to strong net sales growth."
