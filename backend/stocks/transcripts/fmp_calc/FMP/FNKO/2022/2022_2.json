    "content": " I'm excited to report record second quarter net sales of $316 million, a 34% increase over the prior year, capping off the strongest first half net sales in our company's history. Net sales for all three of our reported brand categories grew double-digits, with Loungefly more than doubling for second quarter in a row reaching $70 million in net sales for the quarter and $120 million through the first half of the year. On the strength of our first half, we are raising our net sales outlook for the full year by $25 million at the midpoint reaffirming our implied second half guidance. and contributing to the category's 21% year-over-year net sales increase are emerging brands, including Soda and Popsies, all delivered strong incremental growth, each with additional expansion opportunities on the horizon. Our Loungefly and other brands now constitute 26% of net sales, up from 19% in the second quarter of 2021 and a strong proof point of the effectiveness of our investments to diversify our revenue base. We remain on track to deliver full year adjusted EBITDA margins consistent with 2021 results, but acknowledge that a significant deterioration in the macroeconomic environment or less than anticipated stability in freight rates could temper margin expansion in the second half of the year. We are raising our full year net sales target to between $1.3 billion and $1.35 billion, reflecting our $25 million outperformance in the second quarter."
