    "content": " For the third quarter, adjusted EBITDA was $36 million with an adjusted EBITDA margin of 10% reflecting elevated freight rates, limited application of our pricing increases, and the investments we are making to serve a strong current demand and support future growth. We ended the quarter with total debt of $250 million up 41% compared to Q3 of last year, as we access our revolver to support the near term infrastructure investments and offset our increased working capital needs stemming from our inventory timing. As I previously mentioned, the reductions in our full year net sales and adjusted EBITDA margin outlook is a function of a broader macro climate and our continued investment in more efficient fulfillment capabilities to support our future growth. With a year and a half of very strong double-digit growth behind us, we are on the right path to deliver on our five year objectives layout in our Investor Day, including increasing net sales to $2 billion and driving adjusted EBITDA margin to approximately 20%."
