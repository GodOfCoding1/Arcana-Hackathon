    "content": " For the fourth quarter, adjusted EBITDA was negative $6 million, due to container rental charges, chargebacks and additional fulfillment expenses, all of which we are addressing in the first half of this year. For the first quarter, we expect revenue of between $225 million and $255 million, excluding our anticipated inventory write-down, we expect gross margin to be slightly below this past quarter and improved sequentially throughout the year as our inventory actions, pricing and product costing efforts take hold.

Well, I mean, the things that I just mentioned, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s about -- that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to total about $40 million of nonrecurring expense that we got hit with in the fourth quarter that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not going to see going forward into 2024. Hi, thanks for taking my question.
