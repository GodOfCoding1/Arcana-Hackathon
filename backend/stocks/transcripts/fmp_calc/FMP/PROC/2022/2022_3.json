    "content": " Our B2B -- our B2C business, we posted a 40% growth in constant currency in the nine months of the year, supported by the very positive performance of our Rx and OTC products. In general, main drivers for growth were increased demand for both of our Rx and OTC products, the rollout of our existing portfolio with new product launches, the higher market penetration in the Andean Region and the south of the Central America region and the higher demand for products and services for third parties. Looking at our OTC on Rx lines in Colombia, growth was substantial almost 20% supported by the performance of products launched last year and increased demand for existing products. Moving to Slide 10, on the gross profit line, we reached $68 million in third quarter '22 and $187 million for the first nine months of 2022 with a 64% gross margin in both periods."
