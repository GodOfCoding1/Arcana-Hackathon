    "content": " This increase was driven by the opening of 4 new restaurants in the second through fourth quarters of 2021 and 2 new restaurants during the first half of 2022, combined with a 1.9% increase in same-restaurant sales. These increases, combined with pricing actions taken in 2021, resulted in an effective increase in price of approximately 6.8% in the second quarter of 2022 and 7.0% year-to-date. As a result of menu venue price increases and operational efficiencies, restaurant-level adjusted EBITDA margins sequentially increased from 20.8% in the first quarter of 2022 to 25.5% in the second quarter of 2022."
