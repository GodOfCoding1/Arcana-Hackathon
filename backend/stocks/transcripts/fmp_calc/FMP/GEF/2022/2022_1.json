    "content": " The business's first quarter adjusted EBITDA rose by roughly $35 million due to higher sales, partially offset by higher raw material costs. Adjusted EBITDA rose by roughly $24 million versus the prior year due to higher sales, partially offset by higher raw material, transportation, and utility costs, including a significant $42 million drag from significantly higher OCC costs. First quarter adjusted EBITDA rose by $58 million year-over-year, despite an OCC index headwind of $42 million and roughly $33 million of non-volume related transportation and manufacturing labor inflation, absolute SG&A dollars rose $17 million versus the prior year quarter, mainly due to higher health medical and incentives costs, but fell 200 basis points on a percentage of sales basis. Finally, first quarter adjusted free cash flow was $19 million cash outflow and lower year-over-year primarily due to higher capex -related maintenance and organic growth investments in IBC's plastics and specialty corrugated products. We have overcome that headwind and increased the midpoint of our adjusted earnings per share guidance by $0.45 to $6.60 a share for Fiscal '22 reflective solid first quarter performance, announced paper price increases and lower interest expense. We now anticipate generating between $380 million and $440 million of adjusted free cash flow in fiscal '22, while our profit expectations have increased since Q4, that improvement isn't fully reflected in free cash flow primarily due to higher anticipated cash taxes and increased working capital largely due to announced price increases. Thanks so much, Larry. Thanks so much, Larry."
