    "content": " In addition to the absence of a $10 million contribution from FPS that benefited the previous year as well as a higher year-on-year incentive accruals, the team has also been excellent at taking steps to offset the previously discussed $100 million one-time full-year 2021 benefits related to last year's historic run up in steel prices. We are raising the midpoint of our adjusted earnings per share guidance by $0.40 to $8 a share for fiscal 2022, reflective of our strong third quarter performance and confidence in our ability, our team's ability to deliver results to round out the year. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. We're very comfortable that our business is going to continue to operate well, we're going to obviously try our best not to give up price because it's very valuable to us, but to the extent that, demand drops dramatically in the market, yes. Your line is open. Your line is open."
