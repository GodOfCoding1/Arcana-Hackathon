    "content": " As we discussed during our Investor Day last month, this recall prevents Winnebago Industries and all industry OEMs, upfitters, and retail dealers using that chassis from currently shipping, selling, or delivering any of the affected products until a remedy is implemented sometime in the first calendar quarter of 2023. Gross profit margin of 16.8% was 300 basis points lower than last year, driven by operating leverage, chassis recall-related production inefficiencies, a normalization back to seasonal trends within our Towable segment after extraordinary performance during the prior year period when dealer inventories were at all-time lows, and comparing against the strong Q1 last year where pricing was taken ahead of inflation. But on the towables RV side, I think it would be fair to say that we think both the dealers and probably the OEMs would see little harm in field inventory being reduced a little bit here over the course of the next three to four months and I won't get further than that because I don't have a crystal ball to anticipate the market condition. I'd go back first to our comments last year for Q1, really strong EBITDA margins we had in towables in excess of 17% was certainly an outlier relative to the more typical lower seasonal Q1 that we would report on. But your question does give me an opportunity to state again how pleased we are with the Barletta pontoon business that we acquired now about 15, 16 months ago, how well it's performing and just the reaction that we continue to get from retail consumers to that brand's product line compared to the other choices they have in the market and the profitability of our Marine segment, particularly around Barletta's growth, Bryan and I have been very pleased with as well."
