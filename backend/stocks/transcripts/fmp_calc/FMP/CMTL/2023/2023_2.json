Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. I was just going to say that we have identified some of our more entrepreneurially oriented growth minded leaders and those are the ones that are strategizing with us regarding EVOKE, our innovation foundry and they are beginning to conceptualize these more comprehensive up tiered value propositions and using the EVOKE venue as a technology incubator and innovation foundry for the integration of other key ingredients, such as blockchain, cloud computing, AI, machine learning, and other things that we can implement on private networks to serve customers and create customer value. Your line is open. Your line is open."
