    "content": " Compared to the year ago quarter, our consolidated Q3 fiscal 2022 net sales declined $17.3 million or 12.4%, a large majority of which related to lower revenue in our government solutions segment, given the impact of the withdrawal of US troops in Afghanistan last summer, and the impact of the more recent Russia-Ukraine military conflicts creating geopolitical uncertainty in Europe on previously anticipated orders. And I think our view and our philosophy right now is, look, we could tell you the funnel is growing, but it's very difficult to tell you when we're going to get an order and we would rather be in a position to tell you when we got the order rather than put it into our guidance or something like that and just miss it because of timing."
