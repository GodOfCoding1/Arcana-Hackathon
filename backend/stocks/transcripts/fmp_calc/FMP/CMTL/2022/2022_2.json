    "content": " The second quarter of fiscal year 2022 was clearly transformative for Comtech, I took on a new role as CEO, we welcome new independent members to our board of directors, and we further plans to deploy the proceeds of $100 million strategic growth investment. The other $35 million is more in our commercial space supply tray, change driven and disruptions and just timing but overall, as we're looking at the next two quarters, we're seeing Q3 being more similar, almost exact to like Q2, at this point in time and with the uptick in Q4."
