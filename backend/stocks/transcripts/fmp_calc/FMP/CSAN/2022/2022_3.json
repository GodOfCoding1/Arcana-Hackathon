    "content": " At Cosan Investimentos, we had the investments in Janus and Tellus, increasing our land portfolio and the Vale operation, reiterating our investment thesis, we have Brazil's competitive and comparative advantages and renewable energies through Ra\u00c3\u00adzen oil and gas through Raizen and Compass and food through Rumo and Radar, credit - carbon credit generation through Radar and Ra\u00c3\u00adzen and now mining with our initial investment at the Maranh\u00c3\u00a3o  port and now in Vale. Second, we want to support the company's investment plan in high performance and high profitability businesses as we see in the growth of E2G distribution companies and so on and so forth and Moove\u00e2\u0080\u0099s expansion - international expansion and so on. Given the structure of the company portfolio that can pay out more dividends and Vale's dividend and the profitability of the new businesses we've been investing in, we will be able to work with this portfolio complemented by selective divestments and for more capital inflow into the companies through the market."
