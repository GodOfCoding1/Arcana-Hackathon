    "content": " Let me start by saying that on the 6.4 percentage point decline, about 47% of that decline is explained either by timing on maintenance, meaning different timing of maintenance same quarter last year compared to this quarter; some one-offs and product mix, for instance, as you saw, our volumes in Mexico in cement are dropping while our ready-mix volumes are increasing. You're doing the numbers, but to reach the full year guidance, that would imply an EBITDA for the fourth quarter of about $650 million, which is around 1% higher year-over-year basis."
