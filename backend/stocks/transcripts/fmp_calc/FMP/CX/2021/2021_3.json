    "content": " Indeed, cement prices rose 6% year-over-year the biggest year-over-year pricing percentage gain in fourth quarter 2016. Pricing however was the most important driver of sales with all regions and products contributing to growth, year-to-date cement pricing gain was complemented in third quarter by a second round of pricing increases in Mexico, United States and Europe. As you can see in the line graph, despite sharp volatility in primary fuels our energy cost per ton of cement produced has remained fairly stable, growing 12% year-to-date and we are expecting 14% for the full-year. So what we've seen already after the big shape recovery we saw in the second quarter last year is that bagged cement increased very rapidly, while the segments related to the formal economy in Mexico saw at a moderate recovery and that has continued. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you very much."
