    "content": " With our new EBITDA guidance that Fernando will present next, coupled with the expected 2021 free cash flow and proceeds from outstanding asset sales being dedicated to debt paydown, this would suggest further improvement in our leverage during the year and could put us two years ahead of our plan of reaching investment-grade capital structure by the end of 2023. And the second one is given the \u2013 on expansion CapEx to $500 million, is this the kind of a recurrent on expansion that we could expect for the next couple of years and somewhat related to the size of these projects that you have been working on already for a couple of years that you have identified. I think that can derive either as an amount or what's included in those $500 million because, as you might remember, next year, we're going to be finishing building cement capacity expansion for 4.3 million tonnes of cement, that will happen during the next year. What we are expecting, again, because we've been having this exercise of building a bolt-on portfolio of acquisitions and investments, is that we have detected and we continue detecting very sizable opportunities with the same profile, meaning most probably for the rest of the year, I wonder is for next year, we will continue adding this type of demand readiness and aggregates and organization solutions opportunities to our bolt-on strategy. And then the second question is whether the $100 million \u2013 or let me put it differently, how much of the $100 million in incremental EBITDA is in your $2.9 billion guidance for this year already?"
