    "content": "  This positive momentum is reflected in both the number of prescriptions filled, which increased to 18% in the second quarter compared with the first quarter of 2022 and the US achieved net product revenue, which was $25 million for the second quarter, a 24% increase compared to the first quarter of 2022, while several factors helped drive our success, we believe the most important one is that FOTIVDA is fulfilling a significant unmet need by providing an evidence-based effective and well-tolerated treatment option for RCC patients, who have relapsed or become refractory to two or more prior therapies."
