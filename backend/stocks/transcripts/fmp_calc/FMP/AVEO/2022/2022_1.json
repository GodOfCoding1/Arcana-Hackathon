    "content": " With that said, we\u2019re still only a year into this launch and there is much more work and opportunity ahead of us as we progress towards our goal of establishing FOTIVDA as the standard of care for third-line RCC patients, which we believe would in turn drive our continued growth. In addition, AVEO continues to enroll patient in the Phase 3 TiNivo-2 clinical trial evaluating tivozanib in combination with nivolumab or OPDIVO Bristol Myers Squibb\u2019s antibody directed against program death-1 as compared to tivozanib monotherapy in patients with advanced refractory RCC who have progressed following prior immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy. I\u2019m pleased with the growth trajectory that we are currently experiencing as FOTIVDA now has the leading share of third line new patient starts as evidenced by third-party data, which we first achieved in December of 2021 and have continued for the first quarter of 2022. So in our first two quarters of launch, we had somewhere between 25% and 30% of patients who discontinued after one cycle and what that tells us that these were very late line patients who really weren\u2019t going to benefit from any additional treatment. I\u2019ll start by saying \u2013 early to be able to get a very specific duration of therapy, because as you know even with of the updated data we presented at ASCO GU, you have a lot of patients who are really on tivo for a very long time, even three to four years as reported just recently."
