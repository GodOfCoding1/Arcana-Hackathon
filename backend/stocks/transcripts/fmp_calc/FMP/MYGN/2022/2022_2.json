    "content": " After excluding divested businesses, quarterly revenues of $179.3 million increased 7% year-over-year and 9% for the 6 months ended June 30, 2022, in line with our long-term revenue guidance. Average revenue per test in the quarter decreased 2% year-over-year, excluding divested businesses, primarily due to shifts in our product mix as compared to the second quarter of last year. Adjusted gross margins improved 30 basis points from last year to 72.4%, and our adjusted earnings per share of $0.04 decreased 8% year-over-year, primarily due to income from now divested businesses, such as Vectra and RBM in the second quarter of 2021. Driven by GeneSight, our Mental Health business reported $33.1 million in revenue for the second quarter of 2022, an increase of 46% year-over-year. In the second quarter, our Women's Health business reported $70.1 million in revenue, a 4% increase year-over-year. Total revenue in the second quarter of 2022 was $179.3 million, an increase of 7% year-over-year and 9% sequentially after excluding divested businesses. Hereditary Cancer revenue in the second quarter was $79.4 million, a decrease of 8% compared to the second quarter of last year, with quarterly volumes decreasing 4% year-over-year. This compared to the first quarter of 2022 when Hereditary Cancer quarterly revenue decreased 7% year-over-year and quarterly volumes decreased 12% year-over-year, shows relative stabilization in our hereditary cancer testing business. Pharmacogenomic testing and Mental Health delivered first quarter revenue of $33.1 million, an increase of 46% year-over-year and 13% sequentially."
