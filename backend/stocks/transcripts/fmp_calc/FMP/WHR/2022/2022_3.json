And to be a little bit more specific when we had the North America business of 17%, 18% margin, I mean, we felt that it's probably a little bit higher than we see the long-term structural margin by the same token between field right now, the 10% are also not reflected structural margins for two reasons. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. And I think it's obviously -- it's understandable everyone's trying to narrow in on the cost basis or where you are in terms of volume in the business if we were to be, let's say, flat next year if the margins would get us back to that longer-term guidance just because this year is exiting at such a lower rate, right, bifurcated second half, first half."
