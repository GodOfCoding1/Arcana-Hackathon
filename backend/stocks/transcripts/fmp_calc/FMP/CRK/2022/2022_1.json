And, you know, I think, Dan, mentioned, you know, the number of long lateral wells we were going to drill this year, and, you know, even the number of greater than 14,000 foot, and so, some of it's probably the timing of when those drilling and completion dollars are spent, but it's no change in the rig count or the frack leak account. And I think just the way the rig schedule works, the activity on that front is ramping up in the third quarter, you know, compared to the second or maybe I think we're probably using, you know, almost 100% of our operated, you know, services for our own stuff."
