    "content": " Our adjusted net income for the quarter was $326 million, or $1.18 per diluted share, and our EBITDAX for the quarter came in at $598 million, 93% higher than last year's third quarter. In the third quarter, we spent $242 million on our development, and exploratory activities including $227 million on our operated Haynesville and Bossier Shale drilling program, we also spent $4 million on non-operated wells and $11 million on other development activity. Your line is open. Your line is open. That's when we back when gas prices were low that was just kind of one of the areas that we did not look at spend on our capital, because we'd looked at the wells that have been drilled, and they just didn't, they didn't really compete when you looked at the other areas where we are aligned, and where we needed to maximize our performance. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. What's different this quarter is that the Texas gulf markets, which have been premium markets, maybe some of the best premium markets have really turned around because mainly because of the Freeport where they're putting all that gas into storage versus sending it, using it for LNG, so that event I think that happened has really turned that Houston ship channel market into a wider market and that's what's -- that's what's affecting us really because we were protected against the other ones for the most part."
