    "content": " In fact, we've got the leverage ratio to do that, we've committed not we told you the last quarter where we're not looking to spend $3 billion, $4 billion, $5 billion buying PDP with inventory, we think we've got a lot of inventories, it's quality and hopefully we can add some more inventory as we drill some wells that's been our view and that's been our drumbeat for a long time and we've executed on it and at the same time we want to show you that we love the environment as much as anybody. Then a priority again like Roland said hopefully, we can get majority of the RBL paid off in the third quarter, probably a little dangling in the fourth, then we want to continue to we'll add these two rigs, but we're not going to add any leverage and our goal is to get the shareholders return period, and that's something we need to do is we need to step up and give a dividend and then we need to continue to test our inventory and become better what we do and that's on top of the ground that's the people that are drilling completing these wells and marketing the gas."
