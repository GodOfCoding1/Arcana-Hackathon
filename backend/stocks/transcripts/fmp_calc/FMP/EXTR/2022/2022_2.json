    "content": " I would like to remind you that during today's call, our discussion may include forward-looking statements about Extreme's future business, financial, operational results, growth expectations and strategies, go-to-market planning related to our acquisition of Ipanema, the impact of the COVID pandemic and continued challenges of our supply chain as they relate to chip shortages and other materials. SaaS annual recurring revenue was $88 million this quarter, up 55% year-over-year and 11% quarter-over-quarter, driven by significant interest in our cloud technology which is also reflected in our 13% market share and number two position in cloud networking. Services and subscription revenue reached a new high at $89.8 million, up 18% from the year ago quarter and 9% sequentially, largely driven by the strength of cloud subscriptions. The growth of cloud subscription and service renewals drove the total deferred revenue sitting on our balance sheet to $373 million, up 20% year-over-year and 5% sequentially. It's -- I'll answer it or I'll make two comments, one is obviously around the 5G, I think as I mentioned in the last answer that the opportunity, the interest in cloud native infrastructure is actually growing, so which means a lot of newer customers and by customers, I mean, service providers are kind of entering that foray. And now that this business is growing, what we're seeing this quarter is a significant contribution from renewals of customers that adopted our solution two to three years ago, sometimes when they were Aerohive customers, so now we're seeing a more balanced contribution to the 47% growth that I mentioned in my comments from new customers adopting the subscription model, as well as renewal of existing customers."
