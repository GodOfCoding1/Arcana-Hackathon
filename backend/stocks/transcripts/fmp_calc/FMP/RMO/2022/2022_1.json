    "content": " I will open up the call with an overview of our first quarter and some recent business highlights; Lauren will then discuss our commercial strategy and recent successes; then Anne will walk through some of the positive operational results we have achieved during the first quarter; AK will then provide a deeper dive into our technologies, focus and differentiation; then Kerry will wrap up the presentation with first quarter financial results and closing remarks before we take your questions. So we do have several aspects of our technology that make the battery management system and our own batteries function at a premium level together, but we work very well with our customers and their vehicle management systems and software as well as with fleet partners to make sure that the service that we offer is exactly what they need and potentially could be a service that we would offer separately from products in the future, though that's not something that we do today. Because the cell is the single largest component of the bill of material as well as combined with the fact that it's a significant customer, that's why the impact on a comparable basis is as large as really a 2x impact comparing our $40 million to $50 million guidance that would basically double those numbers, $80 million to $100 million if the business arrangement were the same and then therefore, the accounting were the same year-over-year."
