    "content": " Despite earnings pressure in our mortgage origination business and a decline in the value of our available for sales securities portfolio from rising rates, consolidated profitability from our diverse business model and significant share purchases over the past two years has supported our tangible book value per share and drove it to increase modestly in the third quarter. Further, while we continue to rigorously manage interest bearing deposit costs in the face of increasing competition and customer expectations for higher rates, the cost of interest bearing deposits rose in the quarter to 70 basis points, an increase of 42 basis points from the prior quarter. Third quarter mortgage related income and fees decreased by $144 million versus third quarter of 2021, driven by the ever evolving environment in mortgage banking, which has moved quickly to being purchase focused. The decline in expenses versus the prior year was driven by decreases in variable compensation of approximately $55 million, largely driven by PrimeLending, which was linked to substantially lower fee revenue generation in the quarter compared to the prior year period. While commercial loan growth has improved over the last few quarters, we expect that the full year average loan HFI growth, excluding mortgage loans retained and PPP loans during 2022 will be in the 1% to 3% range as competition remains very intense for newly funded loans and mortgage warehouse lending. During the third quarter, annualized net charge-offs to total loans was elevated at 15 basis points versus the prior periods, but remained well below nor normalized run rate loss expectations. Brad, your line is now open. Brad, your line is now open."
