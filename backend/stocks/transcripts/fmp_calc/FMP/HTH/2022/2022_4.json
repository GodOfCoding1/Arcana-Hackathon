    "content": " During the quarter, HilltopSecurities generated pre-tax income of $19.8 million on net revenues of $107 million, an increase in revenues of $12 million or 13% compared to Q4, 2021. Versus the prior year quarter, net income increased by $19 million or 18% driven primarily by higher yields on loans, securities, and cash balances which was somewhat offset by higher rates on deposits and variable rate borrowings. Fourth quarter mortgage-related income and fees decreased by $121 million versus the fourth quarter of '21 driven by the evolving environment in mortgage making which remains very challenged in combination of higher interest rates, home price inflation, limited housing supply, and ongoing overcapacity in terms of mortgage originators across the United States has driven volumes materially lower and moved margins to levels we have not seen in the recent history. The decline in expenses versus the prior-year was driven by decreases in variable compensation of approximately $50 million at HilltopSecurities and PrimeLending, which was linked to lower fee revenue generation in the quarter compared to the prior-year period. Hey, good morning, guys. Hey, good morning, guys."
