    "content": " Our third quarter adjusted EBITDA of $71.3 million increased 70% year-over-year and adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 550 basis points to 25.5%, driven primarily by the addition of NxEdge, strong organic sales growth and effective pricing strategies in response to inflationary pressures. Sealing Technologies sales increased 7.5% to $157.9 million, driven by strong demand in aerospace, food and pharma and heavy-duty truck markets as well as pricing actions partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange translation and the divestiture of the polymer components business completed in 2021. For the third quarter, adjusted segment EBITDA of $39.7 million increased 15.1% driven by volume growth across the segment, pricing, improved mix and operational improvements in our heavy-duty truck business, partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange translation."
