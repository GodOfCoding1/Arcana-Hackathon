    "content": " Positive momentum in the semiconductor, general industrial, heavy duty truck, aerospace, food and pharma, oil and gas, and petrochemical markets, as well as the first quarter contribution from NxEdge drove sales growth, partially offset by the reduction in sales due to last year\u2019s divestitures as well as a continued lag in our automotive market residing in the engineered materials segment due to supply chain related customer delays. In engineered materials, first quarter sales of $59 million decreased 26.6% compared to the prior year, driven primarily by the CPI divestiture and industry-wide supply chain-related constraints affecting production in the automotive market, partially offset by stronger demand in general industrial, aerospace, and oil and gas markets. We\u2019ve adjusted our assumption on interest rate increases from where we were a quarter ago, just given all the expectations in the markets, and so we essentially now have--we have four 50 basis point adjustments in our model, but one of them is at the end of the year, that doesn\u2019t really affect this year, so in essence we have three 50 basis point improvements--increases, and if the economy slows and the Fed decides--I think it\u2019s almost a certainty that we\u2019ll see a 50 basis point increase in May and then depending on what happens to the economy it could be less than that, but we\u2019ll adjust our model as we know more. Last year, we had really good experience more than covering cost increases during the first half of the year, and then in Q3 we still were fine, Q4 we were--it became a little bit more challenging, and then I would say in this quarter, the challenge was more significant overall because we\u2019re seeing not only material costs increase but we\u2019re seeing the effects of wage increases and continued freight increases."
