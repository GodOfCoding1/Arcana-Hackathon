    "content": " In the second quarter sales of $333.3 million increased 11.6% year-over-year with organic sales growth of 9.5%, about half of which was volume and other half price. Our second quarter adjusted EBITDA of $82 million increased 43.4% year-over-year and we achieved a record adjusted EBITDA margin of 24.6%, a 540 basis point improvement from the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA of $82 million increased 43.4% over the prior year period driven primarily by the addition of NxEdge and organic growth, including the impact of pricing initiatives. In addition adjusted EBITDA in the second quarter was positively impacted by a $2.8 million foreign exchange benefit from revaluation gains primarily on foreign cash balances due to a strengthening dollar and a $2.5 million reduction in incentive compensation accruals due mainly to the share price decline experienced during the second quarter. Adjusted diluted earnings per share of $2.32 increased 49% compared to the prior year period driven by growth in operating earnings, offset in part by higher interest expenses compared to last year. Adjusted segment EBITDA increased more than 140% to $37.8 million compared to the second quarter of last year driven primarily by the NxEdge acquisition and strong organic sales growth. Excluding the impact of NxEdge and foreign exchange translation, adjusted segment EBITDA increased 33.3%, reflecting strong operating leverage and an improved mix compared to a year ago. In engineered materials, second quarter sales of $56.5 million decreased 29.4% compared to the prior year resulting from the CPI divestiture completed in December 2021. Excluding the impact of the divestiture and foreign exchange translation adjusted EBITDA increased 13.6% compared to the prior year reflecting organic sales growth, including pricing initiatives and cost management."
