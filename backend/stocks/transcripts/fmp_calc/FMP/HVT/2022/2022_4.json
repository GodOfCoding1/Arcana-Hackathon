    "content": " In the fourth quarter of 2022, net sales were $280.6, a 5.5% increase over the prior quarter. Other income and expense in the fourth quarter of 2022 was negligible, but our interest income increased $920,000 during the fourth quarter, as interest earned on our cash deposits increased this past year as interest rates have increased. Now looking at our balance sheet, at the end of the fourth quarter, our inventories were $118.3 million which was up $6.3 million over the yearend balance of \u00e2\u0080\u009921 and down $90 million versus the Q3, 2022 balance. At the end of the fourth quarter, our customer deposits were $48 million, which was down $50.9 million or 51% from the December 31, 2021 balance and down $31.8 million or 40% versus the Q3, 2022 balance. During the fourth quarter of 2022, we amended our revolving credit facility and increased the revolving loan commitments from $60 million to $80 million, extended the term of the commitment to October 2027 and replace the LIBOR rate with a SOFR rate as the interest rate benchmark. And at the end of the fourth quarter of 2022, we have approximately $20 million of existing authorization in our buyback program."
