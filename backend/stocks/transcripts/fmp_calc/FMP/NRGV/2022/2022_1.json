    "content": " In addition to the IP licensing and royalty agreement I mentioned earlier, we took a significant step forward during the first quarter by breaking ground in China on the previously announced 100-megawatt hour EBX facility with our partners, Atlas Renewable and China-based recycling and environmental service company, China Tianying. The hundred megawatt-hour gravity-based CBX system is being built adjacent to a wind farm and national grid site in Rudong, Jiangsu province, located outside of Shanghai, to augment and balance China's national energy grid to the delivery of renewable energy to the State Grid Corporation of China, the world's largest utility company. There's another group of employees, as we tripled the size of the company in terms of employee headcount in the last 12 to 14 months, that joined us from other companies that we're much larger, much more predictable, that had revenue, that weren't going through an IPO process and weren't associated with the SPAC market, that came under a lot of criticism back in the second half of last year."
