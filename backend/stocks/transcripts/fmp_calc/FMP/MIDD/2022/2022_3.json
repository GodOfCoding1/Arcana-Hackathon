    "content": " I think, in many ways, we have gotten closer to those customers through this period and one of the positive byproducts of being closer to them going through the challenges we all have is, they are a lot more transparent about plans into the -- well into the future like they haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t been before. The two other areas I would call out that we probably haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t talked about quite as much is more kind of our dealer channel, specifically in the U.S. And again, I think we have gone closer to them than we ever have before through the last couple of years, and having more and more of those critical dealers to us through the MIK, strategically playing for next year, many of them would tell you they are busier than ever. So I mean, I think, our -- we would expect the Residential platform is going to have industry leading margins and certainly well into double-digit teens even if there was kind of a significant drop off. I will say there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a number of initiatives that we have had through the year and really the last several years as we kind of think about manufacturing efficiency and product designs, how products come together that particularly applies in our U.K. business, which I think, we have had a strategy to really drive margins up much higher and so if the revenues dropped there, I think, that will help us serve more. So I think, certainly -- I think we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t -- the way we thought about it, I mean, it is really driven based on launching our product innovation, sales mix is a big thing as we are kind of transforming the mix of products that we have in the ROI to our customers. So, I mean, I think, you would -- you might think that Food Processing gets there, the earliest Commercial somewhere in between and we have given ourselves a little bit of breathing room in kind of that range on our Residential platform, which also has some acquisitions that are new to that platform and kind of embedded in the margins. So, I mean, I think, material costs, there was a lot of disruption early in the second quarter if everybody recalls certainly with the war in Ukraine kind of taking it to the next level and that continued throughout the second quarter and into the third quarter. We think that carries a little bit in Q4 and also into Q1 and we do anticipate taking some pricing going into next year as well, because, I mean, I think, things like controls, electronic components and some other categories are still in a highly elevated situation. I mean, I think, for us, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s really the longer term view in knowing that as kind of the backdrop in the world behind us plays out that we are well positioned and some of those growth drivers are incremental and also our kind of share gainers as well. We bring in a lot more in terms of innovation and technology and certainly including this year as you kind of think about the companies that I highlighted on this call, Proxaut, CP Packaging, Colussi, last quarter with Icetro as we continue to extend our beverage."
