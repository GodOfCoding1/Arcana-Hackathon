Operating expenses for the second quarter of fiscal 2022 increased to 20.9 million from 12.6 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2021, administrative and selling expenses increased due to higher sales, marketing and consulting costs as the company is investing in rebranding and accelerating its sales and commercialization efforts, including increasing the size of its sales and marketing teams, which resulted in an increase in compensation expenses. Research and development expenses were 7.7 million during the second quarter, up from 3 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2021, reflecting increased spending on the company's hydrogen commercialization initiatives, namely acceleration of our commercial development efforts related to our solid oxide platform."
