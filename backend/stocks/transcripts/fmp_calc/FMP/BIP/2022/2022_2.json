    "content": " Organic growth remained robust at 10%, reflecting the benefits of elevated inflation, as well as the commissioning of approximately $1 billion of new capital projects, and over $3billion of capital deployed and new investments over the last 12-months. Taking a closer look at our operating results by segment, starting with utilities, adjusted EBITDA increased 14% relative to the prior year reflecting the benefits from inflation indexation, the commissioning of approximately $500 million of capital into rate base and the contribution from two Australian utility acquisitions completed earlier this year. We completed to tuck in acquisitions within our North American Residential infrastructure business during the quarter, including the largest New York based submetering provider and a portfolio of 9000 submetering connections in British Columbia and Alberta, further expanding our existing footprint in Western Canada. You know look, I think there is lots of pools of capital to grow this business, not even outside of North America, whether it is Australia or Europe, there is a pretty, there is lots of deep pools of capital and low cost capital that will still make an attractive value proposition for our customers."
