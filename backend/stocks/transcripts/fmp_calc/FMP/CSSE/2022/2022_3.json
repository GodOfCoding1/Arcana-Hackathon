    "content": " As Bill discussed, we're well positioned to continue taking AVOD market share as both audiences and advertisers shift from linear to CTV and now with the addition of Redbox's TVOD and DVD businesses, we are even better positioned to benefit from the rebound in theatrical leases. In addition to growth from having 6 weeks of Redbox revenues in the period, we saw continued strength in AVOD streaming revenues from AVOD rights as well as ad representation revenues, distribution touchpoint revenues, owned and operated ad revenues driven by our new apps and an increase in sponsorship revenue due to the premier of Chicken Soup for the Soul of television group's original production, Pet Caves, on our streaming platforms. It's just kind of an interesting point in the market, right, Bill, where you've got a bunch of guys that are probably starting to recognize that they're maybe spending a little too much on content spend although we'll see if that eases or not. And I don't see that slowing at all, especially to AVOD because if the market really is going to be softer, as you -- as is the premise of the question, there's going to be even more pressure on people to watch AVODs as compared to double or triple up on their SVODs."
