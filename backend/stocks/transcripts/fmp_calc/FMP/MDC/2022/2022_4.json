    "content": " Thank you for joining us today for a review of our operating results for the fourth quarter and full year 2022, and an update of our strategies for navigating today's new home landscape. During the fourth quarter, we generated net income of $79.8 million, or $1.08 per diluted share, representing a 51% decrease from the fourth quarter of 2021. Pretax income from our homebuilding operations for the quarter were $94.5 million, which represented a 51% decrease from the fourth quarter of 2021. We delivered 2,554 homes during the quarter, which represented a 4% decrease year-over-year, but exceeded the previously estimated range for the quarter of 2,200 to 2,500 closings. Our total dollar SG&A expense for the 2022 fourth quarter increased $1.8 million from the 2021 fourth quarter, driven by increased commission expenses as a result of the increase in home sale revenues. As noted last quarter, we continue to take steps to reduce our general and administrative expenses and saw these expenses decrease during the fourth quarter of 2022, both sequentially from the third quarter, as well as on a year-over-year basis when compared to the fourth quarter of 2021. We currently estimate that our general and administrative expenses for the first quarter of 2023 will be between $50 million and $55 million, which represents a $19.5 million or 27% decrease from the first quarter of 2022 at the midpoint. Before cancellations, our gross order activity for the fourth quarter was down 55% year-over-year and 4% from the third quarter of 2022. On a gross order basis, our average selling price of new orders decreased approximately 1% as compared to the prior year and approximately 6% as compared to the third quarter of this year."
