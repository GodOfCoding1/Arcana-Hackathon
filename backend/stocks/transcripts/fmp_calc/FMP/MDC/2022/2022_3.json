In the third quarter of 2022, cancellations as a percentage of that beginning backlog were 17.1% compared to the prior quarter of 7.4%, and our longer term quarterly average over the past 10 years of 13.9%. In large part the cancellations during the quarter were from orders that occurred prior to the run up and mortgage rates with 59% of our third quarter cancellations coming from orders that occurred prior to March 31, 2022. Before cancellations, our gross order activity for the third quarter was down 47% year-over-year and 30% from the second quarter of 2022. On a gross order basis, our average sales price of new orders increased approximately 4% as compared to the prior year and decreased approximately 5% as compared to the second quarter of this year. We acquired 447 lots during the quarter, resulting in total land acquisition spend of $74 million down 73% from $273 million in the 2021 third quarter."
