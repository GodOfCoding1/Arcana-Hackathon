    "content": " While third quarter financial results did not meet our expectations, we continue to report record revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 of $57.7 million, which is 26% greater than revenues for the nine months ended of the prior year of $45.1 million. In addition to the macroeconomic challenges faced by our sector, which limited our growth in the third quarter, Targadox revenue for the quarter was $4 million less when compared against third quarter of the prior year, reflecting the continued impact of generic competition for the brand. However, this shortfall was partially offset by an increase in Accutane revenue of $0.6 million or a 17% increase versus the third quarter of the prior year. Our flagship products Qbrexza and Accutane along with the contributions of our newly launched products, Amzeeq and Zilxi represented $44.4 million or 81% of our year-to-date revenue. Total revenue was $16.1 million for the three month period ended September 30, 2022, a decrease of $3.5 million from $19.6 million for the three month period ended September 30, 2021. Other incremental product revenue of $1.7 million versus 2021 during the three month period ended September 30, 2022, was driven by our newly acquired and launched products Amzeeq and Zilxi. In addition, the three month period ended September 30, 2021, included an inventory step up of $3 million for inventory units sold related to the acquired finished goods of Qbrexza from Dermira in 2021. The decrease in cost of goods sold were slightly offset by higher freight charges and additional testing costs of approximately $1 million as a result of our newly acquired and launched products Amzeeq and Zilxi, and an increase in cost of goods sold related to higher noncash amortization of licenses of approximately $0.4 million. Research and development expenses increased to $2.8 million for the three month period ended September 30, 2022 from $0.7 million for the same period of the prior year. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $15.6 million for the third quarter of 2022 compared to $10.8 million for the third quarter of 2021 with the increase primarily resulted from the expansion of our sales force, product samples, marketing expenses related to the expanded portfolio of four products Accutane, Qbrexza, Amzeeq and Zilxi, and professional fees associated with being a public company. Our non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter of 2022 after adjusting for R&D expenses, related to DFD-29 resulted in a net loss of $4 million or $0.23 per share basic and diluted versus a net profit of $1.3 million or $0.14 per share basic and $0.12 per share diluted. And then in terms of revenue and what it's generating for us on a regular quarterly cycle, we're looking at anywhere between $6 million to $7 million. And then when you add on top of that as well the additional milestone revenue that we received from our partners Maruho in Japan, a milestone payment of $2.5 million, you're looking at a potential run rate from $28 million to $30 million."
