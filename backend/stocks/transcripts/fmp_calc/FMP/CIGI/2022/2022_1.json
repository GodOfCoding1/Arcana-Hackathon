    "content": " First quarter revenues were $1 billion, up 31% relative to the prior year period with revenues up strongly across all service lines. Q1 '22 adjusted EBITDA was $121 million, up 33% from 1 year ago, with margins at 12.1%, up slightly from 11.9% in the prior year quarter driven by the Americas region. Adjusted EBITDA was $81 million, up 43% from last year, with the margin up 60 basis points to 12.6% on favorable operating leverage from higher revenues in all service lines. First quarter EMEA revenues were $153 million, up 30% from 1 year ago, with robust growth across all service lines, led by outsourcing and advisory and capital markets. Adjusted EBITDA was $5 million, up 23% on higher revenues, although margin was impacted by revenue mix from increased project management activity which runs at lower margins than other services. First quarter Asia Pacific revenues were $119 million, down 3% driven by COVID-19 lockdowns in several Asian markets as well as a tough prior year comparison, which benefited from a number of high-margin capital markets transactions. All I'm saying is, I mean, just look at the actual results for the quarter, and it's been pretty consistent over the past couple of years, up 30% in virtually every area, pretty impressive, and exceeding our own expectations, frankly. With the Basalt transaction, we're going to have 23% of our EBITDA from investment management, extremely high visibility and highly durable and high margin EBITDA coming from those services, low CapEx as well, so strong cash flow. We expect that to continue through the year across all of our regional businesses from operating leverage from higher revenues, also from some of the continuing cost management activities that we're undertaking around the company."
