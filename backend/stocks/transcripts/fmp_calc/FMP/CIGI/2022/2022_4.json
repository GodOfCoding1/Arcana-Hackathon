    "content": " Adjusted EBITDA for Q4 was $203 million, up 6% from one year ago, with margins at 16.6%, up 230 basis points relative to the prior year quarter. Capital markets, including debt origination was down 51% relative to record volumes in the prior year's seasonally strongest fourth quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was $36 million versus $42 million last year, with the margin primarily impacted by service mix with a higher proportion of project management revenues at modest margins. Fourth quarter Investment Management revenues were $121 million, up 53%, excluding pass-through carried interest, revenues were up 87% driven by acquisitions and management fee growth from increased assets under management. And three, we expect capital markets activity to be down 20% to 40% during the first half of 2023 relative to strong prior year comparatives with a return to year-over-year growth in the second half. As it relates to capital markets, I mean, of course, I outlined that we expect to be down significantly in the first half, which will translate to being down in that particular service line by 10% to 20% on a full-year basis. And out of that $50 million -- sorry, out of that $75 million, $50 million is Investment Management, which we have extremely high visibility on and the remainder is a combination of the other services, which includes a little bit of capital markets, but also a significant amount of property management and engineering business."
