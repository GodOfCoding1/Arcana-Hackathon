    "content": " Earlier today, Colliers reported very solid third quarter results with outsourcing and advisory investment management and leasing all up strongly more than offsetting any softness in capital markets, which obviously has been impacted by higher interest rates, availability of capital and geopolitical uncertainties. With the recent acquisitions of Rockwood and Versus, our investment management business now represents about 30% of our pro forma EBITDA and total assets under management has surpassed the $92 billion mark firmly establishing Colliers as one of the top global players in the rapidly growing alternative private capital industry. Our third quarter revenues were $1.1 billion, up 12% relative to the prior year period with revenues up strongly in our Outsourcing & Advisory and Investment Management service lines. Adjusted EBITDA for Q3 was $145 million, up 17% from one year ago, with margins at 13.1%, up 100 basis points relative to the prior year quarter. The bottom line is that our business, because we are becoming way more resilient and diversified, we're really -- this quarter, and we think it will continue is really only impacted by the softness in capital markets. And for my follow-up, so as we think about the implied guidance for fourth quarter, especially on the EBITDA portion, $208 million at the midpoint, I think implies high-single digit year-on-year growth, very strong sequentially, I think, up 45%. Finally, I note our capital -- in our Capital Markets business, we have a debt origination platform and debt originations at profitable service line, more profitable than the other types of services and that the impact of erection and activity in debt origination is having an impact on the margin as well in the quarter. One moment for next question, please. One moment for next question, please."
