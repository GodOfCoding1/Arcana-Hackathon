    "content": " Adjusted EBITDA was $102 million, up 30% from last year, fueled by revenue growth, as well as a gain on the termination of a lease, partly offset by higher variable costs and an exchange with a reduction in higher margin debt origination. So now that you've roughly hit your goal of 30% of adjusted EBITDA from the IM business, and given your commentary on the continued strength you're seeing in those businesses, I just wanted to ask if there's potential for that target to move higher."
