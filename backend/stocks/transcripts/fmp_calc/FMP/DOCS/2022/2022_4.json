    "content": " First, our top line, I am pleased to report that we delivered $93.7 million in revenue for the fourth quarter of our fiscal 2022, an increase of 40% over the same quarter last year and 5% above the midpoint of our guidance. As Jeff mentioned, our subscription-based business model and foundation of recurring customers provides us with high visibility into this year\u2019s revenue, with only 5% reliance on GoGet customers, we have line of sight into 95% of our subscription-based annual guidance. Your line is open. So this cadence actually is pretty typical for us, as Q1 has historically been a lighter quarter in most prior years, and now if we look ahead, based on currently signed deals, we\u2019re confident that we will see an acceleration in revenue growth starting in Q2. Your line is open. Anna, maybe I\u2019ll continue through that line of thought, just by looking back to your financials prior to COVID kind of pulling forward digital marketing spend and hiding some of the seasonality, if I go back to pre-COVID, it looks like between the fourth quarter of \u201819 and first quarter of \u201821, you actually had an 18% drop in sales sequentially, and your guidance only calls for a 5% drop this quarter. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. If you actually look back 2 years \u2013 I\u2019ll pull Ryan Daniels here and go back on the history, if you look back 2 years, Q1 adjusted EBITDA was 11%, and we finished the year with 31% margins. And similar to revenue, we\u2019re confident we will see EBITDA growth accelerate in Q2, and we have really high line of sight into our 43% margin guidance for the year. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open."
