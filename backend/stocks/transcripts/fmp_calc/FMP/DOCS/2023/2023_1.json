Suffice to say, with over 360,000 active users doing 200,000 calls per workday last quarter, we believe Doximity dialer has replaced the hospital handset to become the new gold standard for medical telephony, and we will continue to lean into its network growth. First quarter revenue grew 25% year-over-year to $90.6 million, exceeding the high end of our guidance range. Adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter was $33.5 million, and adjusted EBITDA margin was 37% compared to $31.2 million and a 43% margin in the prior year period."
