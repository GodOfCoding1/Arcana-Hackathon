    "content": " Looking ahead to the second half of our fiscal year, we're reiterating our annual guidance of 25% top line growth with 43% EBITDA margins. For the third fiscal quarter of 2023, we expect revenue in the range of $110.7 million to $111.7 million, representing 14% growth at the midpoint and we expect adjusted EBITDA in the range of $47.7 million to $48.7 million, representing a 43% adjusted EBITDA margin. So I'm proud, as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, that we have renewed 100%, every single one of our hundreds of Dialer Enterprise clients so far this year which is obviously creating a lot of value in the end provider markets, saving doctors a lot of time and making the money, right, as they now can do their visits on the go from everywhere. And then the final point I'll make on this is I think we're also excited about the operational efficiencies that we're working on with our clients around just content planning in tandem with deal negotiations which we are actually finding that, that's aiding our annual planning because we're able to have more strategic discussions with our clients. Looking back, Biohaven was actually our number 11 client over the 3 years prior to their big drug launch, Nurtec, 2019 to 2021 which, of course, means that it's this tiny pre-revenue company, they were spending more with us than top 20 pharma because they were our number 11 overall client. And as we think about our annual renewal cycle and that kind of 80% or so that comes from those core renewals, the majority of that is brands coming back and buying the same module or buying an additional module, so starting with 1 and maybe expanding to 2, or a customer that we've worked with for a while might have a new brand that we can now add into our portfolio of brands that we work with, so cross-selling to those additional brands."
