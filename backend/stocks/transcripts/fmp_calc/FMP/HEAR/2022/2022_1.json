    "content": " We\u2019re hard at work to continue to produce great products which attract gamers at all price points and very much look at these times as an opportunity to prepare our product portfolio and business for the coming market upswing, exactly as we\u2019ve done in past challenging periods. For the first quarter, we reported net revenue of $46.7 million slightly above our expectations compared to $93.1 million a year ago where the company\u2019s revenues were up 166% year-over-year as a result of exceptional consumer demand across console headsets and PC gaming accessories, and our significant outperformance of the market and peers. Elevated inventory levels are a reflection of continued significantly longer shipping lead times, as well as intentionally higher target inventory levels to absorb COVID driven supply chain disruptions that we\u2019ve experienced many times over the past two years. So as we mentioned, Drew, in the prepared remarks, we expect Q2 to be roughly flat to up slightly to Q1 that \u2013 that\u2019s basically a result of the continued kind of economic pressures and overall gaming market weakness, which we expect to abate as we get into Q3 and then produce a very good growth rate starting in Q3 but then in Q4."
