    "content": " We continue to believe that the gaming market is a great market to be a leader in, despite the difficult year, driven by a slowdown in consumer demand, retail channel inventory reductions, heavy competitive discounting, a strong dollar and continued global logistics and supply chain challenges, including high freight rates. In our Rocket PC gaming portfolio, we've continued to expand our line of award-winning PC gaming mice, keyboards, and headsets with new products that deliver the performance PC gamer's desire and leverage RGB lighting to create the most beautiful desktop for gamers available. Leveraging our global business as a leading gaming hardware provider, the successful expansion and diversification of our portfolio over the past years from council gaming headsets into a broad array of council and PC gaming accessories is enabling us to continue to expand revenues outside of our market-leading council headset business to what we expect will be over 30% of revenues in Q4. Just as retail inventory reductions this year are having an incremental negative impact on revenue, while it's difficult to predict macroeconomic conditions for 2023, we believe that gaming is a category can perform well even in a recession as it has in the past. And, we've got kind of a strategic map of where else we can go that's complimentary to our current businesses and, and like the rest of our expansions can fully leverage the global leadership position we've had for many years in council gaming headsets with all those retail relationships and all the fans we've generated you know, from that."
