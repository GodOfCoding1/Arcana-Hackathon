    "content": " As a reminder, we had a near record second quarter of 2021 given the extraordinarily strong gaming market fueled by the pandemic and stimulus checks, recall too that high freight costs despite recent reductions continue to flow through the P&L as we sell through inventory that incurred those costs. Of course, we are continuing to invest into great new products and portfolio expansion that has enabled our sustained leadership and console headsets and generated significant new revenues over the past years consistent with our long term growth strategy. Non-console headset revenues were 25% of our revenues for Q2 and continue to steadily increase as we expand our presence in PC gaming accessories, console controllers and simulation products. For the second quarter we reported net revenue of 41.3 million compared to a near record 78.6 million in the year ago period, where strong demand for the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s products were driven by stay at home orders, government stimulus payments, and a strong gaming accessories market in 2021. Gross margin in the second quarter was 19.1% compared to 36.5% in the year ago period, due to the higher than normal promotional levels, business mix, higher freight cost, volume driven fixed cost, deleveraging and higher warehouse costs to ensure product supply. Our successful efforts to maintain our strong leadership and counsel headsets while significantly expanding our product portfolio and the market segments we generate revenues in have positioned us very well for the future, both in terms of participating with the long-term tailwinds in gaming, and also continuing to grow revenues and earnings over time."
