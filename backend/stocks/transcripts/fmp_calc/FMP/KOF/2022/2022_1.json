Your line is open. Your line is open. So, if you think about this in terms of what we can deliver through the Coca-Cola system, Coca-Cola FEMSA towards each one of our either small shops or bars in Brazil, et cetera, we're looking to go between from a starting point of about 20% share of wallet being a what that bar or store basically consumes to about 40% share of wallet, okay, to be able to become a very, very customer centric and preferred supplier. And at the same time companies that are very focused on investing behind these brands on consumer insights that can provide us with the tools, so that we can transform those insights into executional capabilities that end up driving more growth, not only for the partners and for the customer, but also as John mentioned for the Coca-Cola portfolio, those are interesting analysis that we're learning actually, and we're incorporating as we learn and we progress in this journey. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open."
