    "content": " This is a very strong start to fiscal 2023, especially in corporate travel, exited the June quarter at approximately 90% of pre-COVID levels as office traffic reverts back to levels seen prior to the pandemic. Consumer business was also strong, domestic travel ending the quarter at approximately 100% of pre-COVID levels. It's recovering strongly since the easing of international travel restrictions at the end of March 2022, is trending at approximately 60% of pre-COVID levels. Gross bookings for business travel, where we are the market leaders, sits the June quarter approximately at 90% pre-COVID levels, the highest level since February 2020. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a very strong secular trend that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s happening with growth in travel at a more general level, specifically for Yatra, there are two factors that I think are playing really well for us is on the corporate travel side, we are seeing very strong inbound demand. As I mentioned in response to Scott's question to get the corporate travel side of things, we are now tending towards 90% of pre-COVID levels, about 60% of the workforce. So on the cash balance side, there is deployment of working capital that's happening as the corporate travel business is recovering, given that now we've reached 90% of pre-COVID levels."
