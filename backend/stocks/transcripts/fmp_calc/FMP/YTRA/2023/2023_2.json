    "content": " Reflecting these dynamics revenue of INR 831 million, which is approximately US$10.2 million was up 85% year-over-year and adjusted revenue of INR 1.52 million, which is US$18.6 million, approximately increased 92% from the previous year. Our adjusted EBITDA was adversely impacted by higher legal costs of INR 24 million incurred in connection with the expansion of the Yatra Board with the addition of Mr. Kaufman, the debt facility that we took subsequent to year end, and IPO-related legal cost. After rebounding strongly in Q1 overall domestic air travel industry volumes contracted by 10% largely on account of Yatra's overall air tax volume declined only 2%, which was substantially lower than the overall industry resulting in market share gains for us. The strong year-on-your growth was driven by a rebound in the air passenger traffic of about 41% and an improvement in needs, which resulted in 110% increase in the Air Ticketing \u00e2\u0080\u0093 adjusted revenue to INR 1 billion. Other operating expenses increased by 91% YoY to INR 390 million primarily due to the increase in payment gateway charges, sales commission and communication, which increased in line with the growth and revenue as the business continued to recover strongly. As Dhruv mentioned earlier, our adjusted EBITDA was adversely impacted by higher legal cost of INR 24 million incurred in connection with the expansion of the Yatra Board with the addition of Mr. Mike Kaufman as well as the debt facility that we took subsequent to the quarter and IPO related legal cost. Subsequent to the quarter end, we raised an additional capital of $10 million from MAK Capital to help maintain a growth momentum and continue to work closely with banks in India to increase our receivable financing limits as the corporate business continue the strong recovery."
