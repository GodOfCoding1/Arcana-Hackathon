Once we get back to normal, given our recent new customer signings and our ability to gain share in this highly fragmented market, we believe it is possible that corporate travel accelerates growth to levels higher than pre-pandemic. When we come out of this pandemic on the back of the secular growth in Indian travel, the mid-teens signing growth we made during the pandemic in new customers and in the growth of our hotel network, our digital platform business, has the potential to grow to the size of our pre-pandemic corporate travel business in the coming years. So in a pre-pandemic level, Scott, in corporate travel revenue right now, August would be trending somewhere close to about 25% of pre-pandemic levels, maybe even slightly north of 25, late 20s."
