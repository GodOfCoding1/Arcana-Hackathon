Business travel impact where we are the market leaders is trending to exceed 70% of it pre-COVID volumes in March 2022, levels not seen since by 2020 and we remain optimistic that it should get back to close to pre-COVID volumes in the June 2022 quarter. Just like business travel, Omicron negatively impacted volumes in January, but Feb onwards we\u2019ve seen strong recovery happening, and March has been even stronger. Firstly, as I mentioned, we\u2019ve seen corporate travel volumes touch about 75% of pre-COVID levels from the month of March. So from that perspective, I\u2019m quite hopeful that as we go into April, May, June and as corporations reset their budgets, we should end up seeing a very strong recovery happening in corporate travel for us on the back of not just recovery of our existing customers, but also on account of the new wins. There was a slight disruption for the freight business in the month of January on account of Omicron, and maybe in the last couple of weeks of December when flights got disrupted, but with international travel opening up and international flights coming back on scheduled and moving away from the bubble agreements, we are seeing a lot more capacity come on stream for international air freight."
