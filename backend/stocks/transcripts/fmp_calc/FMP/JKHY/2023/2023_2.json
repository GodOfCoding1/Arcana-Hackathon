    "content": " Dave actually mentioned that as some of the testing that we're doing already, in the Google Cloud, that's a big one, there's a lot of components that we're doing with real time to help us with some solutions that we're going to look to roll out over the next 18 months or so that we're not prepared to talk about publicly, but components of that. So I would say year-to-date trends that we've seen core being about six driven mostly by cloud strength, payments up about 7% growth and complementary about 8%, for the full year and that's on a non-GAAP basis, for the full year, we're seeing some consistency in those trends. It's why we have so many best-of-breed products in the Jack Henry product family, it was the whole basis for the ProfitStars initiative that we ran until we just changed our branding here, we still have all those solutions, we still have that strategy, we still have a salesforce that only calls on customers outside the Jack Henry core base."
