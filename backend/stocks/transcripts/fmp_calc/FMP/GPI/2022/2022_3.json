    "content": " Those risks include, but are not limited to, risks associated with pricing, volume, inventory supply due to increased customer demand and reduced manufacturing production levels due to component shortages, conditions of markets and adverse developments in the global economy as well as the public health prices related to the COVID-19 virus, and resulting impacts on the demand for new and used vehicles, and related services. These results were largely due to continued strong new vehicle margins that were able to more than offset weak supply, continued double-digit same-store growth in our Aftersales business, significant contributions from our recent acquisitions and record profitability from our UK region. You may now go ahead. You may now go ahead. You may now go ahead. I do think, one of our big growth opportunities in the future, which Daryl is fully aware of, and he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s toured a lot of these shops with me in the UK is we are not yet at the same level of after sales sophistication in the UK than we are in the US in the brands we have there, such as Audi and BMW and Mercedes and Land Rover will really support a lot more service business for us if we can implement some of the general concepts that we've been able to implement in the US and after sales. You may now go ahead. You may now go ahead."
