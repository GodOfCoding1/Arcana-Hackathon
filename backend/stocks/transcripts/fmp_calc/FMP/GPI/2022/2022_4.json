    "content": " Those risks include, but are not limited to, risks associated with pricing, volume, inventory supply due to increased customer demand and reduced manufacturing production levels due to component shortages, conditions of markets and adverse developments in the global economy and resulting impacts on the demand for new and used vehicles and related services. I'm pleased to report that, for the quarter, Group 1 generated adjusted net income from continuing operations of $158 million or $10.86 per diluted share in EPS, an increase of 15% over the fourth quarter last year. And, clearly, the reduction in profitability drives SG&A as a percent of growth, but I think our use of the AcceleRide platform, how we've integrated that into our dealerships, and I think, importantly, the integration that we're going through, integrating AcceleRide or DMS, CRM and credit software, that's going to help us further increase the utilization of our sales executives going forward. Moving forward, if you look at it on a macro basis over the next couple of years, what firms like Cox are saying, which I tend to agree with them, is I believe we're going to see somewhat of a shortage on used cars because of the pandemic-related SAR declines that we saw for three years."
