    "content": " I'm pleased to announce yesterday the Board of Directors approved certain enhancements to our shareholder return model, including doubling the quarterly fixed dividend to $0.12 per share starting with the first quarter 2023, showing their confidence in our ability to continue to generate significant returns to shareholders. For fiscal 2022, we produced $200 million in adjusted free cash flow, of which $56 million or 28% was attributable to the fourth quarter. We expect to generate nearly $100 million of adjusted free cash flow, which, after the fixed dividend, means we have the potential to return about $130 million or almost 20% of our current market cap to investors in 2023. And for our new wells in California also, because of the pricing environment and because of the low cost to drill and complete wells, the rates of returns are also on the order of 100%, and that's what we have assumed for the year in 2023 as well."
