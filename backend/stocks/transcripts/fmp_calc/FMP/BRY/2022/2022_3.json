    "content": " Through the first three quarters of 2022, we have returned $148 million in the form of dividends and share repurchases, which is more than 20% of our current market capitalization. This is inclusive of the quarter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s variable and -- of this quarter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s variable and fixed dividends totaling $0.47 per share, which the Board declared and will be paid on November 28, 2022 to shareholders of record at the close of business on November 15, 2022. This clear and simple shareholder return model is based on the discretionary cash flow we generate, which is calculated as cash flow from operations less the regular quarterly fixed dividend of $0.06 per share and the capital needed to hold oil and gas production flat. Compared to the second quarter of 2022, this quarter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s discretionary free cash flow reflects lower oil prices, as well as the semiannual interest payment made in July equating to $0.18 per share. I will conclude my opening comments by saying that based on current oil strip pricing and our strategy to maintain flat production year-over-year, we expect to be able to return to our shareholders the value of our current market capitalization over three plus years. Since going public in July 2018 over four years ago, we have returned more than $280 million and based on our current plan and commodity strip prices, we anticipate that going forward, we will return our current market capitalization over three plus years."
