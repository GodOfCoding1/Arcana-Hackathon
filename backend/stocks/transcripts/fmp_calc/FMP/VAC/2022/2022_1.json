    "content": " On the third party management front, I\u2019m pleased to announce that we closed on the sale of our VRI Americas business last week for approximately $60 million of net proceeds or 15 times 2022 full year adjusted EBITDA. Adjusting for the impact of approximately $24 million of negative reportability, our adjusted development profit margin expanded by 780 basis points over the first quarter of 2021 to 28.3%, highlighting the benefits of more efficient marketing and sales spend, lower inventory costs, and our business transformation savings. As a result, segment adjusted EBITDA at our exchange and third party management segment increased roughly $2 million or 4% to $43 million from the prior year quarter, with adjusted EBITDA margin remaining strong at 57%. Finally, similar to what we saw towards the end of 2021, our corporate G&A expense increased $15 million in the first quarter year-over-year as a result of higher salary costs due to reduced work week programs in the prior year, higher bonus expense, and a decrease in credits related to incentives under the CARES Act; however, given our synergy efforts, corporate G&A remains well below pre-pandemic levels. So yes, what\u2019s basically happening is because of how we recognize for GAAP revenue those contract sales based on closing, it just means that your contract sales accelerated at the end of the first quarter much higher than what you finished the year at, right, so just the natural result is that that revenue\u2019s coming and the associated EBITDA that I mentioned, the $24 million, and that will happen in the second quarter."
