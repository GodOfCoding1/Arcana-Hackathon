    "content": " We generated $506 million in contract sales this quarter, up 40% from the prior year and adjusted EBITDA grew 55% driven by strong development in rental profit growth in our vacation ownership segment. Profit in our vacation ownership rental business more than doubled in the second quarter compared to the prior year to $38 million, driven by a 5% increase in keys rented and approximately 35% higher revenue per available key. Bringing it all together, adjusted EBITDA on our vacation ownership segment increased by more than 50% in the second quarter compared to the prior year, and we delivered adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 36%, more than 500 basis points higher than last year's second quarter. In our rental business, we continue to expect average revenue per key to increase on a year-over-year basis, but as we've mentioned previously, we plan to allocate a higher portion of our rental inventory for owner usage, which is expected to negatively impact our second half rental profit. You may proceed with your question. You may proceed with your question. So that, that's still how we see the second half of the year from a tour perspective, playing out a continued build versus 2019, and getting back to overall 2019 tour levels in the fourth quarter. You may proceed with your question. You may proceed with your question. In fact, if anything, the average purchase price for owners versus last year in the second quarter is actually slightly higher, and it's even, on a growth percentage, even higher for first time buyers. You may proceed with your question."
