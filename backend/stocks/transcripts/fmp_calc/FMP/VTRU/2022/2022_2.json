    "content": " So, as I am saying, when you talk about the collection process and you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve experienced as a whole for Uniasselvi, is let's say benchmark for Uniasselvi and when we talk about pricing throughout the last years, I guess that Uniasselvi have done a quite nice job regarding every ticket and pricing, which is going to be very useful for Unicesumar going forward. Uniasselvi, we are at the close number group 29% in intake this first quarter, the first semester, sorry, of this year, compared to the same period of last year, while had very strong growth much I'd say stronger than Uniasselvi. But of course, with the condition of Unicesumarthis increased by a 100% given the strong health courses of Unicesumar and on the -- continuation education slide, this is a business that on organic base was more or less stable over time, slight increase on a quarterly number, with Unicesumar. So, they have quite low PDA expenses and a percentage of net revenue and at the end on a full consolidated basis, this quarter, our PDA went down from 16.8% last year to around 16.2% on organic data this quarter only Uniasselvi and 12.5% of net revenue when it's taken to account Unicesumar. On the other hand, as we found the first semester of this year, the tickets of Unicesumar because of this strong growth they are more or less 2%, 3%, 5% lower than, than what we saw last year as we saw in the first semester of this year. So on the other hand, in case of only a 70, we are still seeing the growth, and as we have been seeing in the last say semesters, so nothing different from what we saw in the first half of these year overtime, as I said, we are going to work more on the pricing and positioning of Uniasselvi including tickets overtime, we don't expect this to be actually to have major changes in the second semester of this year in real life."
