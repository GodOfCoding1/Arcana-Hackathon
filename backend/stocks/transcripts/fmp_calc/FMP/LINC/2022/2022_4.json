    "content": " Revenues ranging from $345 million and $360 million; adjusted EBITDA ranging between $19 million and $24 million; adjusted net income ranging from $7 million to $11 million; student stock growth ranging from 5% to 10%; and capital expenditures ranging from $35 million and $40 million, with approximately $30 million earmarked towards growth initiatives, including program expansions. Consistent with our seasonality, we expect revenue to grow during the first half of the year in low single digits with slightly higher growth in the second half; operating expenses should be in the mid- to low-$80 million range with the exception occurring in Q3 when the higher number of starts is expected to push total operating expenses in the mid-to-low $90 million range; interest income of approximately $1 million from short-term investments spread evenly through the year; non-cash stock-based compensation expense of $2.5 million, recognized evenly each quarter; depreciation and amortization of approximately $9 million with about 60% in the second half of the year; and finally, our effective tax rate is expected to be around 28.5%."
