    "content": " We did increase the total number of enrolled students as of March 31 over last year's total, and we believe we will return to student start growth in the second quarter. Also, as Scott highlighted, last year's first quarter start growth was the highest of the year at 30.6%, which set a high benchmark for start growth in this quarter -- in this year's first quarter. The first quarter has the largest plan increases in expenses, partially resulting from the onetime $3 million benefit to bad debt expense in 2021 from the forgiveness of student accounts receivable for students that were impacted by COVID-19. Finally, to conclude on our first quarter results and our current trends, we remain confident in our financial outlook and are reiterating our previously communicated full year 2022 guidance as follows: revenue between $350 million and $365 million, adjusted EBITDA between $35 million and $40 million, net income ranging from $17 million to $22 million, student stock growth of 5% to 10%; and lastly, capital expenditures between $7 million to $9 million."
