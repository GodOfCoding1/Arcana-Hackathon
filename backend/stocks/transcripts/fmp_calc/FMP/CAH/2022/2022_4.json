    "content": " Operating earnings decreased 12%, which primarily reflects a year-over-year headwind of approximately $300 million related to net inflationary impacts and global supply chain constraints in medical, partially offset by Pharma segment profit growth. We expect a similar net impact of approximately $300 million from inflation, global supply chain constraints and mitigation actions in fiscal '23 or a minimal impact on a year-over-year basis. We expect the gross impact of inflation and global supply chain constraints in the first quarter to be approximately $150 million, approximately 25% of this offset through our mitigation actions."
