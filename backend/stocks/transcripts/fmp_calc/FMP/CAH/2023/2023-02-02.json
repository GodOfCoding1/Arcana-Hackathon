    "content": " Operating earnings of $467 million were in line with the second quarter of last year, this reflects growth in Pharma segment profit offset by the decline in Medical segment profit, which was anticipated. Second quarter revenue increased 15% to $48 billion, driven by brand and Specialty Pharmaceutical sales growth from existing and net new customers. I was wondering if you could talk about a little bit more about the pharma improvement in the back half of the year, specifically like as you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve had time to sort of think through the pharma reorganization and sort of continued cost cutting benefit is that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s improving the operating profit growth. Of course, in the second half of the year there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a meaningful step up in the Medical segment performance, and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s of course being driven more than anything by the pricing on inflation and the first instance we would expect of cost stepping down as it relates to the international freight. So on pricing, I would think about pricing as being a fairly stairstep process beginning back with our first temporary price increase in March 2022 so what we have \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and when we first shared was the 20% mitigation of inflation soon after in the fourth quarter of last year, then that went to 25% in the first quarter of this year."
