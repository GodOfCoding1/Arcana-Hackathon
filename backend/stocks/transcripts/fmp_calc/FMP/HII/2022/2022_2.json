    "content": " Moving onto Slide 7, Ingalls revenues of $658 million in the quarter decreased $12 million or 1.8% from the same period last year, driven primarily by lower revenues on the DDG program, partially offset by high amphibious ship revenues. Ingalls operating income of $106 million and margin of 16.1% in the quarter were up significantly from last year due to favorable changes in contract estimates as well as higher risk retirement on the LPD program, partially offset by lower DDG risk retirement."
