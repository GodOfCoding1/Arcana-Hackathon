    "content": " I would like to highlight that the adjusted EBITDA of our North American business operation totaled BRL2.6 billion with an adjusted margin of 32.9%, both historical records for our third quarter and above the margins achieved by our local competitors confirming that our strategy and position in North America has been successful over the last few years. I would also like to highlight the approval of an additional investment of around BRL200 million in our specialty steel mill in Monroe, Michigan for the modernization and technological upgrade of the rolling mill as part of an investment plan of approximately BRL2 billion aimed at making our special steel operations in the US, especially in Monroe, one of the most modern plants in the world. Furthermore, I would like to highlight that the analysis of civil construction GDP for the second quarter of '22 when compared to the same period of 2021 shows a strong performance in the sector, growing 9.9% according to the latest survey conducted by the Brazilian industry. In Peru, the demand for steel continues at good levels, driven by the construction industry, which continues to evolve, resulting in a 6% increase in sales in the local market in the third quarter when compared to the previous year. During this quarter, if we take into account this BRL1.2 billion that we paid in the third quarter related to dividends paid in the second quarter plus BRL600 million that we invested in share buyback of  we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have nearly 60% of our free cash flow of the quarter invested in return to shareholders. Back to you, Renata. Back to you, Renata."
