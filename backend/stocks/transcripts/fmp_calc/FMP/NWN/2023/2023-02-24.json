    "content": " On a quarter-over-quarter basis, our gas utility provided an additional $7.4 million or $0.05 per share due to higher earnings from increased revenues and lower pension expense. Utility depreciation and general taxes increased $1.8 million due to higher property, plant and equipment as we continue to invest in our system. On a per share basis, our gas utility contributed an additional $0.10 of earnings in 2022, offset by a reduction of $0.12 in contribution from our other businesses. We invested nearly $340 million into the business, most of which was for gas utility capital expenditures and invested $94 million for water and wastewater acquisitions. Related to our financings, we issued 4.4 million shares of common stock in 2022 to raise $209 million and executed agreements for $140 million of incremental long-term debt to support the gas utility and $150 million for growth in our water utilities. Gas utility capital expenditures for the year are expected to be in the range of $310 million to $350 million, a similar level of investment to 2022 as we continue to have significant projects related to our gas utility system."
