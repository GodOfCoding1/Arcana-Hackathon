    "content": " For the second quarter, we reported net income of $1.7 million or $0.05 per share, compared to a net loss of $700,000 or $0.02 per share for the same period in 2021, an increase of $0.07 per share. Utility margin in the Gas Distribution segment increased $2.3 million as a result of customer growth and new rates, which collectively contributed $1.7 million. Utility O&M increased $3 million, reflecting higher contractor costs for safety and reliability projects, professional services and information technology costs. Net income from our other businesses increased $900,000 for the second quarter of 2022 due to higher asset management revenues and lower business development costs. For the first 6 months of 2022, we reported net income of $58 million or $1.77 per share, compared to net income of $58.8 million or $1.92 for the same period in 2021. The $800,000 decline in net income for the 6-month period reflects an improvement in gas utility net income of $3 million while the results from our other businesses declined $3.8 million, as the prior period benefited from the higher asset management revenues related to the February 2021 cold weather events."
