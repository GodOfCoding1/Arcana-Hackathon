    "content": " For the first quarter, consolidated revenues increased 1.4% versus the prior year period as sales growth was partially offset by the divestiture of a significant portion of our international operations in the first quarter of 2021. Retail net sales increased 2.3% versus last year, driven by strong sales growth in several seasonal event categories, as well as an increase in average order value versus prior year. Brand comparable sales increased 2.1% year-over-year as the strength in our seasonal categories was partially offset by underperformance in select everyday categories, driven by Omicron-related softness in January and softer-than-expected March trends due to the difficult consumer backdrop. Excluding the impact of the divestiture, net third-party wholesale revenues increased 14.5% versus prior year period, driven by continued positive performance at our Anagram balloon division, higher sales to our franchise and independent customers and continued improvement in our Canadian business performance. As Brad mentioned, during the quarter, we experienced increased port fees and higher-than-anticipated freight cost which we estimate impacted gross profit by approximately $12 million or 280 basis points versus prior year. Adjusted operating expenses were approximately $152.2 million or 35.1% of net sales, a 260 basis point increase versus the prior year, primarily driven by increased store labor costs due to wage rate growth. Inventory was up approximately 21% year-over-year, driven primarily by increased input costs, including capitalized freight expense, higher levels of in-transit inventory due to ongoing supply chain delays, as well as initiatives to improve in-stock positions."
