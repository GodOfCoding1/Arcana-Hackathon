    "content": " We're pleased to announce that we've increased our AFFO guidance by $0.02 per share at the midpoint, implying year-over-year growth of 5% on total AFFO per share and just over 6% on real estate AFFO per share. I think first, we've talked about interest rates, and we're expecting to see that really flow through in the fourth quarter more as it relates to our variable rate debt, which is -- as I said, it's limited to our credit facility, but I think the increase in base rates there, we're seeing flow through our fourth quarter. So we're seeing the impact of base rates drive up there, and that's really going to have kind of an impact on the quarter to the tune of about $0.02 in the fourth quarter, I would say. I think we're a little too soon for us to be getting into next year's guidance at this point, and we're hesitant really to kind of look at any 1 quarter. I think since mid-September around the time we saw the sharper increases in base rates and debt spreads, we've probably seen another 25 to 50 basis points up, and that's broad U.S. and Europe. And it's clear where debt costs have gone, and I think many sellers are still reluctant to lock in higher pricing, but they're getting there because the alternatives are perhaps more expensive, especially when you consider sale leasebacks."
