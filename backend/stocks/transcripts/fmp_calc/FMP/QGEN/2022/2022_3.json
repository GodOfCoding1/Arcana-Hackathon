    "content": " Here, we saw solid double-digit CER growth in the non-COVID portfolio that represented 75% of sales in the third quarter of '22. The Genomics NGS product group, which represents about 10% of total sales delivered sales growth of 6% at constant exchange rates as COVID related revenues continued to be soft. Based on the better-than-expected results in the third quarter and also the solid outlook for the fourth quarter, we have increased our full year sales outlook to about USD2.25 billion at constant exchange rates. In the first three quarters of '22, we delivered 14% CER growth in our non-core product groups and expect double-digit CER growth to continue into the fourth quarter putting us on track to achieve our full year goal. For the fourth quarter, we have set an outlook for sales to reach at least USD520 million at constant exchange rates, that for adjusted diluted EPS of at least $0.50 also at CER. First, our results exceeded the outlook for the third quarter of 2022, driven by the 18% CER growth from our non-COVID product group and adjusted earnings per share of $0.55 CER well above the previous outlook of $0.48 CER. And as we look into 2023, based on what we see today, there is no reason why QIAGEN non-COVID product group should not continue at a double-digit CER growth rate in the new year as well."
