    "content": " We are very pleased to report strong results in the first quarter of 2022, which exceeded our outlook and reflects a solid performance in our non-COVID products of 14%, CER growth. Therefore, we now expect sales of at least $2.12 billion for the full year 2022 to be mainly driven by double-digit CER growth coming from our non-COVID portfolio. In our COVID-19 product groups, testing demand in the first part of the quarter resulted in 18% CER growth in sales, when we were actually expecting a decline. I think on 2023, I think on the non-COVID side, I think we always said that we rather believe -- first of all, we haven't given any official midterm guidance, but I do think as you see how we started in the year that we also reconfirmed today, also for the full year, double-digit non-COVID growth rate."
