    "content": " However, this product group saw an overall sales decline of 7% CER due to the significant headwinds created by reduced COVID testing demand compared to the second quarter '21. The sales trends for the clinical PCR testing systems, QIAstat-Dx and NeuMoDx remained well on track with our full year expectations, and we were particularly pleased with double-digit CER growth in consumables or QIAstat-Dx. And it's very interesting, as Roland said in his part to see that, for example, the ratio between COVID and non-COVID in Europe of consumption of assays on NeuMoDx is still very much impacted by COVID, obviously in Europe, but has decreased in favor on the non-COVID portfolio already in Q2. So I would say, given the growth rate we are delivering, in particular, now more or less in 2.5 years on the non-COVID side, I do think there is clearly also we want to believe that we are able to match the balance between both quite nicely."
