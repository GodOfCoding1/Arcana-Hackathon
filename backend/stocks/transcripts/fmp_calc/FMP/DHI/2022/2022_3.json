    "content": " 54% of the homes we closed in the past 12 months were priced under $350,000 and our average sales price is approximately $100,000 lower than the average other public homebuilders, positioning us to continue aggregating share. Our third quarter home sales revenues increased 18% to $8.3 billion on 21,308 homes closed, up from $7 billion on 21,588 homes closed in the prior year. As a result, our net sales orders in the third quarter decreased 7% to 16,693 homes and our total net sales order value increased 8% from the prior year to $6.9 billion. During the quarter, we will evaluate demand and adjust our homes in inventory and starts pace to meet current market conditions. Based on the projected completion dates of our homes under construction and current market conditions, we expect to generate consolidated revenues in the fourth quarter of $10 billion to $10.8 billion and homes closed by our homebuilding operations to be in the range of 23,500 to 25,500 homes. And \u00e2\u0080\u0093 so we will just be adjusting our SAR space, looking at our overall homes and inventory and our spec levels and alongside demand over the coming months to position ourselves as best we can through the current market. And then I think Bill said earlier in one of his Q&A responses that our can rate hasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t necessarily gotten worse since June, but it has stayed elevated into July, and sales have continued to be a challenge, but we do still see a decent level of demand out in the market and are selling and closing homes every day so far in July. Obviously, as we see how the current market conditions transition here, we will be evaluating the depth and demand, the strength of the demand and then positioning our land and our lots and our homes and inventory to match those conditions as we go into next year."
