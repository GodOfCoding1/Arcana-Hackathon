I mean I think what's really changed in the dynamic is that, if you go back five to seven years ago when prices were high operators generally would consent to all of their non-operated properties and just spend extra money. And so what I would describe to you is, we're not -- what we're seeing is instead of a quarter of a net well here with some acreage or 0.5 a net well there, we're seeing pad developments with up to 40% working interest that could be five to seven net wells. Your line is now live. Your line is now live. Your line is now live. I mean, obviously there is being one more round from month to month, and depending on when we're adding those wells, earlier or later in the quarter, that's obviously going to drive things too. Your line is now live. Your line is now live. Your line is now live."
