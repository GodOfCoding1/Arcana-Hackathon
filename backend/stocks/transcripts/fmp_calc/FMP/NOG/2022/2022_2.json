    "content": " We produced nearly 73,000 BOE per day in the quarter, and we have already generated over $260 million of free cash flow in the first half of 2022, more than we produced during all of 2021. The breakdown by basin remains consistent with the first quarter as the Permian makes up almost half our oil-weighted wells in process, while the 2-year high in the Williston rig count is providing for additional activity. While the revolving borrowings ended only slightly lower quarter-over-quarter, that's a function of the $17 million deposit on our Williston acquisition as well as over a $13 million reduction in our 2028 notes. I've seen just from anecdotally, John, and I'll let the smarter people in the room answer the rest of this, but when we've seen kind of stand-up rig operators looking for development capital in the Permian, $2 million to $3 million a well difference."
