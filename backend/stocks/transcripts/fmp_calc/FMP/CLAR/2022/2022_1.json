    "content": " Due to the continued supply chain and logistics challenges and other delays caused by COVID-19 related shutdowns in Southeast Asia, we were unable to fulfill roughly $10 million in demand with product during the first quarter that had already been produced, but stuck in transit. Consolidated gross margins in the first quarter increased 320 basis points to 39.1% compared to 35.9% in the year ago period and it was up 290 basis points to 39.3%, when adding in the $0.3 million of fair value inventory step-up charge associated with the MAXTRAX's acquisition. But when we look at the inventory levels that existed at the end of the quarter, I'd say that we're sitting on $20 million of extra inventory that is just working through the system and that we purposely brought on in order to mitigate some of the supply chain or logistic challenges or delays that we're experiencing."
