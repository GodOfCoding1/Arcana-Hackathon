    "content": " Through a disciplined approach to new product introductions, identifying continuous improvement activities within our supply chain and operations and increasing the number of touch points with retail partners and consumers, we believe we are well positioned for continued market share gains as we seek to elevate the awareness and demand for our brands within our targeted markets. In the seasonally slowest third quarter, our Adventure segment contributed sales of $18.6 million, reflecting lower consumer demand given the challenging economic environment and constraints on new vehicle deliveries, which impacted new product sales both in Australia and the North American market. Given the continued outperformance in our Precision Sports segment, we were raising our full year expectations in this business to now grow 18% to approximately $130 million from $127.5 million previously. Anna, your line is open. Anna, your line is open."
