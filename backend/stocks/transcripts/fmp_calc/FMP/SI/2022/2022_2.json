    "content": " Turning to SEN Leverage, our Bitcoin collateralized lending product, we saw continued strong demand for the product with total approved commitments growing 28% to $1.4 billion compared to $1.1 billion at the end of the first quarter. Despite a challenging environment in the overall digital asset industry, Silvergate reported record second quarter net income available to common shareholders of $35.9 million or $1.13 per diluted common share compared to $24.7 million or $0.79 per diluted share in the first quarter and up from $20.9 million or $0.80 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2021. Revenue of $79.8 million was up 33% compared to the first quarter and up 88% compared to the same quarter a year ago, driven by higher net interest income, which I will discuss in more detail later on. Turning to Slide 7, net interest income was $70.5 million in the second quarter, an increase of $20.1 million compared to the first quarter and $40.2 million compared to the second quarter of 2021, as we benefited from the rising rate environment. Thanks for the question, Mike. Thanks for the question, Mike."
