    "content": " It wouldn't surprise me if we had a quarter or two that were flat or probably even down during this year, but overall, I think you should \u00e2\u0080\u0093 I think most years, we're saying low double-digit growth on the loan book. And so, that factor is in addition to the factors that Kelly uses when calculating loan and deposit beta, and it, kind of goes back to Jason's comments regarding the tougher year and the slower growth, and that's why we're hedging instead of the usual low-double-digit, we're back into the high-single-digits, just in case. And so, yes, it's a loan growth story, which made us motivated as to make sure that we increased our reserve, and we're really in that low 1.2 to 1.25 area, which we're comfortable operating in. So, we're encouraged, but we're still keeping one on nonaccrual, and we're doing that as a matter of prudence relative to that unknown tail risk, which we've always said for the COVID cycle-in to cycle-out, it was at close to 1%, and we haven't hit that 1%, but if that tail-end risk didn't materialize and things went the other way on that credit, it's a small number, but that's really it. And I think it's a testament to the team to stay disciplined and stay focused because if we didn't have a discipline, and we didn't have that focus, Jason, I would argue that it would have been really easy for us to run our energy book to 20% or 22% in hospitality to 25% and we're just not going to do it."
