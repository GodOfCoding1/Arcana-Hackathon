    "content": " As our customers position themselves for the summer months, they are choosing to hang on to older and as cheaper containers as new production units remain much more expensive - Production of new units at factory has moderated substantially to about 300,000 TEU per month with shipping lines placing over 70% of recent orders. But based on what you know today, it certainly seems like the lease rental income line will certainly see much more kind of flatter trajectory from here and then as containers maybe turn and start to pick up, I suppose there could be some upper pressure on the direct expenses, but it does sound like you guys are seeing a lot of demand in the resale market. I think what really matters very much for us going forward is the fact that new containers remain historically at an elevated level, which means that for shipping line, it makes more sense to renew existing leases and existing containers because they are simply a lot cheaper than taking on new container into their fleet."
