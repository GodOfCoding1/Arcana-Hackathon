    "content": " For the first quarter lease rental income was $199 million in line with the fourth quarter, despite two fewer billing days and 17% higher than last year. The start of the year has historically been a seasonally slower period, but we continue to see strong underlying consumer demand and deployed close to $0.5 billion of CapEx on long-term and attractive leases, while increasing our share buyback to almost one million shares for the quarter. Q1 depreciation expense was $72 million and is expected to remain mostly flat in Q2, as most of the recent CapEx was deployed under finance leases."
