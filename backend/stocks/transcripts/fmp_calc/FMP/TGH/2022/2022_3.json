    "content": " As we had anticipated, the demand for new container was muted in the third quarter as shipping lines now operate with sufficient container inventories following robust fleet expansion over the last two years and an overall softening of cargo volumes. This uptick in redelivery has allowed us to capitalize on continued favorable resale market conditions, higher disposal volumes, albeit at lower average sales price per unit have translated in a third quarter gain on sales of $23 million, in line with last quarter's record figure. And I think we're in a situation where as you know, lead times on containers are very short, and that essentially explains why supply and demand tend to rebalance fairly quickly in the container supply world, whereas the lead times for new ship deliveries are much, much longer, typically two, three years before a ship gets delivered, which really means that it's a completely different ball game. And again, it's primarily driven by container that have reached sales age, containers that shipping lights have been holding on over the past quarter over the past two years actually, and that are now being returned because they're so banged that they can't be operated and their prime candidates to be retired and to be essentially sold in the secondary market or scrap.So will we see a small decline in utilization? So taking that into consideration, we probably would estimate that secondhand prices on average would probably move towards that level of 50% of 2,200, so that give or take, 1,100, which is still substantially higher than our current residuals on a lot of those containers and that should continue to provide us with some gain on sales, but definitely gain on sales that will be more modest than what we have seen over the past three, four quarters."
