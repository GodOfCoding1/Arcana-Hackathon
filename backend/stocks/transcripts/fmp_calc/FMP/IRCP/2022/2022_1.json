    "content": " So we see this high and ridiculous figures of growth 570% and 322%, so we consider that it's better to understand the situation that we focused on the top right chart here, where we compare our sales of this quarter with the previous quarter that we had regular sales. This is just the beginning when we were reopening the shopping centers and on this quarter, we see a very good increase in terms of sales of our tenants, that put us in only 10% compared to real term sales of a quarter, where the shopping was completely opened. We see a slight increase, that's because the incorporation of the 200 Della Paolera building, which we are right now and it's our head office - our headquarter here. On Page 6, we can see that we sold in November 2021, three floors of the 200 Della Paolera building, 3,500 square meters of GLA for a total price of $32 million, which it's almost $9,000 - it's $8,950 per square meter on this building, which is an incredible sale. And when we compare with the previous year, first quarter 2020, we see a gain of ARS2.3 billion, so we have a decrease of 35% at the adjusted EBITDA. But the good news here is that we see a first quarter with an EBITDA of $15.5 million, that is above all the previous quarters of - since the beginning of the pandemic."
