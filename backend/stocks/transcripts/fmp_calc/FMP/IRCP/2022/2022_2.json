    "content": " The occupancy on the Buenos Aires hotels still very low at 36% occupancy that we hope to recover going forward and in the Llao Llao Hotel, we see a big evolution and a big recovery recovering the same occupancy in the pre-pandemic level, but here affected by some closure of some rooms that we are developing and turnaround some rooms here. Shopping mall in the six months we see a big recovery 227%, reaching ARS4.3 billion of adjusted EBITDA that if we compare with pre-pandemic levels this is still below the pre-pandemic levels was ARS5.5 billion. We sold some square meters that used to generate $1.6 million of EBITDA, new square meters that generate $2.9 million, the vacancy that generate $1.6 million of difference and rent price that generated $0.5 million of decrease in EBITDA. But here compared with the previous quarters, the main effect or the main impact was the approval of Costa Urbana that generated $150 million more in valuation that at the official exchange rate that is like $300 million. So finally, regarding the debt profile, we can see here the evolution of the net debt on a consolidated basis between IRSA and IRSA commercial properties that we reduced significantly the debt from $755 million before the pandemic to $501 million. That $40 million that we committed to the city at the official exchange rate is something that probably could take place in the next, I don't know two to five years."
