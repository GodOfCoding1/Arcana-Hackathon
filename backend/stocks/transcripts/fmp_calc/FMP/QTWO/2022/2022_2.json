    "year": 2022,
    "date": "2022-08-06 09:04:06",
    "content": " In our Emerging Businesses, the quarter was highlighted by the announcement of Q2 innovation studios partnership with Rocket Mortgage, continued execution and adding new financial institutions and partners to the ecosystem and signing a large lending customer within Helix, all of which Jonathan will unpack shortly. In conclusion, the first half of the year was highlighted by broad based product adoption in our digital banking and lending solutions, as well as the announcement of key programs and partnerships for our Emerging Businesses, allowing us to engage in strategic verticals we haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t previously served. So while we certainly expect in the back half of the year to start seeing what you referenced in terms of the market opening up and more corporate development activity and opportunities, we didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t see it yet in the second quarter and I think it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s largely because of the lag between what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s happened in the public markets and how that slowly translates into private sellers and so we do expect that will happen, though."
