    "content": " In fact, we think, by our measure, it's the largest gap we've ever seen and -- well, is seen in 50 years between food at home and food away from home, meaning that food at home has increased pricing significantly faster than what food away from home, McDonald's and others in our industry have done. I think -- when we look also at what's going on in Europe, we've got a very strong coffee business in a number of markets, and I think driving that and using that particularly as a way to drive transactions, I think that's also an opportunity for us. I would say, what they're doing at this point is they're taking advantage of the strong health of the business to get multiples of 8-to-10x when they're selling, which is the best that we've seen in, I think, anybody's recent memory on this."
