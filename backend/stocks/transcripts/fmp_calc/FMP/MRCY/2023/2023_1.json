    "content": " This backlog, combined with strong bookings expected in Q2 and for the remainder of the year, position us well to deliver increased revenue and EBITDA in Q2 and the second half of fiscal '23. We believe that Q1 marked the bottom in fiscal '23 for organic revenue growth, free cash flow and margins. Last quarter, we forecasted a free cash outflow in Q1, driven by lower net income, onetime payments as well as working capital build associated with continued supply chain constraints. In addition to organic and M&A-related growth, our 5-year plan includes continued margin expansion driven by 1MPACT, leading to stronger adjusted EBITDA as well as improved working capital efficiency and cash conversion. Yes, it's a good question. Yes, it's a good question."
