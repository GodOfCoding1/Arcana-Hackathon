    "content": " As a result of these actions, over the past 7 fiscal years, we've extracted substantial cost and revenue synergies, leading to adjusted EBITDA growing more than 9 times or twice the growth in revenues. Looking ahead to fiscal '23, we continue to anticipate a return to above industry average organic revenue growth driven by the strong bookings and backlog growth in fiscal '22. As I've said, we're maintaining our full year fiscal '22 guidance for revenue, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS, reflecting the incremental acquired revenue from Avalex and Atlanta Micro, offset by the elevated risk we expect to continue through the second half of the year. At the midpoint, we expect organic revenue to be approximately 9% from Q3 last year as a result of the lower bookings in fiscal '21. We expect free cash flow to adjusted EBITDA for Q3 to be approximately breakeven, driven by continued impact cash outflows, working capital investments associated with quarter-over-quarter revenue growth as well as additional interest expense. For the full fiscal year '22, as I've said, we're expecting double-digit bookings growth and book-to-bill above 1. Good evening, Mark and Mike. And so despite the headwinds that we're experiencing now in the latter half of '21 and '22 to date, we absolutely believe that our long-term business model is in fact, as Mike said we've just updated our 5-year plan at the midyear mark and continue to believe in our ability to grow the business at high single digit to low double-digit rates on average over time, as we have done for many, many years now. Good evening, Mark and Mike. And remember, the bookings slowdown that we saw in the second half of fiscal '21 and in the first half of this fiscal year, which we expect to ramp is largely what has driven the slowdown in organic revenue growth."
