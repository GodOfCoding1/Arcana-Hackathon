    "content": " Mercury's total revenue for Q3 was down 1.5% from our prior year record as anticipated, reflecting the orders that slept as well as the supply chain and labor market challenges. Despite the industry headwinds and order delays, we anticipate total company revenue growth of approximately 8% to 10% for fiscal 2022, exceeding $1 billion for the first time together with record adjusted EBITDA. Operating expenses were up 7% compared to Q3 last year, in large part driven by the recent acquisitions and related amortization expense, as well as $6.3 million of restructuring and other charges, most of them related to third-party consulting costs associated with our 1MPACT program. Inventory increased approximately $8 million in Q3, mainly due to accelerated raw material purchases to support higher demand and mitigate supply chain risk in Q4 and into fiscal 2023. So, while we expect some of the unbilled to come down in Q3, we have other programs where we're seeing supply chain decommits and we actually think unbilled are going to be up at the end of Q4 due to program timing and milestones. But if you think about, what we said in the prepared remarks and what we expect to have happen in the fourth quarter, we are expecting bookings to actually accelerate over the 41% growth that we had year-over-year in Q3 resulting in substantial growth at the year level, as well as a huge increase in terms of backlog as well. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. Your line is now open."
