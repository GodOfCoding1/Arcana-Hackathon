    "content": " As a result, we believe that, we can replicate what we've done successfully since fiscal 2014 and achieve Mercury's full growth and adjusted EBITDA potential organically and through M&A over the next five years. Looking further ahead to fiscal 2023, we expect a return to high single-digit low double-digit organic revenue growth driven by bookings and backlog growth in fiscal 2022. As we announced, Avalex is expected to generate approximately $40 million in revenue, for the 12 months ended December 31, 2022 with adjusted EBITDA margins of approximately 25% or $10 million. For the second half of our fiscal year, we expect Avalex, to contribute approximately $20 million in revenue and $5 million in adjusted EBITDA. In Q2, we expect a book-to-bill above one, which will drive the revenue growth and margin expansion in the second half of the fiscal year. Now, I think we still feel pretty good that Q1 is the low watermark for bookings this fiscal year and we're going to see progressive growth in both bookings and revenue as the year progresses. So for the second half from a revenue perspective, as we said, we're expecting double-digit growth in revenue versus the first half and year-over-year. So taking it down a level, if we look at in the second half from a programmatic perspective, the growth, what the programs that are going to drive growth are LTAMDS F-18, SEWIP, F-16 SABR F-35 and not large FMS program that moved from Q1 of last year. And so, if you look at LTAMDS, we're still expecting substantial growth in bookings year-over-year, despite us lowering our original bookings forecast, given that the LTAMDS award moved to fiscal 2023."
