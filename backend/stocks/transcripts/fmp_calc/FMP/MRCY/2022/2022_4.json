    "content": " On the bottom line, we delivered adjusted EBITDA margins of nearly 25% in the fourth quarter and a record $71.6 million in adjusted EBITDA, which is up 36% from the third quarter and up 21% from the record set in Q4 last year. Another year of expected double-digit growth in bookings and another positive book-to-bill in fiscal 2023, give us the confidence that we can and will return to organic growth back in line with our model in fiscal 2024, provided supply chain and labor market conditions normalize. Your line is now open. We're actually expecting very strong growth in bookings in the first half, which should actually help improve the linearity as we head into fiscal year 2024. So unfortunately, if you step back, we're kind of in a multiyear industry event here and the linearity of bookings in both fiscal year 2021 and fiscal year 2022 hasn't helped us with respect to the timing of revenue and EBITDA. Your line is now open. Good afternoon, Mark and Mike. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. So the biggest area that we're probably seeing from an inflation perspective is in relation to semiconductors, which I think is, as I've mentioned in my prepared remarks, it came for about 38% of our external spend and that's supporting the 70% of our revenue, which is coming from processing systems. Your line is now open. Good afternoon, Mark and Mike. Your line is now open. Yes, I think if anything, the pipeline of opportunities associated with the 1MPACT is increasing, we did push out the achievement of the goal a year largely because I think we're seeing the 1MPACT of inflation at the back end of fiscal 2022 and more so in fiscal year 2023. Your line is now open."
