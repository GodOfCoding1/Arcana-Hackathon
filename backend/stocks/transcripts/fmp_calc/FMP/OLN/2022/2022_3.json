    "content": " And in fact, it's been our guidance range now for the last 3 quarters as we've really been preparing this window to show that Olin delivers a different level of free cash flow than we did before. And so if you -- Mike, if you're asking about sort of what's the fundamental decline in the marketplace, it's likely to be less than the decline in Olin volumes because remember, Olin tends to eat those shortfalls in demand from a production standpoint. Well, I mean, when the when the demand declines dramatically on the chlorine and chlorine derivatives side relative to that sort of global industrial demand for caustic there's just not enough caustic to satisfy that demand, even though that demand has declined a good bit. However, as our levered free cash flow does grow from sort of that trough level of $1.1 billion in a year, there's going to be opportunities to acquire existing assets, do joint ventures with existing assets do additional alliances as well."
