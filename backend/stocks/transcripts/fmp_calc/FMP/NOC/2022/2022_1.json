    "content": " We had talked about our mix being roughly 50% cost type and 50% fixed plus price that\u2019s exactly where we are as we sit here in the first quarter, and we don\u2019t see that varying too much over the next couple of years, maybe a percentage point higher on cost plus or two, as we look at the next couple of years. Thank you very much. Certainly, we saw those most notably at the beginning of this year and they have in our case really moderated as we looked at March and April performance, but we\u2019re keeping up close eye on everything from the tight labor market to inflation and COVID-related headwinds that could slowdown our growth rate even though we have strong budget support for our programs. And it\u2019s a bit early in the year for me to try to put a number on our 2023 growth rate given all of those puts and takes, but we\u2019ll certainly keep you updated on each quarterly call on our outlook for next year. So I thought I would ask this, it looks like in the budget, there\u2019s about a $2 billion funding increase in fiscal 2023 versus the rate that the levels that we\u2019ve seen over the last several years. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. It is likely to be higher than we anticipated coming into the year, but still don\u2019t see it crossing the 1.0 threshold and space is a key driver as you noted of that strength, but we see broad strength in booking this year beyond what we had expected, some nice competitive wins in our Defense Systems business and our aero business also having strong awards, particularly as we look to book lot 15 aggregate demand on F-35 this year. Thank you very much. Thank you very much."
