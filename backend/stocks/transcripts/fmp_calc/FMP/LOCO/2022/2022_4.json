    "content": " We are pleased with our performance in the fourth quarter as system wide comparable restaurant sales increased by 4.7%, including a 6.5% increase at company-owned and a 3.5% increase at our franchise locations. While we continue to be pressured by inflation, our team's did an admirable job managing our businesses, delivering a restaurant operating profit margin of 14.7%, which was 230 basis points better than the third quarter, and adjusted net income earnings per share of $0.16. As highlighted earlier, during the fourth quarter, we continue to see improvement in company and franchise-operated restaurants drag-through times, last visit excellence scores, social media ratings, customer complaints and value scores. Labor and related expenses as a percentage of company restaurant sales decreased 40 basis points year-over-year to 31.9%, as wage increases were offset by higher menu prices and lower overtime expense as staffing levels continue to improve. If we now look at where we are quarter-to-date, really company comp sales are up a little over 6% and franchisees, I think right around 0.5% positive, which is actually pretty strong given -- we're estimating that the weather impact is probably in the range of 2% to 4% in terms of same-store sales growth. I mean, these things always take a little bit of time as you're bringing new franchisees in the system, but we feel like again, we'll get some more development deals done this year on that. So again I think the system as a whole has made tremendous progress on operations, the franchisees despite the fact that we're already operating well at high levels a year ago have made even more improvements and the company has made dramatic improvements."
