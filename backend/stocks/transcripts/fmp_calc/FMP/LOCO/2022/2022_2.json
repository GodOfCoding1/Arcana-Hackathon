    "content": " Looking ahead, third quarter to date through July 27, system-wide comparable restaurant sales increased 2.4%, consisting of a 0.4% increase at company-owned restaurants and a 5.5% increase at franchise restaurants, all of which reflects the traffic softness that Larry alluded to earlier. Food and paper costs as a percentage of company restaurant sales increased 370 basis points year-over-year to 29.8% due to increased commodity costs and investments in new packaging, partially offset by higher menu prices. Labor and related expenses as a percentage of company restaurant sales increased 150 basis points year-over-year to 31% due to higher wage inflation, overtime costs and other labor-related costs, partially offset by lower workers' compensation expense. The opening of 3 to 6 company-owned restaurants and 6 to 10 franchise restaurants, the remodeling of 10 to 15 company-operated restaurants and 20 to 30 franchise restaurants, capital spending of $20 million to $25 million and a pro forma income tax rate of 26.5%. So I do think it's going to be a situation at least over the next several quarters where we're going to have to continue developing ways to reach out to those really value conscious -- not value conscious, they're really price-conscious consumers with really strong price points that not only will drive transactions, but maintain the margins."
