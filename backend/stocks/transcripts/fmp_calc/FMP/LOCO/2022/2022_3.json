    "content": " I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m also pleased to add that our fourth quarter has started similarly to the third with system-wide same-store sales through October 26, increasing approximately 3.5%, including a 5.4% increase at company-owned restaurants and a 2.2% increase at franchise locations. Store level margins during the third quarter continued to be pressured by wage, commodity and utilities inflation, however, staffing levels improved throughout the quarter, and our company-operated restaurant teams made good progress managing their businesses, resulting in pro forma earnings per share of $0.14. For the third quarter ended September 28, 2022 total revenue increased 3.6% to $119.9 million compared to $115.7 million in the third quarter of 2021. Looking ahead, fourth quarter-to-date through October 26, system-wide comparable restaurant sales increased 3.5%, consisting of a 5.4% increase at company-owned restaurants and a 2.2% increase at franchise restaurants. Food and paper costs as a percentage of company restaurant sales increased 250 basis points year-over-year to 29.2% due to increased commodity costs, partially offset by higher menu prices."
