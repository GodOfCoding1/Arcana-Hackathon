    "content": " If we look at operating profit in the same way, on slide number 15, we find that in dollars, our operating profit in this year's quarter 3 was not only higher than it was in last year's quarter 3, but also higher than what it was in quarter 3, 2019. You can see that in each of these 3 regions, we are sustaining strong momentum, both in the form of year-on-year growth and on a 2-year CAGR basis, which eliminates the impact of comparing against last year's surge, especially in Latin America. As we look to the fourth quarter, we lapped a particularly strong organic net sales growth performance, and on operating profit, we are managing through high costs and supply challenges, as well as lapping a 53rd week. And I'm just trying to get a better sense of as you look to your fourth quarter guidance and you think about early next year, how do we think about the impact on whether it's your gross margin or your EBITDA dollars, however you want to think about it on the labor strikes alone, I am just trying to get a sense of how to parse that out as we think about the headwinds there and any help you can give will be great."
