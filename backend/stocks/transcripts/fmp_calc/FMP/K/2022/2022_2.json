    "content": " Our international regions collectively posted yet another quarter of strong growth in sales and profit, a performance that is driven not only by snacks but also Cereal and Noodles & Other in emerging markets. This growth comes despite high cost inflation, industry-wide supply disruptions and incremental costs and lost sales stemming from a fire and strike in our North America Cereal business in the second half of 2021. Through the first half, our net sales grew organically by 8%, with price/mix growth more than offsetting the negative volume impacts of supply disruptions, most notably in North America Cereal and price elasticity. Cereal also posted strong net sales growth in the second quarter, driven both by volume as we replenished both our and retailers' inventories and by price/mix as we executed revenue growth management actions. Leading EMEA's growth in quarter two and the first half were Noodles & Other, which make up almost half of the region's annual net sales and which sustained its strong momentum in Africa. Snacks, representing about 1/5 of EMEA's annual net sales, also sustained organic net sales growth of more than 20% with gains across Asia, Africa, the Middle East and Australia driven by momentum in Pringles. These 4 brands collectively represented more than 40% of the total 2021 net sales of what will be Global Snacking Co. On Slide 29, we see continued strong retail sales growth across key international cereal markets also led by world-class brands."
