    "content": " As previously announced in December, shortly after the closing of Silvertip, to meet the increasing demand for next generation hydraulic fracturing services, we were pleased to announce our first contract for one of our electric fleets, order two additional e-fleets under the master lease agreement used for our first two electric fleet orders, and deploy our fifth Tier IV Dynamic Gas Blending or DGB fleet, with our sixth to come online in the coming weeks. Furthermore, if demand for frac services temporarily declines in gas-focused basins, and a few competitor fleets subsequently move to the Permian, we believe the demand gap is large enough to absorb the new fleets without disruption, especially when considering the bifurcation in service quality and equipment offerings, as small privates and other subscale competitors do not have the next generation capabilities that ProPetro has compiled. Turning back to 2022 results, our full-year 2022 cash CapEx was $320 million, or slightly below the midpoint of our prior guidance and our incurred CapEx was $365 million, which is slightly above the high end of our prior guidance, and included approximately $18 million of strategic purchases of critical inventory items to get ahead of certain supply chain constraints of major components. To reiterate, 2022 was a significant investment year in which we recapitalized our fleet while transitioning to over 35% natural gas-burning equipment, completed the accretive transaction with Silvertip to accelerate free cash flow and earnings, and enhanced adjusted EBITDA margins by over 930 basis points, all while protecting our liquidity."
