    "content": " Indeed, both ProPetro and Silvertip share a like-minded and steadfast focus on leading the Permian in completion services execution, and we are excited to welcome the Silver Tit team as we work to deliver best-in-class services for our customers, capture the significant growth opportunities inherent in this transaction and unlock meaningful value for our shareholders of both companies. Our steady focus on achieving full cycle cash-on-cash returns across our operating fleet paired with additional operating leverage in the form of a 15-fleet active later in the fourth quarter of this year and the acquisition of Silvertip gives us confidence to guide to a full year 2022 adjusted EBITDA expectation of at least $310 million, more than double that of last year. Accordingly, with the backdrop of our 2022 equipment reinvestment cycle, capital expenditures in 2023 are expected to come in lower than this year, setting us up for strong free cash flow next year without any future anticipated debt service requirements."
