    "content": " Bingo Blitz revenue was $155.1 million, up 18.4% year-over-year driven by several in-game live ops celebrations around the game's 12-year anniversary and other special themes throughout the quarter, including unique mini games. We generated $2.616 billion of revenue up 1.3% year-over-year, $275.3 million of net income down 10.8% year-over-year and $919 million of retention plan adjusted EBITDA down 6.5% year-over-year. The decline in sales and marketing expenses were driven by timing of some of our off-line campaigns, the strategic decisions that we made this year regarding our new games pipeline and the reduction in marketing expenses in Redecor. I think really the biggest impact that we saw in 2022 was to new game launches and we made strategic adjustments since and are now focusing on investing externally in world-class partners, where we can see opportunities to invest in new games and temporarily suspending most new game development internally excluding Wooga."
