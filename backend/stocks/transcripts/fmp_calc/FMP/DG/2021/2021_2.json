    "content": " Much like our Q2 results, we expect continued pressure on our gross margin rate in the second half due to a less favorable sales mix compared to the prior year, an increase in markdown rates as we cycle the abnormally low levels in 2020, and higher LIFO provisions as a result of the cost of goods increases. Please proceed with your question. So in terms of gross margin, and I'll start by saying we're very pleased with the performance up 62 basis points year-to-date, while down 80 basis points in Q2, we're up 87 basis points over Q2 2019, as we continue to see initiatives like DG Fresh, NCI, and others really contributing. Please proceed with your question. Please proceed with your question. Please proceed with your question. Please proceed with your question. I don't want to get ahead of our skis and say that it'll be even better, but I would tell you, with the initiatives that we have and the retention rates we're seeing from that new consumer, that's what gives us the confidence to raise that sales guidance from the back half for this year, and will propel us into '22. Please proceed with your question. Please proceed with your question. Please proceed with your question."
