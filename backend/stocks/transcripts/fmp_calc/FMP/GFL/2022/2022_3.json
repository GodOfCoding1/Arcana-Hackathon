    "content": " Add to this, the nearly $200 million of M&A rollover already in hand and the impact of current FX rates, and we're expecting a minimum of 12% top line growth, even after accounting for the assumption that commodity prices stay at today's levels for all '23. So, $6 million incremental revenue sort of coming out of that, the real growth and the real success of that was, as we had anticipated in our thesis of bringing the two businesses together was creating a one-stop shop for Environmental Services need that large customers could reach out to in all of the various markets. But I think where we're sitting today, we have a high degree of conviction that we're going to achieve what we've laid out just simply with the algorithm of our pricing versus our costs and giving consideration to the sort of externalities of commodity and FX. So we've always articulated, I think that in your contribution for next year is a small dollars, maybe there's sort of $20 million to $40 million of contribution in year next year depending on that ramp. It's really -- as we continue to develop some particularly some of our net newer markets, we're just seeing more and more opportunities for investment and foundational CapEx that could then serve for years of growth thereafter. So, we're thinking about all those things, it's not something we've made a decision on today but we're thinking about all of them and we're thinking about and we'll continue to think about them and update people as we sort of move forward in our decision and thought process."
