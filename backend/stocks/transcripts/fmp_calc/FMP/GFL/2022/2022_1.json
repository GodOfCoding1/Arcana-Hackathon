    "content": " Sprint, a vertically integrated regional Solid Waste business based in Texas with a footprint that strongly complements GFL's existing footprint, Sprint has achieved industry-leading margins for over 15 years under the ownership of Joseph Swinbank and his family, and we're excited that Joseph and his sons Will and Reagan are showing their support for the combined GFL opportunity through their continuing their investment as a shareholder of GFL and as consultants to the business. I would say certainly in the large urban markets, when you sort of look across Canada, I mean, the big 8 primary markets when you're thinking about Vancouver, Edmonton, Calgary, Winnipeg, Toronto, Ottawa, Montreal, Halifax, those markets are still, I would say, for the most part, still way off pre-pandemic levels and a lot of that is driven by exactly what you said, people getting back to offices and getting back to a normal work schedule. So I think Q1 was the peak Q2 will still be elevated -- but as you get into Q3 and beyond, I think at the current pace, you're going to see those sequential decreases significantly reduce and therefore, be in a path where we could end the year where probably a little bit higher if the original guide for the year was sort of 4, low 4s."
