    "content": " Everspin delivered quarterly revenue of $15.7 million, above the high end of guidance, leading to an all-time record full year revenue of $60 million for 2022. MRAM product sales in the fourth quarter, which included both Toggle and STT-MRAM revenue was $14.6 million consistent with the prior quarter at an increase from $12.6 million in Q4 2021. Everspin expects total revenue in the range of $14.1 million to $14.8 million and Everspin expects GAAP net income per basic share to be breakeven to $0.05, primarily influenced by expenses related to our next-generation 28-nanometer STT-MRAM product development and price increases from our suppliers. Yeah, so the way I think about it is the way we built the $14 million to $14.8 million guidance in revenue you know we continue to feel that Toggle is strong, the backlog is very promising and 2023 going up to \u00e2\u0080\u009824. So I think, think about us taking over some of the market with the low-density parts from nvSRAM and FRAM, and then the high-density, the 64 meg, and then the 32 meg for example, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to basically attach to industrial IoT applications, aerospace and defense, process automation, you know, the standard application that you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen Toggle MRAM get into over the last decade or so. So as we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen our data center customer, their revenue has maybe gone up and down and been a little bit challenging over the last few quarters, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve really been able to make up with it from all the hard work on the Toggle side over the last few years with the design wins."
