GAAP operating expenses for the first quarter of 2022 was $6.3 million versus $7.7 million in the prior quarter, and $6.3 million in the same quarter one year ago. We are pleased to report for first quarter positive net income of $1.9 million, or $0.10 per basic share, based on $19.9 million basic weighted average shares outstanding. In the fourth quarter of 2021 and a GAAP net loss of $0.5 million, or $0.02 per basic share in the first quarter of 2021. Cash and cash equivalents decreased to $19.9 million at the end of the first quarter compared to $21.4 million at the end of the prior quarter, and $15.5 million in Q1 '21. Cash flow from operations was negative $1 million for the current quarter compared to $6.4 million in the prior quarter, and $1.7 million positive for Q1 of last year. And then, $2 million of unfulfilled demand being pushed in the second half to 2022 based on the supply constraints, I guess you're confident that that demand will still be there in the second half, it won't won't go away."
