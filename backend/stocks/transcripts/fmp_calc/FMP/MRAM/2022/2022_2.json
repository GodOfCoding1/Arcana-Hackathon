    "content": " Before we begin the call, I want to remind you that this conference call contains forward-looking statements regarding future events, including but not limited to, our expectations of Everspin's future business, financial performance and goals, customer and industry adoption of MRAM technology, successfully bringing to market and manufacturing products in Everspin's design pipeline and executing on its business plan. Everspin delivered quarterly revenue of $14.7 million, an increase of 24% compared to the second quarter of 2021 and above the high end of guidance. In addition, despite the supply constraints and cost increases, we generated positive cash flow from operations, resulting in a healthy cash balance of $23.1 million. We delivered solid quarterly results, beating top end of guidance, with revenue of $14.7 million compared to $14.3 million last quarter and $11.8 million in the second quarter of 2021. MRAM product sales in the second quarter which include both our Toggle and STT-MRAM revenue, was $13.2 million versus $12.7 million in the prior quarter and $10.2 million in Q2 2021. Licensing, royalties, patents and other revenue in the second quarter was $1.5 million compared to $1.7 million in the previous quarter and $1.7 million in Q2 2021. We expect the GAAP net income per basic share to be between breakeven and $0.05 per share, primarily influenced by expenses related to next-generation 28-nanometer STT-MRAM product that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u0093 development and price increases from our suppliers."
