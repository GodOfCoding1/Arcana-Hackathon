    "content": " The primary reasons for the gross profit margin decline in the first quarter of 2022, as compared to the prior year period were the positive margin impact from higher share of shelf manufacturing of 250 basis points driven by increased output from our new and expanded facilities offset by first short term under utilization of our new facilities due to supply chain challenges of 970 basis points largely driven by COVID-19 related impacts on labor absenteeism in Americas and lockdowns in China and logistical constraints delaying the timely supply of raw materials and spare parts, all of which resulted in the lower production output."
