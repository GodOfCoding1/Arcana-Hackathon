    "content": " Walking from fourth quarter 2022 to the fourth quarter of 2023, we expect improvement to come from four key buckets: fewer COVID-19 related one-offs in Asia, which we expect to more fully flow through starting in the second quarter as the first quarter is expected to still have some lingering COVID-19 impacts; EMEA price increases which have already been implemented; third, improving Americas channel mix as we expand distribution; and finally, an improvement in our cost per liter driven by improving utilization and co-packer consolidation net of mid single digit inflation."
