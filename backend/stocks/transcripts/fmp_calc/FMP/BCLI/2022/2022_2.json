    "content": " You and Dr. Lindborg have touched on ALS functional ratings score and P-values, cerebrospinal fluid, CSF from all participants in Phase 3 revealed large and also statistically significant CSF biomarker improvements from baseline with NurOwn treatment, particularly in biomarkers related to neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration, while placebo remain unchanged, can you maybe just talk a little bit about the biological responses and effects on biomarkers that were also seen in Phase 3 and how patients and investors should be thinking about the correlation and connection between these statistically significant biomarkers and statistically significant positive changes in ALSFRS-R?"
