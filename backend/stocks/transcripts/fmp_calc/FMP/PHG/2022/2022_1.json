    "content": " Number one, it's the continued strong delivery of our strategy and operational performance, leading to an increased order book despite the very challenging backdrop; two are obviously the shortages and dislocation in the supply chain, geopolitical challenges and increasing inflationary environment; and three, the huge undertaking at Philips Respironics to do everything to deliver a solution to patients and caregivers affected as fast as we can. Order intake grew 5% in the quarter for the group or 8%, excluding the Sleep & Respiratory Care business, driven by strengths across the Diagnosis & Treatment businesses, Hospital Patient Monitoring and Connected Care Informatics, to just name a few. This further builds on the good order intake growth in recent quarters, resulting in an all-time high equipment order book for Philips, in fact more than 30% higher than a year ago, as shown on Page 27 of our presentation. To round off, looking ahead, the strong customer demand and order book, coupled with our first quarter sales performance, support our range of 3% to 5% comparable sales growth and 40 to 90 basis points adjusted EBITA margin improvement for the year, as provided in January. The Diagnosis & Treatment order intake grew 7% in the quarter driven by strong, double-digit growth in magnetic resonance imaging and Image-Guided Therapy as well as a strong performance in Ultrasound and Enterprise Diagnostic Imaging -- Informatics. It's only in Connected Care where, let's say, we have -- so overall, for Diagnosis & Treatment, IGT was a little bit lower compared to last year because we had, if you'll remember last year, an 82% order intake growth last year in Q1."
