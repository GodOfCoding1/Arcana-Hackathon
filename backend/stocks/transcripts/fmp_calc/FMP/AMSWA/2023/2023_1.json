    "content": " As I mentioned in my opening comments, based on our Q1 results, we're confident in our performance will be in line with the guidance we provided back in June, which is for total revenues to be between $132.5 million and $135 million and adjusted EBITDA to come in between $16 million and $18 million. For the first quarter of fiscal '23, the revenues were $31.3 million, which -- that was a 7% increase from $29.3 million in the same period last year, both drive of that was our subscription fees which increased 23% year-over-year to $12.1 million. Our subscription fee margin increased to 70% compared to 67% in the same period last year and that's primarily due to increase in subscription revenue and lower amortization of cap software expense excluding the non-cash amortization of cap software expense of $508,000 for the first quarter and our subscription gross margin would have been 74% versus 75%last year. So on a GAAP basis, our operating income increased 44%, $2.6 million for this quarter and that compares to $1.8 million same period last year. On an adjusted basis, which excludes non-cash amortization of intangible expense related to acquisitions and stock-based compensation expense, our adjusted operating income increased 49% to $3.9 million compared to $2.6 million last year. We continue to see the ERP providers being less and less entrenched so more opportunities that are popping up where they're either aren't getting considered or aren't winning and I believe that that is a clear recognition in the marketplace that they just don't have the depth of capability that's necessary to manage the complexity of today supply chains, the pace at which things change, the dynamics of it, just don't suit those capabilities very well and they are not keeping up with the best of re-providers."
