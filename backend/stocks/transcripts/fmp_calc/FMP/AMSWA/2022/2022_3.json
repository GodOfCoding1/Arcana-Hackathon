    "content": " Subscription fee margin increased to 68% compared to 59% in the same period last year and that's primarily due to increase in subscription revenue and lower amortization of cap software expense, excluding the non-cash amortization of cap software expense of $628,000 for the third quarter, our gross or subscription gross margin would've been 74% versus 71% in the same period last year. For year to date for the nine month period ended January 31, 2022, our total revenues increased 12% year-over-year to $92.9 million and that's primarily due to a 49% increase in subscription fees to $31 million, and a 30% increase in license fees and a 7% increase in services, partially offset by a 9% decline in revenues."
