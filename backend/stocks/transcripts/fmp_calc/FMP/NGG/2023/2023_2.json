    "content": " At the end of June, we received the draft determination and we're working with Ofgem on 4 key areas: first, streamlining the number of uncertainty mechanisms to reduce complexity and allow for efficient investment; second, to agree more symmetrical incentives, having seen the significant customer service benefits of these in ED1; third, narrowing the gap on Ofgem's proposed 19% reduction to our expenditure so we can deliver the outcomes our customers have asked us for; and last, given the macroeconomic situation and critical need for investment, we must reach a sensible outcome on the financing package, in particular, a fair allowed cost of capital that reflects the higher cost of equity and debt we're now seeing in the market."
