    "content": " We placed 10 Swoop systems in the third quarter driving all time quarterly revenue of $2.3 million, and we drove great discipline in spending successes, which had credit to Scott who stepped in as interim CEO shortly after Dave\u00e2\u0080\u0099s departure and has enabled a very smooth transition in my first two weeks in the role and to our broader Hyperfine team. Turning to a recent commercial progress, as I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve mentioned earlier, we installed 10 commercial Swoop systems in the third quarter of 2022, driving record quarterly revenue of $2.3 million. We expect our go-forward quarterly cash burn rate to be slightly higher as we take strategic steps to expand our base of clinical evidence in stroke and optimize of a technology as Maria described, while rightsizing the organization and managing the business to maintain our cash runway through year end 2024. Your line is open. So we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re clearly narrowing down on our clinical use cases that our highest priorities, I have the team focus and making sure that we have the right programs anywhere from the R&D teams to clinical to commercial to really take full advantage of that neurocritical care opportunity followed by stroke. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open."
