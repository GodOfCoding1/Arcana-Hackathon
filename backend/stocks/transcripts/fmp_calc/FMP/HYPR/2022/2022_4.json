    "content": " Our fourth quarter result of $1.4 million in revenue on five commercial Swoop systems reflects learning and addressing these processes, as well as some distraction due to the restructuring and right sighting of the team and recruiting an onboarding of new talent. In line with our disciplined approach to spending, we are also initiating guidance for cash burn of $40 million to $45 million in the full year 2023. Turning to our 2023 outlook, based on our progress and current trends of the business, we are initiating full year expectations for revenue to be in the range of $10 million to $14 million."
