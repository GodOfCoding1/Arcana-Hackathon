    "content": " As in most quarters, there are some good things to think about or good things that happened in the second quarter, and there are some things that are a little bit more concerning or maybe watch items going forward. And those three awards in particular that we released news about involve in-seat power for Southwest Airlines, one of the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s most prominent airlines obviously, and one that has never used our in-seat power product before, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s specifically for their 737 Max aircraft, which they run a bunch of Maxes now and they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to take deliveries of quite a few more over the next year or two. And we expect to play a prominent role in it, recognizing that reasonable people can differ over the timing and magnitude of how that industry\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to take off, but we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re pleased to be on the Lilium team, and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re running hot and heavy on that one and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll continue to do so for the next year and a half, two years as they work towards certification. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to weigh a little bit towards the fourth quarter, third quarter being a little lighter, fourth quarter being a little heavier, but that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what we are thinking our average will be in the second half of the year. So when you look at it sequentially, we averaged 114 for the previous four quarters, 129 in the second quarter, and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re thinking we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to average about 160 million in the second half here.
