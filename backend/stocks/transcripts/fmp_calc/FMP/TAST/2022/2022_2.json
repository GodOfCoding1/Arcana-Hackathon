    "content": " Because of the inflationary challenges experienced during the second quarter, adjusted EBITDA decreased $14.2 million to $15.1 million, while our adjusted EBITDA margin decreased 350 basis points to 3.4% of restaurant sales. So I think on a 3-year comp basis, it's pretty much we made most -- we're up in the high single digits on the 3-year in the third quarter on a 3-year basis, which is mostly driven by higher average check offset by some traffic loss."
