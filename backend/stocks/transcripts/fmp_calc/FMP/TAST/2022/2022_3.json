    "content": " General and administrative expenses increased 50 basis points year-over-year as a percentage of sales, driven by an increase in certain executive transition litigation and other nonrecurring professional fee costs that totaled approximately $1.4 million, along with a reversal of bonus accruals in the same period last year that reduced reported G&A expense. And that's -- so I don't think it's going to be sort of a light on, lights off on January 1 next year, the commodity costs are going to all of a sudden be more in line. Well, I was just going to say, I just want to make sure that the pricing -- the menu pricing we've taken so far this year, I mean, in the third quarter added 10% to the average check. And just to add that -- just a minor comment related to that is that -- and we're also -- as we've come out of the prior year and particularly on the labor challenges, we're continuing to focus on executing operations at a high level that will help, we think, traffic and sales as well. So I don't think we're going to see -- I think we'll see some improvement next year on those metrics that you -- on labor cost of sales -- labor as a percent of revenue and COGS as a percent of revenue, but I don't think it's going to be -- unless we have a complete grand slam home run on the traffic side, it's going to be pretty mild improvement over time. So we're within that $40 million bucket on the repairs and maintenance side is -- as I said on the call, it's like $20 million of the $40 million is sort of repairs and maintenance and restaurant equipment."
