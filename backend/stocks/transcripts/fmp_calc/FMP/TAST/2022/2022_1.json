    "content": " Pricing for our Burger King restaurants was increased approximately 7.7% during the first quarter, inclusive of actions taken late in 2021 and earlier this year. On the labor front, given the continuation of wage pressures that emerged last year, average hourly wages of our team members increased by 13.6% in the first quarter compared to the prior year period before overtime. The average check for delivery rose to $18.07 from $17.58 between those 2 periods while the average check overall, including delivery, rose to $9.69 this past quarter compared to $9.57 in the fourth quarter of last year. As a result of the inflation challenges experienced in the first quarter, adjusted EBITDA decreased $15.6 million to $4.3 million while our adjusted EBITDA margin decreased 400 basis points to 1.1% of restaurant sales. The greater outflow in this year's first quarter was due to reduced earnings relative to the same period last year, along with the repayment of 1/2 of the FICA deferral of $10.8 million we benefited from in 2020 and the first 6-month interest payment on the senior notes we issued in June 2021. So I think the current level is -- maybe, at most, we go $20 million or $30 million more if things were looking really, really positive and our EBITDA leveraged up because of some of the turnarounds we're seeing."
