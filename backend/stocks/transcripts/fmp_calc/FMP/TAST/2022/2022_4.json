    "content": " Adjusted EBITDA improved over 80% to $25.4 million over the same period last year, driven by sales leverage on both costs of goods sold and labor. Adjusted restaurant level EBITDA totaled $46.9 million, an increase of over 37% compared to last year, sequentially from the third quarter to the fourth quarter of 2022. On an adjusted basis, fourth quarter net loss was $2.5 million or $0.05 per diluted share compared to an adjusted net loss of $7.5 million or $0.15 per diluted share in the prior year period. Part of its because we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re lapping, especially in January, we lapsed some big storms last year, but in February, even when we haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t lap storms, we think we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to, come out at the high end of mid single-digit on comp growth, in the first quarter. So, I think plus the reinvestment part of Reclaim the Flame, which we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re taking full advantage of, for our physical assets, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s important too, but I think the most exciting thing to me is the increased level of advertising that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to see later in the year, which everyone knows about. So whether it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s them paying for the incremental marketing over the next couple years to them helping us with remodels on subsidies basis to they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not going to do something to drive traffic that reverses some of the progress they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve made because if they do that, that could if for instance, they went back to \u00e2\u0080\u0093 if they increased discounting that would obviously make it more challenging for us to or for the system to hit that 175,000 per store."
