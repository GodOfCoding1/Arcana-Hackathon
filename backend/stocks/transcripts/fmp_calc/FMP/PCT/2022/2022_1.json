    "content": " During the quarter, we also ramped up spending on our Feed PreP site in Central Florida, as well as made continued progress on the Augusta pre-engineering for lines one and two, which was a cash use of $11.6 million. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. And so I would say that the majority of the conversations that we\u2019re having with offtake today are based on feedstock plus, and that\u2019s really just not that\u2019s very consistent with the way most markets like this work, where it\u2019s always the base feedstock raw material. We\u2019re flexible and we\u2019re building a portfolio around, let\u2019s say multiple pricing mechanisms, but today, especially given the high volatility and just the global marketplace, we\u2019re really anchoring more to the feedstock plus than anything else at this point. So I actually don\u2019t know the exact number for how much spending is left for Ironton as far as cash spent versus total project, I think it\u2019s in the $155 million to $175 million range of remaining capital to spend to finish Ironton. But as far as basic guidance 75 million through the end of June and probably $5 million to $10 million per month thereafter, it\u2019s a little bit difficult to say on average because there\u2019s different milestone payments across the Augusta project. Your line is now open."
