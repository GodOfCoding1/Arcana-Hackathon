When we become mechanically complete and we let's say start \u00e2\u0080\u0093 starting up the plants, we have several different feedstocks that we're going to test at the beginning. One moment for our next question. Your line is open. So, look, there is no event of default here, if there is a cure period, we're working on it, as Dustin said, we have contracts and we've invited the bondholders, it's going to be a site tour end of November for any of the bondholders that want to come, including the individual that expressed high level of interest. So, it's really \u00e2\u0080\u0093 it's an event, but one that we're very comfortable with and one that we are certain or feel highly confident that this will be behind us in the next few weeks, because as Dustin said, we've got contracts that replace. One moment for our next question. Your line is open. It's being pre-revenues difficult, having technology risk because we don't have commercial scale is difficult, but I referenced in my remarks, the thing that's been overwhelming to Dustin and I is, sure, we don't have as many commitments as we wanted right now for the financing we were trying to raise, but look at the market, we're not unique, not even close. One moment for our next question. Your line is open. Your line is open."
