    "content": " And so we were in good shape for Augusta lines one and two, and we're not prepared to speak about the details yet, for lines three, and four, but we've got quite a few very active discussions with feedstock for three and four that we're going to be excited to share in the future. And it's really pivoting on three things, a, ramping the feedstock up to our contractual plans, b, getting the operations up running tuned up and running reliable, and then, c, making the pellets pushing it to the offtakers, and getting them comfortable with and reliably taking our material. And I'll just say that we've made great progress across all three fronts, we're starting to take feedstock into Ironton now, as you saw with some of the pictures, we're having detailed discussions with the offtakers about, okay, in theory, I want to take X million pounds of product, but in practice, it's got to go to this piece of equipment. So without getting into too many of the specific details on lines three and four in Augusta or the feed streams that we're targeting, I think at the end of the day, it's going to create, it's going to create a really nice story and sustainability, showcase for some of the brands that otherwise really haven't been able to show that circularity. I think that, Gerry, I think that when we reach mechanical completion, that's going to be a big day for us, when we're able to introduce some of our process specific solvents into the process circulating get up an operation, that's a big day."
