    "content": " Excluding the impact of the Precoat purchase accounting related amortization and depreciation of $8 million, operating margins for the quarter would have increased to 14.3% of sales. When adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $71.2 million or 19.1% of sales, up 78.8% compared to the prior year. Excluding the loss and including the D&A from Precoat purchase accounting, third quarter EPS was $0.88, an increase of 3.5% versus 85% -- a $0.85 in the prior year quarter. But I'd say typically, we're -- well, because of -- keeping in mind that our -- we try to price in line with those zinc costs, so while we've kept our pricing discipline, I think the overall impact, we probably -- I'd say, we're looking at maybe 100 basis points overall, just kind of that headwind as we have about six months of zinc in our kettles and dependent on -- but there's a range of cost in each kettle across the fleet. So you're looking at a business of, what maybe $6 million, $7 million a quarter, but really low margins lower than we've experienced."
