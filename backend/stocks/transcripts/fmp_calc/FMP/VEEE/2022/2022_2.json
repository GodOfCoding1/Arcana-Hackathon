    "content": " Your speakers for today's program is Joseph Visconti, Chairman of the Board and CEO of Twin Vee Powercats Co., and Carrie Gunnerson, CFO of Twin Vee Powercats Co. Before I turn the call over to Joseph, please remember that certain statements made during this investor call are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. It's important to note that if Twin Vee move forward focusing on building its gas powered boat division, Forza X1, our electric boat division will incur losses as Forza moves from R&D to prototyping its new FX1 one models then to testing and marketing these electric boats, and then to ramping up production in our new Forza X1 factory in Marion, North Carolina over the next 12 to 18 months. So in addition, we have increased our unit throughput to an average 4.75 boats per week as we discussed, and this again helped Twin Vee's gas powered division record its first profitable quarter since Twin Vee's IPO in July 2021."
