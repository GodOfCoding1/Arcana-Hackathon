    "content": " Our net loss for the first quarter 2022 was 5.6 million compared to net income of 8.1 million in Q1 2021, and adjusted EBITDA decreased by 18.8 million as we continue to invest for growth through the near term headwinds combined with public company costs that were not incurred during Q1 2021 as we were not a public company a year ago. One higher compensation from the addition of 38 full-time employees year-over-year as part of investments in our sales and technology development teams to support our strategic growth plan and two, increased general and administrative expenses related to public company costs and higher marketing spend."
