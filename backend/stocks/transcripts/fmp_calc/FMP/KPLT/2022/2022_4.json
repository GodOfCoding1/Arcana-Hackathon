The company is, however, providing 2023 commentary as follows: the company expects consumer spending headwinds to persist in 2023; historically leased to own solutions benefit from periods of shrinking prime credit availability; creating a countercyclical hedge against the challenging macro environment; the company expects to see year-over-year gross originations growth continue into 2023; the company also expects sequential improvement in the second-half of 2023, compared to the first-half of 2023 as the company sees the full benefit of new merchants through direct integrations, as well as on our mobile app featuring Katapult Pay."
