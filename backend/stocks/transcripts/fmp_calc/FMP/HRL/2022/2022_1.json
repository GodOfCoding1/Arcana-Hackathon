    "content": "  Our outlook for the remainder of the year assumes, among other things, elevated levels of demand across our go-to-market channels; margin improvement from our efforts to combat inflation, including pricing actions and a positive shift in mix; strength from our high-growth brands and businesses, including Columbus, Applegate and foodservice; continued Planters\u2019 performance at the high end of our expectations; improved supply chain performance as labor pressures ease; and the benefit of new capacity for dry sausage, pizza toppings, bacon and other value-added products."
