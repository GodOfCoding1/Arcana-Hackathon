    "content": " During the quarter, we had numerous successes and milestones supporting the expansion of future contribution margin dollars, including: adding over 300,000 tons of new annual sand and clay sales to U.S. industrial customers with long term contracts, for a total of more than $4 million of incremental annual run rate contribution margin: completing very successful customer trials of our new EverWhite pigment and activated clay products, which may lead to accelerated commercialization of our fillers and green diesel offerings; fully commissioning our new West Virginia limestone and aggregates plant, we have nearly 2 million tons of new business opportunities there spanning a number of infrastructure applications, including aggregates, asphalt and concrete; executing attractive contracts with several leading quartz countertop manufacturers will delivering them record production of our new EverWhite cristobalite product. For the second quarter, we\u2019re expecting robust sales volumes as we offset west coast shipping challenges by utilizing alternate ports across the U.S., and with further price increases taking effect plus improved product mix, we expect contribution margin dollars will increase about 15% to 20% sequentially, with per ton margins around $40. I feel like the dynamic sets up very well to keep things tight in the market, and we\u2019re also seeing quite a bit of discipline out there in terms of all the sand suppliers in addition to that, so I think we\u2019re set up for a really good environment for pricing over the next few quarters and, as you said, in many instances sand has actually become the gating item for completion activity, and most of the service companies that we talk to now won\u2019t even mobilize equipment out to the job sites unless they\u2019ve got sand fully committed for the entire job, and what we saw earlier in Q1 is before everyone kind of woke up to the tightness in the sand market, jobs would be started and then in the middle of the job, they wouldn\u2019t have enough sand and there would be this big panic. I think the way I look at it, and we talk all the time internally about the sustainability of our profitability in the oilfield, and I think that\u2019s really at the root of your question, so I would say, first off, that I believe and, most importantly, I think our customers believe--every senior executive I\u2019ve talked to recently has some version of this kind of thesis, that we\u2019re in the early stages of a multi-year North American shale upcycle, so I think the conversation of pricing and margins has a backdrop of it seems like we\u2019re going to be perhaps a lot tighter here than we\u2019ve been over the last few years. We\u2019ve got, depending in the quarter, 10% to 15% share of the proppant and about 30% share of last mile deliveries with SandBox, and I also think we\u2019re really well positioned with our operational footprint and the customer base that we have, and the contracts that we have quite frankly, and I think that\u2019s proven to be true, whether it\u2019s on the downside that we faced during the pandemic, where we were kind of the last man standing, as well as the upside here."
