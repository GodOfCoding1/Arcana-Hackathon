    "content": " During the quarter, we had numerous successes and made further progress toward the expansion of future contribution margin dollars, including receiving our first purchase order for our newest patent pending white pigment product, ramping up sales of our Diatomaceous earth filtration products into the renewable diesel market, signing a key purchase agreement for the first significant sale of our new high purity filtration product, executing a long-term contract for our ultra-low iron silica that will support the increasing demand for U.S. And finally, we have multiple customers across different markets inquiring about long-term contracts for Diatomaceous earth filtration and clay adsorbent products, given that the supply for both of these products is expected to be tight for the next several years."
