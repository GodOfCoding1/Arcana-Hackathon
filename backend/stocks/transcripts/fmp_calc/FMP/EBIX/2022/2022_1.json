    "content": " Our worldwide revenues, including prepaid gift card revenues, increased 11.5% year-over-year in the first quarter of 2022. In total, our travel, foreign exchange, remittance, e-learning and financial technology businesses combined grew revenues by 28% year-over-year during the first quarter of 2022. Our U.S. revenues grew 2% year-over-year, with 21% cumulative growth in our life speed and annuity exchange businesses. Our risk compliance solutions, RCS, revenues grew 8.3% year-over-year due mainly to a 27% year-over-year growth in Latin America and 68% growth in our BPO business unit in India. However, on a constant currency basis, year-over-year revenue in Q1 '22 increased 1% to $294 million from $290 million in Q1 2021, reflecting the strengthening of the U.S. dollar after the Ukraine conflict, which has the impact of hurting our worldwide GAAP revenues. In spite of that headwind and the effect of Omicron in Q1 2022 on many of our businesses, we still managed to grow overall revenues by 7% sequentially and 1% year-over-year on a constant currency basis in Q1 of 2022. Our worldwide revenues, excluding the prepaid gift card revenues, increased 11.5% year-over-year in the first quarter of 2022. In spite of Omicron and the year-over-year decline in gift card sales, our top line in Q1 2022 grew sequentially by 7%, and on a constant currency basis, increased year-over-year by 1.3%. In the U.S., our annuity and life speed exchange businesses cumulatively increased over 21% year-over-year as industry transaction levels increased and we continue to grow revenues from our existing client base. Our European business, whose technology powers the front end of the London reinsurance and insurance markets, continues to perform steadily after our record 2021, with Q1 2022 revenues increasing 3% year-over-year. Excluding the payment solutions business in India, the company's gross margins for Q1 2022 of 78.5% compared to Q4 '21 and Q1 '21 gross margins of 77% and 80%, respectively. In addition to the continuing effects of COVID-19 on our business, Ebix had a year-over-year increase in G&A expenses of $5.6 million in Q1 2022 driven by increased personnel costs of approximately $3.1 million and a decrease in bad debt recovery of approximately $1.7 million year-over-year. Excluding the payment solutions business in India, we generated 31.6% operating margins in the first quarter of 2022, an increase of 50 basis points as compared to 31.1% operating margins in Q4 2021. During the first quarter of 2022, we had the following major cash uses: $11 million of cash interest paid; $15.4 million for income-related taxes paid globally; our combined $12 million expended on capital expenditures and software development costs; $8.4 million used to reduce the principal outstanding on our corporate credit facility; $3.7 million used to reduce the balances of our working capital facilities in India; and $2.3 million for dividend payments. This was a result of strong performance by the core business comprised of life, annuity, health, P&C exchanges and the core consulting group, which altogether were up 9% in Q1 2022 compared to Q1 2021. Overall, the Q1 growth was despite continued headwinds in the underwriting exchange business, which was down 9% compared to Q1 '21 and 2% sequentially compared to Q4 of '21. Our worldwide revenues, excluding prepaid gift card revenues, increased 11.5% year-over-year in the first quarter of 2022. Excluding the payment solutions business in India, we generated 31.6% operating margin in the first quarter of 2022, an increase of 0.5% as compared to 31.1% in Q4 of '21, which, as Steve defined, is in line with our goal of more than 30% operating margins. Despite a 7% decline year-over-year in the gift card business, our EbixCash revenues on a constant currency basis were higher than the Q1 2021 revenues. In total, our travel, foreign exchange, remittance, e-learning and financial technology businesses combined grew revenues by 28% year-over-year during the first quarter of 2022. Three, we successfully showed how a successful implementation of pioneering technology can result in a network effect with annuity and life speed revenues combined growing 21% year-over-year, purely because of the network effect of large distributors and the carriers they bring on our exchanges."
