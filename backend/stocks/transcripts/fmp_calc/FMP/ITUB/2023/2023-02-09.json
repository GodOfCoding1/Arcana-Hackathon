    "content": " The good news was that we reached the top of the guidance, although we can clearly see a negative impact compared to 2021 results for all the reasons I've mentioned, notably due to the overhead strategy and to the impact of the capital hedge implemented in 2022, which added approximately BRL 2 billion in costs this year. I wanted to understand how much is already destined for the segment for credit cards or specific sector of the economy and how much of that is completely free, let's just say, with the use \u00e2\u0080\u0093 looking at the subsequent fines of approximately BRL 2 billion, BRL 1.3 billion, the exposure . Specifically, in the wholesale that works with a lower \u00e2\u0080\u0093 well, the delay is not \u00e2\u0080\u0093 I don't like to follow the NPL 90 for the medium and large sized companies, but there you can see that the delay is insignificant, irrelevant, whether there is more relation with the cost of credit capture that we can observe all throughout 2023, given the scenario and also given the perspective, given the size of the portfolio to actually do more provision \u00e2\u0080\u0093 an expectation of doing more provisions for 2023. Now, on the other hand, since we are a full bank and we have penetration for the \u00e2\u0080\u0093 relationship with the clients that is very relevant, we have all the cross sale that also affects the margin, whether if it's several products or transactionality of treasury or cash management products and deposits, and the volume of capture throughout the bank, that generates a lot of returns."
