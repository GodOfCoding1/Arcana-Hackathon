    "content": " Second quarter capital came in a little higher than expected, primarily due to acceleration of operations associated with the timing of ongoing completions, associated facilities, and a small amount of non-op activity that was expected in the second half, not changing our full year 2022 capital budget of $550 million. Currently, a $90 per barrel WTI price for 2023, we expect free cash flow of approximately, $560 million versus prior projections of $550 million, and expect low single-digit oil growth compared to the new 2022 oil production range. For all financial impact of all of our updates over the second half of 2022, and full year 2023 is approximately $60 million. Free cash flow for the second quarter came in at $110 million, in line with our expectations and these cash flows were directed towards our debt and equity repurchases. Dated for current guidance, under the same pricing scenario we used in our last guidance, Laredo is expected to generate $280 million of free cash flow for 2022 and approximately $840 million of free cash flow through the end of 2023."
