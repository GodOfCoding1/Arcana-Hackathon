    "content": " We believe that this conditions inevitably improve the long term demographic trends and the changing workplace will position our core properties to serve as the base to spur Orion's growth, As of yearend and including the disposition of six non-core properties in the fourth quarter, we owned 81 properties and six unconsolidated joint venture properties representing 9.7 million square feet that was 89% occupied, up slightly from 88.2% last quarter. At year end, our vacant space represented about 11% or 1.1 million square feet of the overall portfolio, and we incur annual operating expenses of roughly $7.50 per square foot on average, to keep that space. If the two properties we sold in Illinois at auction in the fourth quarter are excluded, our average sales price per square foot for the year was about $50 in line with our expectations at the beginning of the year. To that point, all of our sales have moved to closer -- the portfolio closer to our long term targets, including the Walgreen campus, we have seven properties totaling about 584,000 square feet currently under contract for sale at an aggregate sale price of approximately $36.6 million or $63 per square foot. At year end, we had total liquidity of $446.2 million, consisting of $425 million available capacity on our revolving credit facility, and $21.2 million in cash and cash equivalents, including Orion's proportionate share in Arch Street Joint Venture."
