    "content": " As we detailed previously, at our inception, we inherited a portfolio that need some intensive asset management, so we can ultimately grow the business by focusing on retaining tenants, leasing vacant space, growing our joint venture with Arch Street Capital buying select assets for the balance sheet and selling noncore assets to maximize long-term value. To conclude, we continue to be excited about our progress since Orion was spun off and we are continuing to make steady progress in 2022, we want to again, make it clear that there is plenty of work ahead to retain tenants, fill vacant space, dispose of non-core assets and begin to grow the core portfolio through targeted acquisitions."
