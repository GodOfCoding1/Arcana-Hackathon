    "content": " To date, we have closed on 7 dispositions totaling 539,000 square feet for an aggregate sale price of $28.4 million equating to a price per square foot of approximately $53, both reducing existing vacancy and avoiding near term vacancy as the leases expire. At quarter end, we had total liquidity of $418 million, consisting of $394 million of available capacity on our revolving credit facility and $24 million in cash and cash equivalents, including Orion's proportionate share in the joint venture. One more final thing is that when we sell properties either with a short-term lease or a vacant property, it's not only the price we get per square foot, but it's the savings we get from not having to carry that asset vacant when we think that it's unlikely to be on any type of reasonable economic terms."
