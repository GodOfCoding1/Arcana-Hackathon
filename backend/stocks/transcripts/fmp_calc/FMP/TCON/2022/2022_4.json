    "content": " Allow me to recap 5 key events: First, this quarter, we expect to report the arbitration panel's binding decision, including potential damage awards regarding our legal disputes with I-Mab; second, this quarter, we expect I-Mab's decision on their option to terminate the TJ4309 agreement for a payment to TRACON of $9 million; third, in the third quarter, we expect to report on the second DMC interim efficacy assessment for each of the 2 ENVASARC cohorts of 46 patients dosed with the 600-milligram dose of ENVA; fourth, in the second half of this year, we expect to report Phase I data of the combination of ENVA and our CTLA-4 antibody YH001 as well as the triple therapy that includes doxorubicin; fifth, this year, we also expect to further leverage our unique product development platform to provide TRACON non-dilutive capital in exchange for enabling companies tired of being beholden to CROs to potentially benefit from our capabilities and realize for themselves the substantial time and cost savings we enjoy at TRACON."
