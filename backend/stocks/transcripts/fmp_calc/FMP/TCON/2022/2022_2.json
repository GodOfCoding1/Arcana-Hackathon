    "content": " Earlier this month, we submitted an IND application to the FDA for the initiation of a Phase 1/2 clinical trial of YH001 in combination with ENVA and doxorubicin for the treatment of sarcoma patients, including patients who have not received prior therapy. This trial would be expected to rural patients with UPS and MFS as well as other sarcoma subtypes shown to respond to triple therapy, based on data from the Phase 1/2 trial that I described earlier. Second, we expect to dose the first patient in the Phase 1/2 trial of our potential best-in-class CTLA4 antibody YH001 in combination with ENVA and doxorubicin as a potential first line treatment for sarcoma. So each of the four Phase 2 cohorts leiomyosarcoma,  leiomyosarcoma, chondrosarcoma and alveolar soft part sarcoma each have a separate if you will endpoint, meaning a targeted objective response rate that we're looking to hit that would be clearly superior to the objective response rate seen with single agent chemotherapy with doxorubicin. But with respect to that company, we do feel that if they intensely invested in this program, in within six months, they will be running their own trials, it could be Phase 1, it could be Phase 2, it could be Phase 3, they will be saving incredible amounts of capital, and they'd be engaged in a process much like TRACON where we feel they could save a year per phase of development. What will, what is expected to happen is that once the Phase 1/2 trial is done, and ENVASARC is done when we start that Phase 3 study, which will be the post approval commitment study, that that would then enroll UPS and MFS because ENVASARC will be fully enrolled, and also include other subtypes, including the subtypes that would enroll in the Phase 1/2 trial where we see activity of that triple therapy."
