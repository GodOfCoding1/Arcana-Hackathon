    "content": " Rent the Runway is not only already a larger business in 2022 than we were in 2019, but we are also fundamentally a stronger business in three key ways; first, we have built a more powerful revenue platform; second, we have transformed the cash needs of the business by innovating the way we acquire the fashion we rent; and third, we have dramatically improved our underlying cost structure. Our active subscriber growth this quarter versus Q2 reflects 2 key factors; first, our acquisitions improved in Q3 versus a seasonally weaker Q2; second and with the benefit of more data from Q3, we believe that the reaction by customers for our April price increase was a significant contributor to our elevated levels of churn and post activity in Q2. Reserve orders from new customers in Q3 were up 27% year-over-year and 46% quarter-over-quarter, with the proportion of high formality rentals higher than last year and near record high in terms of utilization. Total product costs came in at 29% versus 34% last year, with rental product depreciation at 18% of revenue versus 23% in Q3 2021 as it was absorbed over a higher revenue base. Q3 adjusted EBITDA continued to be positive and came in significantly ahead of our guidance, at $6.6 million versus negative $5.6 million in Q3 last year, representing a positive 8.5% margin and an 18-point improvement versus negative 5.5% -- negative 9.5% in Q3 last year. So it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s our job to highlight all of the use cases to customers that she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s able to use her subscription for and we have done a great job at that, given that workwear is double last year, but at the same time, she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s using 55% of her basket for everyday casual occasions."
