We are very pleased with our adjusted EBITDA this quarter, which was positive for the first time since we went public, coming in at $1.8 million versus negative $1.9 million in Q2 last year, representing a positive 2.4% margin and a 6-point improvement versus negative 4.1% last year. In terms of full year, we now expect revenue in the range of $285 million to $290 million, representing 40% to 43% growth versus full year '21. Please proceed with your question.
