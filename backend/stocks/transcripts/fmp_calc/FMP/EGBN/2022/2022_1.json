    "content": " Non-performing -- performing loans were 33 basis points on loans at quarter end and net charge off with just three basis points or $459,000. Charge-offs in the first quarter were just four loans with the gross charge-offs of $514,000 partially offset by $55,000 into recoveries, bringing us to net charge-offs of $459,000 for the quarter or three basis points on an annualized basis, 30 to 89 day past are also at very low levels. The $5 million accrual reduction also positively impacted the efficiency ratio bringing it down to 35.3% for the first quarter 2022, compared to 44.3% for the prior quarter and it lowered the effective tax rate to 23.4% compared to 26.3% from the -- for the prior quarter. While not much changed during the quarter, toward the end of March we raised rates on most interest-bearing demand deposit accounts by five basis points and FHLB advances of $150 million were repaid. I think the rates that we had for time deposits previously were not really compelling too many people to move into time deposits and with the feds ' first move, again, we wanted to be prudent about starting to layer in some time deposits as we're now facing forecasts of seven to eight according to the future risk markets, 25 basis points move by the feds before the end of the year."
