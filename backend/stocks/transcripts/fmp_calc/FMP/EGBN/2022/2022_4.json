    "content": " For the quarter, we had a negative provision of $464,000, and our ACL to loans at quarter-end was 97 basis points down from 1.04% last year -- last quarter. For the quarter, the average yield on loans was 5.7%, up 77 basis points, and average loans were up $96.6 million. For the quarter, the cost of interest-bearing liabilities was 2.86%, up 111 basis points, while average interest-bearing liabilities were down $218.2 million. There's been a lot of the narrative, I think, from a lot of the other banks we've seen this quarter has been that -- this quarter or maybe next is where we're seeing peak NIM and then the margins are kind of flat to maybe even down as you move through back half of the year as deposit costs continue to ramp."
