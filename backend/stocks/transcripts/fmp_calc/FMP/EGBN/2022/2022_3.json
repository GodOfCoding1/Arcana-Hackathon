    "content": " The improvement in credit has driven our coverage ratio of non-performing loans to 997%, up from 386% in the prior quarter and we had a net recovery of $57,000 for the quarter. Also, our 30 to 89-day past dues were $14.3 million, while this is up from $3.9 million at the end of the second quarter, it is still at a very low level and it's similar to the end of the first quarter, which was $13 million. With regard to the third quarter provision for credit losses, the increase of $2.5 million from the prior quarter was driven by three factors, higher period-end loan balances, an increase in impairment reserves on one individually evaluated loan and a modest weakening in the unemployment forecast coupled with an increase in the localization factor based on the national employment \u00e2\u0080\u0093 unemployment forecast. Absent these one-time items, adjusted second quarter net income was $38.6 million or $1.20 per share. Interest income was up $15.9 million on higher average loan balances, increasing yields on adjustable rate loans higher rates on new loans and the quarter had an extra day."
