    "content": " Total NPAs were $20.3 million, down $5.1 million from the prior quarter, primarily on the sale of several notes from one commercial real estate relationship and one OREO sale which generated a small gain. And we had a net recovery of 674,000 for the quarter with gross recoveries of $2.1 million, which were primarily from two partially charged-off, high end single family residential construction loans and charge-offs of $1.4 million, which were mostly the result of one commercial real estate relationship. Net interest income was up $2.5 million, with the increase driven by interest income, which was up $7.3 million on higher average loan balances, increasing yields on adjustable rate loans and higher rates on new loans. Overall the increase in deposit rates and reduced excess - overall the increase in deposit rates and reduced excess liquidity from deposit outflows helped increase net interest margin to 294, 2.94%, up 29 basis points from the prior quarter. Other notable changes on the balance sheet from the prior quarter were loans being up to $40.9 million, or $67.6 million, excluding PPP loans and securities being down $30.1 million. Potentially, this is the $30.1 million mark down on available-for-sale securities, offset by earnings of $25.2 million, less the $14.5 million in dividends declared  Capital ratios at quarter end remained strong."
