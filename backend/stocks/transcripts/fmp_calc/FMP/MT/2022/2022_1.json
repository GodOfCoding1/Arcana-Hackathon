    "content": " So I think our returns have been very, very high, as we just -- as I just highlighted in my opening remarks, $9.5 billion in -- since September 2020, that's quite a lot, right? Then on decarb question, I think it's a very good question, and it's something that, of course, we have been debating quite a lot internally as well. And so I think it's certainly our plan later this year to invite analysts and investors down to India to see firsthand, the work that's underway, the success that's already been achieved, and why we're so passionate about the growth potential of that business. But we're seeing renewables M&A pop-up for India, the scrap company you mentioned in the U.K. Luke, so maybe I would just say that -- and I think we have been giving this message very consistently that we don't want to compromise what we have achieved, right? And then thirdly, your approval yesterday for the buyback, I think it's 10% amortization of the share balance, which is likely significantly lower than what the shareholder returns could be this year."
