    "content": " Despite unprecedented inflationary pressure and continued investments, our full year margins rose 410 basis points to 31 -- 35.1%, and we achieved our free cash flow forecast of $1.3 billion. Due to our 2022 performance and continued solid book of business, our full year 2023 outlook for organic revenue and adjusted EBITDA margins are unchanged from our commentary last quarter. Apart from this, demand for our legal solutions remains very healthy across all key segments, and we expect to return to the 6% growth trend in the second half of 2023, driven by continued momentum in Westlaw, Practical Law, HighQ and other key offerings. Adjusted EBITDA increased 18% to $2.3 billion, driven by revenue growth and savings associated with the Change Program, resulting in a margin of 35.1%. And finally, Tax & Accounting's organic revenues grew 8%, driven by recurring revenue growth of 8% and transactional revenue growth of 10%. For our Legal Professionals segment in total, we believe 5% growth is likely again in Q1, with a return to the prior 6% trend likely in the second half of 2023, as Government improves and strong growth continues from our Westlaw, Practical Law and HighQ businesses. Adjusted EBITDA for the Big 3 segments was $618 million, up 27% from the prior year period, with a 43.9% margin rising 810 basis points. Global Print's adjusted EBITDA was $59 million with a margin of 36.1%, an increase of 20 basis points. In 2023, we see M&A as a roughly $40 million free cash flow drag, resulting from SurePrep integration costs and growth investments at SurePrep and ThoughtTrace. For the first quarter of 2023, we see organic revenue growth at the low end of the full year 5.5% to 6% range. It's about $100 million in revenue, now 25% annual growth."
