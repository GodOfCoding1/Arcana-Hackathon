    "content": " Turning to the third quarter results by segment, the big three businesses achieved organic revenue growth of 6% reflecting broad strengths. Adjusted EBITDA for the Big 3 segments was $530 million, up 13% from the prior year period with a 41.9% margin rising 330 basis points. Moving to Reuters News, adjusted EBITDA was $33 million, up $8 million from the prior year with a margin of 19.7%, up 520 basis points. Global Print's adjusted EBITDA was $50 million with a margin of 34.4%, a decline of 60 basis points due largely to foreign exchange. For Q4, we see organic revenue growth of approximately 6% and adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 35%, both in line with the full year outlook. Yeah, thanks very much. Yeah, thanks very much. So as I just mentioned on Tim's question, roughly $6 billion after tax or roughly 50% of the $12 billion, the residual comes from just natural free cash flow and assuming a two and half times leverage ratio there."
