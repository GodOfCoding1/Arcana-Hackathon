    "content": " Colombia has experienced an accelerated contractionary monetary policy that started at the end of September of last year when the Central Bank raised gradually its reference rate from 1.75% to end in June of this year at a level of 7.5%, and it stands currently at 9%. Thank you, Juan Carlos. The main driver for growth during the second quarter was commercial loans growing over 10%, where we highlight the operation in Colombia that presents a good dynamic on originations. Thank you, Juan Carlos. For the second half of the year, loan growth will be lower and the bank will continue to accrue in significant earnings that we contributed to maintain a core equity Tier 1 at around 11%. Net interest margin closed at a 6.7% level, expanding quarterly by 70 basis points following the reference rate increases by the Central Bank in Colombia. We expect the reference rate to be higher in the second half of the year, although quarterly margins will not grow at the same pace, thanks to an increase in interest expenses as the repricing of deposits start to faster offset growth in interest income during the remaining quarters. We see good trends in efficiency ratio, closing at a 44% level in the quarter as a result of the revenue growth outpacing expenses growth on a yearly basis. Considering our macroeconomic estimations in terms of GDP, inflation and employment rates, our guidance for 2022 includes a loan growth between 12% to 14%, a net interest margin of around 6.5% and a cost of risk of 1.3% and an ROE in the 20% area. Thank you, Juan Carlos. Regarding 2023, we are expecting an expenses growth above inflation around 100 to 200 basis points, which means expenses growth for next year would be in the 9% area, assuming an inflation of around 7% at the end of 2023."
