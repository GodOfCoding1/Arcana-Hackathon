    "content": " Thank you, Juan Carlos. In contrast for 2023, we foresee a sharp moderation of growth to our rate of 0.9% in the central scenario as aggregate demand, cool solve in a contest of higher interest rates, global deceleration and continued uncertainty, we anticipate that next year the best performance sectors will be public administration, agriculture, financial services, and utilities. Thank you, Juan Carlos. And we are calculating that that is going to have an effect on our effective consolidated tax rate of 2% increase, moving from 33% that we expect to end this year as an effective tax rate for 2022, moving to 35% in 2023. Thank you, Juan Carlos. Thank you very much. And then with that, we will propose the dividend to the Shareholder Meetings and that would allow us to have a dividend policy and to have dividends next year based on the results of 2022 and reach the level of 11%, since the loan growth during 2023 is going to be as I mentioned before around 5%. Thank you very much. As we mentioned before, the NIM, we expect the NIM to expand a little bit more during the beginning of the year first quarter probably and probably into the first semester, and then it will contract, we expect the end 2023 with a NIM of around 6.5%. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you very much."
