    "content": " As mentioned earlier, we recently introduced our Next-Generation 2023 model year Step Van, which includes major cost optimization and technology upgrades to our latest generation vehicle; particularly proud of the design improvements for the 2023 Step Van that will deliver the important manufacturing cost reductions that GEO already mentioned. When it comes to range, the 2023 Step Van launched the two battery options, a 100-mile usable range specifications for customers operating shorter routes and looking for the most cost-efficient option and the 200-mile option for applications serving larger routes. The one thing I will say regarding the step van product is that you're seeing several customers responding to a lot of the regulations that are taking place that I spoke about like the Advanced Clean Fleet rule, some of these fleets have thousands of trucks just in California and so hitting those percentage thresholds is going to be critical, particularly when we're one of the few suppliers that's providing an electric step van that will meet the needs of those fleet operators in the state. And the steps that we've mentioned today, there's $15,000 that we've identified, those are really the first step in a number of other improvements in the direct material costs and the labor cost manufacturing time that we expect to bake-in over the course of 2023 and into 2024. The only thing I'd add to that is with this new model, the 2023 version of the step van, we're also offering a 200-mile range version of the van and that's gotten some customers really excited."
