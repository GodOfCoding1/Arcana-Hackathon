    "content": " The other thing we\u2019ve also seen is that customers such as -- early customers like Loomis and others have placed follow on orders to really reap the benefits of electric Xos vehicles across their fleet, have they started to deploy their early vehicles. And, yeah, I know you\u2019re young company and there\u2019s all kinds of supply chain stuff going on, and maybe as investors and being on the sell side where it\u2019s tempting to become a little impatient, for lack of a better word on my part, not accusing -- not saying anything towards you guys, but if you look at the gross margins and it\u2019s just hard not to see and go like, oh, we really want to know, when that\u2019ll change or when something will happen. So even whilst we\u2019re going through this supply chain challenging environment where commodity costs have increased, some cases 10% or 20%, the fuel costs increase has greatly surpassed any COGS increase that we\u2019ve seen, making the total cost of ownership much more beneficial for Xos\u2019 electric vehicles than an alternative diesel or internal combustion engine vehicle."
