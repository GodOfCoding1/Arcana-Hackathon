    "content": " Lending, we were up $149 million year-to-date in loan growth, excluding PPP which translates to about 15% annualized growth for the first half of the year. Excluding PPP loan forgiveness, loans were up $84 million compared to an increase in non-PPP loans of $65.3 million in the first quarter of 2022. During the second quarter of 2022, $15.5 million in PPP loans were forgiven, leaving $10 million in PPP loans outstanding. For comparison quarter-to-quarter, in the first quarter of 2022, we funded $126 million of new loans. Regarding payoffs, payoff loans increased a bit in the second quarter, rising from $52 million in Q1 to $62 million in Q2 but still below the level that we experienced last year."
