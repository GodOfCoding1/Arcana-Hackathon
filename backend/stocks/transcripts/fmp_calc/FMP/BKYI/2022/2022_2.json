    "content": " Our revenue for the second quarter nearly doubled from 2021 driven by a 75% increase in software license revenue, reflecting growth in our installed base of customers, including the benefit of Swivel Secure. We are reiterating our full year 2022 revenue guidance of $10 million to $13 million, 70% of which we expect to come from recurring software license revenue. Our annually recurring revenue from software licenses increased 75% to $1.2 million in Q2 22 versus Q2 2021 due to new customers and migrating PortalGuard customers from on premises to cloud-based SaaS solutions, particularly in the higher education segment. Non-recurring services increased 82% to $111,000 in Q2 2022 versus Q2 2021 due to new customer customizations and upgrades from on prem to cloud deployments. Hardware sales increased to $350,000 in Q2 2022, from $43,000 in Q2 2021, largely due to add-on orders from existing customers in Asia, and one order from our Pocket10 product from a new customer. Gross profit margin declined from 76%  in Q2 2021 to 63% in Q2 2022, due to growth in lower margin, hardware sales growth, and a decline in overall gross margin on license fees due to third party software required for the Swivel Secure licenses. Operating expenses increased to $2.8 million in Q2 2022 from $1.9 million in Q2 2021 reflecting the consolidation of the Swivel Secure expenses, as well as new employees and related benefits."
