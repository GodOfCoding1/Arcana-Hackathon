    "content": " BIO-key's Q1 2022 revenue increased to $1.94 million from $1.89 million in Q1 2021, driven by 205% increase in software license fees as well as an increase in services revenue, which more than offset the decline in the hardware revenue. Gross profit grew to $1.6 million in Q1, 2022 from $1.1 million in Q1, 2021 due mainly to the increase in higher margin license fee revenue as a percentage of total revenue in the current year period. Operating expenses increased to $2.6 million in Q1, 2022 from $2 million in Q1, 2021 due to a $400,000 increase in research, development and engineering expense for upgraded MobileAuth and IDaaS solution and the $300,000 increase in SG&A and other expenses associated with the Swivel Secure Europe purchase. The company reported a Q1, 2022 operating loss of $1 million versus $800,000 in Q1 2021 as greater profit - gross profit was more than offset by higher operating expenses incurred to support our growth. In Q1, 2022, we invested approximately $550,000 in net working capital to support our growth and $1.1 million of net acquired cash related to our Swivel Secure Europe."
