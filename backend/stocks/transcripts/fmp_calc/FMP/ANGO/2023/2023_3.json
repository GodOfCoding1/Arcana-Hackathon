During the quarter, our Med Device segment grew 6% compared with the year ago period when the Med Device segment declined due to headwinds associated with a tight labor market and supply chain disruptions. Revenue in the quarter increased 9.1% year-over-year to $80.7 million, driven by growth in Auryon and NanoKnife as well as a strong performance from our Med Device business. Med Tech revenue was $22.9 million, a 16.6% year-over-year increase, while Med Device revenue was $57.8 million, an increase of 6.4% year-over-year.
