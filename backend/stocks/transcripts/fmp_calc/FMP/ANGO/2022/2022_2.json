    "content": " Our Auryon business saw continued sequential growth during the second quarter with revenue of $6.3 million, up from $5.9 million in the first quarter of FY 2022, despite increased pressure on procedure volumes stemming from COVID and hospital staffing challenges. We continued to see strong year-over-year growth within our Thrombectomy portfolio, which generated approximately 21% revenue growth over the second quarter of FY 2021 despite the challenging environment. Our revenue for the second quarter of fiscal year 2022 increased 7.6% year-over-year to $78.3 million driven by continued strength in our Med Tech businesses, including Auryon, NanoKnife and AngioVac. Our Med Device revenue was $59.4 million, growing approximately 1% over the second quarter of fiscal year 2021. Revenue in our endovascular therapies business increased 17% year-over-year to $39.7 million, benefiting from the continued adoption of Auryon in our thrombectomy portfolio. Auryon contributed $6.3 million in revenue during the second quarter, continuing the momentum that we've been building since last year's launch. SG&A expense for the second quarter of fiscal 2022 was $33.3 million, representing 43% of sales compared to $29.4 million representing 40% of sales a year ago. We now expect that full year adjusted earnings per share will be in the range of a loss of $0.02 to a gain of $0.02 compared to our prior guidance of zero to $0.05, as we continue to invest in driving sustainable growth in our key Med Tech platforms, while also managing the continued headwinds that we discussed today."
