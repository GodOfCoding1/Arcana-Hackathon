Between our recently executed financing arrangements, expected cash collections from maturing launches in Europe and Canada, expected milestone payments and our commitment to raise $150 million of additional capital, which may in part come from our existing SEPA facility with Yorkville, we believe we will have sufficient cash runway to continue investing in our platform and pipeline and achieve positive cash flows."
