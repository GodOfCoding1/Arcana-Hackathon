    "content": " I do believe that this setup has facilitated the AVT04 program, with the marketing application has now been submitted and assessed in major markets, including the U.S. and Europe, with regulatory approval decisions expected in the second half of this year. As highlighted to you in the past, we are currently increasing scale for our AVT02 manufacturing process to support these launches, as well as new launches that we're anticipating later this year, including in the U.S. Our pre-launch preparations have resulted in a build of inventory of approximately $32 million through December 31, and we expect that to continue in the first half of the year, leading up to our anticipated launch in the U.S. on July 1. As I also highlighted in the previous question, we believe, particularly because AbbVie will remain on formulary for the near term as they have communicated to the market, that interchangeability is critically important, and I really would like to remind again that Alvotech is the only candidate that can still have an interchangeable high-concentration biosimilar for adalimumab in the U.S. market by 1st of July 2023."
