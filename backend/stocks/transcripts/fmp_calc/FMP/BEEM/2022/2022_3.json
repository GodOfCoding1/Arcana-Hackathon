Remembering that we'll convert the $12 million an inventory that we're currently carrying over the next 180 days with perhaps a few insignificant exceptions, it's, as far as I'm concerned, as good to us as cash because we don't run out of money before we do that. So we've got to take this non-cash hit because we're going to make the earn-out payments, which I've said from day one, I'm very much looking forward to making those earn-out payments because it means we didn't buy a dud."
