    "content": " So our total deferred power costs exceed $30 million in 2022, and as a result, we expect to file with the Washington Commission in April to begin recovering these costs in July of 2023. In the fourth quarter, we experienced significant increases in commodity prices and the need for additional liquidity, as I mentioned earlier, but we increased our short-term borrowing capacity by $300 million, bringing our total capacity to $700 million. In part, we expect to increase operating revenues resulting from recovery of some of those deferred power and natural gas costs, a return of margin deposits made with counterparties, and we expect to issue $200 million in long-term debt and up to $120 million of common stock to fund planned expenditures and reduce our short-term borrowings. The midpoint of our guidance does not include any expense or benefit under the energy recovery mechanism, and we expect to be within the deadband, the $4 million on either side of the midpoint with an increase in earnings of $0.03 per diluted share. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. Your line is now open."
