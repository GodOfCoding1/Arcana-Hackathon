    "content": " So we didn't -- we anticipated originally trying to get back to earning our allowed return, but with the increase in interest, pension and depreciation we're not going to get there for this year -- for 2023. Your line is open. And I'm not trying to get in, Julien, to pension accounting because I don't want to and nobody wants to hear it, but that's -- overall, our pension expense is expected to be higher for 2023 based on that -- based on what we see today. Your line is open. But what sort of the potential that we could see an upside surprise similar to what we've seen in the last couple of years in say 2023 that might if not close the gap, but make up some of the $0.15 difference\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\n Again, we don't -- we look at the forecast James on -- with respect to where we see those market valuations. Your line is open. And so the increase in O&M versus I guess the prior run rate that we are seeing this year this is basically your expectation that it stays the same going into 2023 or are you contemplating some kind about acceleration or deceleration in the rate of inflation in O&M like... \n Again with respect to our cost management we expect it to try to keep our O&M relatively flat in '23 compared to '22, but we're going to see a higher cost in our pension. Your line is open."
