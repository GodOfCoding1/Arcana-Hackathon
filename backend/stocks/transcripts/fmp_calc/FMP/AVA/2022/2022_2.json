    "content": " The Energy Recovery Mechanism as Dennis mentioned had a pre-tax expense of $4.8 million compared to $7.6 million of expense in the prior quarter and for the year-to-date, we were at about $2.8 million versus $3.3 million. We expect Avista Utilities to spend $475 million in '22 and '23, which is an increase over - from $445 million previously, and we expect the AEL&Ps capital expenditures to be $10 million in '22 and $13 million in '23 and we expect to invest about $15 million in our other businesses in '22 and '23, which is pretty consistent with where we've been. From a liquidity perspective, we have almost $200 million of available liquidity under our committed lines of credit and in the first quarter that's due to - in the first quarter, we issued $400 million of long-term debt and we use those proceeds to repay our borrowings under our credit facility, but also we had a maturity in April of $250 million. We are confirming our - as Dennis mentioned, we are confirming our '23 consolidated guidance in the range of $2.42 to $2.62 on a consolidated basis and that doesn't assume again timely and appropriate rate relief, not only in Washington, but in all of our jurisdictions. We expect Avista Utilities to contribute in the range of $1.71 to $1.87 in '22 and again that's due primarily to the write-off of the Washington due to the settlement of $4 million for the dry ash disposal, rising interest rates and inflation. Looking ahead to '23, we continue to expect that we - Avista utilities will contribute in the range of $2.30 to $2.46 and in March of '22, we did settle our general rate case in Oregon and in June of '22, we settled our general rate case in Washington."
