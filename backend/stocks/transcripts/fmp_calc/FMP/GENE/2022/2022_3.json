    "content": " As you can see below, there is a series of patents that have been granted all around the world that acknowledges the work that our scientific team, our medical team, and our technicians have developed over the last 20 years to get us to where we are today and the exciting suite of risk tests that we've just launched earlier this year with more to follow. We focus heavily on those aspects of a GeneType suite of tests and then multi-risk testing there where they still need to have some medical supervision for any high-risk results that come back to a patient, but it actually doesn't qualify for the reimbursement, that's a pure out-of-pocket model that sits in the middle. The three areas that we're really building up as part of the innovation and as part of the next-generation of divisions that we're adding to the business is pharmacogenomics and the Taliaz in mental health, the germline testing with BRCA and Lynch and other germline tests that will support other testing we've got on the multi-test to make it the most comprehensive risk-assessment test on the market. We've launched the breast cancer, colorectal cancer, we've launched the COVID risk test and with our partners, with IBX and with Vitagene and 1health, and we've launched the first five to physicians and healthcare professionals in quarter one this year of the first lot of six tests there, and then we're in the final stage of development of the Phase 2 part of the test which is the next three tests. Our focus over the next three months is around a series of manuscripts and peer-reviewed publications on every disease that seats onto the multi-tests at the moment to get the clinical validity, clinical utility for physician adoption worldwide, and solid balance sheet that led $13.5 million cash balance 21 -- 22 months run way inclusive of the R&D tax grant that we've been given."
