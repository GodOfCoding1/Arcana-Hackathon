    "content": " So what we've done is, we've actually modeled with the team at ALVA10, implementation of our tests in the payer community and the payer system in the United States, whether they be health systems, employer groups, unions or whatever, and we've actually demonstrated that by the increased number of women being screened and the increased number of people who are being supplemented screening, because of their elevated risk, we've been able to demonstrate a drop in interval cancers significantly and that we've been able to detect a higher number of early-stage cancers. We have germline testing, we have carrier and NIPT testing done through our partner laboratories around the world, and we really look to making sure that we can continue to bring those tests to our community as best as we possibly can, and with the greatest amount of affordability and better turnaround times, so we can allow patients to make better informed decisions, especially on things like carrier testing there. And the GeneType brand is the smaller component of our current revenues that we've got at the moment, although we believe and we're forward-looking and forward estimates, are that the most material growth for us as an organization in the coming six months, 12 and two years, will actually come out of the big material contracts that we're looking to secure with the payers with the GeneType brand and expanding that one worldwide."
