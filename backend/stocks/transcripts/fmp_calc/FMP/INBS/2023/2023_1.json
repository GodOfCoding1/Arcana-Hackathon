    "content": " As with GBS\u00e2\u0080\u0099 prior proprietary saliva-based testing technology, Intelligent Bio Solutions intends to explore the full breadth of applications for fingerprint testing beyond the current portfolio of drugs of abuse, including potential diagnostic applications already identified, these being, opioids for pain, epilepsy treatments, antipsychotics, cortisol, C-peptide and fructosamine. Based on the IFP knowledge base and intellectual property, Intelligent Bio Solutions also foresees diagnostic potential for the fingerprint testing platform in areas including infectious diseases, such as MRSA, Lyme disease, dengue, severe dengue, measles and German measles. Moving beyond just fingerprint assays, another area that clearly demonstrates the diagnostic potential of IFP\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lateral flow technology is the recent receipt of CE marking for a saliva-based rapid antigen screening test for COVID-19, which is both less invasive compared to nasal and throat tests, contains no single-use plastic and is 95% lighter than conventional tests, reducing both material waste and logistics costs associated with ongoing global demand for COVID testing."
