And then the other thing is, as we're thinking about the marketing for Pura Vida, it's not just the data, but it's also looking at different channels, both from a performance marketing and also leveraging even heavier, the influencer part of the business because what we're seeing in a lot of the direct-to-consumer companies with lower AOVs is the importance of kind of releveraging out the influencer put more time and energy into the influencer tribe, so to speak. And then we'll start -- what we're doing this year to is really leveraging now that Vera Bradley kind of the streaming TV, and we think it's a way to bring new customers into our back-to-campus business.
