    "content": " I think one, what we're seeing from a spending behavior, the biggest story for us is the impact of gas prices on the factory channel, that will be perfectly honest, even not so much just total discretionary spending, but just the ability to go out to factory stores, generate the traffic there that we're seeing the impact. Yes, the only thing I would add to that, Rob, if you think about Pura Vida, in the stores, the apparel business, when the consumer gets the opportunity to touch and feel the quality of the apparel business, we're seeing them engage with that product much more broadly than they do when they're online. I actually think that that's a positive on the logistics as we move through the end of the year, particularly, as we are able next year to redo contracts as we're able to get the capitalized costs working through the balance sheet that will be a profit improvement that you'll definitely see as we move into next year, which is encouraging to see."
