    "content": " Vera Bradley Indirect segment revenues totaled $20.9 million, a 6.4% decrease from $22.3 million in the prior year third quarter, reflecting a reduction in orders primarily related to a lower volume of mask sales and a reduction in sales to certain key accounts, partially offset by a rebound in specialty account orders in other product categories that were negatively impacted by COVID-19 in the prior year. For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, our updated expectations are: consolidated net revenues of $155 million to $160 million; net revenues totaled $142.4 million in the prior year fourth quarter; a consolidated gross margin of 51.6% to 52.1% and compared to 54.7% in the prior year fourth quarter. Based on fourth quarter expectations, our updated expectations for the fiscal year are: Consolidated net revenues of $546 million to $551 million, net revenues totaled $468.3 million in fiscal 2021; free cash flow of $45 million to $50 million compared to $15 million in the prior year; a consolidated gross margin of 53.5% to 53.6% compared to 57% in fiscal 2021; the retroactive restatement of GSP, which would equate to approximately $4 million to $5 million in gross profit or 70 basis points to 90 basis points is not included in the current year gross margin estimate. Prior year gross margin was impacted by mask sales, which improved margin by approximately 200 basis points; consolidated SG&A expense of $260 million to $261 million compared to $233 million in fiscal 2021; consolidated operating income of $34 million to $37 million compared to $34 million last year; consolidated diluted EPS of $0.65 to $0.70, diluted EPS totaled $0.63 last year."
