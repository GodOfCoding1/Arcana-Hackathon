    "content": " On a two-year comparison, Pura Vida\u2019s revenues grew over 40% versus the first quarter of fiscal 2020, and Vera Bradley comp sales were flat with fiscal 2020 first quarter results. We have seen our core customers age in terms of kind of the fastest growing group, the one we\u2019re targeting is really in that 25 to 35 year range, which is a significant change from the past, and I think it really underscores between all the collaborations, the sustainability, the new approach to marketing, the focus on social media advertising, influencers, all of that has made us more relevant with that millennial group. One, the data analytics and the targeted marketing, customer journey reactivation, really owning our customer data particularly at the Vera Bradley brand, having first party data I think becomes super critical not only today but as we\u2019re moving through the iOS updates, the pending Google updates, and we think that will be really critical to continuing to grow our direct own digital. Obviously those collections are limited, but we\u2019re learning a lot about the customer, what she\u2019s responding to, sizing, and we definitely think that really building up Pura Vida from a lifestyle brand over multi years just provides some real significant opportunity, because I think that Pura Vida can become much more balanced instead of just so heavy on the jewelry category. We started down the environmental path really by focusing on what we felt would have the biggest impact, which was fabrications, and we felt, one, that that could have the biggest impact short term on the environment, being a good corporate citizen, but second of all, it was a way to really position Vera Bradley more in the forefront of what\u2019s going on out there addressing the environmental needs, and we\u2019re seeing a younger customer respond to that, so I would encourage everybody to kind of watch as we continue to move more fabrications to the sustainable platform becomes really important. As we\u2019re looking how important the charity bracelet program is to Pura Vida, the impact of the charity on the apparel business at Pura Vida, everything that Vera Bradley has done over the years from the foundation to Blessings in a Backpack, we really think that this younger customer really expects brands that they want to be part of, and brands part of the community to have a very strong social as well as environmental positioning, so that\u2019s how we\u2019re looking at this. Yes, I would only add that I think versus two years ago, when we were looking for our first acquisition, I think there\u2019s more activity or more inbound activity with us now that we\u2019ve completed our first acquisition, so I think if you\u2019re just looking apples-to-apples for Vera Bradley, there\u2019s probably a little bit more activity--\n Or deal flow, yes."
