    "content": " But the key item for us, we're not as concerned about getting supply in right now, it's more about having the factory to be able to, A, get it fully running at high capacities for the first shift, the second shift, if we get big orders and then we continue -- we add another line next door. So the money that you typically receive for Tranche 3, which would have been in about six to nine months to a year, everyone's going to get for -- Tranche 2. But to address the market of Border Patrol from what we've gathered from our meetings is, they typically have about 400 drones that are in service, and they need to have 200 or so other drones to make sure there's 400 always stay in service. We're not saying that we're getting 600 drone order in the next couple of months, but we believe that that is up for -- that's an option to replace these older drones they've been flying."
