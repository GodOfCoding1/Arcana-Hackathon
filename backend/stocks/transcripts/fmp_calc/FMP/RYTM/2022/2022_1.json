    "content": " And really importantly, as we have highlighted in the past, we continue to get to interact with patients who have consented into our patient services group, now called in tune and that hugely valuable insights, as we think about how we can provide the best service for that patient, how we can help them manage through the early part of beginning of therapy like this, the daily administration, the early side effects and the that all can be significantly benefited by that strong interaction. As a reminder, the pediatric trial is a multicenter multinational one year open label Phase 3 trial enrolling patients with biallelic POMC, PSCK1 or Leptin Receptor deficiency obesity, or a clinical diagnosis of BBS for genetic confirmation. EMANATE includes four independent sub studies evaluating setmelanotide compared to placebo over 52 weeks, patients six years of age and older with hyperphagia and obesity due to a heterozygous variant of the POMC, PCSK1 genes leptin receptor genes, SRC1 genes, SH2B1 gene."
