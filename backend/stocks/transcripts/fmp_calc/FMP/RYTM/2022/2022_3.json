    "content": " On Slide 5, since BBS approval in June, we have received 120-plus scripts, 80-plus physicians have written prescriptions from 40-plus patients have been approved for reimbursement. So now let me briefly review our acquired hypothalamic obesity program, although the estimated patient population of 5,000 to 10,000 patients may be similar or somewhat larger than the BBS population, the fundamental difference is that these patients are identified, have ongoing engagement with the health care system and for the most part, we believe they are being actively followed by endoprinologists, a primary call point for our current commercial efforts. More than 90% of BBS patients with prescriptions have consented to participate in our patient support service program, Rhythm InTune, enabling us to help patients achieve access, prepare them to initiate IMCIVREE treatment and ensure ongoing continuity of therapy. I will say that just in general, though, the teams are just continuing to expand the opportunity around educating the physicians that we have that already have BBS patients and once again, really trying to expand the opportunity just in terms of additional patients that get diagnosed. They're quite different in terms of disease populations and the different metrics or circumstances, if you will, that allow a BBS patients to come to diagnosis and get access to treatment aside from the fact that it's just a larger population overall as well. And then our second question is on the Phase III in hypothalamic obesity, do you mind providing additional color on the rationale for all patients starting at 0.5 milligrams when in Phase II, they started on 1 or 2 milligrams... And I'll just say on the hyperphagia point, again, this is something that as we come to understand this population and disease more thoroughly, the hyperphagia component continues to be reinforced."
