    "content": " First quarter subscription revenue was $38.7 million, up 37% year-over-year, aided by the conversion of our largest maintenance customer to a subscription arrangement. Similar to our license and maintenance arrangements, as we convert maintenance customers to the hybrid observability subscriptions, we recognize a majority of the revenue upfront and the rest ratably over the subscription period. Total license and maintenance revenue was $138 million in the first quarter, which is a decrease of 5% from the prior year period. Importantly, our overall new subscription sales, including conversions of maintenance customers to subscription arrangements, were better than anticipated, which resulted in total revenue exceeding our outlook. As Sudhakar mentioned earlier, we finished the first quarter of 2022 with 852 customers that have spent more than $100,000 with us in the last 12 months, which is an 11% improvement over the previous year. For the second quarter, we expect total revenue to be in the range of $174 million to $177 million, representing a year-over-year decline of 2% to flat. Although our full year and second year -- although our full year and second quarter guidance assumes a euro to dollar exchange rate that is lower than the 1.13 million we assumed for 2022 when we provided our initial 2022 outlook in February, we are reaffirming the full year guidance for total revenue and adjusted EBITDA margins based on our performance to date and our current expectations."
