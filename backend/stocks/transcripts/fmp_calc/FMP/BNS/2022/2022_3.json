    "content": " International Banking also delivered strong earnings growth, up 30% on the back of solo phone  and revenue growth, while managing through higher interest rates and inflation. The bank reported a common equity Tier 1 ratio of 11.4%, down 20 basis points from 11.6% last quarter, primarily from strong earnings that was offset by organic growth and the impact of share repurchases. Net interest margin expanded by 7 basis points quarter-over-quarter to 2.29%, benefiting from higher deposit spreads and the impact of the Bank of Canada rate increases. Non-interest income was in line with last quarter, but declined modestly by 1%, as the prior year had elevated earnings attributable to private equity and income from associates, though partially offset by higher banking revenues, insurance fees and foreign exchange fees. Revenue declined 2%, due primarily to lower fee income driven by lower assets under management, and trading volumes, partially offset by higher interest income from strong private banking volume growth and margin expansion. The results were driven by solid business banking performance as loans grew 22% and deposits grew 9% with improving margins, mainly in the United States, in line with our growth strategy there. Capital markets revenue was down this quarter with fixed-income revenues down 34% and equities down 25% year-over-year, although modest considering the fixed income and equity issuances in the Canadian market were down 70% and 80%, respectively. GBM LatAm, which is reported as part of International Banking, reported earnings of $192 million, the second highest quarter, up 5% year-over-year as business banking earnings more than offset, a weaker capital markets performance. Non-interest expenses were flat compared with the prior year, despite high inflation of around 10% in the Pacific Alliance countries and increases related to business growth, which were mostly offset by benefits from accelerated digital progress and efficiency initiatives. So if you combine this trend, with very strong asset growth we are seeing in the Pacific Alliance countries, 16% expansion of our loan book year-over-year, 4% in the quarter, 4% in retail, 5% in commercial. But I think it's still only around 25% of the total bank when you have depressed kind of GBM results resilient wealth results, but presumably GBM and wealth will kind of rebound, trying to kind of get a feel for how much of the total bank is international going to be once you have some, I'll call it, a mean reversion in some of the other segments, keeping in mind that probably Canadian Banking is going to moderate frontier or that compounds to felony  depending on how Dan answers the question, I suppose."
