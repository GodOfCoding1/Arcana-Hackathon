Breaking out the third quarter numbers for the 8 comparable hotels more specifically, our overall RevPAR increased during the fiscal 2022 third quarter compared to fiscal 2019, was due to a 16.6% increase in our average daily rate, or ADR, partially offset by an overall occupancy rate decrease of approximately 8 percentage points. According to data received from Smith Travel Research for the fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2019 periods and compiled by us in order to evaluate our results, comparable competitive hotels in our markets experienced an increase in RevPAR of 3.9% during our fiscal third quarter compared to the third quarter of fiscal \u00e2\u0080\u009819, indicating that our hotels once again outperformed by approximately 1.4 percentage points during the third quarter. Further, when comparing our RevPAR results to comparable upper upscale hotels throughout the United States, the industry experienced an increase in RevPAR of 3.5% during our fiscal third quarter compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2019, indicating that our hotels also outperformed the segment by approximately 1.8 percentage points during the third quarter. Finally, as group business returns, our banquet and catering operations continued to drive growth in food and beverage revenues, which were up 28.2% in the third quarter of fiscal 2022 compared to the prior year and were up 6.3% compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2019. Our third quarter fiscal 2022 admission revenues increased 29% compared to the third quarter of 2021, a period that was still impacted by customer comfort concerns with returning to theaters, and day and date releases of films. Our average concession food and beverage revenues per person at our comparable theaters decreased by 2.6% during the third quarter of fiscal 2022 compared to last year, and was also negatively impacted by a higher mix of family films at daytime showings, which resulted in purchases of less expensive food items and smaller average tickets compared to the third quarter of 2021. Due to the impact of three strong blockbusters during the third quarter of fiscal 2022, which were: Minions: The Rise of Gru, Thor: Love and Thunder, and Top Gun: Maverick, the third quarter box office was more weighted towards our top movies as compared with the third quarter of fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2019. Film costs as a percentage of admission revenues increased significantly year-over-year due to a limited number of blockbusters last year, resulting in abnormally low film cost percentages in the prior year and were generally only slightly higher than our costs in the third quarter of fiscal 2019 prior to the pandemic. This follows a second \u00e2\u0080\u0093 a record second fiscal quarter, making for a record summer season in which our hotels division delivered nearly $31 million of adjusted EBITDA in the combined second and third fiscal quarters. We were pleased with our average daily rate during the third quarter, which grew approximately 4% over last year, despite the year-over-year headwind resulting from our 3 Milwaukee Maecus hotels benefiting from three large event demand drivers at high rates in the third quarter last year that did not recur in 2022. And Greg talked a little bit about it in his remarks, meaning over the early part of the summer, we saw the business traveler back at, call it, 70% of 2019 levels, and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got an outlook that, that \u00e2\u0080\u0093 the industry has an outlook that that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to go to 80% hopefully, for next year."
