    "content": " Looking towards Q4, services and care points typically have their strongest revenues in the fourth quarter as customers seek to drive engagement and use dedicated funds going into year-end. So, I would say -- I think the heart of your question is, where's the goodness going to come from next year, and so, we've been I think, fighting with one hand tied behind our back here for the last 18 months with the replatforming of our business, our sales force has been, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to say handicap, but they haven't been able to present to customers, a platform that is in operation with the same or better functionality. But obviously, we feel really good about how we're positioned going into next year to the bookings ramp, relative to the rate that we've seen over the prior several quarters, and being in a position, once people are comfortable with the migration, and active on the network for a while, our existing customers buying up more services. Okay, and then just as a follow up, you had mentioned that this year the salespeople kind of had their arms tied behind their back and because it is hard that to go with new clients and things like that when you're still working on the system, but the platform and stuff but I'm just curious because the sales and marketing the costs are pretty good, like, they definitely were lower than we were expecting. Our subscription revenue growing faster than the overall business that's going to drive our gross profit margins up meaningfully, from the low 40s to the mid-50s, over the next few years, and seeing operating leverage across the other line items and R&D being down year-over-year, driving incremental profitability, in the near term."
