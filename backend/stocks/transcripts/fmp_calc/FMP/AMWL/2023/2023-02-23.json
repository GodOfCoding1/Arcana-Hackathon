    "content": " During the year, subscription revenue growth was positively impacted by the inclusion of a full year of revenue from our 2021 acquisitions of SilverCloud and Conversa and was challenged by the temporary impact on bookings we had expected, while we focused on completing the Converge build-out, successfully migrating our existing client base, plus strategic client deployments. Visit revenue was strong this quarter and in fact, was just shy of Amwell Medical Group's all-time high of $36 million in the second quarter of 2020 at the peak of the pandemic, demonstrating the enduring value of this service to our clients. As we have said previously, while our AMG business is an important differentiator in the market and critical to many of our clients, our primary focus going forward is to drive high-margin recurring revenue associated with sales of the Converge platform plus a growing number of modules, automated care programs and services like AMG. So you can imagine with bookings building over the course of the year and then revenue starting to present from that more in the back half of the year and then driving really growth into 2024, the -- that's the dynamic going on with what's perceived to be, I think muted guidance for the year on the top line."
