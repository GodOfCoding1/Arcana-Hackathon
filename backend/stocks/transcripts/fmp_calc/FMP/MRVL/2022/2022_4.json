    "content": " In our data center end market, revenue for the fourth quarter was $574 million, growing 15% sequentially and 113% year-over-year, exceeding our guidance. Moving on to our expectations for the first fiscal quarter of fiscal 2023 from our data center end market, we project revenue to grow sequentially in the mid-single digits on a percentage basis and more than double year-over-year. Looking forward, we see ongoing growth in the data center, including revenue contribution starting from the new cloud-optimized product ramps to drive another step-up in our data center revenue in the second half of this fiscal year and beyond. Revenue for the fourth quarter was $263 million, growing 6% sequentially and 64% year-over-year, another strong performance from this large and growing Marvell business. Turning to our automotive and industrial end market, revenue for the fourth quarter was $79 million, growing 19% sequentially and 134% year-over-year. You may now go ahead. You may now go ahead.
