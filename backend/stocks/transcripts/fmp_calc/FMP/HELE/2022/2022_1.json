    "content": " Prior to the EPA stop shipment action, we initiated on May 27th, we were in a position to provide a fiscal '22 outlook with core net sales and adjusted diluted EPS growth off of the highly elevated base of fiscal '21, despite approximately $55 million to $60 million of estimated inflationary cost increases. So, you'll remember if you're kind of looking over the past six quarters or so is the time where we kind of, we had less mix of Hydro Flask, more mix of OXO and as we look forward one of the things that we look at from an operating margin perspective and we think even with the impacts that we're seeing, we can pull the operating margins flat year-over-year in fiscal '22 kind of flattish as a company and we expect we can grow in Houseware segment and a lot of that's being driven by mix improvements and getting back more mix of Hydro Flask as well as being able to offset a lot of the costs, inflationary pressures we're seeing."
