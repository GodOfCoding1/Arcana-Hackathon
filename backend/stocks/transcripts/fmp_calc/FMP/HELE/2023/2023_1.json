    "content": " For the first quarter of fiscal 2023, our consolidated net sales declined 6.1%, driven by a decline of $20.1 million related to the sale of the personal care business in fiscal 2022, the unfavorable comparative impacts of approximately $20 million from retailers that accelerated orders into the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 and approximately $15 million from orders that were not able to be shipped at the end of fiscal 2021 due to the impact of Winter Storm Uri. With regard to the quarterly cadence of consolidated adjusted diluted EPS outlook for the fiscal year, we now expect a mid-teen decline in the second quarter, primarily due to lower adjusted operating margin and higher interest expense, a low double-digit decline in the third quarter, primarily due to higher interest expense and higher adjusted effective tax rate and a mid-single-digit decline in the fourth quarter, primarily due to lower net sales, higher interest expense, and a higher adjusted effective tax rate."
