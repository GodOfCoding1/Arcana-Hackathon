    "content": " On an adjusted basis, operating margins declined by 0.4 percentage points to 16.6%, primarily driven by unfavorable operating leverage, the unfavorable impact of less Beauty segment sales within our consolidated net sales revenue, and a less favorable product mix within the Home & Outdoor segment due to the acquisition of Osprey. Our revised outlook reflects several factors, including the timing shift of sales into the third quarter versus our previous expectation of those sales occurring in the fourth quarter, higher sales in our Beauty segment due to an improved outlook for Curlsmith and a less than expected category decline in hair appliances and higher sales in our Health & Wellness segment due to a more severe start to the flu season. By segment, we now have the following net sales expectations: Home & Outdoor growth of 2.5% to 3.5%, including net sales from Osprey of $180 million to $185 million; a Health & Wellness decline of 11% to 10%; and the Beauty core business decline of 18.5% to 17.5%, including net sales from Curlsmith of $35 million to $40 million for the 10-month period of ownership in fiscal '23. My first question is, first a clarification on the consolidation of Beauty and Health & Wellness divisions into one, because it sounds like it's both the cost savings maneuver to reduce headcount, but also you're expecting it to help with brand development innovation and focus on marketing, at least that's what it says in the press release. On the retailer inventories -- sorry, I want to say one other thing about this, about  (ph), which is, you've heard us talk about SKU rationalization in Pegasus and Noel might mentioned this because that's going to help us on the topic of not just how much inventory we carry, but how quickly it turns."
