    "content": " In the first quarter of 2022, we achieved a record of 2,175 total ordering healthcare providers and a record of 761 adopters for our flagship, AVISE CTD and AVISE Lupus test. Our total revenue for the first quarter was $10.4 million, which included 30,903 AVISE CTD tests delivered. Total revenues were driven primarily by testing volumes for AVISE CTD, including AVISE Lupus which grew to 30,903 tests delivered in the first quarter of 2022 despite the disruption caused by the Omicron variant through mid-February 2022. Operating expenses were $20.1 million in the first quarter of 2022 compared with $16.2 million in the first quarter of 2021 due to increases in employee-related expenses from headcount growth, including stock-based compensation and recruitment expenses, cost of revenue due to the increase in testing volumes and cost per test, research and development costs as well as overall increases due to inflationary factors."
