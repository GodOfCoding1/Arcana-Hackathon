    "content": " In the second quarter of 2022, we achieved a record of 2,273 total ordering health care providers and a record of 797 adopters for our flagship AVISE CTD and AVISE Lupus tests. During the quarter ended June 30th, 2022, we submitted to Noridian 3,749 claims for Medicare Part B reimbursement under our PLA code for AVISE Lupus. To better understand our Medicare volumes in context for the period April 1st, 2021, to March 31st, 2022, approximately 13% of our total orders for AVISE CTD test, including AVISE Lupus, were for Medicare beneficiaries. Even with these record volumes, total revenues in the second quarter of 2022 were $9 million, compared to $12.8 million in the second quarter of 2021, this represents a decrease of 30% over the second quarter of 2021. The decrease of $3.2 million of AVISE CTD revenue is attributable to a decrease in average reimbursement per AVISE CTD test, due to a decrease in estimated collections, as well as our revenue accrual process of writing down AR balances for claims greater than 12-months. AVISE CTD test revenue was $7.2 million in the second quarter of 2022, compared with $10.4 million in the second quarter of 2021. Other testing revenue was $1.8 million in the second quarter of 2022, compared with $2.1 million in the second quarter of 2021. Our AVISE CTD and other testing revenue resulted in testing revenues of $9 million in the second quarter of 2022, compared with $12.5 million in the second quarter of 2021. Cost of revenue were $6.1 million in Q2, resulting in total gross margins of 32.2%, compared to 57.3% in the second quarter of 2021."
