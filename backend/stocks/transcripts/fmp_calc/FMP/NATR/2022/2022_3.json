    "content": " The resilience of our portfolio was on display in the third quarter, where despite unprecedented external headwinds, we delivered third quarter sales of $105 million on a reported basis or $112 million when removing the impact of foreign exchange. As a result, third quarter gross margins contracted as inflation and foreign exchange negatively impacted cost of goods by approximately $3 million or roughly 300 basis points versus Q3 of the prior year. Sales declines driven by foreign exchange also negatively impacted profitability by an additional $3 million, which contributed to adjusted EBITDA of $6.8 million for the third quarter versus $12.9 million in Q3 of the prior year. Net sales in the third quarter were $104.5 million, compared to $114.7 million a year ago. Reflective of gross margin pressures, operating income was $5 million or 4.8% of net sales compared to $10 million or 8.7% of net sales in the prior year."
