    "content": "   Operator: Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for participating in today\u2019s conference call to discuss Nature\u2019s Sunshine\u2019s Financial Results for the First Quarter Ended March 31, 2022. Despite these unprecedented challenges, first quarter sales growth was strong up 10.3% in local currency versus prior year, reflecting the strength of our brand and the steps we\u2019ve taken to build momentum in the business. That said, as the tail of the first quarter \u2013 as the tail end of the first quarter and April played out, we saw the headwinds have a more significant impact on the business and believe there is risk \u2013 there\u2019s increased risk associated with our full year expectations. We\u2019ve continued to build our digital capabilities and as a result, DTC sales have steadily increased and currently represent about 16% of total sales in the U.S. We expect the ongoing refinements and evolution of our Force of Nature digital campaign to continue to drive customer growth while the expansion of our newly developed CRM capabilities improves customer activation for new and lapsed customers. Now more specifically in the first quarter, net sales in the first quarter increased 8% to $110.5 million, compared to $102.4 million in the year-ago quarter. On an absolute basis, net sales in Asia increased 29% to $46.1 million, compared to $35.8 million in the prior year quarter. Reflective of the gross margin pressures in higher SG&A spend, operating income was $1.3 million or 1.2% of net sales, compared to $7.6 million or 7.5% of net sales in the year ago quarter."
