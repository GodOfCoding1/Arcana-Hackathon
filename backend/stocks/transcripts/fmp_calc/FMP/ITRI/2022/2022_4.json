    "content": " Gross margin for the quarter was 30.1%, 510 basis points higher than last year, primarily due to favorable mix partially offset by elevated component costs. Device Solutions revenue was $100 million, a $42 million or 27% year-over-year decline on a constant currency basis. Gross margin increased 260 basis points from the prior year due to favorable mix, partially offset by higher component costs. Other full year guidance assumptions are a euro to U.S. dollar foreign currency exchange rate of $1.05 and an average non-GAAP effective tax rate of approximately 28%, average shares outstanding for the full year of approximately $45.7 million. The timing of outcomes revenues, generally, let's call it, 18 months after the network deployment in terms of timing, it changes a little bit project to project but that's a good time of the year number to understand what the timing would be."
