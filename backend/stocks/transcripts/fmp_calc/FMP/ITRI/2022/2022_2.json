    "content": "  Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Itron, Inc. Q2 2022 Earnings Conference Call. For opening remarks, I would like to turn the call over to Ken Gianella for opening remarks. Good morning, and welcome to Itron's second quarter '22 earnings conference call. On the call today, we have Tom Deitrich, Itron's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Joan Hooper, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Following our prepared remarks, we'll open the call to take questions using the process the operator described. Before I turn the call over to Tom, please let me remind you of our non-GAAP financial presentation and our safe harbor statement. Actual results could differ materially from these expectations because of factors that were presented in today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s earnings release and the comments made during this conference call, and in the Risk Factors section of our Form 10-K and other reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Materials discussed today, August 04, 2022 may materially change and we do not undertake any duty to update any of our forward-looking statements. Now please turn to Page four in the presentation, and I'll turn the call over to our CEO, Tom Dietrich. You will hear a second quarter details from Joan coming up shortly, but here is a brief overview of the quarter. Non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.07, and free cash flow was $10 million. Next, an example of content expansion on top of an existing network footprint, AEP Ohio will be deploying our demand response offering to enhance the reliability of electricity services, especially during peak periods. And finally, we are pleased to announce a long agreement with Malaysian Utility, Syarikat SESCO Berhad for selecting Itron's network-as-a-service offering for AMI, which will enhance their analytical insights and improve their operational performance. These are just a few examples of bookings that have driven our total ending backlog to a new record level of $4.1 billion, and our 12 month backlog up to $1.7 billion, which is also a new record for the company. As is apparent from our bookings and backlogs this quarter, market demand continues to be strong for our solutions, particularly in the Networks and Outcomes segment. While demand for our offerings is strong, we continue to proactively prune non-connected and commoditized products to sharpen our R&D focus. While these actions do have near term impact on revenue, they focus and accelerate our growth into higher margin solutions and continue to move towards an asset-light manufacturing model. Next, I would like to give an update on our supply constraints. Particularly, we are disappointed by persistent shortages associated with analog semi components, which gated our revenue in the quarter, particularly for Network Solutions. We continue to take actions that are in our control such as product redesigns, multi-sourcing, prudent efforts to secure supply through alternate channels and building additional inventory when appropriate and available. Finally, I would like to give you some insight on the inflationary pressures and operational inefficiencies impacting our performance and the price cost actions we are taking to offset them. Structurally, we have made strides in reducing manufacturing overhead, streamlining our operations and moving to a more asset-light model the last few years. These continued efforts, combined with our ongoing pricing actions will improve our margin performance towards our operating model as component supply availability improves. As Tom just mentioned, our second quarter results continue to be impacted by component supply shortages and cost pressures. Second quarter revenue of $432 million declined 12% versus last year or 8% in constant rent. The year-over-year decrease was due to supply shortages, limiting our ability to meet customer demand, particularly in our network segment. Q2's revenue was gated by over $100 million, similar to the Q1 impact. Q2 gross was 29.2%, 140 basis points lower than last year due to higher component and manufacturing costs driven by the continued supply constraints, slightly offset by the exit of lower-margin devices product lines. Non-GAAP operating income was $9 million, adjusted EBITDA was $17 million. Device Solutions revenue was $105 million, a $43 million or 27% year-over-year decline on a constant currency basis. The decrease was primarily due to exiting certain product lines, including sale of our non-communicating mechanical C&I gas business. Network Solutions revenue was $269 million, a $6 million or 2% year-over-year increase in constant currency as we ramp to new deployments. Revenue in the Outcomes segment was $58 million, a $2 million or 3% decrease in constant currency versus last year. Lastly, foreign currency changes resulted in $19 million lower revenue versus the prior year. Our Q2 non-GAAP EPS was $0.07 per diluted share, down $0.21 from the prior year. Net operating performance had a negative $0.20 per share impact due to lower gross profit, driven by the component shortages and higher input costs. Turning to slides 11 through 13, I'll discuss the Q2 results by business segment compared with the prior year. Operating margin of 23% decreased 130 basis points due to the fall-through of lower gross margin, partially offset by lower OpEx. Outcomes revenue was $58 million with gross 39%, an increase of 50 basis points year-over-year. Outcomes operating margin was 16%, 460 basis points lower than last year due to higher R&D investments. Unfortunately, the component environment remains heavily constrained, which will continue to limit our revenue the back half of this year. We are assuming a euro to U.S. dollar foreign currency exchange rate of 1.06 in the second half of the year, and a full year non-GAAP effective tax rate of approximately 30%. While we are very disappointed that component constraints are continuing longer than expected, we anticipate that the supply situation will start to improve by the end of this year. And as supply availability begins to improve, we will gradually start fulfilling the deferred demand. As we discussed, the demand for our solutions is at record levels. Our ESG program is embedded in the DNA of our products and services that support sustainability, diversity and accountability of our key stakeholders. And indeed, that's what you heard us talk about in terms of setting outlook for the year. It's a combination of redesigns and multi-sourcing on our side, plus some incremental capacity improvements that suppliers are putting in place. Certainly, that's not what we see in our sector. Our demand is very, very strong, but other areas of their portfolio tend to fall off, which makes room for some of the other components that we want to put our hands on. In the second quarter, there definitely was some impacts associated with the shutdowns in China that impacted some of the near-term things and added some instability into the mix in the short run. And indeed, that's what we see from our suppliers as well. FirstEnergy is a longtime broad customer of ours, and we would absolutely anticipate working with them in other territories as well. As you know, we don't put anything in backlog on our side until two things happen. And my last one for you is just - in particular, on the outcome side, I think it's been a bit slower to evolve than both myself and investors have expected. In general, what we see from our customers is when they set up a new project, a new network, it takes a little while to get that installation done, get it stabilized, get everything integrated into their back office solution, and that's when they started adding in incremental applications from our point of view and services. So as we have seen some slowdowns in the network side of things, initially, just COVID rollout and then some regulatory delays, which have long since past, but still rippling through given the long tail of how our customers operate and now some component supplies. That said, underneath the covers, all of the right conversations are going on with customers, we see real hunger for more agility in terms of how they use their assets given volatility in the world today and plenty of good discussions with our customers that we believe in a long-term very bright future for our Outcomes business. So just going thinking about how the supply chain constraints alleviate into next year by the end of the year, like I think Joan, you said when you talked about guidance. Obviously, first of all, you need the component supply to become available, and that's primarily in the hands our suppliers, we would need, obviously, the production capacity to be able to catch up and to support our customers. And then, of course, our customers need the installation capacity, so the timing of their deployments. And as the impact of supply constraints has gotten bigger and bigger, it's harder to catch that up very quickly. And then I think you said this, Tom, in the prepared remarks about the backlog, and there hasn't been any change in customer decisions. So in terms of the backlog in place today, as you correctly stated, no cancellations or any concerns around that side. And of course, we're eager to get to deliver it as soon as we can put our hands on the proper components relative to new deal flow. Clearly, there is conversations around what the supply chain recovery looks like. But generally, the cycle for customers to go through regulatory approval and begin projects we're beyond the horizon of what is on deck in terms of the supply recovery. So customers are thinking about, obviously, the order in which they do projects based on their particular business outlook, but no change due to supply on our side. And in any way, all of the volatility in the world today only makes the things that we do more valuable for our customers. So if you think about the sale that we announced back in - I guess, in the fourth quarter of the mechanical C&I gas business. In addition to that sale, we've been active pruning and exiting certain businesses that just didn't have the margin profile that we were looking for. So if you look at even whether you look at the quarter or year-to-date, devices is down pretty significantly year-over-year. And it feels like every iteration of COVID just keeps getting more and more infectious, which suggests that another shutdown is unfortunately a matter of when and not if. The - I think there's two parts to the question that you asked there is our direct supply, we've diversified away from China pretty dramatically. It is our suppliers supply chain deeper into the cycle, which was what we saw an impact from in Q2. Absolutely, it is, and that is part of a lot of long-term semiconductor trends, some of which are even in the news from a government stimulus point of view is really all about. The Inflation Reduction Act was announced a few a few weeks ago, just or maybe it was last week, it's been a long earnings period. So I think that there's been a number of pieces of legislation, some signed and some still in process that read directly on the products that we have. So if I start with IIGAA, grid resiliency and water infrastructure, clearly, are places that we are involved in and something that's really helpful for us. And certainly, this latest build that's still throws have working its way through the Inflation Reduction Act that you mentioned have some significant investments in clean energy, which we read on. And most any conversation that we have with customers or any of the third party studies that are out there says the amount of investment in the distribution grid because of the growth in EVs that's projected the next decade or two is many, many hundreds of billions of dollars no matter how you look at it. So that is something that is exciting for us to be a part of and something that we will work hard to and our customers through, whether it is driven by government investment or just driven by consumer behavior, it's going to read on the products that we provide for our customers. I believe previously, you said it was your expectation was $200 million for the full year, but it looks like we've already reached that mark. So if I think about the revenue guidance, the reason revenue guidance came down is entirely due to the supply situation. So when we gave the original guidance, as you indicated, we thought a couple of hundred million in the first half and then things would recover drastically in the second half. As we talked about in the script, we expect it to get gradually better through Q3 and Q4, so each a little bit better. So it will be really quite different than we expected, and that's really the reason for the decline. If you look at the first half versus second half implied by kind of the midpoint of the guidance, there's about 7% growth. And to the earlier comment Ben had about devices, the growth from first half to second half is not devices. So as that continues to gradually improve, you'll see networks pick up. And then I guess with my follow-up, it looks like both R&D and G&A costs dropped quite a bit from Q1 to Q2. In general, our target for OpEx long term continues to be kind of 22% to 23% of revenue, but obviously, the revenue has been heavily constrained. We continue to control discretionary spending, but we're not going to do anything shortsighted here and a knee-jerk reaction to the current supply shortages because it is temporal and it will improve over time. And if you look at -- for the full year, we'll be slightly below what we spent last year. Obviously, $1.7 billion is very strong. It does imply a reasonable bare case scenario for 2023, just with what's already booked. Obviously, the rollout of that and transition, if you will, into revenue is dependent on the component supply. As we've signaled, we think component supply is going to get better sequentially in the back half of the year compared to first and then components constraints tend to ease into 2023. So it's a little early to talk about the details of what 2023 would look like other than the demand picture is extremely strong, and we're pleased with the response of our customers. We're going to work as closely with the customers and obviously, suppliers as aggressively as we can in that backlog into revenue. I guess of the $1.7 billion, can you give us a sense of how much of that was priced, call it, prior to the second half of 2021? The way to think about it is that the total backlog, if you will, of that $4.1 billion is roughly about a four-year period with $1.7 billion of it in the first 12 months. Since the 2021 time frame, we've obviously been indexing contracts, been working hard to re-price as much of the existing backlog as we can. The overall, I think, question around margin, I would say, for this year, built into our guidance is an assumption that given the margin pressures and the inflation pressures and the - it takes a while to get the pricing through that our assumption is that our margin is going to end the year pretty similar to what the first half was as a percent. Certainly, most of our business in Europe tends to be turns-based business. For example, given the divestiture that we did last year, most of what we do in Europe now predominantly tends to be on the water side of things. We have seen, and Joan referenced this in her earlier comments, some slowdown in the prepaid world given some of the energy prices and people making decisions based on affordability but overall. So this notion of being able to download applications into an endpoint, how people are using that capability is a mix grid side activity. We definitely see a pretty significant uptick in demand response interest as the cost of peaks in the grid, which energy prices where they are is increasing dramatically. Both of those tend to help us on both the network and the outcome side, and that is indeed reflected in the backlog. It takes a bit of time, as I mentioned earlier, for that to through from backlog into operation, but those are the areas of key interest on the part of our customers. In the prior call, you commented on book-to-bill exceeding or at least being one for the year. I guess just with the guidance cut on revenues, presumably that's more than a 1:1 book-to-bill. And as a result, the book-to-bill number is off to continue to be strong for us. Okay, you could always have some lumpiness quarter-to-quarter, but we're definitely looking for a good bookings year. I mean, if you look at where we are year-to-date, we were 1.13:1  in the first half. But as Tom said, there's some lumpiness in there, but there's lots of things in the pipeline we're optimistic about."
