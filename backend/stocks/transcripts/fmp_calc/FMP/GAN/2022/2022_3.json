    "content": " We ended the quarter with approximately $42 million in cash, which was $7 million lower from the prior quarter and heavily impacted by both the effect of foreign currencies, as well as timing of capital expenditures, including required investments in gaming licenses for soon to be launched regulated territories of Nevada and Mexico. Turning to fourth quarter and full-year performance, FX headwinds on the uncertain impact of the upcoming World Cup on our B2C business are creating a wide range of potential outcomes, despite a positive start in October when we experienced an all-time monthly record in sports betting handle on a constant currency basis. There is a lot to look forward to in the quarters ahead with our entry into the $600 million Mexico online gaming market, the launch of GANSports in the Las Vegas locals market with Red Rock and the World Cup kicking off this weekend. We've made great progress year-to-date and we're firm believers 2026 revenue targets based on both the ramp up and organic growth coming out of B2C in various different international markets, particularly Latin America, but crucially for our core value proposition, which is B2B here in the U.S. we are seeing very, very high levels of demand for the GANSports capability and we look forward to making additional new client announcement as and when contracts are finalized."
