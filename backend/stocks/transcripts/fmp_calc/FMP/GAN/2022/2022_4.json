    "content": " As major agenda items, we will also discuss the strategic review process we are announcing today, our recent successful sports betting deployment for Wynn Resorts and our amended Ainsworth exclusive iGaming content distribution partnership that will help reduce our future cash commitments by $15 million. During the World Cup event, we saw New Depositing Customers or NDCs of approximately 47,000, driven by the Latin American region, together with approximately $42 million in sports bets wagered and the final between Argentina and France actually resulted in a record $2 million in sports betting handle for a single event. I and my entire executive group firmly believe that there is tremendous unrealized value in our proprietary technology offerings, our  IP and a growing profitable B2C business that generated annual revenue of nearly $90 million this past year, which is well north of our current trading market cap. The same is true of the Red Rock contract, which will come on stream later on this year and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re very focused on not just rolling out WynnBET across all these different states throughout the balance of the next few months, but of course, getting the extraordinary existing retail and online sports betting business on Red Rock modernized with the GAN Sports solution in the Silver State of Nevada, subject of course to the all important licensing process."
