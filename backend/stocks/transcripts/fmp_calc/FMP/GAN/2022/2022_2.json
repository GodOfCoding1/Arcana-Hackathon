    "content": " In addition, we experienced a sports hold of 9.7% in the quarter versus a 7% normalized range, which created a $4.2 million benefit from last year\u00e2\u0080\u0099s second quarter. As a result, revenue and adjusted EBITDA were negatively impacted $2.7 million and $1.3 million, respectively, on a year-over-year constant currency basis and $1.3 million and $600,000, respectively, versus the expectations included in our initial guidance. Lastly, our financial results in the second quarter of 2021 provide a tough comparison as we observed higher-than-normalized hold during the European football tournament, which positively impacted our revenue and profitability by $4.2 million in the prior year quarter as disclosed previously. Record B2B revenue of $14.2 million increased 36% and B2C revenue of $20.8 million declined 13% and 2% in constant currency versus the prior year quarter, which included the Q2 2021 hold event. The largest increase was related to sales and marketing, up 36% to $7.1 million and 5 points from 15% to 20% of revenue related to focused efforts to grow our customer base in emerging Latin American markets. Our largest operating expense, G&A increased 4% year-over-year to $11.2 million and 1 point from 31% to 32% of revenue, largely due to software and related technology expenses as well as unfavorable FX expense. As Dermot commented, we are seeing underlying strength in the business exhibited by strong KPIs in both segments and driven by our core growth markets of B2B U.S., which increased 41% year-over-year and B2C Latin America, which increased 9% and 22% in constant currency. Overall, Q2 B2C segment revenue of $20.8 million decreased 13% versus the prior year and 2% in constant currency. Q2 B2B segment revenue of $14.2 million increased 36% and in fact, has increased sequentially for the past four quarters."
