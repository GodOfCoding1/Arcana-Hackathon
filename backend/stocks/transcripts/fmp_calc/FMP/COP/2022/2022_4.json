    "content": " This is why you see ConocoPhillips leaning a bit further across our deep and diversified portfolio in 2023, whether it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the Lower 48, where we achieved record production in 2022 or our diversified global portfolio, ConocoPhillips is well positioned to meet the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s long-term energy needs while also reducing our own emissions footprint. We delivered on our plan to return $15 billion of capital to our shareholders, which represented 53% of our CFO, well in excess of our greater than 30% annual through-the-cycle commitment and we further advanced our net zero operational emissions ambition with a new medium-term methane intensity target consistent with our recent commitment to joining OGMP 2.0. Your line is now open. Last year was an outstanding year, 53% back to shareholders and of the cash flow and the guidance this year, $11 billion also implies a very strong return of capital number. Your line is now open. And Doug, the project currently lining up debt financing for a portion of the spend, so you roll that all together, we would expect our 30% share of the net equity capital to be just under $2 billion over the 5-year investment period. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. Your line is now open."
