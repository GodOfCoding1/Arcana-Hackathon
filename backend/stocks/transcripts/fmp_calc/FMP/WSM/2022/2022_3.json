So for example, if I'm wrong, and retail isn't as good as I think it's going to be, this inventory can be shipped against DTC orders, which I think is a really exciting advantage that we have that particularly stores or brands that don't have retail, don't have the opportunity to achieve. And so, there are -- in addition to just the cost being normalized, I think there's some real opportunities as you think about the back half of next year and beyond to really improve the margin from here. So, that's why I tend to be quite optimistic that retail is going to be -- the retail for us at least is going to continue to overdeliver in the short term as we're comping the pandemic, not completely out of the house that we were in last year. When you really go back and you think about -- even before all these new start-ups came about, there was Macy's always in the home business and a lot of other big players and then Amazon came along and Wayfair, they've always been after price first."
