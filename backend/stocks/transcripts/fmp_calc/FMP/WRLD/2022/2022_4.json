    "content": " We attribute this record growth to positive customer experiences, increased marketing intelligence, and larger loan offerings, all in the midst of tighter credit underwriting for new customers that we began in the third quarter. In particular, new customer originations in the fourth quarter increased from approximately $25 million to over $60 million as new loan applications increased significantly by 64% versus the fourth quarter of fiscal '21 and 41% versus the fourth quarter of fiscal '20. It might have been a little bit higher, but it's still relative to -- if you go back to fiscal 2020, right, which is the last period or year we had with substantial growth like we've had in the past three quarters, it's in line with that as well as delinquencies in line with that. And further to Johnny's point about the tightening credit underwriting as we slow down our growth from these extremely high levels, we've already begun reducing our approval rates, especially for new customers."
