    "content": " In particular, we saw tremendous increases in new and returning customer loan volume when compared to last year or even pre-pandemic levels, with both customer types loan origination volumes increasing by more than 40% when compared to the same quarter 2 years ago, which is the most recent pre-pandemic comparison. So in periods like this, where we have tremendous amount of growth, especially in new customers -- new customers being up, I think it was 54.6% within the quarter, 100% year-over-year. Even our former customer base, and these are customers who had paid off a loan in the past and come back, that's up 55% year-over-year, with most of that growth being within this past quarter. As those customers stay with us into future quarters, especially if they were to refinance or even open a new loan, it's very likely that their expected losses would come down at the individual customer level, and therefore, provision would be lower. For the customers who remain on the books in future quarters, it's very likely that those expected losses and provisions are lowered. Additional information regarding forward-looking statements and any factors that could cause actual results or performance to differ from the expectations expressed or implied in such forward-looking statements are included in the paragraph discussing forward-looking statements in today's earnings press release and in the Risk Factors section of the Corporation's most recent Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021, and subsequent reports filed with or furnished to the SEC from time to time."
