    "content": " So I think, one thing to think about going forward is, we experienced rapid growth in the portfolio due to mapping back from the depressed demand from the year prior so that's one thing to think about and the other is, we typically have, fair amount of runoff in the portfolio during our fiscal fourth quarter, which is the quarter that we're currently in now, during tax season. It's really a matter of when growth continues to be substantial, but it doesn't necessarily continue to accelerate at the same rate and what we\u2019ve seen in the last two quarters, especially pretty substantial acceleration in growth, that's unprecedented and we've \u2013 as I just mentioned, we set the second quarter in a row of historical growth for the company. And I just a follow-up to John Rowan\u2019s question just, and I understand there is seasonality with the credit provisions in the next quarter, you usually get lower \u2013 the lowest credit provisions out of the year, I guess when you look at the delinquencies and charge-offs climbing, just, I guess it's hard, but kind of wondering if we should continue to expect that especially that could seems like you have, you're growing quickly."
