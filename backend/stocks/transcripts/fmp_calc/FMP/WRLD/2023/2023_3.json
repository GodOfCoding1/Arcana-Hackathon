    "content": " Additional information regarding forward-looking statements and any factors that could cause actual results or performance to differ from the expectations expressed or implied in such forward-looking statements are included in the paragraph discussing forward-looking statements in today's earnings press release and in the Risk Factors section of the Corporation's most recent Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022 and subsequent reports filed with or furnished to the SEC from time to time. For example, new customer originations in the first quarter had a 16% lower first-pay default rate year-over-year when compared to the first quarter of the prior year. While still early, our most recent third quarter first-pay default rates show a 30%-plus reduction compared to the third quarter of fiscal year 2022. New customer originations in our second quarter of 2023 had gross yields over 7% higher year-over-year when compared to the second quarter of fiscal year 2022, while the third quarter gross yields are over 25% higher, again at the same time at a 30%-plus reduction in first-pay default rates. As mentioned, our increasing confidence in the early indications of performance, low delinquency and high gross yields allowed us to begin increasing marketing to new customers, our approval rates and our loan volume towards the end of the third quarter. For reference, new customer originations were 31% of the originations in the third quarter of 2022 and 45% in the third quarter of fiscal years 2019 and 2020. This quarter, new customer originations increased with each subsequent month to 55% of comparable December volumes in fiscal year 2019 and 2020 and 45% of the prior year's December."
