    "content": " Additional information regarding forward-looking statements and any factors that could cause actual results or performance to differ from the expectations expressed or implied in such forward-looking statements are included in the paragraph discussing forward-looking statements in today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s earnings press release and in the Risk Factors section of the corporation\u00e2\u0080\u0099s most recent Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022, and subsequent reports filed with or furnished to the SEC from time to time. First, you will notice a substantial decrease in new customer originations in the second quarter, much more in line with the origination volume of fiscal year 2021 than a high growth year like last year fiscal year 2022. With this emphasis on credit quality, yields, retention and deemphasizing risk, as well as growth, as we look towards the next six months to 12 months of an uncertain economy and pending cash flow risk to our customers, we do expect a muted growth season this year in comparison to prior years. While we continue to invest in the highest credit quality, new, former and refinance customers, we expect our reduced book-to-look rates to continue into the third and fourth quarters for new customers, especially as well as tighter underwriting and exposure to refinances. The underwriting changes we have made, especially on the refinance side in the first quarter and especially the second quarter of this fiscal year, we will begin to see changes or impacts to the charge-off rates more than likely in the fourth quarter of this fiscal year from those changes and those impact a much larger percent of the overall portfolio."
