    "content": " Before we start, I'd like to remind you that the following discussion, as well as our press release and presentation, contain forward-looking statements, including but not limited to Cipher's financial outlook, business plans and objectives and other future events and developments, including statements about market potential of our business operations, potential competition and our goals and strategies. Combined, the sites operate 20 megawatts, which powers approximately 0.65 exahash per second at the data centers and can generate roughly 2 bitcoins per day in current market conditions. For the period from November 22, 2022 through December 31, we mined 180 Bitcoin at an average price of approximately $17,000 resulting in Cipher reporting $3 million in revenue for the year. Revenue for the year ended December 31, 2022 was $3 million and was generated entirely from Bitcoin mining operations. And so at any given point in time, if you think about the levers we could easily tap for financing, we could look for debt financing, which I mentioned we've seen offers on some of our data centers, we could theoretically sell equity to fund it, or we could sell our Bitcoin effectively via operations. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open."
