    "content": " And other future events and developments, including statements about the market potential of our business operations, potential competition and our goals and strategies the forward-looking statements and risks in this conference call include responses to your questions are based on current expectations as of today and Cipher assumes no obligation to update or revise them whether as a result of new developments or otherwise, except as required by law. Our anticipated cost for non-rig infrastructure per megawatt at our data centers is $450,000 and we anticipate completing another three data centers in addition to Alborz by early next year or in initial deployed capacity of 265 megawatts. Against this market backdrop, Cipher Mining has several key competitive advantages, the best in class power contracts and mining rig purchase contracts I mentioned earlier allow us to operate profitably in a lower Bitcoin price environment than most of our competitors. On the right side of the slide, you can see a simple two-by-two matrix that shows revenue per megawatt hour generated assuming new mining rigs with bitcoin prices of $20,000 and $25,000 and a network hash rate of 200 exahash per second and 225 exahash per second. Many of them paid top of market prices for their mining rigs at $70, $80 or $90 per terahash per second. As I previously mentioned, we have paid a very competitive weighted average cost for our mining rigs of $34.96 per terahash per second."
