    "content": " And Avero Diagnostics, a new PacBio customer who purchased a Sequel IIe in the third quarter to support its microbiome DTC test offering and could potentially scale the system to provide tens of thousands of tests per year. From a regional perspective, Americas revenue of $16.7 million declined 14% compared to the third quarter of 2021, primarily driven by lower Sequel IIe placements as customers delayed purchases due to lab space limitations funding and deferred orders due to the anticipation of a potential new sequencer launch. Excluding amortization of intangible assets, third quarter 2022 non-GAAP gross profit of $13.7 million represented a gross margin of 42%, compared to a non-GAAP gross profit of $15.7 million, or 45% in the third quarter of last year. Now, we do have -- as with any product transition, there's always customers that just bought at the end of the third quarter or people that bought in 2022 and so we were very thoughtful about that and put together a pretty aggressive customer loyalty discounts that would account for them and give them an opportunity to get into Revio and still get some power out of the Sequel IIe until Revio is broadly available to them. So we -- in the prepared remarks, we tried to give you a little color there on the fact that there's still some applications where the Sequel IIe will be quite adequate and, quite frankly, a great platform, things like AAV and even some of the power you get using the Maf kit on isoform sequencing, you get really nice -- you can get really nice scientific results."
