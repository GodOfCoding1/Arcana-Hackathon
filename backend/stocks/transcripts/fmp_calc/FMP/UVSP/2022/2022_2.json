    "content": " Additionally, we continue to have very strong loan growth as loans grew $265.9 million or 19.6% annualized, excluding PPP loans during the quarter. During the quarter, as Jeff said, loans increased $265.9 million or 19.6% annualized, excluding PPP loans. Third, non-interest income decreased $1.2 million or 6.1% compared to the second quarter of 2021, which was driven by a $2.1 million decrease in net gains on mortgage banking and a $915,000 decrease in BOLI income primarily due to an $893,000 debt benefit claim in the second quarter of last year. Fourth, non-interest expense increased $6.1 million or 14.7% compared to the second quarter of 2021. Excluding these items, non-interest expense increased $3.6 million or 8.7% compared to the second quarter of 2021. We expect this to result in net interest income growth of approximately 21% to 23%, off the base of $173.4 million in 2021. Fourth, our non-interest expense growth guidance of 10% to 11% off the base -- the 2021 base of $167.4 million remains unchanged."
