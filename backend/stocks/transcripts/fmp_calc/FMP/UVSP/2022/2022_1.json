    "content": " During the quarter, we continued to experience solid loan growth as loans grew $112.2 million or 8.5% annualized, excluding PPP loans. While we incurred incremental expenses totaling $1.6 million associated with our digital transformation, onboarding of new mortgage lenders and costs associated with the customer who was defrauded, our core business performed well during the quarter. This modest decrease is attributable to incremental investment purchases during the fourth quarter of 2021 and the first quarter of 2022, totaling $135 million at a weighted average yield of 1.9%. Third, noninterest income decreased $2.8 million or 12% compared to the first quarter of 2021, which was driven by a $4 million decrease in net gains on mortgage banking activities offset by increases in our investment management and insurance lines of business and our other service fee income streams. Fourth, noninterest expense increased $5.9 million or 14.9% compared to the first quarter of 2021. Excluding these items, expenses in $3.8 million or 9.6% compared to the first quarter of 2021. Third, we reported noninterest expense of $167.4 million for 2021 and had previously guided to growth of approximately 6% to 8% for 2022. Lastly, as it relates to income taxes, based on our increased pretax earnings from these guidance updates, we expect our effective tax rate to be on the higher end of the 19% to 20% range that was provided during last quarter\u2019s call."
