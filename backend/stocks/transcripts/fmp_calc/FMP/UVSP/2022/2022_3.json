    "content": " Additionally, we continue to have very strong loan growth as loans grew $190.6 million or 13.5% annualized, excluding PPP loans during the quarter. Third, non-interest income decreased $2.6 million or 12.6% compared to the third quarter of 2021, which was primarily driven by a $2.4 million decrease in net gains on mortgage banking due to a decrease in saleable volume. Second, we expect the increased loan growth, coupled with the rising rate environment to result in net interest income growth of approximately 23% to 25%, off the base of $173.4 million in 2021. So, this is Mike Keim. While we are not positioned to give full guidance for 2023 as we are in the middle of our budget process, I think as you kind of just think about our asset sensitivity and the reduced benefit of that asset sensitivity, the further we get into this raising rate cycle, I would think it would be fair to include that NIM would kind of peak out in the fourth quarter, maybe into the first quarter and then you start to see it pullback into that 355 to 365 type range going forward as we \u00e2\u0080\u0093 on a more normalized basis. And as we have seen on the first handful of raises, the first 300 basis points of raises, where the changes coming in is on the liability side as the positive betas catch up, up through this point, our cumulative beta on interest-bearing deposits is in that 12% range, historically, in a rising rate environment, we would see that in the 45% range. For 2016-\u00e2\u0080\u009919, we saw a 12% average increase per year in non-interest bearing really sits there and kind of that roughly 33% to 35% of our deposit base on a normalized basis, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099d expect that to continue to grow in conjunction with our C&I growth and our treasury management and commercial offerings. So, this is Mike Keim."
