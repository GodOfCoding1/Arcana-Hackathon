    "content": " Product revenues for the third quarter ended September 24, 2022, were $9.9 million compared with $6.6 million for the third quarter ended September 25, 2021, a 50% increase year-over-year. The increase in cost of product revenues as a percent of net product revenues for the 3 months ended September 25, 2022, as compared to the prior year was primarily due to a $1 million warranty charge partially related to the quality issues from a vendor that Michael discussed. Kopin's cash and marketable securities were approximately $15 million at September 24 as compared to 29 at December 25, 2021. But can you give us a sense on the defense side, some new programs have kind of emerged more recently, what stage you are in terms of low rate initial production versus full scale and on some of the existing ones that have been around for a while, can you give us a sense of like the runway as we start to kind of think about a little more about 2023 and the outlook as we push out a little bit."
