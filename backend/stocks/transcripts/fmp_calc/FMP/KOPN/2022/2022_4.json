    "content": " The increase in cost of product revenues as a percent of net product revenues for the three months ended December 31, 2022, as compared to the prior year, was primarily due to lower absorption of costs as we reduced production to make changes in the manufacturing of products and additional material costs. Now, turning to the full year results, total revenues for 2022 were $47.4 million compared with $45.7 million, a 4% increase. 2022 revenue increase as compared to 2021 was driven by an increase in defense revenues of $6.6 million or 36%, which was partially offset by a decline in industrial enterprise revenues of $3.6 million or 37%, and consumer and other revenues, which declined approximately 500,000 or 24%. No one likes to reduce force, but that was done mindfully with the thought process around reducing our costs, not just for cost of goods sold and so we have a program in terms of looking at our cost base from our supplier set, our quality base from our supplier set, as well as our re-sales, meaning we're working with our customers actively to look at our contracts that are underperforming and negotiate those contracts again for higher re-sales if possible."
