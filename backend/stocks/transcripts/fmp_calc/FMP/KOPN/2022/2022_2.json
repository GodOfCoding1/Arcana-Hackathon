    "content": " Turning to our financial results, product revenues for the second quarter ended June 25, 2022 were 9 million compared with 6.9 million for the second quarter ended June 26, 2021, 30% increase year-over-year. Funded research and development revenues were 2.8 million for the second quarter ended June 25 2022, compared with 2.7 million for the second quarter ended June 26, 2021 essentially flat. Cost of Goods Sold for the second quarter 2022 was 7.9 million or 88% of product revenues, compared with 6 million or 87% for the second quarter of last year. The slight increase in cost for the product revenues as a percent of net product revenues for the three months ended June 25, 2022 as compared was primarily due to manufacturing inefficiencies caused by supply chain disruptions. And again we are so soft there and the activity is actually going in full speed and as we all know -- I mean working capital obviously has increased because of lot of productions -- new programs go to production and all the activities in R&D, some of them are internally funded but that's normal when things are we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re actually in the winning cycle right now."
