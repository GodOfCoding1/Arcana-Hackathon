However, we also know that live local professional sports remain some of today\u2019s most valuable programming and we continue to explore new ways to offer and monetize our content, including with a direct-to-consumer product. And you know as I mentioned during our prepared remarks, we continue to work with a growing list of these operators today that we have partnerships at the network side, obviously with BetMGM, with FanDuel, with Caesars, with bet365 and we\u2019ve seen considerable growth and revenue from this category for this fiscal versus last with as Andy indicated additional opportunities beyond that different opportunities that will come in the future."
