    "content": " Consistent with our entertainment business, Tao's results for the quarter would have been even stronger had it not been for the onset of Omicron, which temporarily impacted both demands and operations near the end of the quarter. In the fiscal second quarter, we generated total revenues of $516 million and adjusted operating income of $76 million, a significant improvement over last year's COVID-impacted second quarter. The Entertainment segment had $248 million, in revenues which primarily reflects the ramp-up of live events in the quarter, the shortened holiday season run of the Christmas Spectacular and revenues related to the Arena license agreements with MSG Sports as the Knicks and Rangers were back at the Garden for full 2021/2022 season schedules. Finally Tao Group generated revenues of $117 million and adjusted operating income of $17.5 million which as Andy mentioned earlier, reflects reopening momentum in key markets such as Las Vegas and New York, Tao's efforts to staff back up, as well as some inflation and cost of goods sold."
