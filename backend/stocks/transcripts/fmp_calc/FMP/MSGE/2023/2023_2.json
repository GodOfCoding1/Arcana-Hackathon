In summary, we are pleased with our positive momentum and look forward to the second half of the fiscal year, as we continue to pursue strategic opportunities including our planned spin-off and our MSG Sphere initiative that we are confident will position us well to drive long-term shareholder value. On a total company basis, we generated revenues of $642.2 million and adjusted operating income of $124.1 million, an increase of 24% and 63% respectively as compared to the fiscal 2022 second quarter."
