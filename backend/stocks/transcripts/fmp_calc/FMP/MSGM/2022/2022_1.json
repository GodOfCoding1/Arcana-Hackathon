    "content": " Please refer to today's press release and the company's filings with the SEC, including its most recent quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the year ended March 31, 2022 for a detailed discussion of certain -- of the risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in any forward-looking statements made today. By moving to a season expansion update for 2022, more time is allocated to the development team to work on the NASCAR 2023 to include the improvements and new features with the goal of releasing earlier in the year than previous titles. It was a great feeling last week our team accepted the 2021 sport technology award for best use of esports by its sports brand, and we're looking forward to announcing the details of our 2022 into 2023 Le Mans virtual series soon and continuing to build on this momentum with our other franchises. Additionally, we're also exploring various new business development opportunities, since we are the only studio that holds these type of world class IP racing game licenses, it's possible to leverage these licenses and bring in additional studio partners that would build alternative games and profit share with us."
