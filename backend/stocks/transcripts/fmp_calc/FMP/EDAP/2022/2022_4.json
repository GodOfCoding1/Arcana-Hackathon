    "content": " As a global leader in therapeutic HIFU, it is becoming increasingly clear that EDAP's technology leadership, product offering, as well as customer support and distribution capabilities are all translating into increased recognition of Focal One Robotic HIFU as a leading non-invasive treatment option for men diagnosed with prostate cancer. This dynamic, coupled with significant improvement for reimbursement from CMS, will support our continued growth and expansion throughout 2023, as Ryan's team continues to introduce Focal One to an increasing number of urology practices and cancer treatment centers in the U.S."
