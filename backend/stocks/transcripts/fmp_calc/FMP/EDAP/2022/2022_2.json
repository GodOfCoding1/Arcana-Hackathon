    "content": " Our second quarter and year-to-date results together with this proposed increasing reimbursement gives us a high-degree of confidence that our growth will continue as a HIFU technology is increasingly recognized as a  offering in all urology practices, with trusted cancer patients. This move would result in an increase in reimbursement to a hospital performing the HIFU procedure on a Medicare patient to $8,711 per procedure as a national average, adjusted locally based on the wage index as compared to the current national average of $4,506. We've been successful in driving adoption and sales growth under existing reimbursement and the financial return on investment for hospitals to purchase Focal One has been very positive, but we believe the classification to APC Level 6 will significantly improve access to the treatment for many more patients seeking the benefits of focal therapy. As mentioned, this is only a proposed rule at this point and things could certainly change, but we remain optimistic and if implemented securing APC Level 6 reimbursement from CMS would be among the most significant positive catalysts since Focal One was approved by the FDA in 2018. We sold one Focal One unit in the second quarter of 2022 and one unit in the second quarter of 2021, which was 49.3% increase was driven by both higher average selling price and equipment sales and 42.7%% growth in treatment driven revenues."
