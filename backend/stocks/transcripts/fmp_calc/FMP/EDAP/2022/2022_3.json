    "content": " We believe the use of Focal One Robotic HIFU technology could greatly improve the treatment of complex endometriosis by offering patients a less invasive treatment option, without the morbidity and possible side effects associated with surgery. On another clinical front, we continue enrolling patients in BPH benign prostatic hyperplasia feasibility study using a Focal One Robotic HIFU platform, we have so far treated about two-thirds of the number of patients. We're obviously guarded optimistic in terms of, you know - where we land end of the year, but I think it's really allowed us to go back as I mentioned earlier, to speak with hospitals that we spoke to maybe months and months earlier in the year or even dating back to last year."
