    "content": " First, we completed three strategic bolt-on acquisitions for combined purchase price of $85 million, including two during the first quarter in the Industrial Automation market and one subsequent to quarter end in the Broadband and 5G markets. First quarter revenues increased 20% year-over-year to $610 million, exceeding our guidance range of $558 million to $573 million. Enterprise revenues increased 17% year-over-year on an organic basis in the first quarter, driven by improving end market trends and share capture. Revenues were $610 million in the quarter, increasing $102 million, or 20% from $509 million in the first quarter of 2021. Following the early debt repayment that we completed in the first quarter, we now expect interest expense to be approximately $50 million in 2022 compared to $63 million in 2021. The Industrial Solutions -- Industrial Automation Solutions segment generated revenues of $342 million in the quarter, increasing 21% from $282 million in the first quarter of 2021. Industrial Automation segment EBITDA margins were 19.7% in the quarter, increasing 280 basis points compared to 16.9% in the year ago period, due to solid operating leverage on volume growth and favorable pricing. The Enterprise Solutions segment generated revenues of $268 million during the quarter, increasing 19% from $226 million in the first quarter of 2021. So Industrial, I think, you can expect will grow roughly 10% year-over-year for the full year, and then the Enterprise business and I think it's the same for both Smart Buildings and Broadband and 5G, those both grow mid-single digits, call it 4% to 6%."
