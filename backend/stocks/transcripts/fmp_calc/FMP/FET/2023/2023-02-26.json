    "content": " First, pro forma for the conversion, our year-end net debt was approximately $83 million or 1.4x full year 2022 adjusted EBITDA, FET's credit rating was upgraded as a result of our significantly reduced leverage. Third, the reduction in debt decreases FET's annual cash interest payments by roughly $11 million, enhancing our free cash flow conversion. Completions segment revenue was $74 million, a 3% increase with higher demand for pressure control equipment as well as radiators and power ends supporting pressure pumping activity. Excluding the leaseback proceeds, our quarterly free cash flow of $13 million was negatively impacted by large customers who delayed payments at year-end."
