    "content": " Completions segment revenue was $53 million in the first quarter, a $2 million increase as ongoing revenue growth was constrained by supply chain delays impacting our customers\u2019 operations and a record low inventory of drilled but uncompleted wells for E&P operators. In our Production segment, first quarter results improved slightly as revenue and EBITDA each increased by $1 million. Orders in the first quarter were $40 million, a $6 million decrease as our production equipment product line experienced lower orders following very strong annual order receipts in the fourth quarter. The special items called out in our release for the first quarter includes $6 million of foreign exchange gains and $4 million of restructuring, transaction and other costs primarily related to the modification of long-term incentive awards associated with the retirement of our former CEO. We expect second quarter free cash flow to be similar to our first quarter results with customers continuing to stretch receivables, the aforementioned inventory purchases impacting cash flow and our $12 million semiannual interest payment. If you look at our kind of Q1 results and see what we\u2019ve seen, our EBITDA margin in Q1 basically came back to where we were in the second quarter or so of last year."
