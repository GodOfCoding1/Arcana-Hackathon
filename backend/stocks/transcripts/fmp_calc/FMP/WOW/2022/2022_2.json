    "content": " Our pro forma adjusted EBITDA increased nearly 10% to a record $70.6 million, driven largely by the growth in our high margin high-speed data business. In the second quarter, total revenue declined 3.2% to $176.1 million, reflecting a 4% decrease in high-speed data revenue, offset by declines in video and telephony, which decreased 13.7% and 11.6%, respectively. Pro forma adjusted EBITDA grew 9.8% from the same period last year to a record $70.6 million, driving pro forma adjusted EBITDA margin above 40%, also the highest that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve reported on a pro forma basis. Looking at the right side of the slide, our second quarter results for unlevered adjusted free cash flow, which we define as pro forma adjusted EBITDA less CapEx, increased to $35.9 million, up $13.1 million from the same period last year, enabling us to fund our greenfield investments. For the third quarter, we expect HSD revenue to be between $102 million and $106 million, total revenue to be between $171 million and $175 million and adjusted EBITDA to be between $66 million and $69 million. For the full year, HSD revenue was expected to be between $415 million and $419 million, total revenue to be between $704 million and $708 million and pro forma adjusted EBITDA to be between $281 million and $284 million.
