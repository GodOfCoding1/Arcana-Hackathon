    "content": " For the third quarter, our total revenue was down 5.6% as high-speed data revenue declined slightly from last year's record quarter, which included a onetime catch-up of previously deferred HSD revenue of $2.9 million. Without this onetime $2.9 million last year, we would have had approximately a 2% HSD revenue increase this quarter. Our pro forma adjusted EBITDA increased nearly 3% to $68.5 million, reflecting the increased proportion of revenue from the high-margin, high-speed data business, which now represents nearly 60% of total revenue. HSD ARPU of $65.80 has stayed largely consistent with prior quarters, as customers purchasing higher data speeds have been offset by the cost of promotional activity, which contributed to the increase in HSD subscribers during the quarter. The decline in HSD revenue was predominantly driven by $2.9 million of deferred revenue, which was recognized last year in the third quarter, attributed to work completed in Dothan, Alabama as part of the Connect America Fund. Looking at the right side of the slide, our third quarter results for unlevered adjusted free cash flow, which we define as pro forma adjusted EBITDA less CapEx, increased to $30.8 million, which is up $4.8 million from the same period last year, enabling us to fund the capital allocation initiatives announced earlier this morning. And so, in terms of what we saw in this quarter, I think fundamentally, the issue really going forward for the fourth quarter too, is around the inflation impacts, the interest rates on movers, but also those inflation impacts on people's budgets, and even what we're seeing is some of the consolidation of homes."
