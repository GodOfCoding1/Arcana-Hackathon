    "content": " For the first quarter, our high speed data revenue increased nearly 4% on a pro forma basis, while video and telephony revenue declined 14% and 11%, respectively, from the same period last year. Our pro forma adjusted EBITA increased nearly 8% to $66.4 million, driven largely by the growth in our high margin high speed data business. This morning, in a separate press release, we announced that we are doubling our greenfield expansion plans for homes past to 400,000 by 2027, a 21% increase to our current footprint, and now expect to invest a total of $400 million as a part of this process. In the first quarter, total revenue declined 3.8% to $174.6 million, reflecting a 3.6% increase in high speed data revenue, more than offset by declines in video and telephony, which decreased 13.8% and 11.3% respectively. The growth in HSD revenue is predominantly driven by the addition of new customers, as well as existing customers buying higher speed tiers, which has pushed our pro forma adjusted EBITDA up 7.8% from the same period last year to $66.4 million. If you look at the right side of the slide, our first quarter results for unlevered adjusted free cash flow, which we define as pro forma adjusted EBITDA less CapEx, increased to $24.3 million, up $6.7 million from the same period last year, setting a path to fund the ramp of greenfield investments later this year. For the full year, we're maintaining the guidance we set last quarter, with HSD revenue expected to be between $427 million and $430 million, total revenue to be between $708 million and $711 million, and pro forma adjusted EBITDA to be between $281 million and $284 million."
