    "content": " So the last couple of quarters, we probably had $6 million to $7 million each quarter \u00e2\u0080\u0093 each quarter end in kind of what we would call past-due backlog there, where we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got the orders, but can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get the product to the customers because supply chain issues. So we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re really kind of seeing a lot of challenges on the supply chain front, and hopefully, that will continue to work itself out as we move forward, and that can allow us to execute in the business a little bit better."
