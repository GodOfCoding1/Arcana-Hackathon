    "content": " Results across our businesses were very strong with consecutive quarterly record performance in the Reinforcement Materials segment, where EBIT was up 33% year-over-year. We reported record adjusted EPS of $1.73 in the third quarter, up 28% compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2021, driven by record results in Reinforcement Materials and strong earnings in Performance Chemicals. Globally, volumes were up 5% in the third quarter as compared to the same period over the prior year, due to 6% growth in the Americas, 10% in Europe and 1% in Asia, as the global replacement tire demand remained resilience. Looking to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, we expect Reinforcement Materials to report significant year-over-year EBIT growth due to the impact from our 2022 customer agreements and strong volumes across all regions. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open."
