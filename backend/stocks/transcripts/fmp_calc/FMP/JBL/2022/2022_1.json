    "content": " I'd say that -- I'd say for the last, I don't know, dozen years, we have a bunch of tools that have kind of migrated from manual tools to more digital tools to more data analytics as the company's matured and advanced forward, but tools nonetheless, where we've always gone from kind of manual spread sheets to the new digital tools in terms of optimizing supply chains for customers. And by the way, that's with the handicap on the supply chain dynamics, and what the team's doing there has gone so far beyond base electronics, when you think about all the things we're doing in the pharma space, when you think about what we're doing in terms of precision machining, and then also next evolution, 3D printing in terms of orthopaedics, it's, it's really, really fascinating to me. But how it gets done is, is we're continually rerunning and re running and re running the data analytics for customers working side by side with them on an absolute scale in a perfect world, as we look at their product roadmaps and their overall endpoint consumptions, here's what an optimal supply chain looks like and there tends to be a lot of variables that are all different for each product that go into those models."
