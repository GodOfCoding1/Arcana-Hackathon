    "content": " We are encouraged by our first quarter results as sales rebounded, especially within our general merchandise business as the majority of our campus stores were open as compared to the prior year where students were primarily learning remotely and the majority of our stores were closed in response to COVID. We're seeing across the 65 campus stores that are supporting First Day Complete, strong student adoption and really strong fulfillment and execution from our stores, both across the physical materials that they're picking up as well as digital. So, we don't have all the data as of yet, but it looks really strong, and really excited by the execution, the feedback we're getting from students, as well as the campuses that we serve and really proud of the execution of our teams to get the materials in the hands of students on or before the first day of class, which is ultimately allowing them to enhance student outcomes and really improving the overall student experience. I think the only thing I would add to that and as Jon said it's early in the rush to get validated this close, but we have situations with large community college state systems where they've decided to go ahead and completely fund the cost of courseware through the CARES Act funding, which means 100% of the students will be getting the books for free with no opt-out and in some cases they're doing this for two years. To the contrary, we're making the investments very wisely, but everybody is doing everything they can to attract students on a very responsible basis, keeping safety as the first priority, obviously, because we all have to do that to make sure that students are coming back on campus and feel welcome and that they -- we really have almost two freshman classes this year because the freshman classes from last year really didn't get to experience this."
