    "content": " In terms of it impacting growth, I mean, we were very, very focused, as we mentioned on the call, in making sure we\u2019re continuing our investments in the areas that most impact our customer experience, those areas being technology, our product functions, continued investments in the areas that most differentiate that client experience and helps us to continue to build out this Fix plus Freestyle ecosystem and the diversification of our marketing channels. On Fix preview, I think maybe what you\u2019re referring to is I just mentioned that our RPAC continues to demonstrate the positive impact we\u2019ve seen from the ecosystem adoption of Freestyle as well as the full rollout of Fix preview. But in general, we feel like what we\u2019re doing is really creating more purchase occasions, more product categories our clients can love through the expansion of Freestyle together with Fix. We don\u2019t actually break that out, but I will say, as we\u2019ve shared in the past, with Fix preview that that\u2019s had a positive benefit largely on keep rate, meaning the number of items that our clients maintain in part, if you think about what that customer experience is about is the client\u2019s getting really two chances to weigh in on what they get in their fix, both when it shows up, but beforehand, giving feedback of 10 items that we sent into preview. And I think we\u2019ve said before, we would expect ongoing inflationary pressures from a product cost standpoint as well as higher fuel charges, mainly due to pricing and fuel surcharges, and I also mentioned higher split shipments in Freestyle. I think without giving too specific, because we don\u2019t break out fixed and variable, we do see that $40 million to $60 million, a good chunk of it is fixed, but will also be in variable productivity."
