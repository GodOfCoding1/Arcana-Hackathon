    "content": " So the first is, as both Dan and I mentioned, we\u2019re incredibly focused on evolving the onboarding process to Stitch Fix, both for clients that are experiencing and wanting to get into Fixes as well as Freestyle. And so we see opportunity we\u2019ve already made some adjustments as we\u2019ve entered into Q2 and just more learning to just make it, frankly, a lot easier for new clients that want to get shopping right away to get into that experience as quickly as possible. And one of the short-term adjustments we\u2019ve already made there is, we know really high-intent clients, such as want to be styled, want to get a fix, making sure we get that signal and take them directly into that experience. We have started to add a lot of new clients, and we\u2019ll be adding more as we improve our onboarding experience to Freestyle. And we know, as I mentioned, with Freestyle that as we get more new customers into that experience, which we\u2019re very early stage on that growth rate, really represents subsequent purchases by existing Freestyle customers that were already Fix customers. So I think we\u2019re very early stage of opening up Freestyle to new customers, and we are still seeing growth in that core Fix business. For clients that don\u2019t request specific asks within their Fix, which is about half of our clients, the first step of that Preview is actually algorithmically generated and we\u2019ve done a lot of testing to show the power of that experience."
