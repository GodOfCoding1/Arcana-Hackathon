    "content": " Adjusted operating income of $31.3 million increased $8.1 million or 34.9% in the quarter as higher pricing, increased volumes, and favorable manufacturing performance were partially offset by higher costs associated with inflation and higher SG&A expenses. Adjusted operating income of $11.5 million decreased $5.5 million in the quarter, as higher pricing and increased volumes were more than offset by higher costs associated with inflation, higher SG&A expenses and unfavorable manufacturing performance. This improvement was primarily driven by one-time items experienced in the fourth quarter, as our margins were impacted by many of the same challenges we discussed last quarter, Due to continuing higher inflation, labor availability, and supply chain disruptions, gross margin was lower compared with the prior year quarter. But to get back to your original question, Deane, I think in the short-term, the pricing activities we've taken, the resilience in the new construction, new home market, and the fact that  have relatively flush coffers, still from the July money that was injected as a result of the CARES Act, make us feel confident that the second half of the year will feel too much -- too bumpy as a result of people not having jobs qualify for federal infrastructure dollars. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. It looks like Water Flow at higher margins than the Water Management and Water Management noticed that adjusted operating margins were just a little bit down this quarter, so when does Water Management kind of gets back to -- I think I saw 16% operating margin in 2020 and Water Flow at 20% adjusted operating margins. Your line is now open."
