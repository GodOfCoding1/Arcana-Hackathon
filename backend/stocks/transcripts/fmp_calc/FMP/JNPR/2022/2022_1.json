    "content": " Starting with Automated WAN, while this solution set experienced only modest Q1 revenue growth year-over-year, due entirely to the timing of shipments, demand for these solutions remains exceptionally strong as we experienced at least double-digit order growth across all customer verticals and all major product families including our MX, PTX and ACX offerings. Your line is live. Your line is live. Your line is live. Your line is live. Your line is live. Your line is live. I will say this, last year, we did 6.5% revenue growth on a full year basis, this year we\u2019re expecting 7% to 9% growth on a full year basis and we are expecting to exit the year with significantly elevated backlog, so that does give us a lot of confidence in 2023. We\u2019ve been outperforming the model and I think there\u2019s really no reason to believe we won\u2019t just continue to outperform in 2023, especially if supply chain starts to normalize because we do have the backlog built up and the opportunity to turn into revenue, I think will be with us for not just 2023, but quite honestly, a few years to come. Your line is live. Your line is live. Your line is live. Your line is live."
