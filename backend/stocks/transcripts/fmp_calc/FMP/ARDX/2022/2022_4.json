To launch XPHOZAH, we will focus on the 8,000 nephrology healthcare providers that account for approximately 80% of all hyperphosphatemia prescription, with a dedicated nephrology salesforce and a product positioning centered on the important role of blocking mechanism drugs can play in helping many patients who are currently unable to achieve guideline established target phosphate levels."
