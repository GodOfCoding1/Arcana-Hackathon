    "content": " The 37% comp sales growth in Q1 of last year was driven by the timing of government stimulus payments, lapping a quarter during which our stores were closed early in the pandemic and the heightened demand for stay-at-home focused purchases. Although down from last year\u2019s strong sales compared to Q1 of fiscal \u201820, our computing revenue has grown more than 30%. Our domestic appliance business, which has grown every quarter, except for 1 for more than 10 years, delivered comparable sales growth of 3% on top of 67% growth last year. Turning back to our Q1 results, our ending inventory was up 9% compared to last year and essentially in line with the growth of our revenue since fiscal \u201820. For example, Q1 revenue from this team was up 15% over last year\u2019s Q1 and up more than 70% from Q1 of fiscal \u201820. Based on these factors, I\u2019ve just outlined, our guidance for the full year now represents the following: Enterprise revenue of $48.3 billion to $49.9 billion, a comparable sales decline of 3% to 6%, Enterprise non-GAAP operating income rate of approximately 5.2% to 5.4%, non-GAAP diluted EPS of $8.40 to $9. We also know, as we look to the back half of the year, we do expect product availability and certain products and categories to improve compared to the first part of this year and also if you look at compared to last year, in Q4, there was some notable product shortages in iconic areas that we talked about not getting, that did have an impact on sales."
