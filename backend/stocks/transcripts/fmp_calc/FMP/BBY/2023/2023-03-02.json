    "content": " Our non-GAAP operating income rate of 4.8% declined 30 basis points compared to last year, which is an improvement from previous trends as this was the first full quarter of lapping the rollout of our Total Tech membership offering. Moving on to our full year fiscal '21 financial guidance, which is the following: Enterprise revenue in the range of $43.8 billion to $45.2 billion, Enterprise comparable sales of down 3% to down 6%, Enterprise non-GAAP operating income rate in the range of 3.7% to 4.1%, a non-GAAP effective tax rate of approximately 24.5%, non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $5.70 to $6.50. And so I think what we're trying to do is, that's why we also brought my Best Buy into the conversation, we're looking across the entire gamut of what we think we can provide our customers and see the opportunity for a tiered approach all the way from free, you get free shipping, which is really resonating, all the way up to a very comprehensive membership program like Totaltech, where you get everything around support. I think the comparison you're talking about is this year compared to FY '20 -- or calendar 2019, if you think about our business from the biggest change from this past year to 2019 is within gross margin in the two very big factors that have lower gross margin since that time are; one, supply chain costs that are much higher.
