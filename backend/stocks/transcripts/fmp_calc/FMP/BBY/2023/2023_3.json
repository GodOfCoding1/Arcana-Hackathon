    "content": " As expected, our non-GAAP operating income rate declined compared to last year due to the increased promotional environment for consumer electronics, the investments in our growth initiatives and SG&A deleverage from the lower revenue. Conversely, when comparing to the pre-pandemic fiscal \u00e2\u0080\u009820 comparable period, October had the most growth, while holiday shopping was more prevalent this October compared to pre-pandemic fiscal \u00e2\u0080\u009820, it was lower than last year, when there was more of an urgency for consumers to get products early due to supply chain fears. Your line is open. Your line is open. I think people are really just looking for some joy in their holiday and what feels like a little bit more normal, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d say that an holiday versus the last couple of years, Peter. Your line is open. But importantly, too, what we said is if you think about where we sit against FY \u00e2\u0080\u009820 and Q3 and as we start our growth for this holiday season will likely come a little different than it did last year and more of those sale events driving more sales later into Q4 out of Q3. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. I think to the confidence of the share repurchase question, I think we \u00e2\u0080\u0093 I think appropriately just took some time to understand the environment ahead of us on last year\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u0093 in last quarter, just to make sure we were appropriately planning for the holiday period, giving our self enough space on inventory investment and where we need to sit from a working capital perspective and feel confident about our position in Q4 and where our inventory sits. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open."
