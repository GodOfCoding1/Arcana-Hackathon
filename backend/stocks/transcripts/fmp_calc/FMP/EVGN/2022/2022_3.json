    "content": " For example, Evogene is using forward-looking statements in this call when it discusses its expected path to value creation, including potential fundraising at the subsidiary level, its and its subsidiaries expected trials and their expected results studies, product advancements, commercialization, launches, pipelines, milestones, potential collaborations, and other plans for 2022 and 2023, expected burn rate, the potential advantages of its technology and its anticipated entry into new fields of activity. I would like to now continue with an update on our subsidiaries, starting with Lavie Bio, our subsidiary focusing on developing ag biological plans, utilizing Evogene's MicroBoost AI tech engine. ICL shares our vision that by combining Lavie Bio's ag biologicals expertise, Evogene's MicroBoost AI technology with ICL's fertilizer experience, the goal of our collaboration is to create a new type of bio-stimulant products to enrich fertilizer efficiency, a product which will be highly synergistic with ICL's existing product portfolio. To-date in the first nine months of the year, our consolidated cash burn was $25.9 million, which included $3.3 million from the impact from foreign exchange and the decrease in market value of marketable securities on Evogene\u00e2\u0080\u0099s balance sheet."
