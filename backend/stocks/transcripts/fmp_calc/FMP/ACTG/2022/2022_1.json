    "content": " During the first quarter, we completed the $15 million buyback program that we announced in December, purchasing 3.1 million shares at an average price of $4.80 per share. Our GAAP book value at March 31, 2022, was $345.5 million or $7.42 per basic share compared to $430.5 million or $8.80 per basic share at December 31, 2021. On this basis, assuming full exercise of all issued derivatives, Acacia's pro forma book value would rise to $952 million or $5.91 per share, down from about $1.1 billion or $6.51 per share on the same basis as of December 31, 2021. And two, our Intellectual Property business generated $2.6 million in revenue compared to $5.8 million in the first quarter last year. Printronix contributed positive $1.6 million in operating income, offset by a $3.6 million operating loss in our intellectual property business in the quarter and G&A in our parent organization related to our business development and acquisition activities. Next, realized and unrealized loss on securities totaled $105.3 million in the quarter, a reflection of the decline in share prices of our security positions since year-end. We did realize $66.9 million in gains from sales of securities during the quarter, of which $59.5 million were from the sales of shares in our life sciences portfolio, which we continue to bring to realization. Debt at the end of the quarter was $168.7 million in senior secured notes issued to Starboard Value, down from $181.2 million at December 31, 2021, as we paid down $15 million in notes during the quarter."
