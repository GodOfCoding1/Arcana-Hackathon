    "content": " BGC's adjusted earnings margins continue to improve, representing the 6th consecutive quarter of year-over-year margin expansion, which reflects the increased conversion of our voice hybrid revenue into our higher-margin technology-driven Fenics business. Our Fenics strategy is focused on converting the company's $1.4 billion voice hybrid revenue base into higher-margin technology driven Fenics Markets Revenues, while concurrently scaling its state-of-the-art fully-electronic Fenics Growth Platforms, including FMX and cryptocurrencies. Looking at Fenics in more detail, our Fenics UST platform revenue improved 23.5% from a year ago, driven by growth across Fenics U.S. Treasuries, Lucera, Fenics FX, and Fenics GO. Fenics FX, our ultra-low latency electronic FX trading platform, had a record quarter generating strong double-digit volume growth, which drove revenue 47% higher versus last year. Fenics Direct, our web delivered multi-dealer FX options platform nearly doubled its ADV in the first quarter, driving revenue 101% higher versus the prior year period. Our Voice/Hybrid business generated revenues of $381.2 million, down 6.5% from last year due to the continued conversion of Voice/Hybrid to Fenics Markets revenue. As, you saw in our U.S. treasury business, our Fenics UST, we didn't have partners and we launched in '18, and now we've got a 20% market share at the end of the first quarter of 2022."
