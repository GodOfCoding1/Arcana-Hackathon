    "content": " Historically, huge issuance, which we've seen over the past decade, would have produced record trading volume, instead, zero and near-zero interest rates over the last 14 years have caused rates trading volumes to remain flat and credit volumes to actually declined since 2008. During the last 14 years of these zero interest rates, the relationship between new issuance and trading volume growth broke down and disappeared, leaving catalyst transactions and electronification as the best tools available to BGC to dampen the impact of these headwinds. Fenics, our higher margin technology-driven business generated strong growth through the first 35 trading days of the first quarter, with revenue currently up 11% or 13% on a constant currency basis. We are at the beginning of BGC's growth trajectory, driven by a return of meaningful interest rates, which means, we don't really worry about whether they're up or down, just that we have meaningful interest rates, and the reemergence of the strong positive correlation to an issuance and increasing trading volumes. With all those rates, 4%, 5%, maybe they'll be lower or maybe they'll be higher, this is great for US treasury volumes and you should expect volume on that platform to grow and volume across our growth platforms to relentlessly grow as these relationships return."
