    "content": " Together with our European partner, Vifor Pharma, we also remain prepared to submit a combined IgA nephropathy and FSGS MAA submission for conditional approval of sparsentan in Europe, pending alignment with the regulatory path in the U.S. I\u2019m also pleased with the further positive reception of the data from our ongoing Phase 1/2 COMPOSE study of pegtibatinase, following its presentation at SIMD last month. And any additional data beyond the interim analysis on proteinuria, which was the primary endpoint at that point could potentially increase the risk of unblinding, trial integrity and I think as we've discussed repeatedly in the past, that's really an area of focus for FDA. Also among the investor community, we see a very consistent trend that physicians feel very excited about the opportunity, the mechanistic mode of action of sparsentan to claim that foundational therapy because to Jula\u2019s earlier point, like a lot of those patients remain not treated to the target that physician would like to see. And I think the potential impacts on that eventual labeling, of course, it's a speculation at this point, but if you look at benefit risk, which is where the reviewers will start with any of the steroid class, the risk profile is very different than what you see with sparsentan where we have a high degree of tolerability such that it's a long-term therapy that other therapies would be added upon."
