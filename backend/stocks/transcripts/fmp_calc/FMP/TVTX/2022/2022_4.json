    "content": " Based upon the interim results, we believe the preliminary EGFR data available at the time of the interim analysis were indicative of a potentially clinically meaningful treatment effect after 2 years of treatment and that we'll be able to utilize those data for a traditional approval submission in 2024. Overall, we believe this label will provide nephrologists with the confidence needed to prescribe FILSPARI for their IgAN patients at risk of rapid disease progression and that this is just the beginning for realizing FILSPARI's potential. This, together with the higher end of, the robust profile of FILSPARI and our meaningful timing advantage before traditional therapies may potentially be approved gives us confidence that we will succeed in our strategic objective to make FILSPARI the foundational treatment for rapidly progressing IgAN patients."
