    "content": " Notably, during the quarter, we continued our efforts to position sparsentan to become the first non-immunosuppressive therapy for IgA nephropathy and FSGS as a potential new treatment standard, if approved. We believe that we are on a path to an sNDA submission next year, if sparsentan is approved for IgA nephropathy, and the 2-year data in our pivotal Phase 3 DUPLEX study progresses in a favorable manner. After speaking to patients and nephrologist about new REMS requirements for liver monitoring, we believe that the potential for sparsentan to become a new treatment standard in IgA nephropathy remains unchanged. With confirmation of our new PDUFA date, and the ongoing CMA review process in Europe, we believe we are well-positioned for sparsentan to become the first non-immunosuppressive treatment approved for IgA nephropathy in the U.S and Europe. Please go ahead, sir. Please go ahead, sir. Please go ahead, ma'am. But we are on track for delivery of those data sets, and we will certainly work diligently to package those for submission to the FDA, both for full approval for IgA nephropathy or full approval as an sNDA for FSGS, but also in assessing the safety data to assess the potential for any adjustment or removal of liver monitoring as part of the REMS. Please go ahead, ma'am. Please go ahead, sir."
