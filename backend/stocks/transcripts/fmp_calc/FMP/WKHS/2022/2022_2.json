    "content": " After taking a few weeks to assess the C1000, the marketplace and our competitors, we quickly pivoted and developed and are now fully executing on a new 3-year product portfolio road map, and we'll be one of the only players in the last-mile EV medium truck space with a full line of Class 3 through Class 6 commercial products in production in 2024. Yes, a good question. Yes, a good question. We lost about 12 or 18 months with our misfire on the C1000, but we've quickly pivoted and we are -- we feel we're in a really good position with the W750, the W56 that's coming down the road."
