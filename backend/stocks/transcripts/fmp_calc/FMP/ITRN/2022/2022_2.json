    "content": " Operating income for the quarter was $14.4 million, 19.7% of revenue, an increase of 5% compared with $13.8 million, 20.4% of revenues in the second quarter of last year. EBITDA for the quarter was $19.4 million, 26.5% of revenue, an increase of 7% compared with an EBITDA of $18.2 million, 26.9% of revenues in the second quarter of last year. Net income for the second quarter of 2022 was $8.7 million, 11.9% of revenue, or earnings per share of $0.43 compared with net income of $9.1 million, 13.5% of revenues or earnings per share of $0.44. During 2022 after this shock of the world of the shortage, we succeeded to buy new inventories and make capex in lower prices, not lower compared to the past but much lower compared to the current prices that we bought, so I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m expecting that total Q4 and for sure for the second half of 2023, these costs will translate to lower cost and to higher gross margins, so I believe that the profitability, the gross margins which in the end also influence the EBIT margins and the net profit, will be, I believe, materially better."
