    "content": " The gross margin on product was 23.7% in the quarter compared with 25.4% in the first quarter of 2021 and the product margin was somewhat impacted due to the product sales mix, as well as significantly increased spot prices of components due to the global shortage. EBITDA for the quarter was $19.3 million or 26.7% of revenues, an increase of 13% compared with EBITDA of $17.1 million or 25.4% of revenues in the first quarter of last year. By the way, if you look on our cash share position, this cash flow this quarter, you will see that it's looked dramatically low, but part of it is because we already acquired high inventory in the lower prices and this of course today sits in the balance sheet, but once we will sell it in three, six months from now, because this is the main time of our inventory."
