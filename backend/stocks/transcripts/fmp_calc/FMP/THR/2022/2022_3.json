    "content": " Revenue for the quarter was $100.6 million, up 26.4% over prior year, with growth largely driven by North America. Net income of $11.3 million was up 82.3% over the prior year quarter, also showed strong growth. During the current quarter, orders of $90.2 million grew 27% over the prior year period, but were down 25% sequentially due to a large one-time project secured in Q2. Pricing had a positive impact of about 200 basis points overall with the impact accelerating from the first half of the fiscal year, which is a trend we expect to continue in the fourth quarter. Point in time revenues grew 25% in the quarter and 29% on a year-to-date basis, which again, highlights the strong increases of our customer maintenance spending and viewed over the longer term is representative of the value of the global installed base of our business. Now the team is making progress in advancing our three strategic platforms to achieve our goal of $550 million in revenue by the end of fiscal 2026, while driving operational excellence to achieve EBITDA margins in the low to mid-20% range. As a result for the third consecutive quarter, we are raising our full-year revenue guidance to $342 million to $350 million from $330 million to $345 million, representing 24% to 27% year-over-year top-line growth."
