    "content": " Despite the lower gross margins, the team delivered $9.7 million in adjusted EBITDA, up almost 600% from prior year on $71.2 million in revenue demonstrating very strong operating leverage in the quarter. While we have not yet returned to pre-COVID levels of activity, we experienced a solid 35% improvement in our Q1 quick turn business over the prior year quarter as maintenance spending is showing positive signs of recovery, particularly in North America. While down 14% from the prior year period on a trailing 12 month basis, we have reached an inflection point with orders up 19% in the quarter over the prior year period and a positive book-to-bill resulting in backlog growth of 5% year-over-year.
