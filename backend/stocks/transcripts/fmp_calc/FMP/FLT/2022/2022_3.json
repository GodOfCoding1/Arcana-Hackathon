So on the first one, it obviously depends on the FX, but kind of ballpark it's $100- ish million little bit more in revenue with kind of a 75% EBITDA margin, again, kind of where the FX is today.

You may now go ahead. You may now go ahead. You may now go ahead. You may now go ahead. You may now go ahead. You may now go ahead. You may now go ahead."
