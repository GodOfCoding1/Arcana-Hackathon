    "content": " Affecting our results, fuel prices were $4.89 per gallon for the quarter, much higher than our $4.25 guidance assumption from May and contributed around $33 million of additional revenues versus prior year. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 23.7% versus 25.2% last year with the decrease driven by a $9 million discrete benefit in the quarter, partially offset by less excess tax benefit on stock option exercises and higher interest income on foreign deposits, which are taxed at a higher rate."
