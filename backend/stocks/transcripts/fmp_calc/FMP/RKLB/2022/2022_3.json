    "content": " We expect revenue in the fourth quarter to range between $51 million and $54 million, which reflects $34 million to $37 million of contribution from Space Systems and $17 million of contribution from launch services, which assumes three launches or one remaining launch in the quarter with one of those three launches being the attempted Booster Recovery R&D mission last week that was only partially filled, resulting in lower absolute and per launch contribution in the quarter."
