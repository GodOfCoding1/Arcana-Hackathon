    "content": " So, I think that we've witnessed a bit of a \u00e2\u0080\u0093 we've seen scenarios where the customers are trying to play almost a game of chicken where they're wanting to take advantage of some lower launch prices being off to them based on some either desperation or people who are just really early in the game and trying to build commitments to their platform, but when they don't execute either because the rockets fail or their programs continue to have push outs, and the customer will get nervous about keeping their payloads manifest on those rockets, those will start coming our way I believe. And then ultimately, typically how it rolls is you're \u00e2\u0080\u0093 even on your larger platform as you look for a rideshare cheap launch, you'll get it on orbit, prove out the capability of spacecraft, and then when you actually need to put the spacecraft into the desired orbits to be commercial, that's when we often see those customers coming back again and buying bulk buyers of electrons to deploy their constellation to the exact orbit."
