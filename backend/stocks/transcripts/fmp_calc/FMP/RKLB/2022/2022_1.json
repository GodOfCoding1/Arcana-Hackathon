    "content": " That same mission also marked the first mission from Pad B at Launch Complex 1, the newest of three launch pads as we continue to ramp up our Electron launch cadence at this pad at LC1 really shorten their turnaround time between launches and with extensive facilities that are already in place we can now run two launch campaigns simultaneously from LC1 to support back to back launches. Frequent and reliable launch to space is critical for our customers and with all three Electron missions this year launched within a nine-week period, electron has reached an average launch cadence of one every 31 days. The  missions for us complete immediate capture of the electron booster with a helicopter for the first time after launching the space, Electron\u2019s first stage returned to Earth under a parachute is before S-92 helicopter swift in, flew along the returning stage along with the returning stage and used a hook on a long line to capture the parachute. In 2021, our technology could be found on 38% of all launches, having the Rocket Lab logo on everything that goes to space is part of our long-term strategy and these latest missions supported by Rocket Lab technology is an example of that strategy being executed well in early 2022. And again, one of these multi-launch contracts customer's satellite platforms include Rocket Lab spacecraft hardware or flight software to support their mission. This is below our original Q1 guidance on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis of 17% and 30% respectively, driven by the un-forecasted purchase accounting impacts of SolAero that was still in process at the time we issued our guidance and the delayed launch and resulting lower -- resulting in lower absorption of overhead and indirect production and launch costs."
