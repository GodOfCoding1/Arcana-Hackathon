    "content": " We said we saw a $450 million up-sell opportunity just within our installed base, and that by going after this opportunity, we would take our dollar-based retention rates to a 105% by the end of the year. Total revenue was $90.7 million in the fourth quarter, up 14% year-over-year, Subscription revenue was $77.3 million up 90% year-over-year, driven by overall improvement in our go-to-market execution. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. And if anything, as we've added new products and added new logos this year, we're seeing that expand and we're seeing a very balanced ad with people or a very balanced adds again, I think this is maybe the third quarter in a row where we continue to see nice growth in usage. Your line is open. So I think your point, as we've seen during this last year, we didn't have some situation where customers had purchased more volume they needed, so that certainly helped us from a standpoint as what we're seeing, the consistency of add-on, but again, super balance between volume and you've seen the volume on the platform grew 25% of the transactions that went through. Yes, I think the thing you probably need to keep in mind, if you go back to our Q4 last year, it was really one of the -- it was the first quarter where we really started to reaccelerate and we had -- our Q4 at that time was the biggest quarter we've ever had for upsells, and still is a fantastic quarter when you look back at it historically. Your line is open."
