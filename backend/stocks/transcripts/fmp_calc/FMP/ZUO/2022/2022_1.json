    "content": " As we look ahead, we will continue to focus on improving net dollar retention, meeting a target of ARR growth of 17% this fiscal year and managing top-line growth and free cash flow margin by applying a rule of 40 framework that we outlined on Investor Day. I thought we'd start kind of thinking a little bit more short term here and next quarter, I know you mentioned in your remarks Todd, that there's a big lapping of a headwind and net retention in Q2, and I know Tien talked about some really good growth coming out of the install base as well. I mean, you mentioned obviously, I think the $0.5 million plus in huge increase year-on-year, evidence of the cross-sell motion, 100 K plus seems like it slowed down a little bit, but again, you've got stronger momentum, which are very largest customers."
