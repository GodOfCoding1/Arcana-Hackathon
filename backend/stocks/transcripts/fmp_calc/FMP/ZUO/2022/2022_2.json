    "content": " Well, this quarter, a large enterprise marketing SaaS leader reported over 200% increase in annual recurring revenue from just two years ago and now they are invoicing more than $1 billion in revenue across 125,000 subscribers all through Zuora Billing. For fiscal Q3 we currently expect total revenue of $86 million to $87 million, subscription revenue of $71 million to $72 million, non-GAAP operating loss of negative $3.5 million to negative $2.5 million, non-GAAP net loss per share of minus $0.03 to minus $0.02, assuming weighted average shares outstanding of approximately 125.2 million. Last year, they\u2019re seeing that these are the parts of their business, their revenue streams that are growing the fastest and they\u2019re doubling down on those areas and a company like Philips, for example, would come to mind, as an example there."
