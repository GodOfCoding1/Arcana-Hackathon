    "content": " For the Americas segment, a 2.9% decrease in revenues demonstrates the positive impact of robust pricing efforts we highlighted throughout the last several quarters, offset by lower volumes and connections with brand and retailer demand flow-through. As presented on Slide 9, among other benefits, this new facility increases our borrowing capacity from $200 million to $230 million, move the significant majority of our short-term outstanding borrowings into the expanded term loan, continues the favorable borrowing rate structure and overall loan flexibility that has been in place for several years, extends the maturity date to October 2027, and provides helpful liquidity during the current period of demand softness. The operating environment and demand trends we're seeing, both domestically and internationally, within the apparel markets are expected to remain fluid for the rest of the calendar year as major brands, apparel brands and retailers continue to deal with the inventory destocking measures and the timing of apparel production with demand recovery remaining uncertain."
