    "content": " I would now like to turn the conference call over to Waitr's CEO, Carl Grimstad, who will give an overview of the company's business activities and developments for the second quarter of 2022. In July, 2022, we entered into an agreement with the lenders of our convertible notes pursuant to which they converted approximately $6.8 million of the notes and currently now beneficially own approximately 16.3% of the company's common stock in addition to their beneficial ownership in underlying warrants. In addition to macroeconomic factors affecting order volumes, lack of stimulus payments in the first quarter of 2022, unlike those distributed in the late first quarter of 2021 also contributed to the decline in revenue for the six month end of June 30, 2022, compared to the six months end of June 30, 2021. But, this is specifically why I think that the business needs to further diversify itself into more than just prepared food delivery; but, as you heard in my comments, I do think that given the trends currently that by the end of the third quarter, backing out the sort of one-time cost of the rebrand that will start to be break even EBITDA, if not slightly positive in the fourth quarter."
