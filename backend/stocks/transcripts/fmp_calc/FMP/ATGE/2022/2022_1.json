    "content": " Similar to Chamberlain, the decrease in new student enrollment involvement represents a return to more historical trends in Walden's nursing programs following the surge in enrollment levels in the prior period, and we do believe that is attributable to COVID-related headwinds in post-licensure programs. In the first quarter, revenue increased 29.9% to $348.3 million compared with the prior year, primarily due to the acquisition of Walden. Cost of educational services was $163.1 million in the first quarter, an increase of 43.5% compared with the prior year. Student Services and Administrative Expense was $159.5 million in the first quarter, a 59.2% increase when compared with the prior year. Consolidated operating income, excluding special items in the first quarter was $54.6 million, a 0.4% increase compared with the prior year, attributable to higher revenue, mostly offset by higher costs from a return to in-person campus instruction, new campus expenses and increased marketing expense. Net income from continuing operations, excluding special items, was $31.3 million, a 24.1% decrease compared with the prior year due to higher interest expense related to the acquisition. The segment reported first quarter revenue of $135.6 million, an increase of 1.4% when compared with the prior year. September session medical and vet school new student enrollment decreased 4.6% and total student enrollment decreased 6.9% compared with the prior year, driven primarily by declines at Ross Med. First quarter revenue increased 19.9% to $59.3 million compared with the prior year, driven by increases in revenue across each of the main businesses within the segment. Segment operating income, excluding special items, increased 54.8% to $13.4 million compared with the prior year, driven primarily by higher revenue which resulted in improved operating income."
