    "content": " Simultaneously, we initiated $150 million accelerated share repurchase program using existing cash, and the company\u2019s board of directors authorized open market share repurchases for up to $300 million over the next 36 months. Our performance in the quarter was within our expectations, as we recorded total enrollments of 82,174 students, resulting in revenue of $365.6 million and expanding operating margins by 320 basis points, year-over-year, despite lingering macroeconomic headwinds. Consolidated operating income, excluding special items in the third quarter was $76.5 million, an increase of 87.4% compared with the prior year due to the addition of Walden and operating efficiencies. Net income from continuing operations, excluding special items was $42.8 million, a 39.5% increase compared with the prior year driven primarily by a higher operating income from Walden. The Chamberlain segment reported third quarter revenue of $142.6 million, a decrease of 2.6% when compared with the prior year, and operating income of $37 million up 2.4% from $36.1 million in the prior year. Segment operating income, excluding special items was $19.5 million, an increase of 30.1% compared with the prior year driven by overall cost reduction efforts. Focusing on our commitment to reducing the significant gap between the intrinsic value of our assets and our equity market capitalization, we repurchased 4.7 million shares of the company\u2019s common stock for $150 million in an accelerated share purchase agreement using existing cash. In addition, our Board of Directors also authorized open market share purchases of up to $300 million of the company\u2019s common stock over the next 36 months, which would be funded by existing cash and future free cash flow."
