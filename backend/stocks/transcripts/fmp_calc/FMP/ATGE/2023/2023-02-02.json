    "content": " For the fiscal second quarter, we delivered revenue of $363 million and adjusted earnings per share of $1.17, with adjusted EBITDA margins of 25.4%, reflecting a 220 basis point improvement over the prior year. Total student enrollment during the quarter decreased modestly by less than 1% compared with the prior year due to headwinds experience and post-licensure nursing, partially offset by continued improvement in enrollment and pre-licensure programs. Revenue in the second quarter was $131.9 million, down 6.2% from $140.6 million in the prior year. In the Med Vet segment, revenue in the second quarter decreased 1.6% compared with the prior year to $90 million, while adjusted EBITDA was $26.3 million or 8% higher than the prior year, primarily driven by continued benefit from cost management and synergy realization."
