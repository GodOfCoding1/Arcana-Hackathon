    "content": " At the end of 2018, our working interest volumes there averaged 12,000 Boe to 15,000 Boe per day from a $50 million-plus annual capital spend we were investing in the Shelby Trough prior to the farm out. As a result, we have incurred no drilling capital in that area since 2017 and working interest volumes have naturally declined over the past five years from about 10,000 Boe a day to our current level of around 3,000 Boe per day. So, while our royalty volumes are down by approximately 5,000 Boe per day in the Shelby Trough, from 2019, our run rate on royalty-driven growth there is about as good as it's ever been and we anticipate that the area will spool back up quickly. Since this play was restarted in 2019 in the middle of the commodity downturn and just before the real fun of the pandemic took hold, there have been 18 wells drilled in this play and we have -- and we are working towards contractual well commitments on our acreage delivering a strong line of sight to 25 to 30 wells per year spud over the next 12 months. Assuming the macro environment stays constructive and our key operators in the Shelby Trough and Austin Chalk deliver on their stated and mostly contractual plans, we expect to grow production through 2023 and exit next year at close to 40,000 Boe per day."
