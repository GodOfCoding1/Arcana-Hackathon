    "content": " Production from the quarter exceeded expectations due to certain operators, particularly in Louisiana Haynesville, bringing new wells on line at more aggressive initial flow rates to take advantage of higher natural gas prices. The production gains, however, more than offset the downturn in realized prices and we rerecorded $218 million in oil and gas revenues and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s up 6% from last quarter. With the strong production trends for the third quarter, we now expect total production for the year to come in at or above our original guidance level at the midpoint of our original guidance level of 34,000 to 37,000 BOE per day. We now expect lease operating expenses for the full year to be at the high end of our guidance range of $10 million to $12 million, and production costs as a percentage of oil and gas revenues to be below the guidance range of 10% to 12%."
