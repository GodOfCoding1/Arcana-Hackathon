    "content": " We expect to see production growth in the Shelby Trough as Aethon continues to ramp up development activity targeting a minimum pace of 27 wells per year by the end of this year, as well as higher volumes in the East Texas Austin Chalk as we work with our operating partners there to accelerate activity. So, I'll just start off by saying when we look at the distribution and our internal policy, as far as trying to establish what we want to set that at going forward, is that we'll look forward to the next 12 months to 24 months at overall general activity in the sector, pricing trends and everything else and try to establish what we think is a reasonable distribution that can be maintained over the forward quarters. Everyone, I mean as we've all looked out over the last five years, I think it's a general consensus in the industry that until some of these newer LNG export facilities come online, there's going to be a   in growth of natural gas because it's \u00e2\u0080\u0093 the production has gone up and the prices that were in existence last year really saw some increases in activity."
