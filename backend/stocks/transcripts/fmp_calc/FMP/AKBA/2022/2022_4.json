    "content": " We've advanced the regulatory process for vadadustat in Europe to a point where we're now approaching a potential marketing authorization, and we're excited to look ahead as we evaluate and drive potential pipeline expansion opportunities, including developing hypoxia-inducible factor prolyl hydroxylase inhibitor compounds for potential indications of serious unmet need. Within our four walls, we have the expertise to innovate and develop medicines to address patients' unmet needs. Further, our commercial team continues to keep us connected to patients while also enabling a product revenue stream to fund operations and pipeline expansion. To that end, we're also actively assessing regulatory and development paths for vadadustat in other acute treatment indications.

To that end, we're also actively assessing regulatory and development paths for vadadustat in other acute treatment indications. Beyond a European approval for vadadustat, we could initiate our next ARDS study with UTHealth in a non-COVID ARDS population, generate preclinical data for indications for vadadustat in acute settings, secure potential approval for vadadustat in other countries, including the UK, Switzerland, and Australia, secure an ex-U.S. licensing deal, resolve our FDRR process with the FDA, which would provide clarity to our expense profile and the potential revenue related to vadadustat in the U.S."
