    "content": " We've organized our strategic focus into 3 pillars: first, maximizing Auryxia performance and corporate-wide cost management; second, supporting our global partners through vadadustat review, approval and launch, as well as additional geographic expansion and evaluating options for potential U.S. approval; third, at the appropriate time, thoughtfully investing in our pipeline by developing internal assets and evaluating other strategic growth opportunities. Number one, we're extremely proud of where we've been for the last 6 months in terms of realizing this higher net price per pill, but it is still early in the year, and with some of these contractual changes, we just want to make sure that we continue to see the product perform well, and we look forward to giving you further updates on that throughout the year. We also, from a supply chain perspective, I think one of the big things that we just have to plan out with our partners is we've got a global supply chain right now that we are partnered in with Mitsubishi, with Otsuka, with Vifor, and we want to make sure that we are able to support the outside the U.S. markets, while at the same time, reduce the commitments that are needed for the near term for the U.S. market."
