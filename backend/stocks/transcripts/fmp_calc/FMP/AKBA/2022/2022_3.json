    "content": " Beginning with Auryxia net product revenue, we reported $42.2 million in the third quarter of 2022 compared to $36.8 million in the third quarter of 2021, a 14.9% increase. While year on year net product revenue is up, we did report a 3.3% decrease in net product revenue from the second quarter of 2022, driven by lower inventories at our distribution partners, as well as a continued contraction in the binder market. The increase compared to the prior year period was primarily due to a $13.2 million non-cash charge related to an increase in the liability for excess purchase commitments during the third quarter of 2022 and a $6 million non-cash benefit related to a decrease in the liability for excess purchase commitments in the third quarter of 2021, which did not reoccur. As I said, when you have the end of review conference that help narrow the focus for the formal dispute resolution as well and now it's really focused on those two issues I mentioned, thromboembolic events driven by dialysis access, thrombosis and the potential for DILI, drug induced liver injury."
