    "content": " Revenue increased 22.6% to $417.6 million in the first quarter, a new record for us, fueled by a 21.7% year-over-year increase in the number of independent active earning OPTAVIA Coaches to 63,900, another all-time record. Importantly, the number of OPTAVIA Coaches increased sharply by 6.9% on a sequential basis compared to the previous quarter, reflecting the growing precision of the programming we have implemented and continue to refine over the last several quarters. The OPTAVIA app, which is designed to support customers on their health transformation journey, had 140,000 downloads in the first quarter, increasing nearly 57% on a quarter-over-quarter net basis. Gross profit for the first quarter of 2022 increased 21.6% to $302.3 million, compared to $248.5 million in the prior year period, reflecting strong revenue growth, partially offset by increased cost of sales. We are raising our guidance above the previously announced 2022 revenue target range of $1.72 billion to $1.79 billion and we believe we will be able to achieve 15% operating margin in the long-term, despite the short-term margin pressures this year from continued investment in technology and supply chain infrastructure, along with inflation."
