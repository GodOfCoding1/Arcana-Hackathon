    "content": " Revenue of $390 million in the third quarter was down less than 6% versus the prior year period, representing an improvement on the outlook we provided earlier in the year of a mid-teen double-digit decline. The number of OPTAVIA Coaches increased 8.5% year-over-year to 66,200, while revenue per active earning coach declined 12.9% to $5,897. First, using the learning from the successful new coach accelerator program that we put in place during Q3 to accelerate building our base of active earning coaches and acquiring new customers, we expanded the program to include all coaches and extended the program period through the end of the year. Average revenue per active earning OPTAVIA Coach from the third quarter was $5,897, a decline of 12.9% driven by a decrease in the number of customers supported by each coach. Gross profit for the third quarter of 2022 decreased 7.9% to $282.8 million compared to $307.1 million in the prior year period, reflecting lower coach productivity."
