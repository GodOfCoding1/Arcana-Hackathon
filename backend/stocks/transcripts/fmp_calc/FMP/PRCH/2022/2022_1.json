    "content": " Approximately 70% of our revenue this year is expected to come from B2B SaaS fees and insurance, both of which created a strong recurring revenue engine and neither of which would be expected to be impacted a material level by shifts in the housing market. We are certainly pleased with the performance of our business so far this year and are affirming our full year 2022 guidance with revenue guidance of $320 million, up 66% year-over-year and revenue less cost of revenue, what we use as a measure of gross profitability of $210 million, up 57% year-over-year."
