    "content": " So in total because of these impacts, we're updating our full year 2022 revenue guidance to $275 million, which will be 43% year-over-year growth or 23% pro forma growth using the same methodology as we've used in the past. Additionally, with the incremental insurance claims costs and weather seen this quarter, we are updating adjusted EBITDA guidance, negative $48 million for the year. Third quarter revenue increased 20% from prior year to $75.4 million, driven primarily by our insurance and warranty businesses and contributions from acquisitions made over the last year. Our insurance segment reported revenues of $30.9 million for the quarter, a 51% increase from the prior year. The largest impact was atypical weather, including Hurricane Ian and inflationary pressures on claims costs, which has contributed $15 million to this change and slower than expected revenues due to the housing market contributed in additional $3 million. The full change in revenue was caused by lower than expected home sales, which in fact, in move related service and software revenues, you can see that revenue distribution here on Slide 13, we now expect 44% of total 2022 revenue to come for our insurance segment, 27% from our B2B software and service subscription revenue and the balance from move and post-move transaction revenue. And finally, on Slide 18, you can see our Insurance segment continues to grow and ended the third quarter with gross written premiums of $157 million, over 391,000 policies and we are generating an average of $300 of revenue per policy per year. But couple things that I'm certainly proud of, in this market that we're in right now for the business to look at 65% gross loss ratio, 87% combined ratio, those are really good results considering Hurricane Ian and just what's happened on the third quarter in particular from weather perspective."
