    "content": " The improvement in net interest income over the two comparative quarters was the result of solid organic loan growth, incremental deployment of a portion of our excess liquidity into investment securities in the first half of the year and higher asset yields from the continued increases in the Federal Reserve's targeted Fed funds rate. Net interest income increased $14.7 million as compared to the fourth quarter of last year and was up $5.4 million from the third quarter of 2022, reflective of higher yield on earning assets. Card services income decreased $3.9 million from the fourth quarter of 2021, driven by the bank being subject to the provisions of the Durbin Amendment to the Dodd-Frank Act beginning in the third quarter of 2022, which caps our per transaction compensatory opportunity for debit card interchange activities. Our total operating expenses were $79.5 million for the quarter, which was $4.4 million or 5.9% above the fourth quarter of 2021 and $2.8 million or 3.7% higher than the linked third quarter and included $1 million of merger-related expenses incurred during the quarter. And in -- on the insurances, financial services line, I believe there's like a little bit of seasonality between third and the fourth quarter versus fourth and the first quarter of the years."
