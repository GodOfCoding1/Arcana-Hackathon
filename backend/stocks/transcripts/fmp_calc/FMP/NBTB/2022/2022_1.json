    "content": " We recorded a loan loss provision expense of $600 thousand in the first quarter compared to a provision benefit of $2.8 million in the first quarter of 2021, and a provision expense of $3.1 million in the fourth quarter of last year. Net charge-offs in the first quarter were $2.6 million or 14 basis points of loans compared to 13 basis points of loans in the first quarter of 2021 and '22 basis points of loans in the linked fourth quarter, our reserve coverage decreased to 1.18% of loans from 1.24% at the end of 2021. Our total PPP balances as of first quarter in 2022 were just over $50 million with forgiveness almost complete for both the two thousand, twenty and two thousand twenty one vintage loans, we recognized $2 million of interest and fees associated with PPP lending during the quarter and have approximately $1.6 million in unamortized fees remaining. We would expect most of these remaining fees to be recognized in the next two quarters, excluding PPP recognition, loan yields were down just one basis point from the fourth quarter of 2021, meaning new volume rates and blended portfolio yields were essentially the same by first quarter end. Net interest income increased $1.2 million as compared to the first quarter of last year, but it was up $5.4 million excluding PPP recognition reflective of year-over-year loan growth and additional investment securities purchases. Salaries and employee benefit costs of 45.5 million were up 9% over the prior year and included merit-related salary increases, as well as higher performance-based incentive compensation accruals compared to a much more muted first quarter of last year. So kind of long way around getting to the point of -- first-quarter was probably the low point of the year from an operating expense standpoint, but I don't think we're going to be tons and tons above that for the balance of the year."
