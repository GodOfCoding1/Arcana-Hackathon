    "content": " This dramatic increase in market share and the rapidly increasing price of gasoline during the first quarter, drove traffic into our clubs as members continue to recognize the value of their BJ's membership. Higher tier membership penetration grew to 36% in the first quarter, representing a 4 point improvement from the first quarter of last year. This division was led by continued strength in our food business and particularly, in grocery, where comps were approximately 15% in the first quarter and up 3% and nearly 36% on a two-year and three-year stack respectively. Our general merchandise and services division comps were down 10% for the first quarter and up 22%, and up 19% on a two-year and three-year stack respectively, as discretionary spend normalizes towards a new higher base from the past two years. Digitally enabled sales for the first quarter grew 26% year-over-year and over 400% on a three-year stack, approximately 80% of our digitally enabled sales are fulfilled by our clubs with services like buy online, pickup in club, curbside, and same-day delivery. Your line is open. Your line is open. Thank you so much for your question. Your line is open. So I think -- as I think about the second quarter, I certainly think, as you compare it to last year, there is some pressure primarily from what Bob just said, as diesel prices rise, there's not much we can do about those, so certainly some pressure on merch margins in the near term. Thank you so much for your question. Your line is open. Thank you so much for your question. Thank you so much for your question. Your line is open."
