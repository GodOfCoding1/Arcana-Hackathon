    "content": " We are pleased to have achieved one of the highest quarterly revenues in our company's history, which grew 11% from one year ago to approximately $621 million, along with quarterly GAAP net income of approximately $42 million. Our full year 2023 guidance provides a range of assumptions for our electronic monitoring and supervision services segment, with the low end of our guidance reflecting a continued reduction in the number of participants in the ISAP program. And we expect our first quarter 2023 adjusted EBITDA to be in a range of $127 million and $132 million, compared to fourth quarter 2022 results our first quarter 2023 guidance reflects the impact of having two fewer days in the quarter, representing approximately $14 million in revenue and $3 million in EBITDA. You may now go ahead. You may now go ahead. You may now go ahead. You may now go ahead. You may now go ahead. You may now go ahead. You may now go ahead. You may now go ahead. You may now go ahead."
