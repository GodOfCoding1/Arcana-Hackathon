    "content": " I spent the majority of my career originating and overseeing institutional debt and equity investments across a wide range of commercial real estate assets, most recently as Chief Executive Officer of Trimont Real Estate Advisors, a credit management and servicing company with more than $165 billion of their clients' assets under management. My hands on understanding and experience of complex credit, underwriting, asset management and the requirements for successfully executing and realizing strong returns on commercial real estate investments, has allowed me to dig in quickly to plan and expand on Broadmark's growth opportunities. Importantly, Broadmark is unique among its peers being internally managed and notably possessing a low leverage fortress balance sheet to support our disciplined targeted investment strategy focused in the $2 million to $50 million origination range, across both the residential and commercial real estate investment opportunities in all major asset classes. Adjusting for the impact of nonrecurring costs and other noncash items, our distributable earnings prior to realized loss on investments for the first quarter were $22.1 million or $0.17 per diluted common share. With regard to origination volumes, which are presented on Slide 7 of the earnings presentation, we achieved $190 million of originations and amendments, up 27% from the first quarter of 2021. From an earnings perspective, as of March 31, we had $67 million in principal outstanding on loans and nonaccrual status, down 34% from December 31, but partially offset by an increase in foreclosed properties post quarter end."
