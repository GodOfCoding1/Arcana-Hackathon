    "content": " Our total cash compensation and G&A expense normalized relative to the first quarter of 2022 and while up 5.9% from the second quarter of 2021 due primarily to increased headcount in the second half of 2021, we maintain our expectation of approximately $24 million in total cash compensation and G&A expenses for the full year 2022. And under the GAAP accounting guidance, once a property is no longer under construction and is ready for its intended use, it's no longer -- you're no longer going to capitalize expenses into the principal -- or the investment in the property."
