    "content": " Crest also set a record for net sales, which increased by more than 37% year-over-year, primarily driven by nearly 28% increase in units while achieving a gross margin of more than 20%. Looking at the top line, net sales for the full year were a record $707.9 million, an increase of $182.1 million or 34.6% compared to $525.8 million for the prior year period. Although we strategically increased spend in targeted areas of our business, SG&A's percentage of net sales was the lowest for any year since becoming a public company as we continue to prudently manage cost. Turning to the bottom-line, adjusted net income for the year increased to a record $84.6 million or $4.54 per diluted share, computed using the company's estimated annual effective tax rate of 23%. Gross profit for the quarter was a record $55 million and gross margin was 25.3%, a year-over-year increase of 130 basis points and a sequential increase from the third quarter of 280 basis points. Adjusted net income increased to $32.1 million for the quarter or $1.77 per diluted share, computed using the company's estimated effective tax rate of 23%. For full year fiscal 2023, consolidated net sales is expected to be between $580 million and $615 million, with adjusted EBITDA between $105 million and $115 million. For the first quarter of fiscal 2023, consolidated net sales is expected to be approximately $165 million with adjusted EBITDA of approximately $33.5 million and adjusted earnings per share of approximately $1.30. For the second consecutive year, we achieved record setting results introduced an array of new and innovative products across our brands, produced industry-leading organic sales growth, and gained market share, all while navigating arguably one of the most challenging business environments in recent history."
