    "date": "2021-11-10 12:30:33",
    "content": " This tremendous result is due to the extraordinary efforts of the MasterCraft team and the continued success of MasterCraft\u2019s best-in-class operating model, which we leverage to mitigate supply chain disruption and increase year-over-year shipments by 22% or 143 units. Looking at the top line, net sales for the first quarter were a record $144 million, an increase of $40.3 million or 38.8% compared to $103.7 million for the prior year period. Gross profit for the quarter increased $3.9 million to $30.1 million compared to $26.2 million for the prior year period, principally driven by higher sales volume, price increases and favorable model mix. Adjusted net income for the first quarter increased to a record $12.8 million or $0.67 per diluted share, computed using the company\u2019s estimated annual effective tax rate of approximately 23%. For the second quarter of fiscal 2022, consolidated net sales growth is expected to be up in the 30% range, with adjusted EBITDA margins in the 14.5% range and adjusted earnings per share growth up in the 5% range year-over-year."
