Crest also set a second quarter record for net sales, which increased by an impressive 41% year-over-year, primarily driven by a 20% increase in units. Looking at the top line net sales for the second quarter were a record $159.5 million, an increase of $40.8 million or 34.4% compared to $108.7 million for the prior year period. Gross profit for the second quarter increased $5.9 million to $35.2 million compared to $29.3 million for the prior year period, principally driven by higher sales volume price increases and favorable model mix. Turning to the bottom line, adjusted net income for the second quarter increased to a second quarter record of $17.2 million or $0.91 per diluted share, computed using the company's estimated annual effective tax rate of approximately 23%."
