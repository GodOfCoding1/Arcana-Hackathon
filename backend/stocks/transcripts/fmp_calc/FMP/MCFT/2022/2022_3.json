    "content": " Our business performed extremely well during the third quarter as we delivered our highest net sales, gross profit, diluted adjusted earnings per share, and adjusted EBITDA for any quarter in the company's history. Crest also set a quarterly record for net sales, which increased by 28% year-over-year, primarily driven by 17% increase in units while achieving a gross margin of nearly 20%. Thanks, Fred, looking at the top line, net sales for the third quarter were a record $186.7 million, an increase of $38.9 million or 26.3% compared to $147.9 million for the prior year period. Gross profit for the quarter increased $4.8 million to $42 million compared to $37.2 million for the prior year period, principally driven by higher net sales. Turning to the bottom line, adjusted net income for the quarter increased to a record $22.4 million or $1.21 per diluted share computed using the company's estimated annual effective tax rate of approximately 23%. So we've had nice increases sequentially quarter-to-quarter, and we're going to -- we're committed to overcoming the supply chain challenges to deliver on another record quarter of fiscal -- for our fourth quarter of the fiscal year."
