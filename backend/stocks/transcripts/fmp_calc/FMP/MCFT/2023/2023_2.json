    "content": " Net sales, diluted adjusted earnings per share and adjusted EBITDA were all the highest for any second quarter in the company's history and it is our ninth consecutive year-over-year record-setting quarter. Adjusted income for the quarter increased 11% to $21.3 million or $1.20 per diluted share, computed used in the company's estimated annual effective tax rate, 23%. Year-to-date, we have generated a record $79.9 million of cash flow from continuing operations were nearly 200% higher than the prior year period. For full year fiscal 2023, consolidated net sales is now expected to be between $620 million and $640 million, with adjusted EBITDA between $111 million and $118 million. For the third quarter of fiscal 2023, consolidated net sales is expected to be approximately $158 million and adjusted EBITDA of approximately $26 million and adjusted earnings per share of approximately $1.04. So we still are being very prudent and cautious with our production plan and our guidance gives us the flexibility to modulate our retail -- I'm sorry, our production to make sure that we are achieving returns and healthy inventory levels that we've committed to providing both our dealers and our brands. So given what we are seeing is kind of a return to more retail seasonality with that, we've also seen a return of higher levels of discounts, certainly higher than we've seen in the last past couple of years. So this year reflects a more level-loaded production versus what we expect to ship throughout the year and that's going to influence the year-over-year comparisons but nothing we would note there from a negative perspective, nothing from a retail perspective that's driving that more so than just manufacturing efficiencies. In terms of promotional activity, I think, as Tim mentioned earlier, while we're certainly seeing higher promotional activity this year versus the last 2 years compared to '19, we're not seeing -- we're not back to '19 level of promotional activity. So you're going to see some higher operating, especially on the sales and marketing side in the second half of our year as we kind of go back to boat shows, travel expenses supporting the port -- boat shows, those types of expenses are going to be more back-end loaded or second half of the year loaded as an example."
