    "content": " For Q3, we expect total revenue of $60.3 million to $61.3 million or a growth rate of 16% to 18% year-over-year; revenue, excluding our largest customer, of $56.1 million to $57.1 million, this represents a growth rate of 17% to 19% year-over-year; non-GAAP operating loss of $15.5 million to $15 million or an operating loss of 26% to 24%; non-GAAP loss per share of $0.14 on approximately 110.2 million weighted average shares outstanding. But I can tell you that I think a lot of what we saw in Q2, the lumpiness, so to speak, in the back half of the quarter was honestly some aspects of what we anticipated given people's pent-up demand and desire to get away, employees included, but most importantly, in terms of our customers and prospects and partners. In summary, it was another excellent quarter as we saw strong financial performance that was driven by our international theaters and support, of course, by our channel partnerships; additionally, improving momentum in our customer base; and lastly, strong adoption of both the security and observability products and use cases like we've talked about."
