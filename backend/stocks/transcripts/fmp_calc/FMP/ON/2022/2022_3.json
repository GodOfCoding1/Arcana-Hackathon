    "content": " In the third quarter, we saw continued strong demand in the automotive and industrial end markets, with revenue increasing sequentially 11%, 5%, respectively. We reported record revenue for our strategic end markets of automotive and industrial, which together accounted for 68% of revenue as compared to 61% in the quarter a year ago. Our non-GAAP gross margin declined as expected by 40 basis points quarter-over-quarter, primarily due to an accelerating ramp in silicon carbide and lower factory utilization at 75% as we proactively slowed wafer starts by 20% from the beginning of the year. So at a high level, automotive, we see the strength -- we see the strength in and supported all by the LTSA that we -- Thad and I have been talking about, including the renewed LTSAs and the extended LTSAs that cover the demand outlook that we have, and that's why we're building capacity for."
