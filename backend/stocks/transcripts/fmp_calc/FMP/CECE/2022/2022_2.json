    "content": " 63% growth in our adjusted EBITDA with year-to-date EBITDA margins over 10%, we continue to demonstrate very nice operating leverage and $19 million of free cash flow in the quarter is obviously very strong. Of note, we would say some of the energy markets that we participate in both in terms of the energy transition areas that we think are going to continue to have sustained investment in areas around biogases and whatnot, but also just sort of back to let's say LNG, I could use the acronym LNG, LNG, LNG, over again in terms of market opportunities we're seeing. But if you look at our SG&A as a percent of revenue, even though the dollars have gone up, the percent of revenue has gone down and so that contraction, if you will, in a good way of SG&A as a percent of revenue is, at this point, more than offsetting the other negative contraction of gross margin rate, so and that ultimately what you want is to get back to the gross margins that we've historically enjoyed, and nothing has fundamentally changed about our business, I would submit to those of you that are listening today."
