    "content": " I'll start with our fantastic orders growth, which came in at $161 million, up 75% when compared to the first quarter of 2021. Sales came in slightly better than expected at $92 million, which was up nearly 30% year-over-year and flat sequentially as the teams executed for customers in the month of March and following unfreezing of our backlog. So our acquisition strategy is to stay focused on sort of our 3 core areas of industrial air, industrial water and the energy transition, first and foremost, and continue to add sort of broad industrial platforms, products, services that have more of that shorter-cycle profile to give us a better business mix to balance out our longer project revenue businesses as well. But if you would have looked back 4 or 5 years ago, if we would have had a quarter over $100 million of orders, I would say 60% to 70% of that strong quarter would have been energy-related orders, power, oil and gas, et cetera. In this quarter, our first quarter could have been $130 million at the low, give or take, or higher even than $160 million, but let's just say it landed at $160 million. So look, you can do the math and just make a determination that if we're running at $90 million, $95 million of revenue this quarter, which we did $93 million, well, it's hard to believe that we're not going to have a few quarters that reflect much higher revenues when this turns through our backlog."
