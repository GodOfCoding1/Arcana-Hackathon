    "content": " Across the consumer goods space broadly, I think we're beginning to see more signs an evidence of gross margin stabilization, if not recovery, with results across many companies either coming in ahead of consensus expectations or improving sequentially or even starting to improve year-over-year. I think the example Miguel gave around Lunchables and Capri Sun in which we saw the improvement on inventory and CFR and then our ability to actually then go into market and then drive event-based promotions that allows to then continue to grow those particular categories during the back-to-school period, which was basically a phenomenal result for us in terms of performance."
