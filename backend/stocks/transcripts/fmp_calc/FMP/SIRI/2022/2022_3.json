    "content": " Self-pay net adds were 187,000 in the third quarter as we sustained a record low churn of 1.5%, and total revenue grew 4% versus the prior year period, while advertising revenue remained relatively flat as macroeconomic factors resulted in a deceleration in ad spending late in the quarter. At SiriusXM, total revenue in the third quarter increased 5% to $1.7 billion, driven by a 6% increase in ARPU to a record $15.72, which includes a 6% advertising growth rate on the SiriusXM platform, combined with a larger self-pay subscriber base compared to the prior year period, partially offset by lower paid trial subscribers. As Jennifer mentioned, SiriusXM's net self-pay subscriber growth in the quarter was an outstanding 187,000, boosted by trial funnel growth in the second quarter, leading to increased conversion opportunities combined with growth in our streaming-only subscriber base. During the third quarter, SiriusXM's new and used car trial starts were both down 4% sequentially as auto industry sales continue to remain soft and vehicle prices remain near record highs. Gross profit in the SiriusXM segment climbed 6% to $1.08 billion, representing a gross margin of 62%, a point higher than last year's third quarter. In our Pandora and Off-Platform segment, third quarter advertising revenue of $407 million was a slight increase versus last year, and Pandora's ad revenue per 1,000 hours of $103 declined slightly from $109 in the third quarter of 2021. I think one of the great things is that we continue to hear from our customers that if we're not in a vehicle, whether it's combustion or electric, that they want to make sure that they have access to an embedded satellite radio subscription or embedded SiriusXM experience."
