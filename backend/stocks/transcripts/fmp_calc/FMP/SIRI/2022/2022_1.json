    "content": " These industry trends are also driving enhanced monetization as is evident in the IAB\u2019s new Internet advertising revenue report, which found that digital audio was the fastest growing advertising segment last year, climbing to almost $5 billion. We launched two new live shows, Open Lines on Fashion in which the host of the popular horror comedy podcast, Last Podcast on the Left, talked directly with listeners about a paranormal topic of their choice, and It\u2019s Me, Tinx Live on the Starz channel in which the well-known digital creator and host of the popular podcast gives advice directly to listeners. Adjusted EBITDA grew 1% to $690 million, a new first quarter record, even as we continue to make meaningful investments in sales and marketing plus revenue share associated with our podcasting ad rep deals. In the Pandora and off-platform segment, advertising revenue of $336 million increased 8% in the first quarter with Pandora\u2019s ad revenue per 1,000 hours reaching a first quarter record of $90. Gross profit in the Pandora and off-platform segment was flat at $137 million, in what is typically a seasonally light ad revenue quarter, with a 29% gross margin, slightly lower than last year, given meaningful investments in new podcast content that are still early in monetization."
