    "content": " SiriusXM achieved strong 2022 subscriber and financial results, reaching record high EBITDA at more than $2.8 billion and revenue of $9 billion and delivering 348,000 Self-Pay net additions with a growing base of streaming subscribers. We are not issuing subscriber guidance at this time, although we anticipate we'll see modestly negative Self-Pay net adds for the year as economic and demand uncertainty persists, auto sales remain soft, and we moderate marketing spend for our streaming service early in the year ahead of planned product improvements late in 2023. We finished the year with over 7 million 360L-enabled cars on the road and the percentage of new SiriusXM-enabled vehicles with 360L increased to 27% in 2022, a number that should meaningfully rise this year as we expand into several additional automotive brands. Given the soft ad market entering 2023 and our plans to increase marketing spending later in the year on streaming, we expect year-over-year trends in subscriber growth and EBITDA to be more favorable in the back half of 2023 than in the first half, with declines in Self-Pay subscribers and EBITDA sharpest in the first quarter and then moderating to reversing later in the year."
