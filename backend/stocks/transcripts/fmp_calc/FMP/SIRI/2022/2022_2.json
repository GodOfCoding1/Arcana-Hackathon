    "content": " While we manage through prolonged supply-related challenges in the auto industry, the strength of SiriusXM's brand and uniqueness of our product which is evidenced by our large subscriber base and outstanding churn rate of 1.5% remains extremely attractive to automakers which continue to see us as the premium audio entertainment provider of choice in North America. We generated $435 million of free cash flow during the second quarter, down 21% from the prior year as cash taxes rose by $97 million year-over-year and last year's second quarter benefited from $17 million of satellite insurance receipts. For SiriusXM, total revenue in the second quarter increased 5% to $1.7 billion driven by the larger self-pay subscriber base and 7% growth in ARPU, offset by a lower base of paid trial subscribers. In the Pandora and off-platform segment, advertising revenue of $403 million increased 5% in the second quarter with Pandora's ad revenue per 1,000 hours, stable at approximately $100. Gross profit in the Pandora and off-platform segment declined 13% to $167 million, representing a 31% gross margin lower than last year, given meaningful investments in new podcast content that are still in the early stages of monetization. We're all -- and hopeful that we can continue to improve the margin profile but I think it's still premature to talk about it, given that the market is still growing, it's still early days and we want to make sure we capture share but certainly do it in a financially disciplined way so that we can really have an additive halo effect to the overall FX and media and advertising REIT."
