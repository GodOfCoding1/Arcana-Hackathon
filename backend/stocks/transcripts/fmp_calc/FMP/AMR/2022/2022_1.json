    "content": " Our Board of Directors has also instituted a dividend at an annualized rate of $1.50 per share to be paid on a quarterly basis, with the first quarterly dividend payment of $0.375 per share being paid out on July 1 to Alpha stockholders of record as of June 15. SG&A, excluding noncash stock comp and nonrecurring items decreased from fourth quarter's elevated level of $18.1 million, down to a more normalized $14 million in the first quarter of 2022. The share repurchase program is also up and running with $40.4 million spent as of May 4 to acquire 30 approximately 302,000 shares of Alpha's common stock at a volume weighted average price of approximately $134 per share. Should we think about 14 million, 15 million tons of met coal sustainable over that outlook period or kind of in higher markets, it's that range of output and a lower market maybe drops down to 12 million, 13 million tons."
