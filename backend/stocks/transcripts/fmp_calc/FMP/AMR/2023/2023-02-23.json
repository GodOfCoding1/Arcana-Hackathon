    "content": " Export met tons priced against Atlantic indices and other pricing mechanisms in the fourth quarter, realized $196.88 per ton, while export coal priced on Australian indices realized $183.59. Looking now to our dividend program, Alpha's board has declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.44 per share, an increase from the prior quarters $41.80 per share, which will become payable on April 3 for holders of record as of March 15. Specifically looking at fourth quarter price movements for metallurgical coal, the Australian Premium Low Ball Index increased from $270.50 per metric ton on October 1 to $294.50 per ton that year end. The U.S. East Coast High-Vol A index was at $325 per metric ton, while the U.S. East Coast High-Vol B was at $310 per ton, while many of the Metallurgical markets are assessing the potential impact of China's decision to again allow the import of Australian coal as well as the country's reversal of a zero COVID policy, Alpha believes that we are well positioned regardless of those two key changes in China's approach. The API two index started the fourth quarter of 2022 at $310.85 per metric ton, and ended the year significantly lower at $190.50 on December 30th."
