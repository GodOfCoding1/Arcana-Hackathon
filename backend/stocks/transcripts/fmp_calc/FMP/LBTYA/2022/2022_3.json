    "content": " You'll see that Switzerland and Holland are nearly 100% 5G today and among the best mobile networks in the world, while the U.K. and Belgium are a bit further behind, but that's due to slower spectrum availability and market conditions. So we need to maintain that revenue stream even if it's small, because we do know that consumers in the U.K., for example, have told us - without a video product, they would be less interested in our broadband product, which is one of the advantages we have, of course, over every altnet in that market as we're offering an FMC converged bundle with video."
