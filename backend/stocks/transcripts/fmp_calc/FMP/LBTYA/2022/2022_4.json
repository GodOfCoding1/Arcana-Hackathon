    "content": " You may now proceed. In the UK, in Switzerland however, we've seen around a 3% decline in fixed ARPU related partly to the fact that we start with fairly higher ARPUs in each market and then that's compounded in the UK by declining video voice and cost of living pressures. That implies a 40% premium to our current market price of $21 to run the same math and attributing all of that premium to the FMC telcos, resulted in an EBITDA multiple of around 6.5% and an operating free cash flow multiple of about $14.5 million. But their arguments also typically include three other drivers, like the benefits we're realizing from a sub base that is now 50% converged or the expectation of continued and on-target synergy realization in the UK and Switzerland, and the inherent free cash flow profile of our businesses, especially given that we believe we're in a peak CapEx period right now. But if you were to add them all up and use today's dollar exchange rates broadly our 2021 energy cost of around $280 million increased to around $410 million in 2022 and will be around $600 million in 2023, and representing a hit to free cash flow across our portfolio of around $330 million as a result of the invasion. You may now proceed. You may now proceed. You may now proceed. You may now proceed. You may now proceed. You may now proceed. On the other hand, I would also point out that Charlie skipped over in his guidance slide, the fact that Switzerland is guiding to 320 million to 350 million of free cash flow in 2023, which I'm going to guess here Andre I think it's up 30% to 40% over 2022. You may now proceed. You may now proceed."
