    "content": " Moving to Slide 11, our commercial and medical affairs teams have done a great job executing our launch plans to quickly raise awareness among leukemia treaters, ensure quick product availability and access for patients, accelerate launch momentum through the publication of critically important third party references and continue educating our field team to hone our REZLIDHIA messaging. And last month, our launch momentum continued with the February first online publication in Blood Advances of the data from our pivotal Phase 2 cohort entitled olutasidenib induces durable complete remissions in patients with relapsed or refractory IDH1 mutated AML. For the fourth quarter of 2022, we shipped 2,417 bottles of TAVALISSE for our specialty distributors, resulting in $31.5 million of gross product sales, 2,196 of those bottles were shipped to patients and clinics, while 221 bottles increased the levels remaining in our distribution channels at the end of the quarter. Please proceed with your question. Please proceed with your question. Please proceed with your question. So it's all of those things, though, and it's taken some time, but I just give it to our sales team that's out there every day searching for new patients and painting that picture for clinicians, and they're really making a difference and our market access team has really worked so hard to ensure that patients, especially commercial patients have access to the drug. Please proceed with your question. Please proceed with your question. So as data evolve, we look at Cohort 2, it takes 28 days to say it's safe or escalate to the next cohort, but then those patients also continue and I'd say, you now look at three months, you can get a rough handle of whether there's a major signal in there. Please proceed with your question. Please proceed with your question."
