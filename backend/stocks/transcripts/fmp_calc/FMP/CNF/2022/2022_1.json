    "content": " Interest and financing service fees on loans decreased by 1.7% to RMB415 million from RMB422 million, primarily due to (a) lower average effective interest rates of outstanding loans, and (b) the decrease of average daily outstanding loan principal in the first quarter of 2022 as compared to the same period of last year. Collaboration cost for sales partners, representing the sales incentives paid to sales partners, decreased by 19% to RMB80 million compared to RMB98 million in last year, primarily attributable to the lower fee rate the company paid to the sales partners resulted from lower average effective interest rates of outstanding loans. As of March 31, 2022, the company had cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash of RMB1.7 billion compared to RMB2.2 billion as of December 31, 2021, including RMB1.2 billion and RMB1.5 billion from structured funds as of March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively, which could only be used to grant new loans and activities. And the delinquency ratio, excluding loans held for sale, for loans originated by the company increased from 16% as of December 31, 2021 to 17% as of March 31, 2022."
