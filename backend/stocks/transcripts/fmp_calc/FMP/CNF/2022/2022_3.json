    "content": " In the first-nine months of 2022, we have introduced loans of over RMB600 million to commercial banks and the outstanding loan principle under the commercial bank partnership was approximately RMB640 million, as of September 30, 2022. Interest and financial service fee are low decreased to 9% to RMB413 million for the first quarter of 2022 from RMB455 million in the same period of last year, primarily attributable to a decrease in the balance of average daily outstanding loan principles. Interest expense decreased to 11% to RMB195 million for the first quarter of 2022, compared to RMB219 million in the same period of last year, primarily due to a decrease in principals of other borrowings and lower interest rates charged by trust companies. Interest income charged to sales partner, representing a fee charged to sales partners who choose to repurchase default loans in installments, increased by 213% to RMB34 million in the third quarter of 2022, from RMB11 million in the same period of last year, primarily attributable to the increase in the delinquent loans that were repurchased by sales partners in installments. The delinquency ratio, excluding loans held for sale for loans originated by the company decreased from 16.2% as of December 31, 2021 to 13% as of September 30, 2022."
