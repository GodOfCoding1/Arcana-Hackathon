    "content": " However, given the impact of pandemic prevention and control policy, as well as the uncertainty of the China's real estate market, we continue to be conservative in evaluating potential losses and recorded a provision for credit losses of 18 million for the second quarter. Interest financial service fee on loans was 408 million, a decrease of 9%, primarily due to the decrease of average daily outstanding loan principal in the second quarter of 2022 as compared to the same period of 2021. Collaboration cost for sales partners decreased to 77 million in the second quarter of 2022 compared to 107 million in the same quarter of '21 partly due to the lower fee rate, the company paid to the sales partner in the second quarter of 2022. Interest and financing service fees on loans was 843 million, a decrease of 6% probably due to the decrease of average daily outstanding loan principles in the first half of 2022 as compared with the same period of last year. Collaboration cost for sales partners increased to RMB156 million in the first half of this year, compared to RMB205 million in the same period of last year, primary attributable to the increase in loan balance under the collaboration model. Income tax expenses was RMB19 million compared to RMB38 million in the same period of last year, partly due to the increase in taxable income in the first half of 2022 as compared to the same period of last year. And we have also seen a rising number of active sales partners, and that would be around 500 as of the end of the second quarter of 2022, which is a 9% increase as compared to the same quarter of 2021."
