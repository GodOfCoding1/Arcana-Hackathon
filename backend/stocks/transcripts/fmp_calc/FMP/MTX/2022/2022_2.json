    "content": " We saw higher-than-expected inflationary cost pressures in the quarter of $43 million compared to last year, and our pricing actions accounted to $47 million. This quarter, our sales increased 27% over last year, a robust figure that was broad-based and driven by 4 areas: 7% revenue growth -- base revenue growth, 2% from new product sales, 8% from acquisitions and the remainder from price increases implemented across our product lines. And excluding $21 million of unfavorable foreign exchange impact, sales growth was 27% above the prior year. Second quarter operating income, excluding special items, improved by 15% compared to the prior year to $73.5 million. Second quarter sales for the Performance Materials segment were $300 million, a 26% increase compared to the prior year and 10% higher sequentially. Sales in household, personal care and specialty products increased by 37% year-over-year, driven by our pet care acquisitions and continued strong performance from our portfolio of consumer-oriented products. Segment operating income increased by 12%, both sequentially and versus prior year to $38.9 million and operating margin improved by 20 basis points sequentially to 13% of sales. Specialty Minerals sales were $164 million in the second quarter, an increase of 15% year-over-year and 1% sequentially. Global PCC sales increased by 15% versus last year, driven by higher selling prices as well as volume growth in our Specialty PCC business. Operating income for the segment improved by 10% sequentially to $20.2 million, and operating margin improved by 100 basis points as the impacts from our selling price actions offset the impact from inflationary cost increases. Sales were $93 million, an increase of 25% year-over-year and 11% sequentially, driven by higher volumes and selling price increases."
