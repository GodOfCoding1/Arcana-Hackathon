    "content": " Our sales volumes were relatively flat overall as strength across our consumer-oriented end markets was offset by weakness in Europe and China, as well as production and shipping limitations from severe cold weather in the Western U.S. We also experienced some late quarter inventory destocking by our specialty PCC and processed minerals customers in the U.S. Fourth quarter operating income was lower than our expectation going into the quarter, primarily due to the sales volume pressures I noted, as well as higher freight, energy and production costs. Turning to the full year, sales increased 12% to $648 million, primarily driven by new satellites, higher selling prices across all product lines and continued strong demand for our specialty mineral additives across a wide range of consumer and industrial markets in North America."
