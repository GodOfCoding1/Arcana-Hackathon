    "content": " For the full year, we expanded gross margins by 90 basis points, driven by strategically tilting our business mix to Recon, leveraging our EGX capabilities and making progress on the price cost equation in our P&R business. Quarterly phasing of margins is expected to be similar to the progression we saw in 2022 with Q1 organic growth rates consistent with full year guidance, offset by 1 to 2 points of negative currency impact. We expect free cash flow conversion to be 40% to 50% in 2023, and we have a strong pace that we see of improvement there over the coming years to get into the 80% plus that we've talked about in prior calls. I think we've consistently said that we would have a high single-digit growth business by 2024, and that we had some work to do, working our way towards that in terms of expanding the Recon part of our portfolio that grows a lot faster and shaping the P&R portfolio to be a consistent mid-single-digit grower."
