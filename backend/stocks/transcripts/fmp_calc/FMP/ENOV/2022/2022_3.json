    "content": " We've put a thoughtful guide out there as to what we now expect is going to happen down the back half of the year, which should be a good, strong finish, about 6.5% full year growth for the company, something we're certainly proud of in terms of how it stacks up and how it shows our ability to make good, strong progress on our strategic goals. What's happened this year, and we're expecting to see carry a little bit into next year, is that there is this currency pressure and continuing waves of inflation and so while we can execute that on an underlying basis, the headwinds that are offsetting a portion of that. So between the integrated channel, great innovation and being able to kind of lean in on STAR next year, we feel like our Foot and Ankle business is going to be on a very nice growth path, and there's also some interesting bolt-ons that are potential in that space as well. So as we're looking at the current year, we've got the headwinds from the most recent acquisitions that we've done, which includes Insight, for example, which brings the ARVIS system along with it, but these are also the seed corn for future rapid growth and margin expansion."
