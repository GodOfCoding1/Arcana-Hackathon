    "content": " First of all, as we\u2019ve discussed, Q1 is by far our lowest quarter of the fiscal year, and given the uncertainty in the supply chain and some of the things that you\u2019ve heard about, whether it be transit time increases, etc., we\u2019ve got now 65% to 70% of our full year sales volumes still in front of us, so it just dimensionalizes even through Q1 into January that we still have our big part--the biggest part of our season, POS season still in front of us, so we\u2019ve decided that until we get into our POS season, we\u2019re going to hold a wider range on the sales outlook. The only thing I\u2019d add is if you go back to 2018, when Chris and I started, this business was a $1.3 billion business, we\u2019ve grown it north of $2 billion, and candidly when you look across $250 million of that growth has come from new customers, whether it be Costco if you go back a few years, and then you go into when we launched weber.com, Canadian Tire in Canada, now what you just mentioned with Best Buy and others, so we feel like we can manage through the complexities well and have done so, and will continue to do that. As it speaks to either capital allocation strategy or the strategic intent behind different places where we would look to invest for disruptive and inorganic innovation, we would bring to bear the same strategies that we have for the core business, where we want to drive growth by extending into new segments, we want to drive growth by dialing up technology as a lever for the business, much like we did with the June Life acquisition a year ago, which has been really exciting for us, and then there are other high margin initiatives, like let\u2019s say accessories as an example, where we can drive favorable gross margin mix and incremental consumer engagement in terms of purchase frequency and purchases and engagement with the brand in between grill purchases sequentially, and those are kind of the strategic pillars. Generally speaking, one of the concepts we\u2019ve talked about even back during the IPO but over the last couple of quarters is this idea that the pandemic in the outdoor cooking category and the behaviors that fell out of the pandemic, particularly around call them lockdown behaviors or work-from-home behaviors, those home-oriented behaviors, we felt like had--based on all the tea leaves, we felt like that had good chance to last and sustain over time, and as consumers are more oriented around their homes and spending more time at home, even if work-from-home is not working all five days from home during the week but working two or three days from home during the week, which I think is a social dynamic that\u2019s even still playing out today, it does it does create more engagement with cooking at home and more engagement with grilling, and that\u2019s been generally a positive tailwind. The way that I characterized it over the last couple of cycles is it creates a new floor for the category, and so as you think about--you know, I mentioned in the remarks we were down in Q1 8% for the quarter from a demand standpoint, but the two-year stack was plus-75%, and so what we feel great about is the higher level of consumer engagement with grilling does appear to be sustaining, and it\u2019s been--you know, we\u2019re coming up on now two years since the outbreak of the pandemic, and that sustained new floor, if you followed me down that pathway, does continue to be holding. Our target was to be up about 40%, so we came out of Q1 a little bit lighter on trade inventory just driven by the supply chain challenges that I referenced, so as we work through Q2, we feel really confident and maybe a little bit more delayed versus where we expected to be, but once we get all the containers in and out the door, we should be close to about 30% up year-on-year, and that\u2019s both just lapping last year, where you were still at low inventory levels and additionally we\u2019ve got higher facings with our new product launches this year, that gives us just the ability to kind of have more inventory at shelf, if you will. But given the uncertainty in the supply chain at this moment in time and the reality that, as I mentioned earlier, 65% to 70% of our annual sales are yet to be booked from February through September and the inflationary impacts that are really impacting every consumer category out there, not just in our space, we\u2019ve decided that until we get well into our POS season that we\u2019re going to hold a wider range on both our top line and our bottom line impact. If I could just add, Chris, I would--and partially related to Bill\u2019s comment around just having our lowest quarter behind us and having so much in front of us for the year, I think we felt like when we saw container rates at this, I think maybe highest cost ever in October, at least from my recollection over my 30 years, container costs we didn\u2019t think could go up from there, and they went up from there, and they went up from there almost 50% in December-January."
