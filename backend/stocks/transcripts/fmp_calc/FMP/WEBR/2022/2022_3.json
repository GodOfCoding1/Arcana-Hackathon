    "content": " Other contributing factors to the year-over-year margin declines were: first, lower production volume driven by suppressed consumer demand, which drove nearly $13 million of fixed cost inefficiencies versus last year when our plants were operating at near 100% capacity; second, the foreign exchange impact, as previously noted, negatively impacted gross margin by $25 million or 190 basis points; third, continued inbound freight cost increases versus the same period last year, which drove $17 million of margin decline or 320 basis points; and finally, an additional $12 million of negative margin impact resulted from higher promotional activity in the quarter to drive sales and unfavorable region and product mix compared to the prior year. Selling, general and administrative costs for the fiscal third quarter decreased by $84 million or 33% to $174 million from $258 million last year and decreased 570 basis points to 32.9% from 38.5% of sales last year."
