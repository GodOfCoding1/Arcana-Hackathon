    "content": " For example, according to third-party U.S. data, Rover had more than 13x sales of pet services versus the next largest similar player for the 12 months ending June 30, up from just over 10x for the prior 12-month period; third, our international businesses continued its aggressive growth trajectory with GBV increasing to over 3.5x Q2 2021 levels, and have driven the mix of GBV from non-U.S. markets from 3% in Q2 of last year, 8% this quarter. In that time, we increased revenue approximately 130% over the prior 12 months, slipped from negative to positive adjusted EBITDA, gained market share, all while ramping our investments in product support and marketing to drive long-term enterprise value. While we continue to make progress in our new customer marketing initiatives, we are also pleased with our repeat bookings, which were $1.2 million for Q2, a year-over-year increase of 40%. Non-GAAP marketing expenses were $10.7 million in the second quarter or 24% of revenue, up 600 basis points from Q2 2021 and roughly flat sequentially from Q1 2022. As Brent described earlier, we plan to keep our marketing spend elevated on an absolute basis for the second half of the year versus 2021, but we do expect it to be a lower percentage of revenue relative to the first half of 2022. Second quarter non-GAAP operations and support expenses were $6.1 million or 14% of revenue, flat compared to 14% of revenue in Q2 2021. For the full year 2022, we are updating our prior guidance and now expect revenue of $160 million to $166 million and adjusted EBITDA of $10 million to $14 million, which at the midpoint would be a 48% increase in revenue over 2021 and approximately flat in adjusted EBITDA."
