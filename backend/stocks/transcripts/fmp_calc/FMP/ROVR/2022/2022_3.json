    "content": " Forward-looking statements are based on the current expectations, estimates, forecasts and projections and beliefs and assumptions of management and relate to our future financial performance, such as our fourth quarter and full year 2022 financial guidance, trends for GAAP and non-GAAP marketing expense as a percentage of revenue, marketing product investments and initiatives, COVID and macroeconomic impacts, partnership and expansion opportunities, market share, other future events and industry and market conditions and forward-looking statements about Rover, its platform and its domestic and international market opportunity. Non-GAAP contribution increased to $41 million in Q3 2022 from $29 million in Q3 2021, driven by growth in revenue while staying roughly flat on a percentage of revenue basis at 81%. Third quarter non-GAAP operations and support expenses were $7 million or 14% of revenue, flat compared to the second quarter of 2022, and up from 12% of revenue in Q3 2021. We continue to see leverage in non-GAAP product development expenses, which were $6 million or 11% of revenue compared to $5 million or 14% of revenue in Q3 2021. The increase year-over-year in expense is a result of the investment needed to support our transition into the public markets, coupled with expected growth of the business, while the decline on a percentage basis is due to our scaling of revenues from Q3 2021. Our forward macro assumptions layered into guidance are as follows: Both the low and the high end of our revenue guidance continues to assume the full year impact related to Omicron as discussed in Q1 and the recent macroeconomic headwinds, inclusive of the elevated cancellation rates relative to pre-COVID norms. For the full year 2022, we are updating our prior guidance and now expect revenue of $171 million to $173 million, which at the midpoint would be a 57% increase in revenue over 2021; and adjusted EBITDA of $16 million to $18 million, up from $12.4 million of adjusted EBITDA in 2021. For the fourth quarter, we expect $49 million to $51 million in revenue and $6 million to $8 million in adjusted EBITDA or a 12% to 16% margin driven by our anticipated continued ramp in marketing investment."
