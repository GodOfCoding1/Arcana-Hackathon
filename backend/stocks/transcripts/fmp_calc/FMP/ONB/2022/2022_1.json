    "content": " We saw strong full quarter combined commercial loan growth over 8% during the quarter, excellent credit quality and our pipeline more than doubled to a record $5.4 billion. Q1 represents our seventh consecutive quarter of organic loan growth with total loans increasing 6% on an annualized basis, driven by strong performance in commercial which grew $405 million or 8% annualized. Consumer loans were flat, as higher portfolio mortgage production offset $190 million of runoff from the legacy F&B transaction book. We're also pleased that in spite of the strong first quarter production our pipeline ended the quarter at a record $5.4 billion, 20% higher than the combined Q4 pipeline. Also, we did see a $4 million increase in the value of our MSR that is not reflected in mortgage revenue, as we account for our MSR on a lower cost or market basis rather than fair value."
