    "content": " Slide 13 shows trends in adjusted noninterest income, which was $89 million for the quarter, slightly better than expected due to $4 million of discrete items related to equity investment returns and recoveries from fully charged-off acquired loans that we don't expect to recur. While the equity markets have us discounted relative to our peers, we believe this should narrow, as we continue to deliver commercial loan growth, execute on the promised cost synergies, maintain our customary credit discipline and leverage our best-in-class deposit franchise for better-than-peer margin expansion. Yes, Chris, I think maybe the short hand would be we'd be near the higher end of that range with some normalized solid loan growth over the remaining of the -- remainder of the year and then better performance in the deposit betas from these assumptions, maybe go through that top end range, but that's probably the short hand. I think we had really strong organic growth in AUM and the wealth and brokerage, but equity markets and fixed income markets obviously putting pressure -- and you're starting to see that come through on the fee line."
