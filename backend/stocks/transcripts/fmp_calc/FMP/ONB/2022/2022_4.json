Hey, good morning everyone. Please go ahead, Scott. But I can tell you that sort of this -- I don't know that we can repeat 47.5% but I do think for the full year, we're going to have a really strong efficiency ratio, and we continue to work on opportunities to continue to control expenses. Hey, good morning everyone. Please go ahead, Scott."
