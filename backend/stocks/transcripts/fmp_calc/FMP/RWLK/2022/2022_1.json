    "content": " Before we get started, I would like to remind everyone that any statements made on today's conference call that express a belief, expectation, projection, forecast, anticipation or intent regarding future events and the company's future performance may be considered forward-looking statements as defined by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act. Our current pipeline of active rentals consists of 19 cases, representing a total of $1.9 million, and our overall insurance cases are currently at 73, with 56 in Germany and 17 in the U.S. With our other primary on-based system, we sold 16 MYOLYN owned units for over $180,000, which marks our highest quarter to date for this product line. With regard to investors who now understand this is the short-term period, this is the time we're just kind of in the famine portion of things, with the stock currently at $1.33 net cash, and clearly, it's going to come down presumably in the next few quarters, how do you feel that -- how do you believe in terms of investment opportunities?"
