    "content": " And I would also speak say that while I can't speak for other leagues, we feel very confident in both the NBA and NHL's understanding and recognition of the importance of the RSNs and are very focused on finding a path forward to protect this overall ecosystem for both which includes the leagues, the teams and their networks. Let me remind you we have a number of revenue streams that are fixed and contractual: media rights, both set from our leagues and our MSG network, set escalators, our suite and our sponsorships, those are locked -- the ones are currently signed or locked also long-term set with escalators. And actually, if you go deeper in the playoffs you earn -- it's big pieces of incremental revenue but that also has a long-term impact, because as team performance not only do you increase from that year's playoff, but you have follow-on benefits from increasing season ticket renewals. What's great about an NHL patch or any single -- any type -- any time a league opens up some premium new inventory, it's not only the revenue you're able to drive from that actual asset or that inventory. And I'll mention also in the NBA while we have a current patch partner, when that patch comes to market, we believe there's huge upside there as the market seems to really move in that space in terms of what some of the teams have just recently signed deals, what they have been able to realize. And we think there's a huge advantage in the way we go to market, being able to sell across with our partner in MSG Entertainment being able to sell across the networks, across arenas, across fixed assets, and across the teams and being able to provide -- and to be able to provide a holistic solution for a partner enables us to drive premium revenues for both -- for the sports for our teams."
