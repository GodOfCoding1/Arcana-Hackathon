    "content": " In particular, national and local media rights fees represented $112.3 million of revenue this quarter, which reflects a return to normal levels of local media rights fees anticipating full seasons for both teams, contractual escalators on the NBA national media deals as well as the impact of the NHL, new U.S media rights deals which began this season. I would also add that this week we paid down an additional $25 million on the Rangers revolver from cash on hand and cash flow from operations, which reflects our confidence in the trajectory of our business given the momentum we're seeing for the remainder of fiscal 2022 and beyond. And that's what we've been doing, reducing our revolver capacity -- borrowings that we spoke about $25 million on the Rangers facility in the quarter, as well as an additional $25 million that we've paid down just this week. So, while we're not going to be open up to every partner, we do think there's space to potentially add another at the right time who's going to -- who has the same vision for us and how we believe that we should drive this business. So, every time we have long playoff runs, and we feel good about the use of our teams and where they're going, we think that there's ability to drive our business and continue to drive the business. So, we think we're going to be able to help our partners drive their business, and I think it's already shown in the results from who are the leader -- who are the leaders in the New York market and who are our partners."
