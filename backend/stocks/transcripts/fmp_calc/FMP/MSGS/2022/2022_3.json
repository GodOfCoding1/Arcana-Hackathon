    "content": " The leagues have done an outstanding job in opening additional opportunities, including the NBA's decision to increase the number of permitted international sponsors for teams next season and the NHL's new digitally enhanced DasherBoards, also launched next season, and will create significant incremental exposure for our partners during Rangers telecast on MSG Networks. I would also add that in addition to the $45 million of debt repayments in the quarter, last week, we paid down an additional $15 million on the Rangers revolver for a total of $60 million since the start of the third quarter, which reflects our continued confidence in the trajectory of our business, including what is anticipated to be a strong end to the fiscal year with the benefit of the Rangers playoff run and the runway we seek to deliver sustained growth in the long term."
