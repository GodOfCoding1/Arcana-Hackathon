    "content": " For fiscal year 2022, adjusted EBITDA was $3.8 million with an 8.8% margin, which also represents another record performance for the company. The ultimate scope of work scale of the deployment and timing, as communicated by the customer during the RFP process supports a total value of up to $55 million over a three-year period to CRI with ongoing annual SaaS in excess of $2 million annually, when fully deployed. On our last earnings call, we updated our 2023 full year revenue guidance to $54 million with an adjusted EBITDA of 15% on an exit run rate basis. Today, you have an option to run that same $50 million ad spend across out-of-home networks contained in all major retailers where somebody is actively in the act of shopping, they can see a Coke special on the screen, and they can walk 10 feet to the cooler and pick up a 12 pack of Coke. Yes, Howard, as we continue to work with these partners developing and deploying these ad-based networks, we are certainly positioning CRI as the full services provider, both the hardware installation activities, the software support to manage and run the network, but also as an option and full capability service provider to assist in the sale of those ads, the media revenue component."
