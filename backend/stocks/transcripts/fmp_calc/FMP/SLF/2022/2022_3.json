    "content": " Reported net income of $466 million for the quarter was down 54% year-over-year as a result of market volatility, the write-down of goodwill in the U.K. and an increase at SLC Management put liabilities. These strong results driven by our protection and health businesses were offset by lower income in wealth and asset Management, which were impacted by declines in global equity markets. Reported net income for the quarter was $466 million, driven by strong underlying earnings, partially offset by market-related impacts, our charge to write-off goodwill related to the sale of our U.K. business, an increase in acquisition-related liabilities in SLC Management and lower ACMA gains compared to the prior year. Strong growth in protection and health businesses, including moderating COVID-related impacts and a full quarter of contribution from DentaQuest, more than offset lower wealth and asset management results. Underlying net income of $300 million was up 3% from the prior year, driven by strong investment gains and business growth partially offset by lower wealth management fee income. So to your question on new business strain, if you look actually previous year on this year, it's actually a small $3 million down and that's really a function of international where the sales are lumpy, and so we wouldn't necessarily have that come through every quarter. If I then move just to the local markets versus hubs, I'd rather actually just deal through each of the individual businesses because what you'll see in a hub, which is a Hong Kong, Mainland China as well as high net worth, that is effectively either through selective origination, where you would see some variability in the sales but much more positive on new business gains as we make sure we have positive net VNB."
