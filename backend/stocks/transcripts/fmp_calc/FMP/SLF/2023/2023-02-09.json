    "content": " Strong results from our protection and health business were partially offset by lower income and increased outflows from our wealth and asset management businesses, largely reflecting declines in global equity markets. Underlying ROE for the quarter up 15.7% continues to trend towards our medium term objective of 16% plus, reflecting our disciplined capital management and growing emphasis on capital Life businesses, and our LICAT ratios at SLF remain solid at 130% for the quarter. Sun Life had a strong finish to the year with record underlying earnings in the fourth quarter, reflecting the strength of our businesses and the benefits of our diversified mix. Our balance sheet and capital position remains strong, as reflected by an underlying return on equity of 15.7% for the quarter, a 5% increase in book value per share over the prior year, a strong capital position with a lockout ratio of 130% SLF up 1% from Q3, and 130 basis points improvement in the leverage ratio of 26.4% last quarter to 25.1%. Canada\u00e2\u0080\u0099s underlying net income of 324 million was up 22% from the prior year, driven by strong insurance sales, improved disability performances on life health and higher investment gains.
