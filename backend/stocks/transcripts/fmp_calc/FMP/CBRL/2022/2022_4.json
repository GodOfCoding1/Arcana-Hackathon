    "content": " Looking back at the fourth quarter, the challenging environment I discussed in June continued to impact us through the end of our fiscal year, including a slower-than-expected summer travel season, fewer visits from guests 65 and older and high gas prices and other inflationary pressures that weighed most heavily on lower income guests. Restaurant revenue increased 6.5% to $661.9 million, and retail revenue increased 3.3% to $168.5 million versus the prior year fourth quarter. We expect to deliver between $20 million and $25 million in cost savings during the fiscal year, ending the year with an annualized run rate savings of approximately $30 million from the work we've done over the last several quarters to systematically identify business opportunities in the company and develop initiatives to support cost improvements. So I am more optimistic about the Maple Street hitting their opening schedule for the fiscal -- this year than I was how we ended in the fourth quarter, we're only able to get three of the ones done and we had hoped to do, I think, six, as well as I think what we'll see in the Cracker Barrel side is more ability to get higher new unit growth, modestly higher new unit growth in fiscal '24 than what we've just announced. So when we're talking about inventories and potential markdowns picking up and maybe the first half of the year, it's just picking up relative to historically strong full price selling performance last year versus kind of the discomfort with the inventory levels on the retail side just given the environment."
