    "content": " We saw and are continuing to see our catering channel do well, driven by enhancements we've made to our offerings and our optimized marketing support and we're on track to achieve our target of growing this channel by 25% to $100 million this fiscal year. Restaurant revenue increased 9.4% to $718 million, and Retail revenue increased 4.7% to $215.9 million versus the prior year quarter. In addition to the above assumptions for revenue growth, commodity and wage inflation and cost savings, our operating income margin expectation continues to contemplate the following assumptions: continued inflationary pressures in other areas of the P&L, most notably supplies, utilities and maintenance, moderation in retail margin compared to the prior year near historic high and incentive compensation normalization, which will have a meaningful impact on G&A in Q3 and Q4. Yes, I think, Andrew, in the $25 million cost save, we've got, I think it's about 40% coming out of cost of sales, and I think we've got about 40% coming out of labor. In terms of margin expectations for the quarter, generally, we're going to be in more of a normalizing standpoint from now on, which is not as good as last year, but better than '19 is kind of what I... We're -- the retail business is doing great."
