    "content": " For the first quarter, we delivered top line results in line with our expectations, which included total revenue of $839.5 million, an increase of 7% over the prior year quarter. As I said earlier, we continue to expect to deliver between $20 million to $25 million in cost savings during this fiscal year, ending the year at annualized run rate savings of approximately $13 million from the work we've done over the last several quarters. And while we believe our unique offerings at strong price points resonate with guest and benefits our retail business, we expect our promotional activity will be higher than the prior year, even though it's still well below historical levels. So for the last several quarters, we've seen an increase in frequency with younger guests, in particular, with the 18 to 34 year old, and we think that is really in part due to the strategic initiatives we've been undertaking, whether that is the culinary and beverage news, the increased focus on targeted digital marketing or the technology enhancements that we've done for them we're seeing a sustained improvement with that group as well. So as you're thinking around pricing shifted at all because obviously, the aggregate inflation for the full year looks to be a little bit higher on food costs as well as on labor and it sounds like some of the other OpEx line items as well."
