    "content": " We took significant rating actions throughout the book of business this quarter, resulting in an increase in average premium per policy of 18.1% over the prior year quarter and 5.6% over third quarter 2022. Total revenue for the quarter increased 4.7% from the prior year quarter, reflecting the increase in net earned premiums just mentioned and higher investment income due to an increase in return, partially offset by lower other revenue, which is driven by lower policy fees associated with the lower policies in-force. We continue to restrict underwriting across the portfolio to avoid unprofitable business, especially in dislocated markets, and also to keep our exposures relatively flat given the expected tight reinsurance capacity of our CAT XOL renewal in the spring. And I think that, that is probably going to continue, and we will actually be looking at each state to see what we need to do based upon those reinsurance rates because, yes, unfortunately, I think that the overall market is going to see increases across our footprint."
