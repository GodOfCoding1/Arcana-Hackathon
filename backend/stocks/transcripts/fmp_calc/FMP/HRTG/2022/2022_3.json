    "content": " This loss was primarily attributable to a $40 million net retained loss for Hurricane Ian that previously was announced on October 13, and without which, our net loss and LAE for the quarter would have declined by $14.8 million or 10.6% from the prior year quarter. The company has received close to 14,000 claims associated with Hurricane Ian, and we project ultimate gross losses, including loss adjustment expense, of $655 million. As mentioned, current accident catastrophe weather losses included $40 million of net current accident quarter catastrophe losses attributable to Hurricane Ian, up 150.5% from $16.0 million in the prior year quarter and $23.8 million of other weather losses, down 32.8% from $35.4 million in the prior year quarter. The net combined ratio for the quarter was 133.3%, up 20.8 points from 12 in the prior year quarter, driven by higher net loss ratio and net expense ratio just mentioned."
