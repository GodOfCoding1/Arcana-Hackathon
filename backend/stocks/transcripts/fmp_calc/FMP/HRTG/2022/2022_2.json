    "content": " Excluding the impact of a goodwill write-down, second quarter net income was $2.9 million or $0.11 per diluted share, up from a net loss of $4 million in the prior year quarter. Net current accident year weather losses increased to $38.1 million, up 7.34% from the prior year quarter. Our focus on rate adequacy, underwriting and profitability in all our geographies has started to gain momentum and resulted in an adjusted net income, a non-GAAP measure of $2.9 million or $0.11 per diluted share, when excluding the impact of the goodwill write down. Driven by the non-cash goodwill write down of $92 million or $90.8 million after tax, the net loss for the quarter was $87.9 million or $3.32 per diluted share. Total revenue for the quarter was up 9% from the prior year quarter, reflecting an increase in premiums earned, investment income, fewer realized losses, and slightly lower other income from policy fees due to lower policies in-force. The second quarter weather losses were $38.1 million, compared to the prior year weather losses of $35.5 million. Shareholders' equity decreased to $180.5 million or $6.80 per share for the second quarter 2022 driven mostly by the write down of goodwill and unrealized losses on our fixed income investment portfolio, which is driven by higher interest rate environment."
