    "content": " These forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements concerning the impact of COVID-19 on our operations and financial condition, our ability to implement our proprietary merchant boarding and CRM system and to roll out our Omni Commerce and SecurePay applications, including payment methods, to our current merchants and the integration of our secure payment gateway with our crowdfunding platform, our ability to successfully launch a cryptocurrency mining operation and our ability to earn revenue from those new operations. The 2022 outlook, we\u2019re right now on a pace of $36 million in revenue, this revenue here, the $36 million is only for the fintech products, it does not include the Bitcoin. Once we have the 1,000 miners up, we actually feel \u2013 we\u2019ll have another $6.5 million in revenue based off just the Bitcoin mining and that $6.5 million is based off today\u2019s price of Bitcoin. One thing I\u2019d like to say real quick, looking at the revenue, the forward looking revenue the $36 million does not include the Bitcoin mining of $6.5 million."
