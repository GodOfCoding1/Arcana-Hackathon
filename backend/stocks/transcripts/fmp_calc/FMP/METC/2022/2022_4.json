    "content": " We also expect a one million ton increase in sales enhanced by the roughly 150,000 tons of carryover coal we did not ship by year end because of rail logistics. In addition, this year we hope to decrease cash mine cost by 5% or about $1 to $2 per quarter, as well as have a significant $50 million or 43% decrease in capital expenditures versus '22. Our production and sales should increase meaningfully throughout the year on the back of Elk Creek's plant capacity increasing by 50% in the second quarter, as well as on the back of the return of the Berwind mine, which occurred last week. And Lucas, this is Randy. Yeah, Lucas, this is Jason. Yeah, Lucas, this is Jason. And as Chris mentioned in his remarks, thinking about the rest of the year we've stayed close to both the eastern railroads there as we're served by both at one at Berwind and one at Elk, where we, our expansions coming this year and we're very confident in the meetings we've had since last year and going forward here, that they're anxious and ready as we are to bring these tons on and get them moved. And Lucas, this is Randy."
