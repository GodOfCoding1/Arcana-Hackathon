    "content": " So when I think about sort of, let's call it, a $17 million increase at the midpoint of guidance this year, around a third is just general inflationary pressures, equipment costs a little more, that sort of stuff. And I think Jeremy, you called out the costs should trend down sequentially as we move through the years, right, for the reasons you mentioned, whether it's on prep plan towards the end of the year or obviously sitting on the world you side with the Ramaco coal acquisition. So I think cost would trend down in Q2, but they should be lower in the second half, certainly than first half and even Q2, especially, as Chris said, the Berwind plant comes online this summer, which saves the trucking costs and incrementally as we move throughout the year, we'll get on to more kind of Ramaco coal, speed coal, which will help as well. So just quick back of the envelope math, we see a 10% increase in second quarter volumes that would imply to get to the midpoint of your full year, it would imply a second half, you need to move about 1 million tons a quarter, maybe a little bit more, just to get the midpoint."
