    "content": " First, we have started an increase in the processing capacity at our Elk Creek preparation plant to now reach 3 million annualized tons by the middle of next year. Almost 60% of this increase is due to CapEx associated with the Maben transaction, with another roughly 20% due to the increase of the Elk Creek preparation plant expansion to a total capacity of 3.0 million tons, up from 2.6 million tons previously. We now show our multi-year production growth in detail with an expectation of producing 4.3 million tons in 2023, 5.5 million tons in 2024, and 6.5 million tons in 2025. Then, for a total of $95 million in growth capital split between 2023 and 2024, we anticipate completing our full build-out of the 6.5 million tons of annual production. This year, it's a slightly different dynamic, because the pressure really on pricing is coming from not only overseas, but from thermal, and although we've got a little softness right now I think on the API2 numbers based on some issues with the water level of the Rhine River and a few things of that nature, we think sometime this fall, that those pressures will be relieved and that the thermal prices in Europe will probably continue to go back up based on both factors such as that, as well as some of the geopolitical aspects. Just first of all on the 2023 volumes of production 4.3 million tons and the interplay, there is a Slide with regards to thermal versus met, realistically in your opinion, how much of that 4.3 million tons would Ramaco shift into the thermal market? Now with the reception we've seen for several of our coal qualities in the thermal market as well as the industrial market, and discussions we've got ongoing now towards 2023 shipments, it certainly the ability there to move 1 million tons to 1.5 million tons is out there."
