    "content": " I would also like to point out that we have an impairment to goodwill, a onetime non cash charge in the fourth quarter and the amount of $102 million or $2.98 per diluted share related to the structural decline of our marketing services business. Now, to be honest, a little bit of that is the revenue recognition issue where some books move out of the year, but by the time they get to '24, and that sort of corrects and reverses the SaaS business at the rate that it's growing, we'll just pull it away from the print business. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. The functionality you guys mentioned, chatty sign, obviously marketing center estimates, invoices, calendar integrations, when you look at kind of what's on your agenda over the next 12 to 24 months I know, you don't probably want to give away all the goods in terms of new features. Your line is open. But as Ryan detailed in his prepared remarks, we're beginning to offer a nice menu of additional things that customers can buy, whether it's signatures or team chat, or the big one being marketing center, and these additional purchases by existing customers. Your line is open. But if you go back and you think about the Investor Day, kind of long range guidance we told you that we thought that we would be able to grow ARPU up into the $7,000 range over the next few years and part of why we believe that is we felt that we could serve more needs in slightly bigger businesses as time goes by and that's exactly what we see happening."
