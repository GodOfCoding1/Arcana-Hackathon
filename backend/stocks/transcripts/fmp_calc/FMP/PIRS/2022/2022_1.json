    "content": " In the first quarter, AstraZeneca initiated the efficacy portion of the Phase 2A study with the dry powder inhaler formulation given twice a day on top of the standard of care regimen of medium dose inhaled corticosteroids and long-acting data agonist or ICS/LABA in moderate uncontrolled asthmatic patients, which is randomized one-to-one-to-one across the one milligram and three milligram dose levels plus a placebo arm. Before taking everyone's questions, I would like to reiterate those points about our success in partnering and grant procurement, which has enabled us to leverage a significant amount of non-diluted capital to advance a broad and a diversified pipeline while retaining significant or fully proprietary commercial rights in these programs, we continue to advance our innovative pipeline and we are looking forward to adding PRS-220 as our fourth clinical stage programs later this year."
