    "content": " In the Phase IIa trial of the dry powder formulated elarekibep, an inhaled IL-4 receptor alpha inhibitor that we are developing with AstraZeneca for the treatment of moderate to severe asthma, I'm pleased to report that AstraZeneca has completed the enrollment of Part 1b, which is the safety of the 10 mg cohort, while enrollment continues for Part 2, which is efficacy of the 3 mg cohort versus placebo. And right, like you mentioned, I think we continue to focus on the opt-in at the 25% believing, again, that is manageable, given that sort of the spread of the costs, along with the -- our share of development milestones that we would continue to get on that program that are meaningful to us, it's something that we think is, again, relatively affordable. At a high level, I would frame what we're going to be looking at at the end of the Phase I study next year is the set of the data that we're going to be generating, SAD/MAD data in healthy subjects, which will not have -- I think we've already mentioned that -- not have a wealth of biomarker data. So your first question was around enrollment trends, and then the second one was, again, what -- how the 10 mg and other factors could -- safety data from the 10 mg and other factors could inform what we would do beyond Phase IIa beyond the 3 mg dose."
