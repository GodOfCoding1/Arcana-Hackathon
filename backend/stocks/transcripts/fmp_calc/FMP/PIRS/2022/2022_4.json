    "content": " Although our operating plans for the current year include the benefit of cost saving actions we have already taken, we are prepared to gate future investments on PRS-220 and PRS-400, including certain Phase 2 readiness activities for PRS-220 and IND-enabling activities for PRS-400 in the interest of achieving our top priority, namely, obtaining data from the Elarekibep Phase 2a study in asthma. And when we think about the opt in overall, again, I think one of the pieces that we think is very manageable for us, again, regardless of our profile, is at the time of the readout, assuming the data is good, the opt-in at 25% at a minimum is something that we will achieve or have an offset of future development milestones on this program that cover about 50% of the overall opt-in cost that we would have with AstraZeneca."
