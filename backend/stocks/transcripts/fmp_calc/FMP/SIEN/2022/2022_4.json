    "content": " '22 ended strong for Sientra with  year end operational results, the first shipments of Viality and SimpliDerm joining our portfolio, I am pleased to report today that we expect to make our path to profitability and positive free cash flow a reality by year end 2023. As Ron, Lisa, Denise all mentioned, we are very encouraged by the marketplace reception for Viality and SimpliDerm, and I'm excited to share our record revenue results of $25.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. Total year 2022 revenue of $90.5 million compares to $80.7 million for 2021, an increase of 12%. Our current period non-GAAP operating expense of $22.8 million continues a favorable expense trend this year, comparing to $21.7 million in Q3 of '22, $22.3 million in Q2 of '22 and $24.8 million in Q1 of '22. Our favorable second half of year expense performance resulted in the total year non-GAAP expense of $91.6 million, the lower end of our $90 million to $94 million non-GAAP operating expense guidance. As we are at the end of our first quarter of 2023, I'll share that our current revenue estimates for Q1 2023 to be between $22 million and $23 million or growth of 3% to 8% versus prior year. In terms of full year expense guidance, we're forecasting non-GAAP operating expense to be between $78 million and $82 million, down from $91.6 million in 2022. At this point, we're focusing on selling in our early experience program where some of the top surgeons in the industry and many that are new to the Sientra have access to Viality and are paving the road for success as we expand broader next year or later this year, as Ron mentioned, into the reconstruction segment."
