    "content": " Excluding the impact of Argyle and Urban, the total revenues decreased by 15.8% and total revenues from FM hotels were RMB 315.2 million, down 16.8% year-over-year. Also excluding the impact of Argyle and Urban, total revenues from FM hotels decreased to 16.3% and total revenues from LO hotels decreased to 13.6% year-over-year. Excluding the impact from our newly opened lease operated hotels and other general expenses, the costs and expenses from ordinary cost of our operating business decreased 9.1% year-over-year. Excluding the impact of newly opened and pipeline hotels, adjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP for the second half of 2022 was RMB 146 million with a margin of 34.6%. Taking into account the recovery in long-term trends and short-term industry fluctuations, we expect total revenues of total hotel business for the full year of 2023 to grow 30% to 35% over the 2022 levels and grow 5% to 9% over the year of 2019 levels. Furthermore, considering the merger of the restaurant business into the group and their revenue contribution from restaurant business, we expect total revenues of the whole company for the full year of 2023 to grow 90% to 95% over the 2022 levels. So this year, our growth is going to be focusing on penetrating to areas where we're still having a slower -- we have a lower coverage and also moving into the first second-tier city seems to be mid-to-upscale segments and that we did observe due to the last 3 years of pandemic. And for the leased, operated hotels newly opened in the past 2, 3 years, another 10% EBITDA margin was reduced, and the remaining delivery amount of the margin decrease was about due to the COVID-19."
