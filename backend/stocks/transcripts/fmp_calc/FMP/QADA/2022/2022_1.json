    "content": " We are also pleased to have achieved our highest first quarter bookings ever, with growth over 50% from last year\u2019s numbers, giving us a good head start to our financial year. That said, I do believe going forward, we\u2019ve seen a growth in our funnel opportunities around automated supply chain planning, forecasting, logistics solutions, and so we do think that each time something like this happens, it just adds more fuel to that fire in terms of the value of visibility and using digital technologies to manage that visibility and responses to that, too. This quarter just happened to be a skew in that the new business favor, but I think we\u2019re still calling, as we have been consistently over the last couple of years now that we expect the mix to be roughly 50-50 of new customers to converting customers into the cloud. And then I do think that both what\u2019s happened in the supply chain over the last sort of 12 months or so will continue to add fuel to that side of the business, as well as the pandemic underlying that, hey, having your solutions in the cloud, your applications running in the cloud is a much safer bet than having to run them on-premises."
