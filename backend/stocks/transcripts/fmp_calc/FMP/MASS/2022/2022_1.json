    "content": " We started the year strong with first quarter revenue growing 50% over the prior year period to $8.3 million, and we have placed 83 devices during the quarter, bringing our installed base to over 2,000 devices across our three products. Desktop revenue from our REBEL and ZipChip products for the first quarter 2022 was $3.6 million, compared to $2.1 million in the prior year period, representing growth of 68%. Yes, we see lots of excitement for the applications for MABs, but the advanced therapy cell and gene are particularly exciting and as we've said, we view it as an area that as we penetrate, it's really unlocking a large portion of the total addressable market, and that's because the typically being done in a more smaller batch, more personalized manner. So, I think things like our iOS app, things like adding analytes, it makes it easier for customers to ensure they're partnering with the right organization, that they're putting their capital dollars to work because we're giving them new features and functionality that are responsive to their job -- thing like the iOS app, we like a lot because it connects more intimately to the customer in their workflow, which we expect to be able to keep broadening over time. And we see REBEL really beginning to do that, and that's why we highlighted that about 30% of our placements here in Q1, about 25% we reported last time overall, were in that space because we see that as an important driver and again, driving that thirst for analytics, which we think we're well-positioned to do with both our ZipChip and our REBEL."
