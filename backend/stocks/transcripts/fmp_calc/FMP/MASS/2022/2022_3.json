    "content": " This morning, 908 Devices released financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2022. If you've not received this news release or if you'd like to be added to the company's distribution list, please send an e-mail to IR@908devices.com. For a more complete list and discussion, please see the Risk Factors section of the company's annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021, and in its other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Except as required by law and 908 devices disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any financial projections or forward-looking statements, whether because of new information, future events or otherwise. Good morning, and thank you for joining our third quarter 2022 earnings call. While we are pleased with our third quarter results and year-to-date performance, we have begun to see a slowdown in our funnel with prolonged purchasing cycles over the summer months and into the fall. Given this impact, we now expect full year 2022 revenue to be in the range of $46 million to $49 million, representing annual growth of 13% at the midpoint of the range. As discussed on our last earnings call, progression of a few larger handheld opportunities would be required to achieve our previous full year guidance, and we've seen protracted cycles in test trials to pilots to enterprise conversion. This positive view was reinforced at our user meeting in September, Critical Mass 2022, which covered the full breadth of our product platforms and their applications. This event brought together more than 175 customers, both virtually and in person to share their success using our mass spec devices to provide rapid and robust actionable information at the point of need. The need for more process control and the steady increase in proteomics and Metabolomics Research, all of which fuel the biopharmaceutical industry's long-term growth. However, the shift in the macro environment has begun to flow some near-term demand for our desktop devices, particularly in cell and gene therapy application, where technology is being adopted to support the process development preclinical space. The Alliance Regenerative Medicine recently issued its first half 2022 report on advanced therapies, which noted that 2022 has already been a record year for the approval of new cell and gene therapies with several other therapies on track for regulatory decisions in late 2022 and 2023. However, the number of ongoing clinical trials globally decreased by 13% from the end of 2021 and investment levels have slowed after 2 record-breaking years. Across our desktop, we continue to see orders from a fairly even split between new and existing customers. With the REBEL device, we continue to see traction with additional units in several of the top 20 pharma companies and with some of these companies ordering their second or even fourth device. With our ZIP chip device, Genentech concurred its fourth unit during the quarter in a paper published in September in analytical chemistry Genentech researchers noted the device's ability to quantify a peptide exchange at high throughput and a high sensitivity in a CAR-T cell therapy application. Overall, we believe that our penetrate and radiate strategy in which we work to penetrate new accounts, create a foothold and then radiate across these enterprise accounts will continue to drive broader adoption and acceptance over the long term. In August, the National Center for Health Statistics a division of the CDC announced that U.S. life expectancy decreased last year to its lowest level since 1996. In September, new report highlighted a shortage of Adderall used to treat ADHD and noted the dangers of sourcing the drug on the street as these counterfeits contain Fentanyl and other drug. Finally, in August, the Australian Federal Police in the Australian Border Force announced the seizure of the largest festival shipment detected in Australia, preventing more than 5 million potential legal doses of the drug hitting the street. As previously noted, we built a pipeline of testing, trials and pilot programs to drive enterprise adoption of our handheld devices. In the third quarter, we expanded in the existing enterprise account, the U.S. Army, receiving an order for $3 million for Aero modules compared with their fleet of MX 98 devices. Once last year, the first of its kind Aero module enables users to monitor, detect and identify vapor and aerosol hazards quickly and safely. As of the end of the third quarter, we now have over 220 employees worldwide and are close to reaching our goal of 80 commercial team members. Turning to our third objective, developing and advancing our product portfolio, we continue to unlock our platform's capabilities through consistent releases of additional analytics, assay accessories and data integration in order to increase areas of use for our customers and to penetrate our addressable market. In January of this year, we announced a research collaboration with the United States Forest Service and Agency of the United States Department of Agriculture to extend the capabilities of the MX-908 to detect these illegal pesticides. In regard to our acquisition of TRACE Analytics in August, we are extremely pleased with how well the TRACE team is integrating with our R&D team to further our online development efforts. As you may recall, our acquisition of TRACE provided us with online Acceptor Bioreactor sampling and Biosensor Technology, which is a central addition to our micro fluidic technology color and will help us unlock more of our total addressable market. At our user meeting, Wolfgang K\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00bcnnecke, Trace Analytics Founder and now the Head of our Bio-analytics R&D presented the benefits of automated control of glucose in lactate in a process development lab, which includes cell-free, sterile and safe sampling with no volume or prep required. As we have noted, our main focus this year has been to build upon the capabilities of our existing products and expand the reach of our technology platform. In 2023, we plan to shift our focus to releasing 2 new devices. Turning to our fourth objective, broadening our bio-analytics platform as more advanced therapies enter the pipeline, biopharma manufacturers need to identify and understand critical process parameters and their impact on critical quality product attributes during process development and the entire bio-manufacturing workflow. CPI process engineers use real-time data from the REBEL to optimize nutrients, resulting in an increase Tier by up to 40% and a reduction in toxic metabolite accumulation and a significant reduction in design of experiment times. These posters highlighted the use of our ZipChip device for several applications, including characterizing Oligonucleotides, peptide mapping of recombinant AAVs and charge varying analysis of small molecules. Also at the show, a principal scientist from Cypogen, a biotech company presented on mass spec-based characterization workflows in biopharmaceuticals development labs and noted ZipChip capability to perform high-resolution separations, while minimizing sample prep burden. Additionally, MIT researchers underscored REBEL's value and their ability to rapidly monitor and profile nutrient consumption of recombinant AAV producing cells in the perfusion process. We are delighted to hear our collaborators and biopharma customers highlight the value of their desktop devices to characterize multiple product quality attributes and control key process parameters, which ultimately leads to improved efficiency and robust product quality. And finally, turning to our longest-term objective, laying an Omaxe Foundation, we see a clear and emerging need for accelerating mass spec-based workflows to address proteomics and metabolomics opportunities. We continue to foster cadence and publications, technology and research with proteomics academic institutions and research partners to support future product launches and workflow specific to the Omaxe domain. In the areas of metabolomics and academic research paper in the journal, metabolite focused on characterizing cell-to-cell signaling molecule levels in healthy versus Type 2 diabetes affected human pancreatic angle. Our Scientific Advisory Board members were enthusiastic about our continued development of on-chip peptide pre-concentration from the ZipChip platform, providing feedback on throughput and robustness requirements to address emerging low input proteomics market. In summary, we remain encouraged by the value our technology platform is providing to our customers to break mass-spec out of the confines of a centralized laboratory and bring it to the point of need. While we face some near-term macro pressure, we continue to focus on serving our customers, expanding our user base and making our technology even more accessible to broader audiences, which open stores for new users and applications. Revenue for the third quarter 2022 was $15.8 million compared to $12.5 million in the prior year period, representing growth of 26%. This increase was primarily driven by desktop device placements, an increase in handheld recurring revenue and an increase in service revenue across both handheld and desktop devices. About 20% of our third quarter revenue was from the remaining U.S. Army device shipments, which compares to approximately 40% of the prior year period total revenue. Handheld revenue from our MX-908 product was $11 million, an increase of $1.7 million compared to the prior year period, representing growth of 18%. Desktop revenue from our REBEL and ZipChip products for the third quarter 2022 was $4.4 million compared to $2.9 million in the prior year period, representing growth of 51%. Recurring revenues, consisting of consumables, accessories and service revenue for the third quarter 2022 was $4.5 million compared to $2.2 million in the prior year period, representing growth of 105%. Our installed base grew to 2,317 units with 175 devices shipped during the third quarter. This included 150 MX-908 handheld devices, 18 REBEL desktop devices and 7 ZipChip interface desktop devices. The increase in gross margin was due to higher service revenue and average selling prices for our devices, offset in part by higher personnel and operating costs. This increase was driven by headcount expansion across our business, a $1.2 million increase in stock-based compensation and an increase in marketing activities and travel expenses. With approximately $180 million of net cash as of quarter end and our cash utilization, we have multiple years of runway to focus on our product innovation, market penetration and commercialization efforts we have implemented over the last few years. Now looking ahead for the remainder of 2022, we now expect full year revenue to be in the range of $46 million to $49 million, representing 13% growth year-over-year at the midpoint of the range. Specifically, our team driving strong adoption of our handhelds through the end of the U.S. Government fiscal year, capturing year-end biopharma spending and mitigating continued disruptions in APAC. Unfortunately, we have seen opportunities push out beyond the end of the U.S. Government fiscal year. As Kevin mentioned, progression of a few larger handheld opportunities would have been required to achieve our previous guidance range, and we have seen protracted cycles in test trials to pilots to enterprise conversion. In addition, for our desktops, our revised guidance range now assumes desktop revenues to grow by approximately 30% over the prior year. While this growth rate is 2x the growth rate of the overall business, it reflects some impairments in the fourth quarter from macro factors, including the likely level of year-end capital spending that is prioritized for new technologies. Specifically, these factors include talent migration across organizations, resulting in delayed adoption and a training, retraining burden, large capital purchases canceled for associated bioreactors, thus delaying priority of our devices and layoffs at small and large biotech\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00e2\u0084\u00a2s, resulting in canceling our consumables. In the near term, our team remains focused to progress our handheld opportunities through test trial to pilots and extend to enterprise accounts, catalyze reference desktop accounts across top pharma or our desktop to enable our penetrate and radiate strategy, scale our operations and ensure the highest quality products in the face of ongoing supply chain pressures. As we look ahead to 2023 and beyond, we believe 908 devices is uniquely positioned to capture the opportunity in front of us. And yes, maybe we can just dive into some of the bits you mentioned on the kind of the spending and those profiles for the desktop customers. As mentioned in the script there, I think we are just seeing a lower level and slow down a bit across the board for some of the handhelds and desktops and desktops, particularly as mentioned, just seeing some slowdown in the large capital purchases with Pireactors that delays the priority for our devices. And we're just, frankly, not seeing the same amount of year-end capital spend at this time for new tech, which is ours. And as we're really not riding a replacement cycle for it, and that gives us less of a visibility than maybe some of the large cap instrument companies. And we're selling, as you mentioned, really into that preclinical space with these REBEL desktops and dollaring are tightening. So all of that, we really see that it isn't a 908 specific phenomena, but an industry phoneme and you can dive into that deeper and think about biopharma spending in particular, and you can see a slowdown in that cell and gene therapy space, which we've been trying to gain a foothold in. And we're certainly seeing more moderation in Q3 across that space, but our unit numbers are pretty small and modest. But in general, I would just say that we have seen that slowdown in deal velocity, so...\n And Max, you were asking about REBEL and looking forward and contemplating our revised guidance is reduced growth for REBEL, given some of the constraints that Kevin just mentioned on the macro environment, especially with the adoption of the new technology. And as we look at the delta of how we brought down our guidance, we attribute approximately 2/3 to handhelds and 1/3 to desktops and the change in desktop coming from slower-than-anticipated funnel progression for our REBEL. And then we haven't seen the 10-Q yet, but it would just be great to hear about some of the regional demand trends that you experienced during the quarter. And if you think specifically in Europe, as we've been really trying to Bolster over this year what we're doing internationally, broadly, mainly in Europe, but some in the Middle East and a bit in APAC. Yes, as Joe said, the EMEA is probably around 15% of our revenues, but we do see that there's additional opportunity there. So not all downside, I would say, across that Europe region, specifically if you think about some of the pressures from the Ukraine war and U.S. partner nations and it's causing a bit of a look around to see if they have the best-of-class them detection capabilities. But we sell through distributors there, but we're not seeing the upside due to those changes that multiple parties have mentioned there out there, say, being able to get our small team to be able to transit and support applications and board our units across the region. But we did put some price increases in effect at the beginning of the year that started to kick in earnest here in Q3, a bit in Q2 as we elevate as  and other consumables where we did not increase that pricing for 2022. We'll take a hard look at it going forward based on the different market factors and what we do for '23, but it is good to see our customers see the value of the technology and leaning forward to purchase at that higher price point. And then just on overall revenue growth, given the way that we're finishing here on the year, and the roll-off of the Army contract, but also some of the order growth numbers that I think you mentioned. As we mentioned, about 20% of our Q3 revenue was Army and 80% was from other business outside of that. And about that service contract, there's about $5 million of ongoing service revenue over the period where they committed to technology upfront, and I think I disclosed that it goes through September 2025. Within the quarter, we did see the U.S. Army adopting the Aero capabilities and had about $1 million of recurring revenue ship related to those Aero modules in the third quarter, and the remaining portion of that additional order will be here in Q4. But if we just step back at a high level and think about it, yes, likely more moderate growth that over the first half of the year and particularly as some of the volume patterns need to change on that preclinical level to support our desktops. We are seeing that, as we mentioned, kind of a couple of quarters with a trend there. We really don't believe that, that much that way to commit to what it is we have set up for 2023 in terms of new products, and we're engaging now with KOLs on that. So yes, based on where we're at, I'd say, more moderate, but incremental from new products, getting that positive feedback that now and thus far really should make us more diversified and give us more opportunity and drive more conversations next year and all very differentiated new products we're contemplating. Or is that mainly an instrument placement issue -- and then, Kevin, I hear you on the industry level data for cell and gene, but you guys are still in the pretty early innings of penetrating that market. Can you just talk about the selling environment and just how you're finding conversations within a pretty large overall market to be, thanks. I mean from the selling conversations, you're right, only about 20% of our REBEL's are going into that selling gene. And while it is slowing, you would expect there's additional opportunity to pursue there as well as outside of cell and gene. I think what we're just generally seeing, down , is that people are slowing down their desire to grab new technology and change the way they're doing it. We've literally had labs that have been good pull-through customers for us, go from having a dozen employees to down to 2 and they're trying to build back again. There's a lot of retraining, -- there's a lot of focus on taking the limited dollars they have and applying it to a replacement product or something status quo, and it takes work to adopt the new product, new technology and get across that chasm, if you will, and it takes effort on the customer side on 908 side, and it's just a new way of doing things. So I'd say across the board with the biopharma spending, we're just seeing more of a reluctancy and a slowdown from that perspective. Dan, you're asking about on the pull-through in device versus consumables. And as I noted, definitely an impact on the device side here in Q4 as we look to finish up the year and moving into 2023. But on the REBEL kits, we are striving for that active users to be at that approximately 1 kit per month on average, and that's that 40% pull-through for those users. I think, Kevin, the question that I have, it really is you have 80 or so folks in the commercial organization today, they were hired last year, they're fully trained and productive right now. About as you mentioned, about 2/3 of that guidance adjustment of $6 million is we attribute more to the handhelds and about 1/3 to our desktops, which will be led by REBEL there. And as from a customer sentiment, I would say that it -- as I mentioned a little bit earlier on the Q&A here for Dan, but we're just seeing a general slowdown for people to adopt new technology. I think you're right, we've got a pretty compelling offering in REBEL in terms of what it can do and the fact that it can do things at line and really speed it up. And today, we're trying to work with them to adjust their feeding strategies, change how they're approaching their bioreactor monitoring, so they can get better outcomes and better efficiency. From a rep perspective, you're right, across the world here across handhelds and desktops. So whether we're ending at 75% or 82%, we're really trying to be very thoughtful, planned and making sure we're spreading across the right regions. And we do see rep churn on occasion, and I don't think we're seeing more than the industry is feeling, but that's not 0. But in the normal year, it's a little easier to predict that, as you said, rep productivity and that after a particular period, the top line impact, we've certainly seen reps where our desktops and hand heads contribute big, very new reps to it. But we've also seen other reps that we're sure are going to be great, just not having out of the part success yet this year. In terms of the new product launch, the online product that is expected to correct me if I'm wrong, till 2023. And so all these efforts are really trying to steer and push us further into that bio-processing 4.0 domain and adding to the offering of our analytes and the process parameters, but also introducing some elements of process control and getting us out there with that online analytics capability that then is more of a 2 step as we see to accelerate our REBEL online efforts, both development and commercially. I'm happy with that acquisition of TRACE analytics, very differentiated, and it enables online capability for multiple products that we've got on our road map here. And then just lastly on MX-908, I mean you seem to be expanding the application base there with pesticides, other products and launch release and testing and things like that. So could you talk to us about sort of as we think about 2023, how diversified can the offering -- product offering be from an applications perspective, obviously, Army and Forensic is a large component right now for you. The handheld, as you mentioned, are largely going into that forensic set of those acquisitions  in some way back to fentanyl and the Opioid crisis and whether those are aerosol hazards or counterfeit drugs that people are swabbing on a surface and continuing to see growth there outside of the U.S. Army. You're right, we are also always trying to expand our analytic panel and capabilities on our handhelds as well, and we did just announce more work we've been doing with the USDA, specifically the U.S. bar service to develop a pesticide library. And we do see that, that's a way for us to just get out there, explore have more conversations in that space. But yes, I think we're excited where the handheld will continue to grow, and we now have over 1,800. And as we mentioned before, we're working on new products there as well that we'll keep shrinking down the form factor, and we think will be compelling driving cycles over the next couple of years as well. So yes, I think it's a good platform for us that we're continuing to invest and really want to own that handheld detection space. I think you said in the past that 1/3 of REBEL users had open blank purchase orders for consumables, meaning they were ordering multiple kits at a time. We have seen -- you're right, we have picking what we think more of a blanket purchase order where they sign up for a set number of hits, that could be 6, that could be 12 tend to be delivered. But we've also seen with some of the macro dynamics, we've also seen some customers having layoffs and then calling us and saying, we need to delay those kits or cancel that order altogether. We've certainly seen some headwinds with what we call a more of a macro level with just limited funding that's been available to some of our customers, particularly ones on the southern border across the board, multiple organizations really hit by the migraine crisis there, where a lot of resources are being taken from technology and needed for humans to help with that problem. And so I think we'll continue to see resources on it, but maybe too early to tell us as a particular change of it."
