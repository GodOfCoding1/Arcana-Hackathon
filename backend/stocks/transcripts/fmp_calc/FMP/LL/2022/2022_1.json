    "content": " First quarter adjusted operating income of $4.8 million or 1.7% of net sales was also in line with our expectations and reflects continued supply chain cost pressures on gross margin, as well as the investments we're making to support our three-year growth. As the percent of net sales adjusted SG&A for the first quarter of 2022 was 35.5% an increase of 210 basis points for the first quarter of 2021 due to increased investment in our growth strategies, including new stores and pros initiatives, as well as continued investment in customer facing and distribution center personnel. Adjusted operating income in the first quarter of 2022 was $4.8 million, compared to $14.4 million for the prior year period, due primarily to lower net sales, increased gross margin headwind and higher SG&A spend to support our growth initiatives."
