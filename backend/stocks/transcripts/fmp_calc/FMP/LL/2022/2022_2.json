    "content": " Even though we reported comparable store sales down 3.1% during the second quarter, we're pleased to report that our teams delivered our fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth in sales to pro customers, opened six new stores and rebuild our inventory levels. Second quarter 2022 comparable store sales decreased 3.1% versus the second quarter of 2021 but increased 6.9% on a 3-year stack basis, demonstrating improvement from pre-COVID levels. The 130 basis point decrease in second quarter 2022 adjusted gross margin versus 2021 primarily reflects significantly higher material and transportation costs which were collectively up more than 1,000 basis points that we were able to partially mitigate through pricing, promotion and alternative country and vendor sourcing strategies. Adjusted SG&A expense for the second quarter of 2022 was $102.1 million compared to $95.8 million in 2021, primarily reflecting increased investment in our growth strategies, higher advertising expense due to the timing of promotions and continued investment in our customer-facing and distribution center personnel. As a percent of net sales, adjusted SG&A for the second quarter of 2022 was 34.1%, an increase of 230 basis points from the second quarter of 2021. Adjusted operating income in the second quarter of 2022 was $5.9 million compared to $16.9 million for the prior year period, due primarily to higher SG&A spend to support our growth initiatives and increased gross margin headwinds. Our 2022 SG&A investments in our long-term growth initiatives are primarily driven by investing more in our customer-facing organization, opening 20 to 22 new stores, expanding our Pro sales team and investing in technology and digital enhancements to improve the customer experience."
