    "content": " In addition, operating expenses were higher due to the planned investments in our growth strategies, including costs associated with opening 18 new stores, higher marketing spend to build brand awareness, higher staffing to support our strength in Pro sales and competitive wage increases for customer-facing associates. Adjusted SG&A as a percent of net sales was 36.3%, up 330 basis points from last year due primarily to investments in growth strategies, including higher marketing spend and deleverage of lower net sales. In terms of our sales outlook for 2023, while we strongly believe that our strategy to increase brand awareness and deliver a more consistent customer experience will gain traction and drive store productivity throughout the year. We remain committed to deliver long-term growth driven by executing on our six strategic pillars, growing sales to Pro, building brand awareness, improving the customer experience, innovation in new products, developing our people and culture and opening new stores."
