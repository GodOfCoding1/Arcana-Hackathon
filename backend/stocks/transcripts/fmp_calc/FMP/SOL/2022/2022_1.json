    "content": " Despite these near-term challenges, the long-term trend towards renewable energy in the U.S. remains intact as solar continues to be the leading technology in the clean energy pipeline, accounting for over 50% of all clean power capacity in the development in the U.S. On top of this, we certainly welcome Biden administration\u2019s decision to waive tariffs on solar panels from 4 Southeast Asian nations for 24 months. With the strong demand for solar energy backed by increasingly supported policies in Europe, our largest market, we believe we are well-positioned to capitalize on this opportunity, given our deep expertise in developing and operating solar projects, extensive network of industry partnerships, well-capitalized balance sheet and unmatched track record in closing financing transactions and monetizing projects."
