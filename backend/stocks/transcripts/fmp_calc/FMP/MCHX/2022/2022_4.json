    "content": " One of the things we have is we've been staging and putting different things together from our infrastructure investment, getting some of our existing customers where we think we've got some very robust conversations to expand the relationship onto our platforms that allow for access to our new features, as well as the new products that are coming to market. And we have several new products that are slated in particular, in the first half of the year, we have pilots that are scheduled, and those pilots are initiation opportunities for a go forward growth opportunity where we can monetize those new products if we're able to onboard and execute towards getting those customers to sign up. But if you look at the conversation volumes, there's the smaller customers and then the small business listing the providers that work in large part with some of the local accounts, those providers and all around they had a meaningful decrease on a sequential basis, which are affected seasonality, but also on a year-over-year basis."
