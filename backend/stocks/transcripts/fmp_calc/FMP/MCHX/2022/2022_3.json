    "content": " Looking at the intermediate and long-term view, we are making progress with onboarding several new customers and also further in dialogue with several of our largest Fortune 500 customers where there are growth opportunities and potential for new multiyear commitments. For the fourth quarter of 2022, similar to past years, we expect a seasonal decline in revenue compared to the third quarter, as this period typically represents lower sales volumes for many of our customers as call volumes decline during the holidays. I would like to note that given the traction of our sales pipeline, timing of onboarding new customers, and technology infrastructure initiatives, we believe we will make sequential progress in both revenue and adjusted EBITDA in the first quarter of 2023. In the relatively near-term, I think our focus is on progress, especially on the top line and trying to make sure that we see traction there with the new customers as well as expanding some of the relationships."
