    "content": " Despite the fluid macroeconomic environment in the second quarter of 2022, we continue to see growth in existing customer relationships and validation our focus on building products that address critical needs for our customers. On a sequential basis, we did see some modest increases, largely due to the expansion of relationships with some of our largest Fortune 500 customers, and we did see some progress in adding new customer relationships across multiple verticals. We believe that over the remainder of this year, we will continue to make progress through our momentum and sales wins with new customers in verticals such as health care, home services and an ongoing relationship expansion with several big customers. And furthermore, to the extent that we get an unwinding of the supply chain disruption, particularly in verticals like auto, we believe the conversational volume headwinds that have been present in our business can shift to a tailwind and contribute to growth potentially meaningfully so as we expand the footprint of customers in those verticals. We continue to see a successful expansion of relationships with our existing customers, and we've also continued to add new ones, both on the OEM side and on the dealer side and get deeper adoption of a variety of our products."
