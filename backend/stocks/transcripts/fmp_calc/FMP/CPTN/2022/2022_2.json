    "content": " Based on initial production orders we received, we expect our next year's unit volume contribution from automotive to more than double this year's total volume. And the second question was about automotive volume for next year, we're not providing obviously full-year guidance for next year, but some color on, based on the production order so we do expect our unit volume from automotive for next year to more than double this year's total volume. Sure, our total OpEx for the year remains anywhere between $55 million to $65 million for the year and for gross profit over the year is essentially roughly zero right, so there's not a lot of growth -- gross profit contribution to profitability."
