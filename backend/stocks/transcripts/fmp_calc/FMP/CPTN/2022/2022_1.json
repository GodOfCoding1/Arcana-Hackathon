Today's call is being recorded, and we have allocated one hour for prepared remarks and Q&A. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference call over to Hull Xu, Chief Financial Officer. Thank you, and welcome, everyone, to Cepton's First Quarter 2022 Earnings Call and Business Update. During the call, we may refer to our unaudited GAAP financials and non-GAAP measures in our earnings release. Actual results for future periods may differ materially from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements due to a number of risks, uncertainties or other factors, including those discussed in the earnings release or during today's call and those described in our filings with the US SEC. As a quick reminder, this call is being recorded, and you can find the earnings release and slides that accompany this call as well as the webcast replay of this call at investors.cepton.com. As you may know, from our April 5 announcement, today is Hull Xu\u2019s first earnings call as our Chief Financial Officer. I look forward to working with Hull in his expanded role as CFO, to continue executing our 2022 milestones in this momentous year for Cepton. Our lidar\u2019s are designed with the philosophy that it must achieve a balance between performance, cost and reliability. This not only validates the viability of Cepton\u2019s lidar for commercial ADAS, but also demonstrate lidar-enabled safe autonomy is more than a luxury feature. I'm happy to report, we have started shipping D-samples in support of General Motors, Ultra Cruise program. As a reminder, D-samples represents the final stage in hardware validation with production intact. In what has been a long process, starting with our initial engagement in 2017, Cepton is nearing the final phases of execution, making lidar\u2019s available in consumer vehicles. By then, will be within just a few months from start of production where Cepton is the sole supplier for the next four years and beyond. We continue to work closely with our Tier 1 partner, KOITO Manufacturing and have started transferring manufacturing processes, equipment and software in preparation for scale production. With Lidar being a critical component of safety for commercial ADAS, it is important to have a Tier 1 supplier as our partner to support scale production. We anticipate this partnership will not only drive future series production wins, but also help scale production to meet the growing demand of our products. Our series production award not only give us a significant momentum and attention from other OEMs, but also place the increased attention on the importance of Lidar in automotive safety. We believe that in order for LIDAR to be implemented in everyday consumer vehicles the price point must start below $1,000 and work its way down to mid-three digit per unit in order to accelerate large-scale adoption. In addition to our long-range forward phasing Lidar, which won the largest ADAS Series production award, we are also working on the near-range Lidar product, Nova, with which we continue to make progress with top automotive and trucking OEMs. One of our key strengths in our Lidar product is vehicle integration, such as the ability for the Lidar to be placed behind the windshield. In the coming decades, we expect ADAS to be the application that represent over 80% of the Lidar addressable market and will provide the largest return on investment. We have applied many of the learnings from the automotive market, particularly stringent requirement for performance and cost to our smart infrastructure customers. There is a growing demand for both our Lidar sensors and our Lidar perception software, where we are beginning to see our engagement mature beyond the proof-of-concept phase and leading to meaningful purchase order volumes. Moving up the software set has helped us reach many customers, who demand a complete perception solution. On the horizon, we have completed design milestones of our second ASIC which will drive further performance enhancement and cost reduction. In the near-term, our focus remains on OEM series production execution and we are looking forward to building our momentum for the rest of the year. In February, we closed our business combination with Growth Capital Acquisition Corp. and renamed the surviving entity, Cepton Inc. Concurrent with the transaction we closed the PIPE investment anchored by Koito in the total amount of $59.5 million. Total revenue for the quarter was $1.5 million, up 239% year-over-year, and 16% sequentially and consists of 100% product revenue. Non-GAAP net loss was $12.2 million or $0.11 per share, both basic and diluted. Weighted average basic shares outstanding for the first quarter was $115.9 million, and on a diluted basis, it's 127.1 million shares. Non-GAAP adjustments include a $56.7 million gain on re-measurement of earn-out share liability, $2.7 million non-recurring transaction costs related to our SPAC transaction, stock-based compensation of $1.3 million, and a $0.8 million gain on re-measurement of our warrant liabilities. As of March 31, 2022, we had available liquidity of approximately $160 million. Total available liquidity consists of approximately $45 million in cash and short-term investments, $15 million remaining on the Trinity loan facility and a commitment to purchase up to $100 million in equity from Lincoln Park Capital. As we said in our FY 2021 earnings call, we expect 2022 revenue to be back half weighted as our development programs achieved the remaining milestones. Starting off with automotive, we remain on track to complete the de sample phase by the end of the year and have salable vehicles equipped with such on LiDAR. We expect to ship several thousand units this year, equipping multiple vehicle models manufactured in multiple assembly plants across the United States in preparation for scale production. On smart infrastructure, we are seeing robust demand for our Vista P and SORP LIDAR as well as our Helios software product from our customers around the world and this will drive meaningful volume as projects mature throughout the year. For the Q&A session, I also have our Senior Vice President of Business Development, Mitch Hourtienne joining us in answering the questions. But specifically coming to the supply chain, there are certainly very much awareness of the issues with the supply chain. Very fortunately for us, we are actually into the A, B, C, right now, D sample stage with limited volume requirement. We are being alerted for all the supply chain issues, but we're not hitting a huge obstacle with the current quantity needed to supply samples for the General Motors Ultra Cruise program. Frankly, it's not actually affecting our execution at all at this point. But we're very much vigilant, making a lot of preparation for this coming year, 2023, where the SOP will actually start. When you're working with KOITO and General Motors, they have tremendous risk mitigation processes that help us with this issue. On the smart infrastructure side, that's a little bit more lower volume. Yes, it's become a little bit harder and more expensive to get some key components, but we've been able to procure those and, for the most part, pass on that cost increase to our customers. Specifically, we have the execution of the GM program, the Ultra Cruise program, all on schedule. And right now, we're not seeing any constraints on the demand side -- and you mentioned the -- you asked about the supply constraints. If it becomes worse towards the end of the year that we may have some issues meeting those units, but we're not seeing that right now. I guess, it's been -- well, I do you approach production with GOOD MORNING, and I guess it's been a couple of quarters now that you've been public with who you're working with. Certainly, with the GM announcement up to today for the past couple of quarters, we're getting a lot more attention from other OEMs. I would say the interest is more about vehicle integration, performance in cost and solidifying those three and keeping an eye on our development milestones. In general, the entire automotive industry with the GM design win and with the latest progress from many other fronts, there is gravity towards lidar is going to be used for the automotive safety in the future. As Jun indicated, the automotive space, especially the OEMs that have already announced adoption of lidar are already beginning to look at additional applications for lidar, which includes near range, short range, medium range applications. I think if you look at our Nova product, what's interesting for potential customers, is it's reusing the MMT technology, which we're validating for General Motors. In terms of applications and use cases, I would say it's an order of magnitude higher than long-range lidar and expands even well-beyond automotive. Second question, you talked on the last call about some pretty good engagement in China with OEMs there. If you follow the development of their EVs, they're actually putting LiDARs in somewhat near-term, right, when we think about near-term, it's two years out. So, look -- pay attention to future announcements from us, we do expect to have some program wins this year. And then last one, kind of, a simple question, but not knowing anything about how this works, so figure that I'd ask it. It started well over a year ago, whether it's actually the technology transfer or actually the tooling -- the software control part of every component. Now, it's actually at this final stage. Finally, there's a volume production process in place. And ladies and gentlemen, with that, we'll be concluding today's question-and-answer session. Ladies and gentlemen, with that, we'll conclude today's conference call and presentation."
