    "content": " We're very appreciative of Koito\u00e2\u0080\u0099s support as this will solidify Cepton\u00e2\u0080\u0099s financial positions and further strengthen our partnership on serious production execution, as well as collaboration efforts towards winning automotive OEM programs in addition to the General Motors design win we have already captured. In the automotive industry, we've seen OEMs allocate additional resources to accelerate development of ADAS versus full autonomy, which puts Cepton at an advantageous position to leverage our major program win at GM to capture additional large series production programs in the near future. Please state your question. Please state your question. Please state your question. Please state your question. Please state your question. Certainly, it's an exciting landscape, a lot of things are happening and Cepton is continuing to execute well and we will continue report on our progress in the focused automotive industry, and we'll talk again in the quarter."
