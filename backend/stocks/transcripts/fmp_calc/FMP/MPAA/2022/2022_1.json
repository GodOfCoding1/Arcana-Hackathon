    "content": " I should mention that on a 2-year comparison from the June 2019 pre-COVID first quarter, net sales increased by 36.5% or approximately $40 million. We also incurred higher freight and other costs of approximately $4.5 million for the fiscal '22 first quarter due to a shortage of freight and supply chain inefficiencies caused by COVID, as Selwyn noted earlier. Net cash used in operating activities during the fiscal year '22 first quarter was $4.7 million, reflecting working capital requirements to support the company's record sales and required inventory levels to support our customers in the face of supply chain challenges due to COVID as well as anticipated business growth in fiscal '22. But definitely, what we're seeing are 2 things, at least in the first quarter is, number one, our brake caliper business has grown dramatically and seasonality for brake calipers is -- generally would be in our fourth and first quarters, a little bit in the second, but mostly in the first, which we haven't really seen as much of in the past."
