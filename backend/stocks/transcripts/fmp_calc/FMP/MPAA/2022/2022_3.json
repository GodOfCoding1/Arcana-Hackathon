    "content": " So let's begin with our record reported net sales, which increased 32% to $161.8 million from $122.6 million in the year ago period. I should emphasize that results were impacted items that totaled $8.5 million or $0.44 per diluted share, reflecting noncash items totaling $4.8 million or $0.25 per diluted share and transitory cost pressures related to supply chain disruptions totaling $3.7 million or $0.19 per diluted share. EBITDA was $18.8 million in the prior year period, favorably impacted by $8.1 million of noncash items, primarily related to foreign exchange items and unfavorably impacted by $5.7 million of cash expenses which were primarily driven by the company's expansion of its new brake caliper product line. And I think what bodes well for us now is twofold is, I think that a lot of the incremental expenditures that we've had because of the supply chain challenges will be mitigated by these surcharges and price increases and then we're in a fairly comfortable position growing into our next year's revenue, which we hope to give guidance at the end of next quarter. So the quarter may be a little bit lower, but we've had a much longer-term outlook probably the last 1.5 years really getting ready for making sure that we were ready to fulfill demand for our customers during the COVID times and then we're also planning for new business that's rolling in."
