Results a year earlier were impacted by non-cash items totaling $4.8 million or $0.25 per diluted share and cash items totaling $3.7 million or $0.19 per diluted share, primarily transitory costs related to supply chain disruptions. Results were impacted by non-cash items totaling $9.6 million or $0.50 per diluted share and cash items totaling $9.5 million or $0.49 per share, primarily transitory costs related to supply chain disruptions as detailed in Exhibit 2."
