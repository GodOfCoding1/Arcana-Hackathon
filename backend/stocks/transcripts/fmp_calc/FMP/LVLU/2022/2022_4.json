    "content": " All statements made on this call do not relate to matters of historical fact should be considered forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, statements regarding leadership transition, management's expectations, plans, strategies, goals and objectives and their implementation, our future expectations regarding financial results, references to the year ended December 31, 2023, market opportunities, product launches and other initiatives and our growth. Adjusted EBITDA of $29.1 million, an 11.4% 3-year CAGR despite no incurring public company expenses and developing infrastructure to position Lulu's for long-term growth. Driven by the combination of maintaining flexibility on product pricing to meet customer demand in the near term that is likely to temporarily soften merchandise margins, as well as maintaining investments in order to catalyze future growth and expansion of our brand across both digital and physical distribution channels, we estimate our adjusted EBITDA will be between $23.1 million and $25.6 million. As it relates to 2023 half 1 comparisons, Q1 and Q2 last year reflected 62% and 27% year-over-year net revenue growth, respectively, as those quarters benefited from pent-up demand as our customer refreshed her wardrobe to return to her social calendar as COVID-related constraints ease, including wedding-related events which are expected to decline in 2023. And then I'll jump in and on the -- you had a question about stock compensation, feel free to chime in if I misheard it, but just to give you some year-over-year perspective on that we're going from '22 into '23 -- at the low end, I would say, I provided a range of $16 million to $19 million in terms of stock comp expectations for '23."
