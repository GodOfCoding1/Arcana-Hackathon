    "content": " The earliest time for data readout expected is in 2024, so our expectation for the market growth for MRD in China is also matched with the clinical program timeline outlined here, which means that from 2022 to 2024 is what we expect to be the early market adoption period, mostly driven by the prognosis part of the MRD utility, which has been well established. The pharma project backlog continues to build nicely, and our pharma revenues are generally recognized as those studies or studies of our pharma customers are executed over time, so there could be some lumpiness and it is dependent on the clinical progress of our pharma client studies, so there could be lumpiness quarter over quarter, as we have seen from other peers, for example in the U.S. An aside, we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have any COVID related revenues in our top line, so it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 100% precision oncology testing revenues, so we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have to worry about a cliff or a decline of COVID testing revenues at all going forward. We do see strong momentum on our underlying business coming from, number one, the market share gains through the in-hospital strategy; number two, MRD volume ramp; and number three, strong backlog of our pharma projects converting to revenue, so we therefore retain our current guidance for the full year and we just call out the lingering COVID risk."
