    "content": " We delivered another solid quarter sales across our portfolio of concepts, resulting in annual sales exceeding $3 billion for the first time in our company's history with average unit volumes of over $12 million for domestic Cheesecake Factory restaurants. Additionally, North Italia's fourth quarter comparable sales increased an exceptional 26% over 2019 on a 14-week versus 14-week basis. Through February 21st, quarter-to-date comparable sales for The Cheesecake Factory restaurants on an operating week basis are up 9.5% versus 2022 and up 17% versus 2019. Through February 21st, quarter-to-date comparable sales on an operating week basis increased approximately 13% year-over-year and 31% as compared to the same period in fiscal 2019. Fourth quarter comparable sales at The Cheesecake Factory restaurants increased 4% versus the prior year and 11.4% versus 2019, both on a 14-week versus 14-week basis. And I think part of that is while we have been taking the incremental pricing to recapture margins, just remind everybody that at least when we look at the data food away from home versus our menu pricing, since 2019, we're still 4 percentage points below what the rest of the market has been. Certainly, a little bit of the strength in the first week or two was the omicron lapping on it year-over-year, but that wouldn't account for the 2019 data, right, which why we think that's important to look at. I think the last thing I would say is that if the top end of consumers really does feel pressure, we're likely to actually benefit some from that because they typically move down off of the steakhouses and the expensive independents, the one-offs in The Cheesecake Factory and into our brands because we're still very, very accessible."
