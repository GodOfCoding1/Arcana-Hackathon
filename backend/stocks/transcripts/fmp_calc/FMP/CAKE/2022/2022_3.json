    "content": " To this point through October 25, fourth quarter to-date comparable sales for The Cheesecake Factory restaurants increased approximately 2.8% year-over-year and 14% as compared to the same period in fiscal 2019. In fact, through October 25, fourth quarter to-date comparable sales increased approximately 9% year-over-year and 25% as compared to the same period in fiscal 2019. Keep in mind, that the third quarter sales were about 2% below this year's year-to-date sales performance of 2019 sales plus menu pricing. For modeling purposes, at this point, we would expect four to five Cheesecake Factory restaurants, seven to eight, North Italia, three to four Flower Child locations and seven other FRC restaurants and we would anticipate approximately $150 million to $170 million in CapEx to support this level of unit development. If you look at the compounded pricing that the industry has now taken because it's starting to get a little interesting as we lap around early summer and fall pricing from last year, which we didn't take and others did, it's probably about 14% based on the latest census, and that's probably going to go higher going into the fourth quarter. For the weighted average for Q4, we would anticipate the menu pricing to be around 8% to 8.5% on a weighted basis, obviously, depending on the sales trends throughout the quarter and when we think about capturing all of that, it would be not until December as noted so it's about one-third of the incremental 2.8% pricing that would be in the fourth quarter. So I just want to, I guess, quantify, are you basically saying that given the price you're taking this quarter and assuming no further kind of kick up in inflation, you think you'll be in the 15% plus kind of unit level margin in 2024. Great, thank you very much. Great, thank you very much."
