And certainly the last thing, because I think this question will come up too, what we have seen historically if there is a little bit of a dip is remind people that our number one competitor are the white table cloth independent mom-and-pops, and I think we probably will be able to take some market share, because we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re keeping so much value and the prices that those groups have had to take and their menu is substantially more than what we're taking. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. And then just to clarify, I know you said you're taking 4.25 points maybe with the summer menu and that would get you to 7.5% ultimately, but I guess consider further increases, I'm just wondering -- or wondered if you could just share what you think the pricing will be in the third and fourth quarter. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. So what we've seen is that in an environment where the labor side is a little bit more stable, which maybe you will get to in this most recent stage, because our staffing levels are at a better point and everybody knows that back-to-school with casual dining, the aggregate sales level dip, that's a pretty known seasonal pattern that we might just see some of those Brian ease in the late third and fourth quarter. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. Your line is now open."
