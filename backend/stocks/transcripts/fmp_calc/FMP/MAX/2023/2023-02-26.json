    "content": " Now I think one of the things that we are seeing in this marketplace that may be a little different than what we saw in the last hard market cycle is that we are seeing less of that kind of behavior and the indications that we are getting from carriers is that, their profitability has been challenged severely for the last couple of years.. And that when they come back, they expect to come back in full and they will come back as the rates start to earn through and actually impact their underwriting profitability and that they are not going to front-run rate adequacy, well, full rate adequacy by cherry picking certain states where they already have rate increases to start to gradually get back into the marketplace."
