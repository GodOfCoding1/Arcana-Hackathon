    "content": " Outside of P&C, we expect Q3 transaction value vertical to be similar to Q2 levels as we face another difficult comp due to the non-recurrence of a special enrollment period for ACA plans, which impacted last year's comparable figuresm as well as continued lower spend by our Medicare broker partners for leads and pulse. During this hard market in P&C, we are staying focused on executing our long-term growth strategy, helping our partners become more efficient with our customer acquisition spend, increasing our data integrations with partners and having productive conversations with a number of insurance carriers regarding new supply partnerships. But it's really what ends up happening is when carriers have gone fallow in terms of investing in growth over a period of one and a half to two years, as carriers start to realize that the rates are adequate and start to develop confidence in that and they see their competitors actually starting to market against it and as consumers start to shop more, I think the profitability pressure that the carriers are facing now reverts pretty quickly to growth pressures. So I would say within Medicare, it really is kind of a tale of two different sets of products for us, where there's the click product, which is - has been performing well and that trend continued in Q2, and that has been both across brokers and across carriers."
