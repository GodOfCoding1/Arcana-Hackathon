    "content": " Outside of P&C, we expect ongoing momentum in our health insurance vertical, including results from CHT, although I will highlight that we had unusually high volume in last year\u2019s second quarter due to the extended open enrollment period in 2021. And I think we\u2019re not going to give firm guidance on what that means, but I would expect very minimal growth on that side just given some of the hard market conditions we\u2019re experiencing P&C where we feel like we\u2019re adequately staff to support growth, but we won\u2019t hesitate to add heads here and there where we think that can be revenue generated and pay back quickly. So I was wondering if you can help square the strength that you\u2019re seeing in the health segment with some of the pullback that the e-brokers are taking this year and maybe help frame what percent of transaction value in health, particularly on the Medicare side, is coming directly from the carriers themselves versus the e-brokers. But I think what you will see is with the magnitude of the rate changes that are taking effect in this cycle, again overall being higher than expected, I think what you\u2019re going to see is that that\u2019s going to lead to a far stronger or correspondingly stronger consumer demand for our consumer shopping activity as those rate changes take effect. And I think what you\u2019ve seen over the last couple of months, again, some carriers, very smart carriers, are figuring out that they need to take more rate as inflationary pressures persist, I think that goes to this and I think what we\u2019re seeing is some conflicting signs coming out, which is far more like a typical rate taking cycle or a hard market cycle where some carriers are taking rate earlier, some carriers are taking more rate than others and in the end, they end up overshooting, undershooting."
