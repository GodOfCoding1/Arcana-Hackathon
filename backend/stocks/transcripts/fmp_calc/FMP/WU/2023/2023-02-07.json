    "content": " This growth reflects a negative impact of 3 percentage points from the suspension of operations in Russia and Belarus continued softness in our retail business as well as our new branded digital marketing strategy, which includes promotional pricing. Today, I am pleased to report that, that momentum we saw in September continued through the fourth quarter with new U.S. outbound branded digital customers up 30% year-over-year, which is now contributing to an improvement in our transaction trends as well. In Q4, we saw U.S. outbound branded digital transactions grow at 5%, a clear reversal of the decelerating trends we've seen in the business earlier in the year and the fastest transaction growth rate since the fourth quarter of 2021. Revenue decreased 9% on a constant currency basis, driven by softness in our retail business and promotional activities related to our new branded digital go-to-market strategy. Earlier, Devin spoke about how our strategy drove a 30% growth in new U.S. outbound branded digital customers in the quarter and reversed a decelerating transaction trend that we have seen in the business for a number of quarters. Given the success of our new branded digital go-to-market strategy, I'm pleased to report that we've achieved a 14% new customer growth in the fourth quarter. Please ask your question.
