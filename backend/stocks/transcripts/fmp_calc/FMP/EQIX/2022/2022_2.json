    "content": " For the full year 2022, based on the momentum we're seeing in the organic business, we now expect our revenues to increase 10% to 11% on a normalized and constant currency basis over the prior year, trending above our Analyst Day revenue range, a reflection of the healthy digital infrastructure demands that are driving the momentum in our business. As for the broader question on recession and potential impact to the demand backdrop and in particular, around exposure to failures, business failures and weaknesses that, that might represent in either startups or those types of companies, as I said, right now, we're seeing no waning of demand relative to people's investment in digital transformation. We're seeing strength both on the supply side, meaning all these service providers ramping their business to deliver services required for digital transformation and they're doing that at Equinix, and then the enterprise buyer really seeing nexus as that point of -- or seeing Equinix at this point of nexus to really house their hybrid IT infrastructure. And it's the combination of all those that make us feel very, very good about what we're seeing in our pipeline and the amount of activity we saw this past -- really this past quarter, but we've had growth over the last 8 quarters in a row in our net bookings line."
