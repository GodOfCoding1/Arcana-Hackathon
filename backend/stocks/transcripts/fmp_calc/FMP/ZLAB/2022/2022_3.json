    "content": " As a reminder, during today's call, Zai Lab will be making certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including our business plans and objectives and timing and success of our clinical trials, our sales and revenue forecasts for our products and product candidates, regulatory applications and commercial launches. This first line indication is the largest ovarian cancer market opportunity for Zai, accounting for over 60% of ZEJULA's revenue in 2022 in China and we expect this percentage to increase through the remainder of this year and beyond. We'll try to accelerate the regulatory pathway for second line plus non-small cell lung cancer monotherapy by leveraging the global data package for the FDA approval, the ongoing PK study in China and the global confirmatory K12 study which Zai Lab joined in the second quarter of 2022. Net product revenues for the period were $39.2 million for ZEJULA compared to $28.2 million for the same period in 2021, representing 39% growth, $10.7 million for Optune which we expect to resume its growth trajectory this quarter, $5.5 million for QINLOCK compared to $4.3 million for the same period in 2021, and $1.5 million from NUZYRA compared to nil for the same period last year. Please ask your question. Please ask your question. Please ask your question. Please ask your question. And in addition to these regional opportunities, we have global opportunities today because today's market is different from last year from a business development perspective, there are more opportunities that may offer rights, which may not be available in past years, including global rights, including 50-50 global rights that biotechs in the United States and in China may be interested in because of the conditions. Please ask your question."
