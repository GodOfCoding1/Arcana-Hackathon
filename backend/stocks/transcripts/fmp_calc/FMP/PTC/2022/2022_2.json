    "content": " In Q2 our adjusted free cash flow performance was strong at $158 million, up 22% year-over-year and ahead of our guidance. If you're concerned about a downturn in Europe which represents 40% of our business, you could create an alternate model where 40% of our bookings declined by 25% for two quarters and then bounced back, in which case we'd still deliver 12% ARR growth over the forthcoming year. PTC's FY 2020 ARR growth of 11% compared very favorably to our more cyclical industry peers, who don't have the same recurring business model. Year-over-year, ARR growth for our Velocity segment was 27% in Q2, with both Onshape and Arena growing multiple times faster than the market, which demonstrates there's a distinct and vibrant segment of the CAD and PLM market that prioritize SaaS and agile product development as their number one buying criteria. We're raising our fiscal 2022 constant currency ARR guidance, based on our strong performance in the first half and despite our exit from Russia. The new range is now $1.64 billion to $1.665 billion, which translates to constant currency ARR growth of 12% to 13% for fiscal 2022. That all said the main driver of our fiscal 2022 ARR guidance raise is the strong customer demand we're seeing in our core CAD and PLM offerings, which represented 70% of our ARR in Q2. Our free cash flow guidance for fiscal 2022, includes $40 million to $45 million of restructuring payments compared to our expectation a quarter ago of $45 million to $50 million as some employees have otherwise departed at PTC and some employees that were expected to depart have moved into new roles where we've been looking at. Despite foreign exchange headwinds and our Russia exit, we're taking the low end of our full year revenue guidance up by $25 million based on our Q2 beat and forecast for the remainder of fiscal 2022."
