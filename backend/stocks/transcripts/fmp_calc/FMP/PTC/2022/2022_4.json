    "content": "  Free cash flow for fiscal \u00e2\u0080\u009822 was $416 million, above our guidance and up 21% year-over-year despite an approximate $30 million or 700 basis points headwind due to the impact of FX on our operations, including $53 million of payments primarily related to our restructuring from a year ago and fees related to acquisitions, adjusted free cash flow was $468 million. With the restructuring costs behind us and cash contribution margins expanding on double digit ARR growth, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re expecting to drive free cash flow up about 35% to the $560 million level in fiscal \u00e2\u0080\u009823."
