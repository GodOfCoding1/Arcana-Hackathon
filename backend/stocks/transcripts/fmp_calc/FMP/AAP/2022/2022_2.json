    "content": " Combined with our front half results, we're providing updated ranges for our 2022 guidance of net sales of $11 billion to $11.2 billion, comparable store sales of negative 1% to flat, adjusted operating income margin rate of 9.8% to 10%, adjusted diluted earnings per share of $12.75 to $13.25, a minimum free cash flow of $700 million and share repurchases between $500 million and $600 million. We're not going to talk about specific numbers quarter-to-date, but what we have done is embedded our quarter-to-date performance into our full year guidance, which you saw in the back half is minus two to zero for the back half of the year.
