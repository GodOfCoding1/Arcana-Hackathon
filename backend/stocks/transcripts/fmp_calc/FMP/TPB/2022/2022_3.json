    "content": " Despite 17.7% growth from the Zig-Zag and Stoker's segments, overall Q3 sales were down 1.9% to $107 million, impacted by NewGen which had a 40% year-over-year decline but it's been relatively stable sequentially this year, and harsh facing less challenging concepts we exit the year. Going into segment performance, Zig-Zag sales increased 23.3% year-over-year to $52.1 million with 21.7% from volume and 1.6% from price mix. Stoker's products net sales increased 10%, to $33.5 million in the quarter with 2.4% volume growth and 7.6% price mix increase. Its share in store selling was up 60 basis points year-over-year to 9.7% with Stoker's now in stores representing 64% of industry volumes, which still provides a long runway for growth. Moving to NewGen, where we continue to manage the disruptive environment with sales down 40.3% from the previous year to $22.2 million. Zig-Zag product sales of $186 million to $191 million compared to previous outlook $193 million to $200 million, which represents 7% year-over-year growth at the midpoint. Stoker's product sales of $128 million to $232 million compared to previous outlook $127 million to $133 million, which represents 5% year-over-year growth at the midpoint, consolidated adjusted EBITDA of $96 million to $99 million, compared to previous outlook of $97 million to $103 million."
