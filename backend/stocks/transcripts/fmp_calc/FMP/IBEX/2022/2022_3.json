    "content": " With additional new customer wins since the quarter closed, we are on track to generate approximately $15 million of in-year revenue from our new clients and expect this cohort of new customers to generate well over $100 million in revenue in FY 2023. We delivered a strong third quarter with record year-over-year organic revenue growth of 18.6%, driven primarily by our integrated omnichannel solutions across both our new and existing clients. And so there's a -- there will be a little guess what I'll say just a little revenue loss in the quarter as we, you know, as we just kind of peace, you know, peace from what was low-margin to this new client, what we feel good structurally about how the business looks, kind of, going out over the next four quarters. And let me -- when I -- when we shared this, I think, last quarter might have been the quarter before, but one of our big wins from FY 2019, so now that's fast-forward, that's, kind of, three plus years into that, we've won massive market share in there where we've doubled the size of our business, and now they've moved themselves into our top three client bases. So, thank you all. So, thank you all."
