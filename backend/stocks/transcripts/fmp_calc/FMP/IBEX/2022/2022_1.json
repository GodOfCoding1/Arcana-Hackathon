    "content": " This was really driven by the tale of two cities, our growth engine now 62% of revenues, and our legacy customer group, largely comprised of telco customers, which experienced a significant one time reset last year, and is now approaching the tail end of the decline and rough comparisons year-over-year. The growth engine consisting of clients new from FY '16, who are adopting our omni-channel capabilities now make up 62% of our business up from 46% in prior year, and 52% from Q4 FY '21. In Q1 though, this growth was offset by declines in our legacy three clients where one-time events occurred in our two legacy telco customers, one which emerged from bankruptcy, and the other which had a major divestiture last year. In addition, we deferred net training revenue of $3.5 million compared to $1.2 million in the prior year quarter, indicating significant future revenue growth, but impacting both revenue and margins in the quarter. On a non-GAAP basis, adjusted net income was $0.9 million versus $5.5 million last year, and adjusted fully diluted earnings per share was $0.05 versus $0.32 in the prior year quarter. Adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter of fiscal year 2022 was $11.5 million, or 10.6% of revenue, compared to $15.8 million or 14.5% of revenue in the prior year. Total capital expenditures including cash and non-cash amounts were $9.7 million, or 8.9% of revenue in the first quarter of fiscal year 2022 versus $3.2 million, or 3% of revenue last year. Net cash generated from operations was $6.9 million for the quarter, up 16% compared to $5.9 million in the first quarter of fiscal year 2021. positively impacted by decreases as non-recurring costs, cash taxes and working capital offset by lower adjusted EBITDA."
