With $1.14 billion of cash-on-hand, approximately $400 million in run rate cost reductions identified so far and several new growth vectors in play, we believe we are increasingly positioned to navigate through the market downturn this year and next. Our pull through weighted rate lock volume of $9 billion for the third quarter resulted in total revenue of $274 million, which represented an 11% decrease from the second quarter. Our total expenses for the third quarter of 2022 decreased by $126 million or 22% from the prior quarter, driven primarily by lower personnel expenses, including both salaries and volume based commissions and lower marketing expenses. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open."
