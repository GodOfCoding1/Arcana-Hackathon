    "content": " Our growth strategy continues to focus on organic levers of increasing revenue from core offerings, including our new human understanding program, both within our existing client base, as well as adding new clients increased market share. So I don't see margins increasing, but the increase in revenue that we gain from the Human Understanding Program should be brought into the books at the same, maybe slightly elevated margins, if there's some leverage ability on just fundamental increase in revenue. So it's increased value to Novant and it's increased revenue to NRC, but it was a current client that expanded their relationship by buying the balance of our product with the overlay of the Human Understanding Program, which provided that information to more caregivers within their system."
