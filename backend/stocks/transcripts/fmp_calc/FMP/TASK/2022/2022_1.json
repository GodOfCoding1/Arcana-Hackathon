In digital customer experience, we grew revenue by 60.2% compared with Q1 of 2021 as a result of expansion with existing clients and new client signings. Content Security revenues grew by 26.9% compared with Q1 of 2021, largely driven by volume growth with existing clients outside of our largest client. Revenue from AI services doubled compared with Q1 of 2021 to $34.1 million driven primarily by expansions with new and existing clients in the social media, travel and autonomous vehicle spaces. Thanks, Bryce, and good afternoon, everyone. Thanks, Bryce, and good afternoon, everyone. You may proceed with your question. You may proceed with your question. You may proceed with your question. You may proceed with your question. You may proceed with your question. You may proceed with your question. And then when you look at what sounds like maybe a little bit of an acceleration or kind of a very short-term decision for some of your U.S. work to be moved offshore, how has that maybe the last couple of months been different than previous times where you've had U.S. operations that want to move to offshoring as they expand with you, both from sort of the time frame that it takes to have that revenue headwind as you get slightly lower, but then also the total scope of the project in the past versus where you're seeing now maybe companies looking to directly move like-for-like offshore?"
