    "content": " We have actually always evaluated that based on the situation what happen if we will continue to operate these vessels, because one of the key strength of Seaspan is our ability to be able to continue to deploy these vessels under all circumstances, which is why we have a \u2013 on average 99% historical utilization rate through all the market cycles and that\u2019s the base line that we are looking at in terms of continued operating. Looking at the rest of the delivery for this year, as I say just now, we still expect possible early deliveries ranging from this initially was \u2013 for example, one of the vessels supposed to be delivered in October this year and because our team and yards cooperation that we were able to advance them to June and we see potentially there will be further advance them to May. So, this is exactly what we anticipate the demand supply going forward in a market and that is why we have been able to forward fixing 86 of our vessels from our existing fleet of 130 vessels and that\u2019s what the exact is we anticipate the development of the market and we are well positioned in avoiding such a peak of delivery."
