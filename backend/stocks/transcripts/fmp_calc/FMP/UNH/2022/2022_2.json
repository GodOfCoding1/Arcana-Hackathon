    "content": " Stepping back and looking across each of our 5 growth areas, you'll see a common theme: The deepening of our relationships with the consumers served by Optum and UnitedHealthcare. Optum Rx revenues grew 10% to nearly $25 billion, reflecting continued strong sales results and execution in the core PBM as well as our growth in our pharmacy care services. So as Andrew said, really strong growth this year, and you see that as a result of new client growth and the membership that we've brought in and the direct Optum Rx as well as the UnitedHealthcare book. And so really, integrating those pharmacies with the pharmacist-first and a service-first model is one of our biggest investments in the quarter, and you're going to see a return on that through the rest of the year, but I think it's also going to pay off in the growth of those pharmacies and better service to individuals that need us most. And that's an area where you will see us continue to talk about, invest in, build, innovate and we hope really lead in terms of moving the consumer to the center of thinking in healthcare."
