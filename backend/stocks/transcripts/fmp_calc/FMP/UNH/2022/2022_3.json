    "content": " Our focus is to bring innovation into the marketplace, whether that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s through the way we design plans like surest in UnitedHealthcare, the way we develop the value-based platform in OptumCare, all of which are designed develop to deliver high-quality care at more affordable levels for folks and then to ensure that, that is something that can rely on year after year after year. So a lot of runway there, and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what really underpins our long-term confidence in sustained growth particularly in OptumCare, which is a key piece of OptumHealth and maybe now pass to Wyatt to give you a little bit more context of how it all fits together, Wyatt. In terms of the magnitude of that, really, the important factors and considerations are when it closes within the year, certain expectations in terms of the integration costs that we will \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and investments we will like to make in the business and when we get that done earlier in the year versus later in the year for a close and then what it has in terms of impact on the out year an important consideration as we bring that in, I think a full out year view. OptumHealth\u00e2\u0080\u0099s growth in patients served, the evolution of the at-home platform, which has got over the last 2.5 years, 3 years, has moved to a very significant scale, complementing our clinic platform, strong capabilities that we are demonstrating in Medicare Advantage."
