    "content": " Once we complete the transformation to One Yellow, we expect improved asset utilization, enhance network efficiencies, cost savings and added capacity without the need to add new terminals, we will be operating as a modernized super regional carrier that will provide our customers with an all in one solution. Adjusted EBITDA for the last 12 months was $406.7 million as of the end of the second quarter, compared to $216 million a year ago. Our revenue growth of 8.4% in the second quarter compared to a year ago reflects continued strong yield performance and higher fuel surcharge revenue partially offset by lower volume, including fuel surcharge second quarter LTL revenue per hundredweight was up 29.7% and LTL revenue per shipment was up 27.8% compared to a year ago. Total capital expenditures for the first six months were $72.6 million compared to $346.2 million for the first six months of 2021, due primarily to continued supply chain disruptions in limited production capacity available for tractors and trailers, we are lowering our full year 2022 capital expenditures guidance from a range of $325 million to $400 million to a range of $250 million to $300 million. When you think about all the redundancies that exist still today under the yellow umbrella, we have four different fixed asset LTL trucking companies that are running, four different pickup and delivery operations, as well as the four different linehaul networks. Erin, this is Darren. Erin, this is Darren."
