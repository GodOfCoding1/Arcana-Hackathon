    "content": " In Q4 year-over-year LTL revenue per 100, including fuel increased 21.1% for the month of January Yellow average between 5% and 6% on contract negotiations, despite the economic slowdown later in the year, the company made significant financial improvement in 2022 and reported its best operating income and operating ratio since 2006. So when I think about the first quarter in its entirety, historical sequential change and LTL tonnage per day from Q4 to Q1 is typically about a 3% decline with January, outperforming that, and of course, we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t yet know how weather could impact the remainder of the quarter But I believe we have a decent chance to outperform that historical 3% sequential decline. As our value proposition expands with the completion of phase two I think we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to be uniquely positioned where we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have to add any terminals, or build any terminals or lease any terminals, we will have the capacity to bring on a tremendous amount of shipment count and through our driving schools, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve proven that we can bring the drivers on to handle that increased capacity. So I think we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re positioned well and certainly we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll continue to watch the cost plan until we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re through the other side of phase two implementation, and then our value proposition will do the work on expanding and growing our business as demand improves. I mean there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a thought that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to see the markets, free markets generally stabilize here around the second quarter, and maybe start to build back a bit in the second half of the year, once we get through this destock phase."
