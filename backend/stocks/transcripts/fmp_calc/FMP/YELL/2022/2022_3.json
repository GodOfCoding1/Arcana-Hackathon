    "content": " Adjusted EBITDA for the last 12 months was $401.7 million as of the end of the third quarter, compared to $248.4 million a year ago. Our revenue growth of 4.5% in the third quarter compared to a year ago reflects continued strong yield performance and higher fuel surcharge revenue, partially offset by lower volume. Including fuel surcharge, third quarter LTL revenue per hundredweight was up 24.6% and LTL revenue per shipment was up 22.4% compared to a year ago. Our results during the quarter were negatively impacted by a $19.4 million increase in third-party liability claims expense compared to a year ago, mostly due to the unfavorable development of prior year claims, including the resolution of several of our most significant outstanding claims. In addition to extending the maturity by two years from January 2024 up to January 2026, we also increased the size of the facility from $450 million to $500 million and reduced the interest rate by 50 basis points. However, as I mentioned in my opening remarks, our third quarter results were negatively impacted by the year-over-year increase of $19.4 million in third-party liability claims expense, mostly due to the unfavorable development and resolution of claims from prior years. We saw a strong yield performance again on a year-over-year basis during the third quarter and we saw continued sequential yield growth sequentially from Q2 to Q3, excluding fuel surcharge, LTL revenue per shipment was up 1.6% and LTL revenue per hundredweight was up 3.2%."
