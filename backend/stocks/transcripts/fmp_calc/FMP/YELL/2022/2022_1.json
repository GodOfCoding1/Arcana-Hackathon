    "content": " So when we talk about One Yellow, we're talking about a network that actually will complete and come to finality on the weekend, and then restart after weather events, you can actually reset the network in a matter of weeks, where in our case, depending on the length of the weather event that happens, it can sometimes take several weeks, even a month to recover and lead to what we had to do in February by limiting operations for a few days. And Matt, this is Darren again, what I'd like to add is, one of the benefits of One Yellow is we're going to increase our asset utilization dramatically as we make those changes, not standing two tractors, two trailers, two drivers to the same customer that actually frees our fleet up."
