    "content": " In addition to our middle-market exposure, we continue to draw upon Barings\u2019 wide investment frame of reference to complement our core portfolio with $579 million of investments in the legacy MVC and Sierra portfolios and $546 million of cross-platform investments. To further mitigate the negative effects of private market competition and remain prepared for the uncertain markets of the future, we\u2019ll emphasize the following: one, we\u2019ll seek to maintain credit discipline in our core business, seeking out attractive direct lending illiquidity premium per unit of risk; and two, we will ensure that both our liquidity and capital profile is sized to take advantage of the market opportunities as they present themselves; three, we maintain an investment focus across a wide range of cross-platform opportunities. It\u2019s interesting in the first quarter in terms of deal flow and just being more robust in terms of the quality of the credits, in terms of the higher OID, lower leverage and higher spreads, Europe was just on a relative value basis, a much more attractive market than the U.S. And to your comment regarding the geopolitical risk, you would think that wouldn\u2019t be the case, but we\u2019re seeing really good businesses in Europe that are new platforms that are coming to market."
