    "content": " I think like Ty kind of mentioned in his prepared remarks, when we look at permitting activity that we saw in 1Q '22, and we look at the new DUCs that were drilled during 1Q '22, those were some of the highest activity levels for both of those that we've seen really since pre-pandemic, probably 1Q 2020. And so some of it's just timing, but I think it is probably safe to say we have seen a trend of DUCs getting drawn down over the last few quarters, and this would be one of the first quarters where they've kind of replenished that. And so as we kind of get a bit of a reset and looked at the type of cash flow generation that was going to create, it just seemed like the right time really for 2 reasons, like Ty said, for one, in this higher price environment, I think our desire to transact on acquisitions, especially cash acquisitions has diminished. And so I don't know if I can give you an exact mathematical formula as to how to calculate what a future special might be, but I think that those are some of the ways we would look at it, and work with the Board to kind of determine what might be an appropriate return of capital when the business is really generating strong cash flows."
