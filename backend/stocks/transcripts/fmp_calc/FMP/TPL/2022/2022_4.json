    "content": " This agreement will facilitate bpx's oil and gas development of a high-quality resourcebase in the Delaware Basin, while providing TPL incremental value across multiple water and surface revenue streams. Rather, we have negotiated with various operators a type of surface use agreement that pays TPL royalty for any produced water barrels that are either stored directly on or that cross TPL's surface. The strong performance was driven not only by higher commodity prices and higher royalty production, but also year-over-year revenue increases of 25% for source water, 24% increase in produced water royalties, and 28% increase in easements and other surface-related income."
