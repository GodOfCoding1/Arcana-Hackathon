    "content": " This quarter, our managed net investment income was $107 million, up almost 30% from the first quarter and we anticipate continued improvement as our new money yield is nearly double our current net investment income yield. The growth in the quarter was driven by property catastrophe and as an excellent example of our ability to employ our gross to net strategy, as we found attractive opportunities to grow at the midyear, we were able to share more risk with our joint venture partners, particularly DaVinci, Upsilon, and Vermeer. We anticipate continued growth in our net investment income, while a retained net investment income yield is 2.2% the current yield to maturity is almost double at 4.1%, and we expect to realize much of this benefit relatively quickly as the Fed increases interest rates and we turn over the portfolio."
