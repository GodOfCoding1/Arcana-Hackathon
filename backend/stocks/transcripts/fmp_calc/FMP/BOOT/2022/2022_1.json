    "content": " As discussed on our last earnings call, total sales in our retail stores during April and the first half of May were very strong, growing 65% when compared to the same period two years ago. Total sales in our stores maintained this strong growth throughout the remainder of the quarter and finished the quarter, up 66% when compared to the same period two years ago. Compared with the first quarter two years ago, total e-commerce sales grew 56%, and our efforts to increase the profitability of this channel continue to be affected with EBIT showing significant growth on a two-year basis. The bootbarn.com business continues to be our best performing site, with total sales growth of more than 100%, compared to the same period two years ago. Our exclusive brands performed incredibly well, during the first quarter, increasing to 26.3% of net sales, a gain of approximately 650 basis points compared to the same period two years ago. I guess you'd have to look at our Q1 filing from last year, and then you look at total sales and then you'd use the stores penetration to come up with a total sales number in Q1 for stores and you've got the total sales for Q1 this year, that's not necessarily on a comp basis, but we opened 15 stores over the past year and you could back into a number. Can you just maybe just walk us through to get to 79% to 107% what the different components of the business that drove the sales growth to 107% were obviously new stores is a piece probably, not all 2800 basis points of the difference between same-store sales in total revenue."
