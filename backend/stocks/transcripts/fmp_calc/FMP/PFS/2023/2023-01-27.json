    "content": " And in the fourth quarter, we closed approximately $574 million of new commercial loans which increased our production to $2.4 billion for the calendar year. Given the rise in interest rates, prepayments decreased 33% to $176 million as compared to the trailing quarter. The pull-through adjusted pipeline, including loans pending closing, is approximately $714 million and our projected pipeline rate increased 61 basis points from the last quarter to 6.76%. During the quarter, the average balance of our core deposits increased $76 million or 3.1% annualized. On a spot basis, core deposits decreased $89 million or 3.6% annualized which we attribute to normal business activity and some outflow of excess liquidity. As Tony noted, our net income for the quarter was a record $49 million or $0.66 per diluted share compared with $43.4 million or $0.58 per share for the trailing quarter and $37.3 million or $0.49 per share for the fourth quarter of 2021. Excluding these merger-related charges, pretax pre-provision earnings for the quarter was $70.3 million or an annualized 2.03% of average assets. Excluding PPP loans, period-end commercial loan totals increased $209 million or an annualized 9.7% versus September 30. Net of runoff in consumer loans, total loans excluding PPP loans, grew $205 million or an annualized 8.2% for the quarter. The allowance for credit losses on loans decreased $600,000 for the quarter as a result of a $3 million provision for credit losses on loans and $4 million of net charge-offs. Noninterest income decreased $10.2 million versus the trailing quarter, driven by an $8.6 million gain on the sale of REO realized last quarter and lower insurance agency income prepayment fees, gains on loan sales, wealth management income, partially offset by an increase in bank-owned life insurance income in the current quarter."
