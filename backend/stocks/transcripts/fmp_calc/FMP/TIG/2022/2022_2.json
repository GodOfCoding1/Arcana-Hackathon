    "content": " We are pleased to have produced double-digit adjusted net income growth and adjusted return on tangible equity, reporting second quarter adjusted net income of $5.5 million or $0.11 per diluted share and an 11.1% adjusted return on tangible equity both exceeding our initial expectations. In the second quarter of 2022, we generated gross written premiums of $154 million compared to $157 million in the prior year period. As of June 30, 2022, net unearned premiums represented $104.5 million on our balance sheet, an increase of $2.7 million or 3% from March 31, 2022, and up $31.1 million or 42% from June 30, 2021. Net earned premiums for the second quarter was $66 million, a 38% increase from the same prior year period, primarily driven by both the growth in gross earned premium and the strategic increase in our retention of gross written premiums. Underwriting income for the second quarter was $3.4 million, a 17% increase compared to underwriting income of $3 million in the same prior year period. Net investment loss for the second quarter of 2022 was $0.4 million compared to net investment income of $2.1 million in the same prior year period. Excluding these unrealized losses related to equity security holdings and income on funds held investments, our second quarter net investment income was $1.8 million compared to $1.6 million in the same prior year quarter. Net income for the second quarter of 2022 was $5.5 million or $0.11 per diluted share compared to $2.1 million or $0.04 per diluted share in the same prior year period. Adjusted net income for the second quarter of 2022 was also $5.5 million compared to $4.3 million in the same prior year period. For the third quarter 2022, we expect gross written premiums to be between $150 million and $160 million and adjusted net income to be between $4.3 million and $5.3 million."
