    "content": " We were pleased with our first quarter performance as we posted a combined ratio of 89.6% and reported adjusted net income of $8.3 million or $0.16 per diluted share, which represents a 16.2% adjusted return on tangible equity. At our fourth quarter earnings call, we forecasted a first quarter 2022 loss ratio between 61.5% and 62.5% of net earned premium. In the first quarter of 2022, our team grew gross written premiums by 10% to $161 million. As of March 31, 2022, net unearned premiums represented $101.8 million on our balance sheet, an increase of $11.3 million or 13% from December 31, 2021, and up $35.7 million or 54% from March 31, 2021. Net earned premiums for the first quarter were $64.2 million, a 56% increase from the same prior year period driven by both the growth in gross earned premiums and the strategic increase in our retention of gross written premiums. Underwriting income for the first quarter was $6.7 million, a 53% increase compared to underwriting income of $4.4 million in the same prior year period. Excluding income on funds held investments, our first quarter net investment income was $1.9 million compared to $1.6 million in the same prior year quarter. Net income for the first quarter of 2022 was $12.3 million or $0.24 per diluted share compared to $9.4 million or $0.18 per diluted share in the same prior year period. For the second quarter 2022, we expect gross written premiums to be between $158 million and $163 million and adjusted net income to be between $4.3 million and $5.3 million."
