    "content": " In the third quarter of 2022, we generated gross written premiums of $162 million, compared to $177 million in the prior year period. Net earned premiums for the third quarter was $71.4 million, a 37.4% increase from the same prior year period, primarily driven by both the growth in gross earned premiums, and the strategic increase in our retention of gross written premiums. Underwriting income for the third quarter was $2.5 million, compared to underwriting income of $6 million in the same prior year period. Net investment income for the third quarter of 2022, was $3 million compared to net investment income of $2.2 million in the same prior year period. Other revenue, which consists primarily of brokerage and third-party administrative fees was $2.1 million for the quarter, compared to $2.8 million in the same prior year quarter, due primarily to a year-over-year decrease in brokerage revenue. Net income for the third quarter of 2022 was $7.6 million or $0.15 per diluted share, compared to $6.5 million or $0.13 per diluted share in the same prior year period. Adjusted net income for the third quarter of 2022 was $5.5 million, compared to $7.7 million in the same prior year period. Adjusted diluted earnings per share for the third quarter of 2022 was $0.11, compared to $0.15 in the same prior year period.
