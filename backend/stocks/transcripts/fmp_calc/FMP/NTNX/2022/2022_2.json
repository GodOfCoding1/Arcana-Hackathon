Now, turning to our guidance, the guidance for Q3 is as follows: ACV billings to be between $195 million and $200 million, representing year-over-year growth of 22% to 25%; revenue of $395 million to $400 million; gross margin of approximately 82%; operating expenses between $365 million and $370 million; and weighted average shares outstanding of approximately $222 million. The guidance for FY \u201822 is as follows: ACV billings to be between $760 million and $765 million, representing year-over-year growth of 28% to 29%, revenue of $1.625 billion to $1.63 billion, non-GAAP gross margin of approximately 82.5%, and non-GAAP operating expenses between $1.465 billion and $1.47 billion. Your line is open. When you talk about, Duston, that $18 million of renewal upside in the quarter, you broke it down to that we had good renewal activity overall, but we also had a pull-in of early renewals. Your line is open. Your line is open. But if I am looking at the $18 million of revenue upside \u2013 sorry, billings upside you reported this quarter, we are seeing that is almost entirely coming from the early renewals and about $10 million of that was from this co-terming maybe pull-in from Q3. Your line is open. Your line is open."
