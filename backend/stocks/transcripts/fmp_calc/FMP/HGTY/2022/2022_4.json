    "content": " Membership and marketplace revenue jumped 50%, due primarily to $14 million in incremental marketplace revenue, including 86 million in transacted vehicle value from three live auctions as seen on Slide 4. On a year-over-year basis for the fourth quarter, total revenue grew 28% to 197 million, powered by total written premium growth of 15% to 162 million. Earned premium grew 35% to 112 million, driven by new written premium growth, policy retention of 88%, and a 10 point increase in our contractual reinsurance quota share to 70%, and our loss ratio returned to 41% in the quarter. Commission and fee revenue in 2022 grew 13%, slightly below written premium growth as our loss ratio of 45% was elevated due to Hurricane Ian and our decision to increase U.S. reserves, which reduced our contingent underwriting commission. And Hagerty Re is just beginning to develop meaningful scale with 400 million in capital at year-end, with our loss ratios resulting in a combined ratio of roughly 90%, we have the potential to generate 10% margins and then leverage our per capital 3x to 4x for underwriting future business resulting in very compelling returns on equity."
