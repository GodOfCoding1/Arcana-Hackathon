    "content": " In addition to the continued strong revenue growth of Hagerty Re, our membership business as well as our garage and social locations, Q3 was our first quarter fully consolidating broad Arrow Group into Hagerty Marketplace. We believe this strong growth trajectory positions us well for 2023, including continued double-digit gains in written premium, 80% quota share in Hagerty Re, a move to a single-tier pricing of $70 on Hagerty Drivers Club as well as a full year contribution from marketplaces live and online auctions, we'll share more specific details on our outlook for 2023 on our fourth quarter call. Our loss ratio in the third quarter increased to 56%, resulting in year-to-date loss ratios of 47%, while our underlying business performance remained solid over the first 9 months, the higher loss ratio was driven by 3.4 percentage points of losses from Hurricane Ian and 2.2 percentage points due to increases in U.S. liability reserves. And slide 7 highlights several of the key year-to-date milestones across our ecosystem, including our continued progress with State Farm, Marketplace's successful launch, increasing quota share of Hagerty Re, solid growth in membership and strong delivery of content and experiences to customers through our media and entertainment platform. Yes, definitely, as we look at it, it's about an 8% kind of PIF count for us, which we don't spend a lot of time focused on the, say, regular auto insurance market, but we know from this year that with many of the very, very large insurers who are our partners slowing down their advertising spends in kind of the earlier part of the year that a lot of those companies are seeing pretty low PIF counts if kind of any at all in some cases."
