    "content": " Before Fred and I dig into the numbers, we wanted to say thank you to our 1,700 plus One Team Hagerty members, who worked tirelessly to deliver high rates of consistent growth, including 26% revenue growth so far this year. Slide 7 highlight several additional milestones achieved towards delivering a seamless digital experience for members, including; launching the Hagerty roadside mobile app, fanning Hagerty classified for members to buy and sell their cars, reaching 9 million monthly views on YouTube with great original content for auto enthusiasts, and transitioning all event ticketing and vehicle submissions to the Concours Digital Event platform that supports all of our owned and operated events. We were encouraged to see written premium growth accelerate in July, and we believe our 24% to 28% revenue growth trajectory positions us well for another great year in 2023, predicated on mid-teens organic growth in written premiums, higher rates, increasing quota share and the expected contribution from Broad Arrow Group.
