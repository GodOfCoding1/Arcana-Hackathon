    "content": " Before we start, I would like to remind you that the discussion today may contain statements related to our business that may be considered forward-looking, including statements concerning our expected future business and financial performance, our ability to maintain existing and acquired members, our plans to expand market share including planned investments and partnerships, expectations regarding key operational metrics and other statements regarding our plans, and prospects. Our Marketplace won\u2019t be just about our members buying and selling cars, but will also serve businesses in the automotive world with our acquisition of Speed Digital, a technology company that is a leading provider of inventory management services to specialty dealers, auction houses and collectors. Overall, 2.5 million active members have joined Hagerty through March 31, 2022, up 11% year-over-year with 1.3 million paid members looking to us to protect their vehicles, provide enthusiast services, products and experiences, and consume automotive media and content. Turning to profitability, for the first quarter of 2022, we reported an operating loss of $13 million, compared to an operating loss of $5.1 million in 2021, reflecting expected higher digital advertising costs, higher amortization expenses related to software development and acquired media and entertainment assets, and higher scaling expenses related to the State Farm and Hagerty Marketplace launches scheduled for later this year."
