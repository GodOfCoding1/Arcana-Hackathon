    "content": " Net interest income was $57.5 million for the second quarter, up from $55.2 million in the first quarter, primarily due to the effects of core loan growth, a more favorable rate environment, partially offset by a $1.1 million decrease in PPP fee revenue recognized in interest income and only slightly higher interest expense. Recall that net fee revenue related to PPP loans recognized into interest income during the second quarter was only $1.4 million compared to $2.5 million in the first quarter and $6.4 million for the second quarter of 2021, interest expense increased by $227,000 during the second quarter compared to the first quarter and decreased by $878,000 when you compare it to the prior year quarter."
