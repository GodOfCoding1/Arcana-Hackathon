    "content": " In the second quarter, we expect to deliver mid single-digit core revenue growth in our base business, which includes a headwind of approximately 200 to 300 basis points from the ongoing COVID-19 related shutdowns in China. And so if you look at the 2-year stack for Q1, we\u2019re in the 35% to 40% growth area, which we think is very robust and more than representative of what is going on in the market and think that, that compares extremely well. And this is why we\u2019re so confident in our core growth guide here for the year and bioprocessing of high single digit, low double digits between the robust growth that we\u2019re seeing and the backlog that we have, that\u2019s really important. Really, the way we are thinking about that business is, again, in aggregate, and we do believe that both the underlying strength of the markets as I just laid out, as well as the strength of our backlog, which continues to grow, support both the high-single digit, low-double digit bioprocessing guide for the year."
