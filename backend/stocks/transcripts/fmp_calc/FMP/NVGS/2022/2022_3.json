    "content": "  The total operating revenues for the third quarter were $106.8 million compared to $102.7 million for the comparative third quarter of last year, 2.2 million of this increase was primarily as a result of the additional handysize vessels joining our fleet as part of the Ultragas transaction in August, 2021, and a further $9.6 million generated from the nine smaller vessels that operate within the independently run Unigas Pool also acquired as part of the Ultragas transaction. Our vessel operating expenses or OpEx increased by 10.6% to $38.7 million for the third quarter compared to the third quarter of last year, much of which was as a result of the additional vessels in the fleet during the quarter relative to last year."
