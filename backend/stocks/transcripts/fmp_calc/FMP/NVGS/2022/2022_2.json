    "content": " The net income for the quarter was $14 million or $0.18 per share, which when compared to the $300,000 generated in the second quarter of 2021 or $0.01 per share, provides an indication of the trajectory the company has taken over the past 12 months and hope to continue in the coming quarters. The total operating revenues for the second quarter were $123.9 million, compared to $85.7 million for the comparative second quarter of 2021, $12.3 million of the $37.3 million increase in revenue was generally as a result of the additional seven handysize vessels joining the fleet as part of the Ultragas transaction, with a further $11.4 million generated from the nine smaller vessels acquired that operate within the independently run Unigas pool. Charter rates too continued to improve during the quarter, which accounted for $8.3 million of the overall increase in revenues, with an average charter rate rising to $24,633 per day or just under $750,000 per month, the highest daily time charter equivalent since Q2 of 2016 and compares to $22,169 per day or approximately $674,000 per month for the second quarter of 2021, and importantly, this $24,633 per day was also an increase from the $22,900 per day achieved last quarter, the first quarter of 2022. A further three vessels entered into dry dock for the scheduled surveys during the second quarter, in addition to the four vessels during the first quarter, taking a total of -- 53 days and with a capital cost of $3.8 million. The voyage expenses increased by 17.6% to $3 point -- or $3.1 million during the second quarter to $20.8 million, primarily as a result of the additional vessels in the fleet, most of which are on voyage charters thereby incurring these pass-through voyage expenses. And as I stated in the last earnings call, this is in -- in part due to the 16 additional vessels in the fleet, which accounted for $5.9 million of this increase, but also $6.1 million of additional depreciation as a result of the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s decision to reduce the estimate of useful life of all of its vessels from 30 years to 25 years as of January 1, 2022. General and administrative costs increased by $35 million -- 35% or approximately $2 million to $7.8 million relative to the comparative quarter of last year, $1.5 million of this increase relates to the additional administrative costs associated with the Ultragas and also in addition to unfavorable exchange movements on our Indonesian rupiah account. This compares to a profit of $2 million for the second quarter of last year, which was based on 155,500 tons export to the terminal and this quarterly performance is the third consecutive quarterly profit of approximately $6.5 million. Terminal depreciation amounts to $5.2 million per year or $1.3 million per quarter, giving an EBIT -- EBITDA for our share of the terminal of somewhere between $7.8 million per quarter and $8.2 million per quarter.
