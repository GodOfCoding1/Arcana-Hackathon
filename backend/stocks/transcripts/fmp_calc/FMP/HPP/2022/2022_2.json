    "content": " And then, Mark or Harout, on the interest expense, I think originally -- on last quarter's call, you spoke about $325 million to $350 million of total dispose. They were just looking at what they think their long-term requirement is, and that's what got the team kind of focused and able to extend them on 50 -- about 50% of their footage through 2030. Just as a reminder, there's also a few of our assets that are currently -- the tenants are building out their space, and their cash NOI will really start contributing in '23, the biggest of which is Google at well One Westside. And so -- and I recognize I could ask this of John, but they bought almost a 4 million share position at a VWAP back at 24, stocks at 14%, you would think that there would be more interest at these levels, given everything that you've been able to produce and all of your commentary on the call."
