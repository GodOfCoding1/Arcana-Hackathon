    "content": " In addition to these new programs funded by the 2021 Infrastructure Act, which are now close to being awarded, we believe the passing of the Inflation Reduction Act during Q3 with its $40,000 federal tax credit for zero emission commercial vehicles in Class 4 and larger is motivating customers to accelerate their efforts to transition to zero emission trucks and buses. So we remain \u00e2\u0080\u0093 we don't have \u00e2\u0080\u0093 from a warranty cost, we're pretty traditional in the way we look at warranty reserves, a little more than a legacy OEM, but not crazy, and we're certainly seeing ourselves in that path, but we see a path to very low warranty in the long-term, given both our improvements and investments we're making in supply chain and higher quality suppliers as well as the investment we're making in our  teams."
