    "content": " I'm glad to report that we continue to sign new customers, receive repeat orders and grow the sales pipeline for our core products and market verticals, which are zero-emission cargo vans, delivery trucks, passenger vans, shuttle buses, and school buses. Research and development expense in the second quarter was $1.8 million compared to $743,000 in the prior year period, primarily due to higher engineering headcount to advance the development of new vehicle platforms and enhance our in-house engineering capabilities. Based on current business conditions, we expect for the quarter ending September 30, 2022 vehicle and powertrain system sales to be in the range of 60 to 90 units, revenues to be in the range of $7 million to $10 million, adjusted EBITDA loss to be in the range of $18 million to $20 million and for the full year vehicle and powertrain system sales to be in the range of 350 to 450 units, revenues to be in the range of $35 million to $45 million. And they've now come back to us and we're able to deliver, and there's countless examples of this that we've seen, but it has certainly elongated our sales cycle while customers go through this process of figuring out what's real and what's not, but as we continue to ship more vehicles and as many of these competitors continue not to ship, and some of this is important, even some of the big OEMs have made promises about what their products will do or be, or cost that are now starting to turn out to be maybe exaggerated or understated in some way."
