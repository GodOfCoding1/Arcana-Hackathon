    "content": " Our sales, engineering, manufacturing and supply chain teams have been taking measures to adapt to the circumstances with announcements in the last quarter of certified repower products, as well as new platform options with Blue Bird and GM, and continued progress on our previously announced Class 4 Lightning eChassis. As far as repowers, we've long been and I've been a long advocate when you look at sustainability and you look at certain commercial vehicle markets where you've got a commercial vehicle, a chassis and a body that out last the powertrain consistently that re-powers are the sustainability solution, they are the right economic solution, but as with any change it takes a little bit to get through these commercial vehicle sales cycles. And we see them exactly -- to your point, Stephen, they see the need, but I think it's also important to note, many of the commercial vehicle customers didn't -- haven't really realized the shortage of chassis even though we've seen it coming for a while, many of them -- it hasn't hit them yet until now. I just want to make sure I understand, because it just -- from an outsider's perspective, it looks like you're casting a wider net as far as markets that you're focusing on with the Blue Bird terms and some of the other vehicles."
