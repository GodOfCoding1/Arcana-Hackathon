    "content": " Next, we will discuss our view of market forces and momentum and our refined product development focus on certain segments and applications most favored by government incentives and where we currently have a competitive advantage, specifically Class 4 trucks and buses plus the Lightning Mobile DC fast charger we just introduced, and finally we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll discuss how this narrowing of our focus will allow us to reduce our expenses and cash burn. Looking forward, our new line-up of products, including all of our GM-based Class 4 products and our Lightning Mobile DC fast vehicle charger, all use high quality batteries from Proterra and CATL, of which we have more than ample supply. Turning to Slide 11 which summarizes our product development focus for this year, Class 4 buses and trucks built on the GM platform with Proterra batteries and an optimized next-generation power train plus the mobile charger I spoke of. Turning to Slides 18 and 19, you will see how the combination of incentives, grants and mandates continues to drive demand for zero emission commercial vehicles and how our products can leverage multiple state and federal grants that are stackable with each other, including the $40,000 IRA tax credit mentioned by Tim. Based on current business conditions, we expect for 2023 revenues to be in the range of $35 million to $50 million - the high end of that range would represent a doubling of revenue versus 2022; vehicle and power train system sales to be in the range of 300 to 400 units, and vehicle and power train production to be in the range of 400 to 450 units.
