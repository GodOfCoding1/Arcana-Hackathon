    "content": " And I'm pleased to report that as of the end of the second quarter, our trailing 12-month company-wide ROIC was 38% and significantly higher in our North American LTL and truck brokerage businesses. Please proceed with your question. Scott, on the sequential margins and overall LTLs you said, the second quarter, we delivered a great sequential improvement of 530 basis points, an 18.4% adjusted OR. When you look at the second quarter, our line haul miles that were outsourced were roughly 24.7%, which was up 80 basis points from last year, which is what we said we would do, but we're going to lean a bit more on purchase transportation this year. And just to give you a few stats, the cost per mile for us line haul was up on a year-on-year basis by 33% in the first quarter and it was up 14% in the second quarter with newly negotiated rates with cars that went into effect in the month of May. Please proceed with your question. Our yield in the second quarter was up 11% versus 8.7% in the first quarter and we expect yield to continue to remain strong for the course of the year, although we'll have tougher comps as we head into the back half. Please proceed with your question. Please proceed with your question. Please proceed with your question. With the significant improvement we've seen in how we're performing and the network fluidity that is back to pre-pandemic levels, we have great sales momentum from our sales force, where we've had record business wins in the second quarter, and that accelerated through the quarter as well. Please proceed with your question. Please proceed with your question. Please proceed with your question. Please proceed with your question."
