    "content": " During last year's holiday season, consumers were urged to shop much earlier in the period in response to supply chain constraints, which led to an unprecedented pull forward of business. As we sell through that inventory this fiscal year, we expect free cash flow to improve more than $135 million this year compared with last year, benefiting in large part from the working capital reduction as well as lower capital expenditures. When comparing our first quarter results to the year ago period, it is important to remember that we faced a difficult margin comparison as the year ago results had not yet been affected by the global supply chain challenges and the surge in shipping, commodity costs, labor and fuel, which began to escalate and impact our fiscal second quarter last year. But because Vital Choice, it's the first year, we kind of gave the -- with our guidance, both the revenue kind of with and without computing anyway, but basically around $5 million or so in the quarter. So we're cautiously optimistic as we move forward into the holiday season that what we saw last year of business being pushed forward, we're not seeing as much of that this year, and we're expecting business to come in more like closer to the holiday, more like consumer behavior from the prepandemic -- excuse me, pre pandemic point of time. And certainly, some of those imports are great coming down, labor stabilizing, all helping to improve our gross margins, and that's why we're we've kind of stated that we think we believe gross margin stabilize in Q2 and then actually improving in the second half of the year."
