    "content": " Revenue in the quarter were down 1% compared with the prior-year period reflecting solid growth of bucketing 5% for the Valentine's Day holiday in our consumer floral business and contributions from Vital Choice, which we acquired back in October. In terms of our bottom line results, gross margins in the quarter were impacted by several factors, including the continued disruptions in the global supply chain, the escalation of commodity costs, increased costs for inbound and outbound shipping, including an acceleration in fuel surcharges related to rising oil prices, increased year-over-year labor rates across the company, and the write-off of certain inventories of expired perishable products, reflecting softer than anticipated demand levels. However, as we enter our fiscal fourth quarter, we do see some opportunities for improved performance, including the benefits of the Easter shift into the period, our strong inventory position, and the spring season's key holidays, including Mother's Day, Father's Day, graduations, and wedding season, where we anticipate stronger consumer demand as we saw in the past two quarters for key holiday occasions. In Consumer Floral and Gifts, total revenues were $264.2 million, an increase of 1.5% compared with $260.4 million in the prior-year period primarily reflecting solid growth for the Valentine's Day holiday, partly offset by softer everyday gifting sales. It's hard to quantify that at the current time, but I think all these initiatives are there to basically help offset the higher labor rates that we're seeing -- significantly higher labor rates, which we don't believe the hourly labor rates are going to go down much."
