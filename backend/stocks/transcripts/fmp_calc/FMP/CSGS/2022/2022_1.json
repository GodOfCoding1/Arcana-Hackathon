    "content": " I'm pleased to share that CSG's business momentum continued in Q1 2022, as team CSG delivered another strong quarter of growth on top line revenue and bottom line EPS. On the right side of Slide 6, we believe that the current economic environment benefits CSG's high recurring revenue SaaS business model and our strong healthy balance sheet creates attractive organic and inorganic market opportunities on the march to $2 billion and beyond. In our base case, we aspire to exceed $1.5 billion in revenue, which means, even if we come up short against our stretch case ambitions, CSG will still grow revenue by over 50% and add over $500 million in profitable recurring revenue by 2025. To reach the $2 billion stretch case revenue aspiration by 2025, we will continue to allocate capital to its most value-adding use and to eventually close bigger scale acquisitions that become even more transformational for CSG and the industry. Since 2017, CSG has grown revenue from exciting new industry verticals like retail, government, financial services and healthcare, from 7% of total 2017 CSG revenue, to over 24% of total revenue at year end 2021. In the payments market, we returned to meaningful revenue growth in the quarter, with good double-digit growth in the last two months of Q1, coming from our strong industry vertical sales results, propelled by our industry-leading recurring revenue SaaS integrated payment platform."
