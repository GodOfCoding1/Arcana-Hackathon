    "content": " During a period of broad-based inflationary pressures and rising interest rates, our third quarter results were impacted by lower customer demand across most product categories as our mass merchant channel partners seek to align elevated inventory levels with a near-term deceleration in consumer discretionary spending. Total capital expenditures were approximately $0.3 million during the third quarter compared to $4 million in the third quarter of last year when we purchased manufacturing and warehouse facilities in Olney, Illinois. Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization declined 35.3% to $5.8 million in the third quarter of 2022 versus $9 million in the prior year period. As Walt mentioned, this availability increased by $15 million in late October following the close of our third quarter as we exercise the remaining portion of our accordion on senior secured credit facilities."
