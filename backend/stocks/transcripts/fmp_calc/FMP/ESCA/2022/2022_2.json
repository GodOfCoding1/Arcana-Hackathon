    "content": " Total inventories were $130 million at the end of second quarter, up from $86 million in the prior year period due to the addition of the Brunswick Billiards inventory as well as prior purchases of long lead time items in 2020 and 2021, exacerbated by slowing demand and retail order cancellations in recent months. Selling, general and administrative expense as a percentage of net sales increased to 15.6% in the second quarter of 2022 versus 13.9% in the prior year period due to lower sales volume and expenses related to the acquisition and integration of Brunswick Billiards. Total operating cash flow less capital expenditures, was $1.7 million in the second quarter versus $6.9 million in the prior year period. Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization declined 15.7% to $10.3 million in the second quarter of 2022 versus $12.3 million in the prior year period."
