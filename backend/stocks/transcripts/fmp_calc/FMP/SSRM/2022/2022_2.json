    "content": " Our four operating assets produced 333,000 ounces of gold at all-in sustaining costs of $11.77 per ounce, with solid margins and attributable net income of $126 million. As a result, we are reaffirming our production guidance, albeit at the bottom end of the guidance range, and we are revising our cost guidance higher for the first -- for the year to reflect the macroeconomic pressures and the temporary suspension of \u00c3\u0087\u00c3\u00b6pler, which we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll discuss during the presentation. First half production at 333,000 ounces of gold and all-in sustaining cost of $11.77 per ounce was in line with our internal budgets and guidance. This quarter we produced over 159,000 gold equivalent ounces and over 333,000 gold equivalent ounces in the first half of the year, in line with our expectations for back half weighted production profile. As mentioned earlier, we revised our guidance for all-in sustaining costs to $1,230 to $1,290 per gold equivalent ounce and are targeting the lower end of our existing production guidance range. As we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve now seen and heard from Rod, we have increased our 2022 cost guidance as a result of the temporary suspension and the persistent and pervasive inflationary pressures across the business that I had also talked about in the first quarter call. Marigold delivered quarter-over-quarter improvement, though production timing continues to be impacted by stacking of fine material from the north pit, production of almost 46,000 ounces at an all-in sustaining cost of $1,458 an ounce was largely in line with expectations of back half weighted production profile. We're going to bounce back from a soft first quarter with production of nearly 2 million ounces of silver at an all-in sustaining cost of $1,523 - $15.23 an ounce."
