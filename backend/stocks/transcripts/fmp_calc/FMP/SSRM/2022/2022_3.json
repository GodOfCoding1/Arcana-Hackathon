    "content": " Our third quarter all-in sustaining costs were $1,901 per gold equivalent ounce after absorbing more than $30 million in cash costs incurred at \u00c3\u0087\u00c3\u00b6pler during the quarter. To that effect, so far this year, we returned $144 million to shareholders through the base dividend and share buyback program and more impressive since the beginning of 2021, we have returned more than 90% of our free cash flow generation to shareholders, which is delivering on one of the key promises post the merger. Second, we are committed to maintaining a robust balance sheet to weather volatility in the commodity price environment and to ensure all of our capital commitments, debt servicing requirements and base dividend payments are fully funded even in the event of a potential downturn in the gold price cycle, our base dividend at $0.07 a share can also weather gold price downturns as it is payable to a gold reserve price of $1,350 per ounce. Since the start of 2021, we have returned approximately $335 million to shareholders and produced 1.2 million ounces during the same period, returning $270 to shareholders per gold equivalent ounce produced in that period of time. Production of 52,000 ounces at an all-in sustaining cost of $1,444 per ounce was behind expectations, but we are starting to see a positive trend with respect to leaching in the fourth quarter. As a result, reflecting on the year-to-date leach cycle delays due to the stacking of final war as well as the lingering challenges with shovel availability, we now expect full year production of 195 to 205 ounces at an all-in sustaining cost of $1,410 to $1,440 per ounce."
