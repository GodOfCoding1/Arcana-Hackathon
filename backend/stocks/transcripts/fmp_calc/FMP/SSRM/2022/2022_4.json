    "content": " To reinforce the point on cash flow, we have assumed an $1,800 gold price and with our 2023 production guidance of 700,000 to 790,000 ounces, we would expect approximately $140 million of free cash flow this year. The business delivered strong fourth quarter production of 183,000 ounces at an all-in sustaining cost of $1,358 per ounce. Full-year production of 624,000 ounces at an all-in sustaining cost of $1,339 per ounce were within the company's revised full-year guidance ranges. Fourth quarter production of 183,000 ounces at all-in sustaining costs of $1,352 an ounce was a solid finish to the year and included the delivery of nearly $100 million in quarterly free cash flow. Marigold delivered strong fourth quarter cost performance, producing 63,000 ounces at an all-in sustaining cost of $1,160 an ounce. Seabee delivered strong operating performance with mining and processing rates, averaging nearly 1,300 tons per day in Q4 and Puna delivered another consistent quarter and met its full-year production and cost guidance targets. We have increased our exploration and development budget to $94 million, up approximately 50% over 2022, and we expect the exploration programs will continue to support our resource development and conversion as we seek to build mineral reserves and extend mine life at each of our assets. For our financial results this quarter, we produced nearly 183,000 gold equivalent ounces, bringing full-year production to 624,000 gold equivalent ounces with revenue of $306 million. This strong sulfide plant performance meant that the mine actually exceeded its revised 2022 production guidance with full-year production of 191,000 ounces, setting us up well for \u00c3\u0087\u00c3\u00b6pler to deliver production guidance of 240,000 to 270,000 ounces in 2023. Marigold again delivered quarter-over-quarter improvement with quarter four production of 63,000 ounces and all-in sustaining cost of $1,160 per ounce, bringing production to the bottom end of its revised full-year guidance range. These new trucks and waste stripping accounts for approximately $100 per ounce of SSR Mining's corporate level all-in sustaining costs, but will be a benefit to the production profile of Marigold in the longer term."
