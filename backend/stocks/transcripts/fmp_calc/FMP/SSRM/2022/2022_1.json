    "content": " Coupled with our previous commentary that our full year production is second half weighted, we remain well positioned to deliver against our full year guidance of 700,000 to 780,000 ounces of gold at an all-in sustaining cost of $1,120 to $1,180 an ounce. And in the CDMP21 released earlier this year, Ardich featured a 1.2 million ounces of gold production, adjusted to $69 million in development CapEx and that production number could grow with continued exploration success. We announced the inaugural 3-year production guidance, showcasing a stable production -- showcasing a stable production above 700,000 ounces and increased our quarterly dividend payments by 40%. As noted, following a solid first quarter, we remain well on track against our full year guidance and expect our production will remain second half weighted as Marigold's performance improves, especially in quarter 4 this year. We remain on track for full year guidance of 700,000 to 780,000 gold equivalent ounces at an AISC of $1,120 to $1,180 per gold equivalent ounce, which remains weighted to the second half of the year, particularly due to the expectations for big fourth quarter at Marigold. Our aggressive exploration and resource definition programs at Marigold continued in the quarter with drilling at New Millennium, where we are targeting additional ore close to the existing pits, high grade oxide of course, as well as concurrently drilling at Buffalo Valley and Trenton Canyon to define best resource development pathway for these deposits."
