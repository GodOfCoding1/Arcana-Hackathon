    "content": " We've also made significant progress towards identifying additional front-of-the-eye indications that are currently evaluating potential KPI-012 for the treatment of partial limbal stem cell deficiency and the ocular manifestations of moderate-to-severe Sjogren's, both of which are areas of significant unmet medical need. Based on the compelling mechanism of action and numerous interactions with key opinion leaders, we're also evaluating the potential of KPI-012 for the treatment of partial limbal stem cell deficiency or partial LSCD, as we call it, and for the ocular manifestations of moderate-to-severe Sjogren's. In addition to the effects of KPI-012 on corneal healing observed in both animal models and in PCED patients in the previous trial, the stat on the literature that suggests that MSC secretomes could also restore the limbal stem cell niche, which would be a significant benefit in both partial and complete LSCD. There's a significant unmet need for new therapies that can provide meaningful improvement in the ocular symptoms, visual impair and quality of life to the approximately 50% of Sjogren's patients or roughly 95,000 people in the U.S. who suffer with moderate-to-severe disease."
