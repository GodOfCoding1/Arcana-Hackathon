    "content": " This formulary addition is particularly important in light of the fact that, in the second half of 2021, CVS Caremark implemented increased coverage restrictions on EYSUVIS, which in turn resulted in more prescriptions going through the patient copay assistance program, having a disproportionate negative impact on net revenues in Q4 of 2021 and Q1 of 2022. As Todd described earlier and as we discussed last quarter, the impact seen on our net revenue for EYSUVIS in the first quarter of 2022 is the direct result of our reliance on our patient assistance programs, in large part because of the increased coverage restrictions implemented by CVS Caremark in the second half of last year. So, think of those numbers of sort of in the fourth quarter of last year, as many as 70% of EYSUVIS scripts were getting filled utilizing one of our copay assistance programs, as Mark said, largely driven by the restrictions that CVS Caremark had implemented that required more patients to use copay assistance. And I think I also feel good about the fact that CVS Caremark's commercial side of the business, and United's commercial side of the business, both just took positive formulary coverage decisions for EYSUVIS."
