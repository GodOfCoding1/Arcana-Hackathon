    "content": " And as a result of lower sales outlook and the impact of unfavorable development program adjustments, we are reducing RIS\u00e2\u0080\u0099 full year adjusted operating profit from the prior range of flat to up $50 million to a new range of down $50 million to flat versus prior year. Adjusted operating profit in the quarter of $315 million was down $100 million versus prior year primarily driven by lower net program efficiencies, including unfavorable development program adjustments, the impact of the divestiture in the absence of a land sale in the prior year. Adjusted operating profit of $348 million was $184 million lower than prior year driven primarily by lower net program efficiencies resulting from continued supply chain constraints and unfavorable program mix and lower volume primarily in land, warfare and air defense programs."
