I mean, one of the sites that had done 30 cases for example, they were like very slowly doing cases and then I actually talked with them and I said, well, you guys started by saying we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to do 30 to 40 per year, you have taken longer to get there. And they said, now that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve confirmed the clinical trial outcomes, we think that TULSA is going to be in \u00e2\u0080\u0093 to be honest, to give you his words, he said, this is going to be one of the big three, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to be TULSA, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to be robotic prostatectomy, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to be radiation.
