    "content": " As you may recall, the TULSA systematic review paper that was published online in March by the Journal of Endourology provided Level 2A evidence, the highest available in support of TULSA, demonstrating that TULSA is safe and effective for treating primary prostate cancer, recurrent prostate cancer and locally advanced prostate cancer as well as for the simultaneous treatment of prostate cancer and the lower urinary -- sorry, urinary tract symptoms normally caused by BPH. Among the many presentations mentioned 1 or 2 of the technology platforms, Dr. Steve Raman from UCLA presented 3-year follow-up data from TACT; Dr. Busch did a presentation on his initial experience with TULSA; and in the presentation titled HIFU pediatric applications, current and future applications, Dr. Karun Sharma from the Children\u00e2\u0080\u0099s National Hospital reviewed osteoid osteoma treatment data and discussed plans for an upcoming trial of Sonalleve designed to examine its use in treating pediatric patients for hyperthermia prior to radiation treatment. So I think on the TULSA side, we are -- it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s more like things are on track, the awareness is going up, patients continue to give us positive feedback, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll continue to see more publications, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll continue to see more and more usage and adoption continuing to go up, you will continue to see additional sites going up. So now looking forward to 2023, as you put all of these important pieces -- as you are currently putting these important pieces together, again, reimbursement and this awareness and a relatively well-established installed base teaching hospitals, how should we be thinking about sort of revenue ramp in 2023 particularly given also the cash position of around $53 million right now, the burn of around $7 million in the quarter."
