    "content": " First quarter revenue increased 13% to $114.8 million and reflected the higher demand in the industrial markets, as Dick discussed, and approximately $11 million of incremental revenue from acquisitions. First quarter adjusted net income, which excludes business development costs and other nonrecurring items, was $3.8 million or $0.24 per diluted share compared with $4.6 million or $0.32 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2021. But I would say to you that our customers, if you look at it on a global basis, we're starting to see reality setting in, and that our customers, we'll call it, North America and/or Europe, are looking for localization of supply chain. And we just actually approved a -- I'll call it a highly automated or fully automated motor production line that has been in development for 2 years, that's now on its way to Mexico and will be ramping up in mid-second quarter and resourcing product that was not being built in North America, but it's primarily for North American usage."
