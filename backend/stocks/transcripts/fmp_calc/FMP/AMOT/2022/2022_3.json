    "content": " Third quarter revenue increased 30% to $134.4 million, a record level, which reflected strong demand in the A&D and industrial markets as Dick discussed and incremental sales from acquisitions. Operating costs and expenses as a percent of revenues were 23.5%, up 90 basis points, but largely attributable to our M&A activity with step-up amortization expenses as well as added engineering and development costs that we have not yet fully leveraged, helping offset the leverage gain on the SG&A line, which decreased 60 basis points to 13.9% of revenue, our lowest level in more than 3 years. So it's a great question, and that's where you're starting to see as we go through this integration process and everybody getting to become familiar as we're laying out those plans moving into the future, and we're getting really focused on some significant major opportunities that leverages technology from several, many of our technology units. So to answer your question, if we go back to our original definition, we would tell you that more than 50% of our sales are solution-oriented, but really, it's approaching more like 60%, 70% in the future as we're looking at these major programs that we're investing in to go after."
