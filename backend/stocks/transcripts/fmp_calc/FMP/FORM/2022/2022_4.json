    "content": " The revenue upside compared to our October outlook which primarily driven by our ability to ship products to certain domestic China customers in compliance with new export controls, which also drove stronger than expected DRAM probe cards and systems revenues in the quarter. In Foundry and Logic probe cards, our largest business, we see moderate strengthening in the first quarter, driven primarily by pilot production ramps for new mobile application processor designs, together with stronger demand in our microprocessor business. Probe card segment revenues were $124.4 million in the fourth quarter and decreased to $50 million, or 10.8% from Q3. Compounded on top of that, obviously, with very short lead times in the probe card business, we're going to be seeing when customers turn back on wafer starts in production in almost real time, with lead times well, within a quarter to look into a second half utilization recovery is something that we just don't have the visibility, the length of lead time and the backlog to really make any intelligent comments on. So I think that's a parallel if inventories get consumed in a relatively short term in a handful of quarters, I think you could see customers take some of these new devices, things like high density, DDR5 for mobile, and ramp those more aggressively, but as long as this overhang of inventory, and what's a pretty unhealthy end DRAM chip market persists, we don't anticipate any significant recovery as we go through 2023 here. Yes, thanks for taking the question. Yes, thanks for taking the question."
