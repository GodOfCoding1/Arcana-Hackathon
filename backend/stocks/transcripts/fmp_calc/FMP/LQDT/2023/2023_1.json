    "content": " As Bill has said, despite the macroeconomic challenges impacting key categories, we have continued to focus on expanding market share, while completing the first quarter of fiscal year 2023 with $270.8 million in GMV, up 4% and $72.3 million in revenue or up 8% from $260.2 million and $66.7 million in the same quarter last year, respectively. Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA was $9.8 million, up from $9.4 million the same quarter last year, mainly reflecting the higher GMV and revenue, partially offset by the planned year-over-year investments in operations and technology and higher sales and marketing expenses to support market share expansion, diversification and longer-term growth. And it's not like, we have \u00e2\u0080\u0093 we're not rooting from one side or the other, which driving the longitudinal data that says, if you have 100 properties in a county every quarter that goes to the sale process as directed by the share, when you normalize that, we're going to sell a lot more property than what we've seen in the last few quarters and what we currently have visibility on for our Q2 March quarter."
