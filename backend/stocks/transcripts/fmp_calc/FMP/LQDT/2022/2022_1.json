    "content": " Our mission and value proposition are resonating with sellers as we grew our GMV by 37% year-over-year in Q1 to approximately $260 million, an all-time record and our sixth consecutive quarter of 20%-plus annual GMV growth. These investments will enable us to capture the market opportunity and key asset categories such as heavy equipment, vehicles, industrial and consumer goods and real estate, and accelerate our growth in the second half of fiscal year 2022 and drive us towards our new target of 1.5 billion in annualized GMV. We completed the first quarter of fiscal year 2022 with $260.2 million in GMV, an all-time quarterly record that exceeds the $1 billion annualized goal we set forth previously. While these business\u2019 growth initiatives gain traction, we anticipate lower profits in the short-term for Q2 of fiscal year 2022, combined with the GovDeals seasonality and change in mix for CAG project days sales this coming quarter."
