    "content": " We grew our GMV by 34% year-over-year in Q2 to approximately $277 million, an all-time record and our seventh consecutive quarter of 20% plus annual GMV growth, the continued relevance and leadership of our circular economy marketplace platform and every sector of the economy is driving us closer to our objective of $1.5 billion in annualized GMV. GovDeals\u2019 GMV increased 62% during Q2 driven by record new account acquisitions as more agencies choose our digital marketplace solutions over traditional sales methods for a broader array of assets, including vehicles, heavy equipment and real estate. Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA was $9.2 million slightly down by $200,000 from the same quarter last year, reflecting our planned investments across our segments for long-term growth in the market share GMV and gross profits while continuing to position ourselves to meet the demand from expected macro trends. Our third quarter of fiscal year 2022 guidance range for GMV is above the same period last year, despite last year\u2019s strong market prices for used vehicles at GovDeals and the more favorable mix of supply and related take rates at RSCG last year. Our outlook for the quarter reflects the retail or RSCG product supply flows and related mix changes compared to last year and increased operation costs from the growth initiatives, along with higher overall company wide sales, marketing, and technology costs to drive longer-term growth across our segments towards our $1.5 billion annual GMV goal."
