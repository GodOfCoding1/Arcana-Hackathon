    "content": " Specifically comparing the segment results for this quarter to the same quarter last year, our GovDeals segment was up 52% on GMV and 13% on revenue, with the faster GMV growth reflecting the inclusion of bid for assets this year, which has lower average take rate on its higher value real estate asset sales. Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA was $11.9 million, down from the same quarter last year, reflecting increased operating expenses in sales and marketing and in our technology and business operations, which includes retail expansion of their distribution center network to accommodate demand for its more diversified client base. And breaking that down further, on the human capital side, we continue to build our domain expertise to understand the industry context and the specific assets that are being sold in industry verticals like real estate, energy supply chain, construction, transportation and that is your classic enterprise sales organization that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s creating awareness, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s able to connect our clients\u00e2\u0080\u0099 pain points with our solutions, help nudge people along the sort of digital-first solutions, get people out of, let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s say, an analog solution. I think that the infrastructure that we have today certainly could take us another $0.5 billion of sales, so let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s say, up to $2 billion of annual GMV, and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a function of us being very asset-light, by continuing to find those high-value asset categories to drive through the platform where we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have to take possession of those assets for use physical facilities."
