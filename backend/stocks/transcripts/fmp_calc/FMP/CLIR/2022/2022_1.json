    "content": " The risks and uncertainties associated with the forward-looking statements made in this conference call include, but are not limited to, whether field testing and sales of ClearSign's products will be successfully completed, whether ClearSign will be successful in expanding the market for its products and other risks that are described in ClearSign's public periodic filings with the SEC, including the discussion in the Risk Factors section of the 2020 annual report on Form 10-K. The consequence of this is, and the reason for the Department of Energy involvement is that when the fuel for refining operations transitions to hydrogen and action anticipated as part of the industry's CO2 reduction strategy without changes in burning capabilities, the NOx emissions will increase, exceeding current levels and if not controlled, will result in basically trading one problem that is CO2 emissions for a very significant other increased NOx, which environmental agencies have been working to decrease to safe levels for decades."
