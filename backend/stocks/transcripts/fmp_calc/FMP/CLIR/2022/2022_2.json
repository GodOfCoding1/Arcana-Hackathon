While we would certainly like to see an immediate short-term need for our technology and believe that we are ready, taking a long-term view of this gives us time to get more of an installed base in place and they like to give customers confidence to use our technology before many of them make decisions of what technology I \u00e2\u0080\u0093 basically, ClearSign or SCRs to install."
