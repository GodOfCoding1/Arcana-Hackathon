    "content": " Looking ahead, we are projecting digital to represent approximately 60% of our total retail sales by the end of full year '24 versus 33% of retail sales in 2019, almost doubling our digital penetration in only 5 years. In Q3, our mobile app accounted for 17% of our digital transactions versus only 12% in Q3 of 2021, fueled by an impressive 36% increase in mobile app users over last year, making the mobile app our fastest-growing digital channel. As we discussed in our Q2 call, lapping the impact of the enhanced child tax credits, which started last July, combined with the pent-up demand from last year's return to in-person learning impacted this year's key back-to-school selling season and the impact of permanent store closures representing approximately $14 million for the quarter. While our previous outlook had assumed a 600 basis point decrease in gross margin, we incurred an additional 300 basis point decline driven by higher transitory supply chain costs in the quarter, including higher container costs and air freight, which has peaked in the back half of 2022. Adjusted SG&A was $105 million versus $115 million last year and $117 million in 2019, and deleveraged 10 basis points to 20.7% of net sales compared to 20.6% of net sales last year. Adjusted operating income for the quarter was $59 million, a decrease of $58 million versus $117 million of operating income last year and deleveraged 930 basis points to 11.6% of net sales compared to 20.9% of net sales in Q3 2021 and decreased 50 basis points versus 12.1% of net sales in Q3 2019. We ended the quarter with 658 stores and total square footage of 3.1 million square feet, a decrease of 7% compared to Q3 2021 and 30% versus Q3 2019."
