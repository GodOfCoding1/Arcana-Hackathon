    "content": " Taking in account the timing of first half execution as well as second half projects, we expect 2023 actions to result in another $10-plus million of synergy flow through this year, bringing our incremental realization to the $25 million level in 2023. While we ordinarily would not comment on analyst estimates, in these circumstances we think it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fair to say that the full year 2023 consensus EBITDA estimate of nearly $390 million appears reasonable. Second, we believe adding the $25 million of incremental synergy realizations to our $370 million of combined EBITDA in 2022 gives a reasonable baseline for 2023 with a range of outcomes depending on how macro factors and first half de-stocking impacts total demand for the year. And in my comments I mentioned that we would expect when we look at some of the different buckets that the order of magnitude of input costs year-over-year, when you sort of think about energy, some of the pulp, particularly in the front half, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to be an order of magnitude of about $100 million."
