    "content": " While price increases began to exceed input costs during this first quarter, as expected, we gained a lot of ground in the second quarter and are well on our way to achieving our $25 million price cost improvement target previously communicated for Neenah. Given the significant upcoming improvements in trailing 12 month EBITDA for both legacy businesses as lower profit quarters from the second half of 2021 roll out of the calculations, we expect a natural de-levering to 3.75 times or below by year end and believe that net leverage will trend below 3.5 times in 2023 and within our target net leverage range of 2.5 times to 3.5 times. And I would think about that primarily in our Engineered Papers business, our Paper and Packaging business, Filtration, particularly water and industrial, and then in our Print Solutions business, where we're seeing maybe a little less strength in some pockets in industrials and health care, but still stronger demand than prior year in most cases."
