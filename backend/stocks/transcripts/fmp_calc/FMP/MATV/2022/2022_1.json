    "content": " Recall that in the first quarter last year, we delivered 15% organic sales growth, as many end markets surged back with post-COVID recovery sales with only minimal signs of the supply chain disruptions that would accelerate throughout the year. While margins were down versus the prior year quarter, we saw strong sequential improvement from the fourth quarter, up 540 basis points and expect sequential improvements to continue in the upcoming quarters, with significant year-over-year margin expansion anticipated in the second half of the year as comparisons ease and normalize. Given first quarter results, continued price increases already put in place for 2022 and solid demand fundamentals we are reaffirming our 2022 financial guidance for adjusted EPS of $3.50 to $3.95, and adjusted EBITDA growth of 20% to 30%. Echoing our comments from the fourth quarter call, from a quarterly view, we continue to expect adjusted EPS to average approximately $1 per share in the second through fourth quarters, which would put full-year adjusted EPS toward the high end of our guided range."
