    "content": " Second, adjusted operating profits were up nearly 25% on a comparable basis, which we view as a very strong result and indicative of significantly improved fundamentals compared to last year, especially with respect to improved price cost recovery. While we are pleased with several strong trends in the business such as 12% organic sales growth on a constant currency basis and operating profit growth of almost 25%, as the third quarter progressed we saw increasing signs of our macro demand slowdown."
