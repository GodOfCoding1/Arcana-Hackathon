    "content": " Our overall financial results were in line with guidance as we achieved fourth quarter net sales of $120 million, down from last year\u2019s all-time record high, but 41% up versus 2 years ago, excluding Octane. Churn in membership growth was also a bright spot as we significantly eclipsed our fiscal \u201822 year-end goal, delivering 325,000 JRNY members, exceeding our goal of 250,000 by fully 30%. Today, I\u2019ll be speaking to total company results for Q4 and will provide guidance for fiscal year \u201823. Given the unique nature of last year\u2019s results, we will talk about sales growth versus last year fiscal year \u201821 and versus last, last year fiscal year 2020 to gauge our growth and overall company improvements when compared to more normalized results. For fiscal \u201823, we expect to return to a more typical pre-pandemic seasonality, with the second half of the year contributing more of the full year\u2019s revenue. As we started doing in the back half of fiscal year \u201822, we will be comparing our sales to the same period in fiscal year \u201820, as we believe comparing to the last pre-pandemic year allows us to better gauge our growth and progress. Given lower top line and deleveraging of fixed costs, we expect Q1 fiscal year \u201823 adjusted EBITDA loss of between minus $22 million and minus $27 million. We expect lower inbound freight as we\u2019ve negotiated new rates that while higher than pre-pandemic are much lower than the spot market rates last year, lower detention and demurrage fees as we\u2019ve digested the inventory we purchased last year."
