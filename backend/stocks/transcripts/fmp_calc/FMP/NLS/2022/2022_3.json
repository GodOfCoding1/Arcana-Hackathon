    "content": " In the third fiscal quarter of 2022, net sales were $147 million, which represents 63% growth versus two years ago, excluding Octane. We're pleased to report that for the first nine months of 2022, net sales were $470 million, a 7% increase over the same period last year, and 144% increase compared to the same period two years ago, excluding Octane. As discussed previously, we delivered the two highest sales quarters in our company's history in the back half of fiscal year '21, fueled in part by pandemic-driven demand. The company now expects total company Net sales in the second half of this fiscal year to be between $260 million and $280 million, an increase of 31% to 41% versus the same period two years ago. Please proceed with your question. Please proceed with your question. And then on the discounting side, I appreciate the commentary year-over-year, but can you talk about the December quarter, how it looked relative to maybe December of 2019, if there's any comparisons there, and how that comparable period would look so far during New Year's resolution time frame relative to the pre -COVID early 2020 time frame. When you compare to two years ago, so that would be the December '19 quarter, it's an interesting comparison because the company was in a much different place, but I would say that we intentionally chose to be very supportive of our retailers to allow them to clear their inventory in content with how we are clearing and on direct because we wanted to make sure that we entered the first half of fiscal year '23 with cleaner inventory. Please proceed with your question. Please proceed with your question. Please proceed with your question."
