    "content": " As proof points for this, this quarter, despite the challenged top line, we grew JRNY members and manage down our inventory on plan, significantly improved our gross margins and reduced our operating expenses, delivering a significant beat to analysts adjusted EBITDA consensus. Driven by key actions we took earlier this year to lower supply chain costs, we improved gross margins by 480 basis points sequentially from the first quarter, and we expect continued improvement in the back half of the year and into fiscal 2024. Net sales for the second quarter were $65 million, down 53% versus last year and up 24% versus the same quarter in fiscal year '20 excluding Octane. Gross profit was $11 million and gross margins were 18%, down 13 points from LY, but up sequentially, nearly 5 points to last quarter. Adjusted operating expenses were $25 million, down 35% versus last year. Adjusted operating expenses excluding advertising were $22 million, down 15% versus last year even with continued investments in JRNY. Net sales were $120 million, down 63% versus last year and up 17% versus the same period in fiscal year '20, excluding Octane. Gross profit was $18 million and gross margins were 15%, down 15 points versus last year. Selling and marketing expenses were down 48% or $21 million, driven by lower ad spend, which was $9 million this first half versus $24 million last year. Adjusted operating expenses excluding advertising were $47 million, down 10% versus last year  of continued investments in JRNY. Per our plan, quarter ending inventory was $99 million, down 39% versus last year and down 11% versus year end. Given the adjustment to our full year revenue expectations, we are now guiding to full year adjusted EBITDA loss of between minus $30 million to minus $40 million, which implies the second half adjusted EBITDA of breakeven to a loss of $10 million."
