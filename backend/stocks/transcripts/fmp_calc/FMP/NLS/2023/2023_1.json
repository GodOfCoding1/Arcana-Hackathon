    "content": " Given the strength of our operating capabilities, our increasing understanding of consumer post-pandemic demand and our balance sheet, we continue to expect positive adjusted EBITDA in the back half of fiscal 2023 and are reiterating our full year revenue, EBITDA and JRNY member growth guidance. Given the unique nature of last year's results, we will be comparing this year's results versus last year fiscal year 2022 and also versus fiscal year 2020, to gauge our sales growth and overall company improvements when compared to more normalized pre-pandemic results. Net sales for the first quarter were $55 million, down 70% versus last year and up 11% versus the same quarter in 2020 excluding Octane. We are expecting the start of gross margin recovery in the second half and expect gross margins to be in the range of 27% to 30%, driven by key actions we've already taken to lower cost in logistics, which include lower inbound freight as we've negotiated new rates that are much lower than the spot market rates last year. Then product cost, the actual cost of the high-performing SKUs that we're bringing in, we've negotiated lower costs and commodity and FX prices are moving our way versus last year."
