    "content": " We continue to improve our inventory position per our plan, inventory was $77 million at the end of Q3, fiscal 2023 down 40% versus Q3 last fiscal year. Net sales for the third quarter were $98 million, down 33% versus last year and up 9% versus the same quarter in fiscal year 2020, excluding Octane. Adjusted operating expenses, excluding advertising were $23 million down 13% versus last year even with continued investments in JRNY, which dollar spent was down slightly versus last year. Cash was $17 million, per our plan quarter ending inventory was $77 million down 40% versus last year and down 30% versus year end fiscal 2022. So a lot of what happened to us starting in latter part of fiscal year 2022 with all those supply chain market issues like high inbound freight costs, the detention and demerged costs that we talked about, that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve now lapped and are no longer in there, our standard costs are much lower than they were, and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s really going to drive margin expansion."
