    "content": " It's quiet because there are no school activities conducted during the summer months of July and August, meaning two-third of the three months period, the company will have no revenue recognition, resulting from the payments, our revenue only grew modestly compared with September revenue recognition of last year. As mentioned during September's half year earnings release, our newly admitted students included more self-funded students rather than government funded students, reflecting our great education quality and strong brand recognition also means that more of our income will come directly from our customers rather than getting the income from the government. For the nine months ended September, revenue from customers were RMB238.3 million, a decrease of 1.6% from RMB242.1 million for the nine months ended last September. Revenue from government cooperative agreements were RMB36 million, an increase of 17.3% from RMB30.7 million for the nine months ended September last year. Gross profit was RMB124.7 million, an increase of RMB28.1 million from RMB97.3 million for the nine months ended last year, September 30. For the entire fiscal year of 2022, the company does not change our outlook and expects a total revenue of continuing operation to be between RMB440 million to RMB460 million, representing a 10% to 15% increase on a year-over-year basis."
