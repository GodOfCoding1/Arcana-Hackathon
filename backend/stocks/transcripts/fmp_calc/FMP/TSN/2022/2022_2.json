    "content": " Overall, our operating income performance translated to $2.29 in earnings per share for the second quarter, up 71% and $5.16 in earnings per share for the first half of 57%. This will be important to ensuring we deliver sequential improvement in our operating margins in the second half of fiscal year '22, especially with continued increases in key input costs such as labor and feed ingredients. In the second quarter, improvements in sales through the foodservice channel drove an increase of $684 million, and domestic export sales to international markets were $311 million stronger than the prior year period as we leveraged our global scale to grow our business. Second quarter adjusted operating income of $1.2 billion was up 57% relative to the same quarter last year, led by increases in Chicken, Beef and Prepared Foods. Driven by the strong increase in operating income, second quarter adjusted EPS of $2.29 grew 71% compared to the same period last year. Segment sales were approximately $5 billion for the second quarter, up 24% versus the same period last year. Operating margins for the segment were 11% or $263 million for the quarter, up 21% versus the same quarter last year. Chicken delivered adjusted operating income of $203 million in the second quarter of fiscal '22, representing an operating margin of 5%. Operating income increased in the second quarter due to increased sales volume and higher average sales prices, partially offset by the impacts of inflationary market conditions, including increased supply chain costs and a challenging labor environment. And so you'll continue to see a focus on that holistically for us across the business as we continue to improve labor, as we continue to expand our capacity, as we continue to invest in our portfolio and our leading brands and expect to deliver 8% to 10% ROS for the year."
