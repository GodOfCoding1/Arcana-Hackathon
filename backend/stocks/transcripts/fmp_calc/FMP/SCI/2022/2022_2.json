    "content": " So, for this quarter, though, versus second quarter last year, our cash flow was reflective of the $18 million decline in operating income, which excludes gains on divestitures $15 million of higher interest in cash taxes, as well as about $17 million or so of an increase use of working capital. One unique thing I noticed about this quarter and it's so immaterial for us compared to others, but I thought about it, as I looked at Colgate and Procter & Gamble, we're seeing, believe it or not, even through Canada, because of the strong dollar, the Canadian dollar conversions probably a bigger impact on us than -- or as big an impact as cremation mix when you think about average."
