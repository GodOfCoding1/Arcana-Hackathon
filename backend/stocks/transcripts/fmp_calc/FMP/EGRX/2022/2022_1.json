    "content": " We are delighted to share that the early momentum we saw at the beginning of 2022 continues to build, reflecting strong initial sales of $34 million for vasopressin and $37 million for PEMFEXY during the quarter. We had the great quarter we anticipated with non-GAAP earnings of $4.04 per share and over $50 million of net income after tax on a non-GAAP basis, well on our way to the best year in our company's history. In the first quarter of 2022, total revenue was $115.9 million compared to $41.2 million in Q1 of 2021, primarily reflecting the strong launches of vasopressin and PEMFEXY. On the expense front, R&D expenses were $6.1 million for the first quarter of 2022 compared to $14.3 million in the prior year quarter. Excluding stock-based compensation and other noncash and nonrecurring items, first quarter 2022 R&D expense was $5.4 million. Excluding stock-based compensation and other noncash and nonrecurring items, first quarter 2022 SG&A expense was $16.6 million. In the first quarter of 2022, we repurchased an additional $8.1 million of Eagle's common stock as part of our $160 million share repurchase program. And so at the market where it is, we'd much rather -- since we've never used debt before really, we have what, this $24 million of debt, and you look at our new EBITDA levels, there's no reason that we shouldn't build shareholder value by taking the cash we have, the cash we're building, and take on some reasonable debt."
