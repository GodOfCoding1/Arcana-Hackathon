    "content": " Together with BARHEMSYS and BYFAVO, this would give us three newly approved NCEs with strong patent life going into their growth stage, with projections of peak sales, just shy of $400 million. In the second quarter of 2022, total revenue was $74.1 million compared to $48.1 million in 2Q of 2021, primarily reflecting continued revenue from sales of vasopressin and PEMFEXY. BELRAPZO product sales were $8.1 million in the second quarter of 2022, compared to $7.6 million in Q2 of 2021. On the expense front, R&D expenses were $11.4 million for the second quarter of 2022, compared to $9.9 million in the prior year quarter. Excluding stock-based compensation and other non-cash and nonrecurring items, second quarter 2022 non-GAAP R&D expense was $10.8 million. Excluding stock-based compensation and other non-cash and non-recurring items, the second quarter 2022 non-GAAP SG&A expense was a $15.2 million. Net loss for the second quarter of 2022 was $9.5 million or $0.74 per basic and diluted shares, compared to net income of $3.6 million or $0.28 per basic and $0.27 per diluted share in the prior year period. We're going to have to see, but as we mentioned the expectation is those two products will reach $275 million at peak sales, which is tremendous for our size, tremendous for the company."
