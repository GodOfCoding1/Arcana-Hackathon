    "content": " As mentioned, we have a company whose revenue, earnings and cash flow are strong and at the same time, we're able to invest heavily in our pipeline, a pipeline that has so much potential to contribute meaningfully to the options available to acute care and other physicians treating critically ill patients and/or perioperative patients as well as to diversify Eagle's revenue stream. In the third quarter of 2022, total revenues was $65.9 million compared to $39.9 million in Q3 of 2021, primarily reflecting continued revenue from sales of vasopressin and PEMFEXY as well as the addition of BARHEMSYS and BYFAVO to our commercial portfolio."
