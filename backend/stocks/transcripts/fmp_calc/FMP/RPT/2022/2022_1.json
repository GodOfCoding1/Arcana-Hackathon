    "content": " I want to end my opening remarks on investments where we continue to flex the power of our grocery-anchored net lease and wholly-owned investment platforms as evidenced by our increased 2022 acquisition guidance to $225 million, up $100 million from last quarter. Finally, our net lease platform closed on the acquisition of two single tenant properties from two of RPT\u2019s shopping centers during the quarter for $11.6 million. As Brian mentioned, we signed 82 leases totaling 716,000 square feet, driving our signed not commenced balance, including leases in negotiations, to $10.3 million with a weighted average ABR per square foot of over $18, representing a 15% increase over our portfolio average. Regarding debt activities, through our grocery-anchored JV, we obtained a commitment on a mortgage at our Dedham shopping center in Boston, totaling $53 million or $27 million at our share, with a 10-year term and a fixed interest rate of 3.35%. We\u2019ve talked a lot about in our disclosure last night and a bit in our prepared remarks that we do have $10.3 million of signed not commenced, which does include some leases in negotiation, and that\u2019s going to come online over the next 3 years, really about $0.11 of operating FFO. So we\u2019re going to have a modest maybe impact to interest rates to that $60 million that will run naked in \u201823, but maybe $0.005 at most, given where that rate is at today, which is about 3%. And forgive me if I missed this, but the cadence of that $0.11 \u2013 sorry, the $7.5 million, including the SNO rents, I guess what\u2019s under advanced negotiation, the split between this year and next year or maybe a quarterly cadence of how we should think about you achieving that $0.11 of potential FFO?"
