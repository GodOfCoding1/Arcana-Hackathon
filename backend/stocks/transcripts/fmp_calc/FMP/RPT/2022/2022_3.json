    "content": " Turning to our value-enhancing remerchandising, redevelopment and outlet expansion pipeline, today, we have roughly 14 active projects totaling $57 million that are expected to generate a weighted average return on cost of about 10%. At the end of the quarter, we had three leases with Regal that are paying us $25 per square foot and account for 2.4% of ABR. Including our SNO balance of $14 million, this week's revolver pay down of $80 million and undrawn forward equity of $16 million, our net debt to adjusted EBITDA would be 6.0 times. The robust leasing activity drove our signed not commenced balance to $14 million, an increase of $5.2 million or 60% over last quarter. If you layer on that implied fourth quarter run rate of about 23%, that puts you right at $1 and that's a good place to start. I mean, today, we're 94% leased, and we think we can get this portfolio to 95%, 96%, which represents another couple of percent of leasing, which is about $4 million to $5 million. But really, it's a small shop, and today, we leased it at 87.2%, and just too kind of give you some math on what that opportunity looks like, for every 1% increase in that rate equates to about $875,000 in rent, which is about $0.01."
