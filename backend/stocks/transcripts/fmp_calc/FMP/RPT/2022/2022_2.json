    "content": " This quarter, we signed 26 new small shop leases with strong national tenants like Chase Bank, Fifth Third Bank, Massage Envy at an average ABR per square foot of $31.92, which is 27% above our in-place small shop average. We signed about 293,000 square feet during the quarter, resulting in a leased rate of 93.3%, up 10 basis points sequentially; and backstop by a robust sign-not-commenced and leases in advanced negotiation backlog balance of $10.3 million or $0.11 of operating FFO per share, which is a long tail commence through 2025. Given our long-term embedded mark-to-market opportunity, coupled with the age of our portfolio of over 30 years, we also continue to drive rent with our 42nd consecutive quarter of positive rent growth with our blended spreads coming in at 14% for the quarter. During the quarter, we took back a couple of spaces: one, a long-term struggling tenant at one of our assets in Florida that is very well located in a center that we want to upgrade to with a better grocer; and the other one was in connection with our redevelopment project at our Crossroads asset in Florida as well where we demoed a Publix, and we're in the process of rebuilding that into a Publix flagship store, which will open, I believe, in the second quarter of next year."
