So in terms of advanced display, we are looking at the 2021, I think our revenue was $80 million, 2022, actually last quarter, we ended the last quarter at $90 million. Please proceed with your questions. But I think for FY 2023, we're looking at probably a little bit north of $10 million for AJA, but we will not have AJA for the entire fiscal year as Fusen mentioned, we probably just only have it for the second half. Please proceed with your questions."
