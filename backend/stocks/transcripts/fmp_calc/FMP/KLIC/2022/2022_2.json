With the $1.58 billion number for this year, I\u2019m just kind of curious at what point do you think some of these, growth initiatives like the auto advanced display et cetera will start offsetting your legacy wire bond or is that like the way down the road? As you know ball bonder actually is a big business and used to be very cyclical, but in our, in my view, actually I think what we try to do is make sure the ball bonder, we have leadership position and also ensure ball bonder grow on top of a new initiative we have. And so I think ball bonder demand will continue to grow actually because of in addition to yearly semiconductor unit growths, and we see the global ball bonder continue to find new application to grow. I think the cycle will take longer right now, because industry is more mature and the ball bonder start to still continue other than you need growth, you know, need additional capacity, also have additional growth in the area like I mentioned, the multi-die and also requirement and also other application in a memory. Your line is now live. Your line is now live."
