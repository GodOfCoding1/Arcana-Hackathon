    "content": " Fusen Chen, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Lester Wong, Chief Financial Officer are both also joining on today's call. For those of you who have not received a copy of today's results, the release, as well as our supplemental earnings presentation, are both available in the Investor Relations section of our website at investor.kns.com. In addition to historical statements, today's remarks will contain statements relating to future events and our future results. For a complete discussion of the risks associated with Kulicke & Soffa, that could affect our future results and financial condition, please refer to our recent SEC filings, specifically the 10-K for the year ended October 2, 2021, and the 8-K filed yesterday. With that said, I would now like to turn the call over to Fusen Chen for the business overview. Today I would like to provide an update on the progress and status of our key growth initiatives around advanced packaging, advanced display, electronics assembly and automotive. Before discussing these growth specific opportunities, I wanted to step back and discuss the broader macro and industry environment. As we have discussed last quarter, the industry continues to be constrained by supply-chain challenges, largely around wafer capacity, which softens the near-term rate of semiconductor assembly expansion. In addition to these known industry challenges, which we have explained on previous calls, we also face an increasingly dynamic macro environment. Regional COVID lockdowns and logistical challenges are continuing, broader inflation, consumer confidence trends and wafer fabrication equipment forecasts are now also impacting our near-term outlook. Although not unique to K&S, consumption of consumer goods, such as smartphones, PCs, and general electronics play a significant role in impacting semiconductor growth rates in the near-term. While we do not yet have clear visibility into fiscal 2023, we intend on providing additional details and a longer-term outlook during our upcoming November earnings call. However, during today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s call, Lester will provide additional commentary that highlights our cash-flow and profitability improvements over the past few years and expectations over the coming quarters. At this point, I would like to provide an update to our strategic execution and progress supporting the broader trends in advanced packaging, advanced display, electronics assembly and automotive. At a high-level, our global research, development, procurement, and business teams continue to be very engaged supporting several exciting opportunities with top customers. Within advanced packaging, our dedicated solutions are currently running 35% higher for FY 2022 than expectations during our Investor Day. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m pleased to announce we have secured purchase orders totaling approximately $80 million, with delivery dates over the coming 18 months. And it is important to note that our leading thermocompression solutions are being adopted by a broad set of customers including integrated device manufacturers, OSATs and also OEMs. As explained in detail last quarters, market opportunities go beyond next-generation heterogeneous applications. Thermocompression is also being adopted in key markets such as mobile sensing, mobile application processors, and silicon photonics. Additionally, a material portion of our high-volume assembly solutions are also benefiting from broadening adoption of Multi-Chip modules and system-in-package applications. These applications, which provide greater transistor density at the package level, are increasing the capital intensity of assembly, positively impacting long-term growth rates of the ball, wedge and APS businesses. As a reminder, ball and wedge bonding continue to represent nearly 80% of total semiconductor packages and offer compelling production benefits that support the increasing value of the assembly process. We have clear leadership positions across these sizeable, growing markets, especially within the most complex applications. Ultimately, this growing capital intensity has added a new layer of technology-driven growth and also increases the need for new product features and capabilities which will continue to enhance profitability. Our progress, strategy, and ability to enhance gross margins, highlights our value contribution within this evolving semiconductor market. Next, I wanted to also provide an update to our growing opportunities within the emerging advanced display market. Since 2017, we have developed enabling innovations which extend the power efficiency, performance, and manufacturing costs of these key emerging display technologies. Advanced display is a meaningful, high growth market opportunity where we continue to be very engaged with several key customers and continue to pursue a multi-pronged approach, supporting new applications within backlighting but also within the direct view and micro-LED opportunity. We continue to expand our advanced display installed base, pursue multiple LUMINEX engagements while making ongoing progress across several customer development initiatives. Ongoing customer engagements, qualifications and acceptance remain our key priority areas over the coming 12 months. In addition to intimate involvement in these long-term technology transitions which expand our semiconductor and display opportunities, we are also extending our presence in both the electronics assembly and automotive markets. Turning to electronics assembly, our largest total addressable market opportunity, our competitive solutions currently support high-reliability automotive, system-in-package and memory applications well although represent only a small portion of the total addressable market. This creates a fairly significant prospective market opportunity, which we have been pursuing through development of a disruptive SMT systems which is expected to ramp towards the end of fiscal 2023 and will accelerate share gains over the coming years. Finally, within automotive, we continue to expand our solutions supporting the electric and autonomous vehicle transitions across our growing base of OEM customers. K&S has a long-established position within several automotive markets and we remain very involved in this exciting, long-term market evolution. The auto transitions driving electric and autonomous adoption are demanding more power control, power distribution and power storage applications which directly benefit our competitive wedge, electronics assembly, and battery assembly solutions. Turning to the June Quarter business results, we generated revenue of $372.1 million and non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.09. General semiconductor increased roughly 12% sequentially, due to strength in ball and wedge applications. Also, demand strengthened sequentially for our dedicated advanced packaging solutions including thermocompression, wafer level bonding and lithography systems. Within LED, similar to last quarter, over 80% of LED sales supported our growing advanced display opportunities. At this point, we are comfortably within our full-year expectations on advanced display contribution and look forward to growing this business over the coming years. Finally, memory came in strong for our core NAND-based solutions which we support across all major memory customers. In summary, our progress on new growth initiatives and customer engagements remains on track and provides upside to our long-term financial targets. As stated earlier, there are additional macro and industry risks we did not previously anticipate and expect to provide greater detail to our outlook over the coming quarters. Our ability to succeed in development and customer engagements near-term will enhance our visibility into fiscal 2023, while providing upside potential to our existing long-term financial targets. As Fusen mentioned, we continue to remain very focused on mid and long-term growth prospects by executing on our internal development goals, maintaining our pace of customer development engagements while actively returning value directly to shareholders through our growing dividend and aggressive repurchase programs. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also very important to remind callers today, that our financial performance has already improved dramatically due to several technology changes which reduce our reliance on annual capacity expansion. During the June quarter, we generated revenues of $372.1 million and very strong gross margins of 51.2%, up by over 500 basis points, year-on-year. This strong gross margin performance highlights our consistent operational efficiency and improving product mix, and also highlights our incremental value-add to the industry. Tax expense for the quarter came in at $5.2 million, significantly better than expectations. Non-GAAP net income for the June quarter was $125.1 million, representing a very strong non-GAAP net margin of 33.6% and non-GAAP EPS of $2.09. Over the past four quarters, we have generated $380 million of free-cash flow, highlighting our longer-term potential. During the June quarter alone, we generated free cash flow of $99.7 million and closed the quarter with a net cash balance of $471.7 million. During the recent March quarter, we announced the accelerated repurchase program and deployed $146.2 million in repurchases. We deployed a total of $61.9 million, to both programs in the June quarter. At the end of the June quarter, we had just over $300 million remaining under our repurchase authorization and continue to manage an active, price-dependent, open-market approach. For the September quarter, in line with Fusen's comments regarding softening macro and industry environments, we anticipate revenue of approximately 280 million plus or minus $20 million. Gross margins are expected to reduce to 47% plus or minus 50 basis points, due to additional expediting fees, near-term facility re-sizing effects and also higher than expected inflation. Non-GAAP operating expense is anticipated to be approximately 70 million, plus or minus 2% and non-GAAP EPS to be $0.93, plus or minus 10%. While we do not yet have comprehensive visibility into fiscal year 2023, we expect the September quarter guide should be comparable to our average quarterly run rate through fiscal 2023. As a comparison, this would represent approximately 7.5 times the non-GAAP EPS generated during fiscal year 2019. As the industry recovers and we expand our served available market beyond fiscal 2023, we expect to exceed our recent fiscal 2021 and 2022 performance. It remains a very exciting time for the company as we have significantly broadened our market access and remain intimately involved with fundamental technology changes across the semiconductor, advanced display, electronics assembly, and automotive markets. While there are some near-term challenges due to the macroeconomic environment, we strongly believe we are well positioned to take advantage of major technology changes which will start to pay dividends in the second half of fiscal 2023 and beyond. What I said was, as Fusen indicated, Krish, given the volatility uncertainty into the market right now, we are not in a position to FY '23 will provide more details on November call. What I did say is that if FY '23 was at the same run rate as Q4, we would generate EPS of $3.50, which shows the company is actually very profitable even at a lower revenue level, much more profitable than the last down cycle. I just wanted to check, you guys highlighted the decrease is due to macro concerns BE Semiconductor highlighted that some of the Chinese costs are also slowing. On top of that, I think the China LED also slowing. So -- if the weakness, I think, in this area and the capacity dilution period of time for us, we are seeing maybe about 2 quarters. Beyond that, we are quite optimistic about the strength coming back second half of '23. And in the meantime, we also anticipate to generate a strong cash flow even together with this very short period of southern periods. It's 52%, same as the previous quarter. Well, Krish, I actually -- we actually don't think backlog is a very good indicator for our investors in terms of looking forward in terms of different for, particularly now that we give long-term guidance. We also have POs, obviously, that do not have a specific delivery date, which we don't put into backlog. And in any event, for the backlog, the backlog has been pretty consistent in terms of the variation over the last quarters or so, each quarter-on-quarter has probably reduced about 10%. So again, we don't think backlog is a great indicator and that's why we didn't include any more. I think also the final point is that, as you know, Krish, a lot of our U.S. listed peers don't use provide backlog information they only do it during the annual report on the K level. So actually, I don't think is a seasonality issue. And second half, we expect in the market should pick up globally for the whole industry. We had higher contribution from our advanced packaging business unit as well as our Wedge Bond business unit, which did very well during that quarter. We had the machine that the one fail, which was -- came in a very high margin because it's been expensed before. Did I hear -- you think it's going to last about 2 quarters and second half of your fiscal or calendar '23, you think the demand is going to pick up. And also tying to the same question, I think in September last year, you were expecting $1.5 billion average revenue through 2024-2025, I kind of forgot, but what is 2023 shaping up relative to that $1.5 billion average revenue guide? So Charles, I think I remember in the Investor Day, that's what we say. I think our 2020 revenue was $632 million, if I remember correct. '21, I think is in the middle of Investor Day, we didn't finish that yet. But I say it's $1.52 billion and we did say '22, we feel like will be as good, as good that means it's also to $1.5 billion. So at this moment, I think we see actually macro slowdown and inventory correction and the capacity digestion and so this will last maybe 2 to 3 quarters. So with this unexpected phenomena, we do expect right now first half maybe it will be lower and a pickup in the second half. But we do believe with '24, we are looking for very, very strong '24 with a lot of new products and even at this moment, if there's a correction happened, I think '24 even will push even higher for the core business. The next few years, '21 is $1.5 billion, '22 is $1.5 billion, in the next couple of years. I understand that for your wire bonder business, maybe the visibility is a little bit not as great as, let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s say, 3 to 6 months ago because of macro. The advanced display side, I would assume that there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s things that are more under control because you have a lead in that market, and you probably \u00e2\u0080\u0093 your customers are probably engaging with you over longer term. So up to date, I think cumulatively, we generated over $200 million in advanced display. And this is including FY \u00e2\u0080\u009822, we expect the revenue for advanced display is going to be higher than $90 million. And because of qualification, we will add not hiring business, but we do expect in \u00e2\u0080\u009823 over $100 million of sales as we continue to drive Luminex qualification for advanced display revenue through \u00e2\u0080\u009823. The second question is OLED compared to micro LED or mini LED, I can tell you, think a lot of people try to make a micro LED and mini LED work and with a lot of effort from throughout the whole industry than \u00e2\u0080\u0093 the reason is that there are a lot of LCD capacity is a layer. And the growth rate, I think, year-by-year by analysts, I think, is really show significant growth. Customer can at a certain point, actually have a dual strategy, but I can tell you all the customers we are working on have a very, very strong commitment. So Christian, I think we are really confident on the long-term growth prospect for the whole industry. And compared to $1.5 billion EBIT, we think you pick up free long rate of course, it's not going to be flat. And if you use the number, we just guide and the long 4 quarters, is, of course, will be between $1 billion to $1.5 billion, right? So that's what we see and try to be realistic, I think 1.5% probably will be difficult. But we do believe our second half will pick up, and we will still generate very healthy cash flow for the company and the investor. So Christian, utilization right now is running pretty flat around 80%, but then you do have pockets, both in terms of end markets obviously, automotive is strong end market and also in terms of regionally, I think China, because of the rolling Covet issues are a little bit lower. As far as what we need it to be, I think historically, if it's above 80% and the mid-80s, I think that was when basically there's capacity expansion. So right now, I think everyone is trying to figure out exactly how the next couple of quarters are going to play out. But we do believe, as Fusen said, the second half of FY '22 will be much stronger. So Dave, I think we have -- we indicated we have about $309 million left at the end of the quarter in our authorization. But I think going forward, we will continue to utilize our OMR program. The guidance you gave for the September quarter, what would you guess would be the cash flow from operations based on that guidance. And then, Fusen, you gave us a lot of detail about, I think, the ramp-up in the thermal compression bond business. So actually, we are quite proud and also show a lot of confidence on this product. I think in the next few years, we will see a significant growth. And the $80 million we mentioned and it's not only PO, it's appeal with the delivery there and continue to grow. Of course, smaller than 20-micron pitch, there will be somewhat niche product architectures and also other technology, but we are quite bullish. I think for the heterogeneity integration for the next many, many years. So this quarter alone, we're talking about dedicated I think different companies have different definition of advanced packaging. But all dedicated advanced packaging, we're talking about our TCB, like some compression and we also have a high accuracy free chip. This time, we didn't talk about it, but it's picking up momentum, maybe we'll update for the next couple of quarters. I think I mentioned in my script, we're talking about the vertical were to replace TV for the next couple of years, and this is like AT Premier frame. All this together, I think this quarter, we are $64.9 million. It did not include ICO advance bond, including advanced wonder, I think is about $130 million for this quarter. Mainly, I think is really bull bonder. And if you hear the script I mentioned, I think every year right now is about 1 trillion finished die, finished wafer and you cut it about 1 trillion die and need to have a package. The packaging measure, I think majority actually is a ball bonder. So actually, which bonder actually is very, very strong because we actually will continue to be strong. So to answer your question, I think it's very easy. During the capacity titration period, I think bonds impacted. And we see the ball bonder -- if you don't -- if you look at every cycle, we do believe every cycle ball bonder will continue to grow. And we see the early adoption, lower volume production maybe in 2023. And also, I think 5G, there's a lot of multiple bandwidths even have ball bonder to create a fitch in isolation to prevent the interference of next die, right. So more longer, I think next week -- next quarter, maybe a 2, 3 quarter will be lower. But when it's a pickup, it will also pick up very, very fast. Just curious, you talked about a 2-quarter inventory correction or 2 quarters of weakness. And of course, we also reached out to our customers. I think just China alone, they are mainly -- I actually don't have the number. And also, historically, we see the weakness of the ball bonder is no more than for headquarters. And if you see, I think I actually reach our pick probably 2 quarters ago when we reached $480 million. One quarter, we reached about $420 million. And actually, after that, ball bonder start to drop a little bit. For the quarter for FY '22, I think we think it's about 10%-unit growth for the year. I think for '23, based on what we see and based on industry experts, I think it will be close to normalized level is about 6.5%-unit growth. And then for the Automotive segment, so during the quarter, why the revenue coming down a little bit -- because I think across the industry, the automotive has been pretty strong. And then I mean it's very strong across the supply chain, either is a semi company or equipment guy. Well, I think we came down just a little bit in the 1 segment, Hans. I think we had a very strong automotive business from our wedge bonder business, as Fusen said, and still continues to be strong. I think for the ball bonder of the automotive business, there's been some -- a little bit of shifting maybe into the next quarter. I think it's just soft, maybe it came down a little bit. So we are actually engaging close to more than 10 high-potential customers, and we ship out our few system and diner clarification. So our goal actually in the next 9 months, 2 or 3 months, we want to make sure we have a few set we hope to finish our qualification. And if you know to move the display big spread from 1 place to the other place, you need to move about 25 million. So we are quite optimistic about the progress, and we'd like to finish the qualification in the next 9 to 12 months. So if we do a 2023, the whole advanced display business since we introduced this segment of business after 2030, it will be more than $300 million. So 2022, okay, 2022 actually is about $19 million. So up to date, it's $200 million, including the '22 and '22 is we target greater than $90 million. And so about $200 million to days and a cumulative including \u00e2\u0080\u009823, we should be above $300 million. In 2024, we believe our advanced display will even grow is a higher rate."
