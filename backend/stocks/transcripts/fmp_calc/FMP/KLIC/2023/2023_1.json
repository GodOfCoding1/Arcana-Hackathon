    "content": " So, overall, I think that at this moment we are comfortable at the consensus revenue of $840 million, due to China COVID situation that really have some softness in our \u00e2\u0080\u009923, but it could impact us in Q2, and we expect maybe extend a little bit longer into Q3. So the book-to-bill for the last couple of quarters have been about 0.8 right, now it's gone up to about 1.3, and I think it's a lot of our backlog actually is in ball bonder and most of it will be recognized within FY \u00e2\u0080\u009823, close to 60% of it will be recognized FY \u00e2\u0080\u009823. I'm thinking if you're sticking to let's say $850 million for the full-year, let's say the June quarter maybe you're getting $200 million. Okay, so David, I think, if you remember I think Q3 \u00e2\u0080\u009822 we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re talking about we have big lot of $80 million, so this $80 million majority of this $80 million will be shipped within the \u00e2\u0080\u009823 and last quarter Q4 over \u00e2\u0080\u009923, we mentioned that we identify for the next couple of years, we probably have opportunity until we move into TCB."
