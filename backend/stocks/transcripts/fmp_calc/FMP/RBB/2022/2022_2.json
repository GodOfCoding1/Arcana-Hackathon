    "content": " Despite elevated expenses, net income increased by 5.9% from last quarter and by 15.7% from the last year to $15.5 million or $0.80 per diluted share in the second quarter. Net income benefited from solid loan growth, increasing asset yields and a stable interest expense, all of which combined to drive record net interest income of 37.1 million, which was a 2.6 million increase from last quarter and a $7 million increase from a year ago. Second quarter non-interest income increased by sub $478,000 from the previous quarter due to a $757,000 gain on a corporate real estate that was disposed of offset by a decline in loan sales as Fannie Mae originations continue to lag. Non-performing loans decreased to 13.9 million due to the $7 million April repayment I mentioned during last quarter's call, we took the provisional credit loss of $915,000 in the second quarter, primarily attributable to loan growth. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. I just want to get your thoughts on growth on the other side of the balance sheet, just I think you're just a little above 100% loan to deposit ratio at the end of the second quarter. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. Because, some of the trust companies, we bank actually do some crypto stuff and that's why you see this wide fluctuation, sometimes during the quarter on non-interest bearing accounts, because, they may have a flush of cash coming in and sometimes they may have a flush of cash going out."
