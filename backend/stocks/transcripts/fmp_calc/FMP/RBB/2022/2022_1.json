Non-interest expense increased from last quarter due to a $2.5 million increase in compensation expense, a $420,000 increase in data processing and a $400,000 increase in director\u2019s fees. Our which cost of interest bearing deposits for the quarter was 0.44%, which was down three basis points from the prior quarter and 29 basis points from the prior year Non-performing assets were stable at $21 million at the end of the first quarter, but declined by about $7 million in early April as three non-performing loans were fully repaid.
