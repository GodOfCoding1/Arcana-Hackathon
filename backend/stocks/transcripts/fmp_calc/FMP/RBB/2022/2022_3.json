    "content": " Third quarter non-interest income decreased by $887,000 from the previous quarter, due primarily to the second quarter gain of $757,000 on a corporate real estate asset that we sold. With respect to funding, commercial customer activity drove $118 million decrease in average noninterest bearing deposits over the quarter. The increase was due in part to two loans, one was a construction loan up $11.3 million on a project that is substantially complete that was delinquent for 52 days due to administrative delays in processing an extension and one was a commercial real estate loan of $8.8 million that was also delinquent for 52 days due to similar delays. Our biggest issue, we do have one customer that does trading -- does trading in crypto and so forth, that customer will -- whereas they are very solid as their financials, their volume has shrunk tremendously, because of a crypto winner and we have gone from $300 million down to approximately $100 million in DD -- and non-interest bearing DDAs and so forth."
