    "content": "  Revenue decreased 8% year-over-year or 6% ex FX, with growth in four of our six divisions being offset by continued decreases in Ratings, as well as a year-over-year decline in Engineering Solutions this quarter due to the timing impact of a single product that Ewout will discuss later. Non-transaction revenue decreased 6% on a reported basis and 2% on a constant currency basis primarily due to lower Rating Evaluation Services and initial Issuer Credit Ratings, partially offset by increases in CRISIL, ICR and RES revenue are historically correlated with the relative strength of the issuance environment and M&A activity, respectively, and the declines we are seeing here are purely indicative of those market conditions."
