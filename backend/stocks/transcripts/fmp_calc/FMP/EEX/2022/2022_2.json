    "content": " But before going into further detail on this quarter's operational performance, I'm pleased to announce that on August 3 2022, Emerald reached an agreement with our insurance underwriters to settle outstanding litigation relating to our 2020 and 2021 event cancellation insurance policies for $149.25 million. As a result, the company expects to record $148.5 million as part of other income nets during the third quarter of 2022. Payment is expected to be received in the third quarter of 2022. And when added to the $223.6 million of claim payments already received, it will bring the total aggregate payments from insurers to approximately $372.9 million. We have 29 events in the quarter, which together attracted 61,600 attendees and 3,600 exhibiting companies, and we continue to see consistent growth in overall show participation. We also project that over the next few quarters on average, our events will increasingly close the gap to pre-pandemic levels of qualified attendee and exhibiting company participation. Trade Shows remain an integral part of our customers marketing budgets, and provide a high return on investments, as they're often the biggest selling events of the year for companies that exhibit. You will recall that last quarter, I highlighted three specific growth levers that make us excited about the future and they're worth reiterating today. Second, we're launching new products and services that are complementary to our core business to better support our customers year-round. Space rates at our shows are higher than pre-pandemic levels, meaning that if we can get back to 2029 aggregate net square footage, we're a much larger revenue company now than we were back then, there is meaningful upward leverage here. With respect to new products and services, we're making targeted investments in our capabilities that will produce benefits across the Emerald platform, a great example of this is our ongoing efforts to operationalize our customer database. Not only will our modernized and highly efficient database improve our ability to cross sell, and upsell to customers who are natural fits for multiple trade shows and content brands, it also provides Emerald with opportunities to leverage our substantial data assets related to building and consumer spending. In addition to our technology investments, we're executing against strong strategic growth plans for our legacy portfolio brands, as well as extending our reach into high growth markets through new show launches and M&A. At our current share price and guidance level, we have an attractive double-digit free cash flow yields on an as converted basis based on an expected $70 million of free cash flow in 2022 before the benefit of any insurance proceeds. To further enhance our business and accelerate growth, we're leveraging these initiatives alongside our three pronged growth strategy where our focus is on portfolio optimization, 365 day engagements and customer centricity. Through our Accelerator business unit that we announced earlier this year and expect we'll add one to two points to our organic growth, we're developing new brand experiences that leverage Emerald' unique capabilities and brand network to deliver leading events in emerging and high growth markets, including upcoming events in the areas of mental health, and decentralized finance. In addition to new launches, acquisitions are another component of our portfolio optimization strategy, where we're improving our business mix through the addition of businesses in high growth industries. In the second quarter, we also announced our acquisition of Advertising Week, a best-in-class global events and content platform focused on marketing, media, technology and culture. We're very excited to be partnering with the Advertising Week team and to combine Emerald's existing platform and capabilities with their thought leadership and expertise in the advertising media and technology space, an area where we have existing events and content properties. Moving to the second prong of our growth strategy, our 365 Day engagement initiatives are designed to support our customers year round while driving steady high margin cash flows for Emerald through the growth of our capabilities in both content and commerce. Our Elastic, e-Commerce, SaaS platform is continuing to gain traction delivering organic revenue growth of over 20% in the quarter, net revenue retention of 105% up from a 102% last quarter, and increase the number of customers subscribing to our platform over the last 12 months by 31%. Within our content business, we did experience a small hiccup related to an email distribution issue that impacted site traffic and newsletter delivery in the quarter, which you can see in our other marketing services line. We have multiple growth vectors including organically through new events, and product launches in high growth industries and externally through M&A as we work to position ourselves as a consolidator of choice with the ability to leverage our unparalleled scale, technology, and data advantages. As Herv\u00c3\u00a9 said, we're very pleased with our results this quarter and year-to-date, and believe they point to a robust recovery in the live event space. As discussed by Herv\u00c3\u00a9 Emerald has reached an agreement with our insurance underwriters to settle outstanding litigation relating to our 2020 and 2021 event cancellation insurance policies for $149,250,000. Payment is expected to be received in the third quarter of 2022. As a result, the company expects to book $148.5 million of other income net during the third quarter of 2022. Once received, this settlement payment is expected to bring total payments from insurers to approximately $372.9 million. Now, moving on to our second quarter results, second quarter revenue was $71.4 million as compared to $15 million in the prior year quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was $15.6 million in the second quarter, as compared to negative $13.6 million in the prior year quarter. The increase was due to the large number of events staged in the second quarter of this year, as well as the recognition of income related to insurance claim proceeds received or confirmed. Excluding insurance proceeds, adjusted EBITDA would have been $7.5 million as compared to negative $15.9 million in the prior year. Free cash flow in the second quarter was $10.5 million, as compared to $23.8 million in the prior year quarter. Excluding insurance, free cash flow would have been $2.5 million as compared to $19.1 million in the prior year quarter before adjusting for taxes. Turning to the balance sheet, we had $232 million of cash and marketable securities as of June 30, versus $245 million as of March 31 of this year, in order to optimize interest income against our substantial cash balance. With the pending receipt of $149.25 million related to the settlement of our lawsuit against the insurers, which Herv\u00c3\u00a9 and I just reviewed, our pro forma cash balance would be approximately $380 million. And as of quarter end, our total liquidity was $342 million, or $490 million pending receipt of the insurance settlement payment. We've historically sought to maintain a strong balance sheet supported by our cash flow generation, which should allow us to continue funding our strategic growth initiatives in any economic scenario. We repurchased 1 million shares of our common stock in the quarter, and an average price of $3.38. As of quarter end, we had net debt of $285 million and a net leverage ratio of 3.5x our trailing 12 month consolidated EBITDA of $84 million as defined in our credit agreement. Pro forma for the insurance settlement payment net debt drops to $137 million, with a leverage ratio well below 2x. At quarter end, we had 69.8 million shares outstanding of common stock on average in the quarter or $69.3 million at quarter end, as well as $71.4 million shares of convertible preferred stock outstanding. The convertible preferred shares have a liquidation preference per share of $6.44 as of June 30, 2022, while accreting on an annual rate of 7%, which compounds quarterly. Net debt was 69.3 million shares of common shares already outstanding and Emerald has a total of 199.9 million shares of common stock outstanding on an as converted basis as of June 30, 2022. As of Friday's closing price on our common stock, this converts to a market cap of approximately $631 million. We have an estimated contingent consideration on our balance sheet of $39 million for acquisitions made in the past three years, as well as a deferred tax asset worth over $70 million discounted the present value based on the tax treatment of certain of our acquisitions. This leads to an enterprise value of $878 million given our net debt outstanding, pro forma for the pending receipt of the insurance settlement, our enterprise value would be $730 million. As a reminder, we have the right to force conversion of the convertible preferred stock starting on June 29 of next year, if our common stock price exceed $6.16 for 20 consecutive trading days. Concluding with our guidance, we continue to be on track for full-year 2022 revenues in excess of $300 million. We expect adjusted EBITDA of over $50 million, which is net of $10 million of projected investment in growth initiatives on our Elastic SaaS product and new show launches in new verticals. We're targeting our expansion towards high growth industries, and investing in technologies that will create efficiencies across the entire Emerald platform from live events to content to our embedded B2B e-Commerce platform."
