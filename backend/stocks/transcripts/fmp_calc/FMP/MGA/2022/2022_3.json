    "content": " Lastly, there has been some movement in a couple of areas of our net input costs, but overall, we are expecting about $20 million in higher costs, which is essentially the impact of lower sales of scrap steel and aluminum compared to our previous outlook as a result of lower market prices. Just wondering what the key factors are sequentially that are driving that, because I mean it also looks like -- I mean, it's about $110 million improvement in EBIT sequentially and only $360 million improvement in revenues sort of at the midpoint. When we're breaking out our commercial recoveries, John, we're speaking specifically not about customer recoveries related to input costs or production volatility, that's reflected in our our $565 million or $570 number that we've been guiding previously. So when you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re thinking about -- forget about the commercial piece, if we're talking specifically about our 565 we've talked about historically, we would have guided in the range of about 200 basis points in Q1 and 200 basis points in Q2. And just my last question, the -- in your discussion on the downward revision to the margin guidance, the 30 basis points due to plant inefficiencies if I do my math correctly, that's about a loss of $27 million in the quarter."
