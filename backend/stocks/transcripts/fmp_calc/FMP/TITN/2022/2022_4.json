    "content": " While this call is focused on our fiscal fourth quarter, I want to emphasize that we experienced exceptional performance each quarter this year driving revenue across all our businesses and perhaps most important, all our segments demonstrated significant operational improvement with each posting strong increases in pretax income which in turn expanded margins. Total revenue for the fiscal 2022 fourth quarter was $507.6 million, an increase of 16.2% compared to last year. Despite slightly lower revenues, the dollar utilization of our construction segment rental fleet improved significantly to 28.4% for the current quarter compared to 22.4% in the same period last year and drove margins in this revenue category up 530 basis points compared to the prior year quarter. Our gross profit margin increased 310 basis points primarily due to strong equipment margins as a result of favorable end market conditions, healthy inventories, and increased amounts earned under manufacturer incentive programs, which for the quarter represented approximately $6.4 million. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, our adjusted net income increased to $22.5 million, which includes a $1.3 million benefit from a partial release of an income tax valuation allowance in our international business. Our adjusted earnings per diluted share was $0.99 for the quarter, which includes approximately $0.47 of benefits associated with the previously mentioned increased manufacturer incentives, gain on sale of Montana and Wyoming construction store divestitures, and a partial release of an income tax valuation allowance. Fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, adjusted EBITDA increased over 160% to $35.9 million, which compares to $13.7 million in the prior year. Agriculture segment sales increased 14.2% to $346.3 million, helping to drive a significant increase in our segment adjusted pretax income from $8 million to $17.7 million, which included a $5.1 million benefit earned through increased manufacturing incentives. Turning to our construction segment, revenue decreased 1.1% to $87.9 million compared to the prior year period, reflecting the lost contributions from the company's Arizona stores following the January 2021 divestiture. Even after excluding the $5.7 million gain associated with the fiscal 2022 fourth quarter sale of four store locations in Montana and Wyoming, this segment is showing strong improvement over the prior year quarter. The combination of strong equipment sales and margins, coupled with solid growth in our higher-margin parts and services businesses, yielded a $5.8 million improvement in adjusted pretax income to a positive $3.1 million. Fiscal 2022 total revenue increased 21.3% compared to last year, driven by 27.1% growth in equipment revenue and was further supported by solid contributions from our parts and service businesses, which increased 9.1% and 7.8%, respectively. Turning to Slide 11, our full year gross profit was $332.7 million, a 27.3% increase compared to last year. This increase was more than offset by revenue growth and led to 150 basis points of operating expense leverage improvement compared to the prior year, reducing our operating expenses as a percent of revenue to 14.1% in fiscal 2022. Floorplan and other interest expense decreased 20.5% to $5.7 million in the full year period, primarily due to overall lower floorplan borrowings. For the full year of fiscal 2022, our adjusted net income was $67.3 million, an increase of 174.9% from the prior year. Our adjusted earnings per diluted share was a record $2.98 for fiscal 2022, representing a 173.4% increase compared to $1.09 in the prior year. Overall, our adjusted pretax income increased 131.3% to $88.1 million for the full 2022 fiscal year and resulted in a pretax margin of 5.1%. We have modeled Ukraine revenues to be down approximately 75% versus prior year, which could -- which would result in associated loss of approximately $0.25 per share in fiscal 2023 due to unabsorbed expenses. For the agriculture segment, our initial assumption is for revenue growth in the range of up 22% to 27%, which importantly includes a full year revenue contribution from our Jaycox acquisition that closed in December 2021 as well as partial year revenue contribution from the Mark's Machinery acquisition, which is anticipated to close in April 2022."
