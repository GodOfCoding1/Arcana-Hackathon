Like I talked about in the last couple of calls, there is a little bit of pause right now or if many of the dealers are working through the PPP loan forgiveness process and I don\u2019t think there has been a lot of activity from some of the banks and to get those at all through in process. I think it\u2019s more about the unknown and the risks that we are hearing about and that type of things that would cause me to want, cause as I think to want more new equipment at this time to kind of take out some of that risk for the back half of the year. I think from a cost perspective, I don\u2019t see \u2013 well, yes, it should come down some \u2013 I would expect next year if we get this done within 12 months, costs would come down in the area of like external consulting and that type of thing."
