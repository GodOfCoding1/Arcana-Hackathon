    "content": " It is -- it's more restrictive in China than what we see in the other markets and really the catalyst for why you saw a sequential improvements is, is for the last three years we've run this, kind of, sales program that we've been testing and evaluating and tweaking and adjusting and China moved up their plans from running that later in the year to the second quarter. And just a little more color, a lot just from speaking for myself I tend to look through the lens of the United States as I think about how we're moving forward, but really, we are a global business, and if you take markets like the Philippines where they're completely shut down, but most all their business is dependent upon \"will-call\" and working in an office environment versus here in the United States we get things shipped. I think we're just being very intentional in prioritizing the business really to what Kevin said, what's -- what do we think is best for the long-term benefiting growth of the customers and individuals and families consuming our products."
