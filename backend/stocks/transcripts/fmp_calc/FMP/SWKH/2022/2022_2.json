GAAP net income for the second quarter of 2022 totaled $565,000 or $0.04 per diluted share compared to $14 million or $1.09 per diluted share for the second quarter of 2021. The first quarter adjusted non-GAAP income generated by Specialty Finance is a total $4.16 million, a 50% decrease since second quarter of 2021, which reflects  nature of the Cara milestones and a smaller portfolio.
