    "content": " On the cost side, we expect cash OpEx will decline from approximately $2.6 million per quarter in 2022, to roughly $1.5 million per quarter by the third quarter of 2023. Driven by the work of Paul, Tom Daggs and the entire team, we now see a path for this business to have more value than simply the PP&E on the books, which totaled $5.8 million at December 31. Turning to the portfolio, we ended the quarter with approximately $238 million of investment assets, which is an all-time high. As of December 31 2022, SWK\u00e2\u0080\u0099s total investment assets grew to approximately $238 million, an increase of 25.4% from $190 million at the end of 2021. As Jody mentioned earlier, as SWK reported non-GAAP tangible finance book value per share at $19.02 at the end of 2022, an increase from $18 from the prior year. In the fourth quarter of 2022, we recognized provision for credit loss expense of $3.5 million as well as a $5.2 million loss and change in fair value of acquisition related contingent consideration, which led to net income of $2.8 million or $0.22 per diluted share. For the full year of 2022, SWK reported total revenue of $41.5 million, a decrease from $56.2 million from the prior year. GAAP net income for 2022 totaled $13.5 million or $1.05 per diluted share, compared to $25.9 million or $2.02 per diluted share for full year 2021."
