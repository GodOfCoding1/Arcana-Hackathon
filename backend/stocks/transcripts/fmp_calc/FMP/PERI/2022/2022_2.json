    "content": " I must say that even though we are reporting 41% year-over-year growth, which is $82 million of revenue of advertising, it's getting harder every day to capture and hold attention but it is more and more vital it takes only a fraction of a second to make a first impression. In other words, our RPM, the rate per 1000 clicks on search advertising is being increased by 43% quarter-over-quarter, it was 52% in the last few, but what you are able to see here, and that's a COVID quarter that the rate was dropped, the rate was dropped. Adjusted EBITDA of 28.5 million, 19% from revenue compared to 13% last year, 99% year-over-year growth, the highest second quarter adjusted EBITDA ever. I think that Beyond Burger is definitely for us it's -- the use case of the quarter, are able to drive net new consumer that will be aware of it and then click -- with one click able to continue the purchase was always the Holy Grail in advertising that getting -- expand the market share of our brand, this is always the discussion that we have with them. So first to your question as far as what we've seen, as far as H2, I want to mention since we are very much into the third quarter, and I can say that at the end of the second quarter we have seen some shifts and shifts from advertising spent towards DR. As I mentioned in our call, the best evidence for it and the reflection of that has to do with RPM increased dramatically."
