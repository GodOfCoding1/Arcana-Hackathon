    "content": " Throughout the quarter, we secured multiple significant contracts, and we enter the second half of 2022 with a strong backlog of $685 million, which is a 14% increase over the same quarter in 2021. As a result of our strong performance in the first half of 2022, we are increasing our guidance for the full year 2022 in gross revenues, which were previously $785 million to $810 million to now $795 million to $815 million, and we'll also increase guidance for the full year 2022 in adjusted earnings per share which were previously $5.39 to $5.80 per share, which will now be $5.43 to $5.82 per share. And I thought -- I may have announced earlier, I said we've had an 83% growth in environmental, it's really the growth came from that real estate transaction business, those 2 key components. I wanted to sort of ask about kind of what we're seeing with Geospatial, especially and maybe we can sort of take into consideration the GEO1 acquisition because it seems as though, at least from the outside looking, again it's the opportunity sort of to continue to build on the the service offerings, what have you. And I think the GEO1 really helps with analytics, and they do a lot of acquisition work, but they were stronger on analytics, and they take data and make that data usable for their clients, and that's going to be a big help to grow Geospatial plus it's going to introduce us to a client -- a utility client that heretofore, we have not had much to do with."
