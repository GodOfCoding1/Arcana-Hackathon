Hey, good afternoon, guys. Hey, good afternoon, guys. The budget for \u00e2\u0080\u009823 shows in those two sectors that are the real estate interest rate, depending on the portfolio of businesses, they're showing roughly a 14% degradation from the budget last year. The L3HARRIS is mostly analytic, mostly software and I'm going to, you'll notice in my concluding comments, I'll mention that we did get the 16 patents that they're doing and really some well-known software that we will be using to support not only the existing clients, but we hope to present them to some of the clients that we're doing in our traditional geospatial services.
