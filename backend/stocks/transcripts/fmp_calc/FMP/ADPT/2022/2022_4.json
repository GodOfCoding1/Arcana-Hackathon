    "content": " Total revenue in the fourth quarter was 55.2 million, with 51% from MRD and 49% from immune medicine, representing a 46% increase from the same period last year. MRD revenue of 28.1 million grew 70% from a year ago with clinical testing and MRD pharma partnerships, each driving approximately 41% of the growth, along with a $2 million increase in MRD regulatory milestones. Looking closer at the full year, MRD revenue was 87.1 million up 32% from a year ago, driven by a $15.8 million increase in clonoSEQ clinical testing and $10 million increase in MRD pharma partially offset by a $4 million decrease in MRD regulatory milestones. Immune medicine revenue grew to 98.2 million up 11% versus the prior year, driven by a $13.6 million increase from pharma services partially offset by a $4.4 million decrease from T-Detect COVID. We anticipate the contribution from our businesses to be approximately 55% from MRD and 45% from immune medicine, with a lower contribution from the immune medicine mainly driven by significantly lower amortization from the Genentech upfront versus prior years.
