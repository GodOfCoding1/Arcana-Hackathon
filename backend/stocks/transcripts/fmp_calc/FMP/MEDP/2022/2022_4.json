    "content": " Revenue in the fourth quarter of 2022 was $394.1 million, which represents a year-over-year increase of 27.7% and full year 2022 revenue was $1.46 billion, a 27.8% increase from 2021. For the full year 2022 net new business awards were $1.8 billion an increase of 13.6% and ending backlog as of December 31, was approximately $2.3 billion. In the fourth quarter of 2022, net income of $68.7 million increased 37.2% compared to net income of $50 million in the prior year period. So I guess I'm wondering, is it easy to cut what is what's allowing you to post numbers that can still get you to your growth outlook when it seems to be a deteriorating environment, should we just chalk that up to conservative guidance or a sales effort that is kind of turning over more rocks and so you have more things going in the top of the funnel that allows you to absorb something -- a higher percentage of opportunities dropping out. I -- there has been -- what we're seeing is a greater churn, greater risk to clients having stalled financing, and that's a headwind, but it doesn't mean there's not other options and other opportunities and we've been able to pivot to those, and we've been more selective during the period of the last -- not this past year but the year before that, when there was a large number of opportunities, we were able to select programs that we're better funded than others. And there's also clients that look to be fully funded for a project going in, but because of other things that they might do that we may not be aware of in terms of other programs they're supporting or other spend run short of cash before they complete, and have assumed that financial markets will be able to get them there on it."
