    "content": " Revenue for the third quarter of 2022 was $383.7 million, which represents a year over year increase of 29.8%. Net new business awards entering backlog in the third quarter increased 15.4% from the prior year to $470.9 million, resulting in a 1.23 net book to bill. In the third quarter of 2022, net income of $66 million increased 35.9% compared to net income of $48.6 million in the prior year period. I mean, we keep expecting that there's going to be a pretty broad based slowdown in starts and also seek some cancellations, uptick in cancellations that are meaningful, given the funding environment and given the feedback we've gotten from clients and what we're seeing. And so to the extent that rates stay consistent, we don't expect to see a positive or negative influence from that in 2023, and there's $7.8 million year-to-date in foreign currency gains right now. I think it's -- obviously, it's a competitive environment and everyone is looking, particularly in our clients in this current environment where their funding is down, they're looking for saving dollars and we have that conversation about how the inflationary environment's going to determine our rates. Sometimes we talk about total cancellation of projects, and we expand that to mean anything that's been awarded to us even though it hasn't started, and things just -- and at times of a slowdown, sometimes that's what happens is you get clients initially delay the startup. But if we have a full quarter's worth of initial project awards that were down 45% year-over-year from what you described last quarter and you apply that negative 45% to 3Q of last year's bookings, 4Q of last year's bookings, 1Q of this year, it suggests a well below 1.0 book-to-bill."
