    "content": " Also with Danone, we're launching the evian Loop bottle in South Korea, which will be the first chemically recycled, 100% recycled content packaging that's going to be sold in stores in South Korea. The big thing is that, we've completed all of the upgrades in Terrebonne and now we're really focusing on production and selling the materials in our facility here to be able to generate first revenues and also sets us apart from anyone else in the world by being able to supply these type of volumes to the customers. So that's another really exciting project for us and to be able to have manufacturing facilities in North America, Asia and Europe really provide comfort to all of our customers and our potential customers that -- knowing that they'll be able to get the exact same Loop resin or polyester fiber from any facility anywhere in the world, on any continent, that's really something that's really important for the customers."
