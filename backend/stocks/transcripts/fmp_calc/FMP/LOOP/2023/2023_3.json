    "content": " With these uncertain macroeconomic times, it's important for us to make sure that the projects that we do focus on and that we do build are the ones that have the least amount of risk and the highest amount of success. And so in these more uncertain economic times and the macro environment out there, we think it's best decision for Loop to be executing on the projects with the least amount of risk and the easiest to execute on. But in today's world, we have to be looking at which projects are the easiest to execute on with the least amount of risk and the highest return on capital. Selling the land in B\u00c3\u00a9cancour was a really smart business decision as it had appreciated over 500% in two years, focusing on the projects that are the easiest to execute on with the least amount of risk with SKGC is obviously in my mind and in management's mind with the best course of action."
