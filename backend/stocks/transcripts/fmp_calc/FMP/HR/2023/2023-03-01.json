    "content": " But directionally, Austin, I think the point here, and I mentioned it in my remarks, that we're seeing a lot of strong trends in place, obviously, on the revenue side, through occupancy gains, rent growth that are really pushing that revenue equation higher. First question is just in terms of interest expense, I know you didn't give guidance on it specifically, but I wanted to just see if you -- if there's any way we can get a feel roughly for how, I guess, cash interest expense without the mark-to-market on the debt could look like this year. To kind of give you a bit of kind of heuristic, so to speak, on it is that with about $900 million of floating rate debt right now, a 1% change in the annual interest rate ends up being about $0.015 to overall growth on a per share amount for the year. So I think in terms of what's in there and what we're expecting to sell, it's really trying to optimize the portfolio going forward and looking at getting out of possibly some smaller markets that we don't want to be in the long term. So when you layer everything into it, the full impact of swaps and then looking at what you're expecting for acquisitions, dispositions, do you think you'll end the year with a run rate that's similar, higher or lower to that $0.41 now? And so plus or minus any one quarter depending on how you're running your models, that would not be surprising, but we still feel like long term directionally with what we're seeing in terms of internal growth, that we'll be able to balance out this year as well as drive that payout ratio lower in the future."
