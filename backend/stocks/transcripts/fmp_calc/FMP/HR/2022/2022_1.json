    "content": " With regards to the $1.1 billion special cash dividend for HTA shareholders, I'm pleased to report that we've lined up $1.6 billion in proceeds at cap rates of around 4.8% through a combination of JV and asset sales. The benefits of scale will accrue to our shareholders through increased acquisition and development sourcing, as well as long-term occupancy gains and rent growth, which combined, can accelerate our bottom line growth by 100 to 200 basis points. And then the joint venture is really more of the same of what we've been doing with our Teachers joint venture, but also pulling in assets that might be a little bit more off-campus, but also helpful to the hospital-centric clusters that Rob described and in markets where we're building scale."
