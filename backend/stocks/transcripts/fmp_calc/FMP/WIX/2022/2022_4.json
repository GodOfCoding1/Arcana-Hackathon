    "content": " We expect total revenue in Q1 to be $367 million to $371 million, representing approximately 7% to 9% year-over-year growth. Free cash flow, excluding headquarters investment, is expected to be roughly $152 million to $162 million or 10% to 11% of revenue in 2023. In the last few years, we are seeing a change, a very significant change where we are getting much more complex websites being built on our platform, for which the price point can go to the thousands and even to the hundreds of thousands of dollars, which means that ARPS is not uniform anymore, which also explains why we're de-focusing our thinking about net adds and focusing so much more about the absolute value in the cohort itself. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. When you look at kind of what made the impact, so I would say that \u00e2\u0080\u0093 generally speaking, we've seen and I mentioned this before, the macro slowness also affects a little bit the existing cohorts, again, because these are small tiny businesses that are trying to keep on working and maintaining the business in a harsher environment, and obviously that has an effect on them. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open."
