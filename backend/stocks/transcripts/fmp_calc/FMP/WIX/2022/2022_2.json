    "content": " And so, we announced today a $150 million dollar cost savings plan to allow us to meet our profitability targets and accelerate gross margins and operating margins in 2023 even if market conditions remain unchanged. Even against the market dynamics Avishai mentioned earlier, revenue in the second quarter grew to over $345 million, representing 9% year-over-year growth and towards the top end of our guidance range provided in May. Our efforts to grow the partner business continue as planned, with revenue increasing 31% year-over-year in the second quarter, as the investments we made in recent years begin to pay dividends and are driving momentum across agencies, designers and developers across the professional ecosystem. Of the $150 million of annualized saving, about 25% will come from cost of revenue, mainly our care organization, which will produce about 200 basis point of gross margin improvement in 2023 compared to our 3-year plan."
