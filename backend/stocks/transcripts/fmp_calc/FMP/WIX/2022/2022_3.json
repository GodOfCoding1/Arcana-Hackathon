    "content": " This trend along with improved gross margins means that nearly all of our incremental revenue in 2023 will flow through to the bottom line We generated positive free cash flow, excluding headquarters CapEx, of $4.6 million in Q3. Revenue was $345.8 million, or 8% year-over-year growth, which was slightly above the high end of our guidance range due to strong performance in our user cohorts. On a year-over-year constant currency basis, revenue was $350.8 million, or 10% year-over-year growth. Transaction revenue, which is a subset of Business Solutions revenue and is composed primarily of Wix Payments, was $36 million in Q3 or 12% year-over-year growth. Partners revenue, which includes all types of revenue generated through designers and developers who build sites for others as well as B2B partnerships, grew to $86.9 million or 24% year-over-year. For the full year, assuming constant currency, total revenue would be about $20 million higher, or 10% to 11% year-over-year growth. Assuming year-over-year constant currency, our free cash flow for the full year would be $43 million higher, or total of 5% of revenue, which is the high end of the range we presented in our three year plan.
