    "content": "  Before the clean-out of the inventory, some customer are reluctant to make an new product, so according to our input and interface with customers, the high end  activity should start to recover perhaps by the end of September or in October, so we believe there is a push-out due to inventory, high inventory, but the design activity should continue, and as Chris mentioned, because wafer fab utilization is a little bit down and that allows customers to have the room to taper pilot activity, so we hope and we believe this is a short term effect."
