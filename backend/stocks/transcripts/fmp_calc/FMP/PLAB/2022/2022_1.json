    "content": " We invested $19 million in CapEx during Q1, which indicates free cash flow of $40 million for the quarter and our CapEx forecast for the year remains at $100 million, primarily for increases in mainstream IC capacity and deposits on tools to be delivered in 2023. So you can see, Tom, right, that historically, our mainstream business was running for 10 years at about $250 million annually, we're in a mature market, there'd be a few percent of price down and regain, a few percent of market share. And then you talked about exiting this year still with the industry and a significant deficit to demand and hoping to add to these kind of point tools, adding 15% capacity, which then puts you over the top end of your long-term target model. And the improvements we're making in our operations, likewise it's very easy to just rationally run the numbers forward to see that nothing on the chart is anything other than a projection of the last several quarters and several years of business performance to hit $800 million. So that's the - where the 20% is it's on the business that last quarter was running at a $240 million run rate, that's where the commitments are. And the way I answer Tom's question, we believe that - and it's hard to know, but when the next downturn happens, if the market kind of continues like it is, we're going to be seeing with 25% to 30% more demand than capacity. Yeah, we don't typically give market share numbers, but you can see that 75% of our FPD business is high end and it's - the high end is dominated by AMOLED."
