    "content": " Our 3 growth engines: consumer payments; new flows and value-added services, all grew revenues well over 20%. U.S. payments volume grew 16%, up 44% versus 2019, which was 2 points better than the first quarter. Debit grew only 6% year-over-year, reflecting the impact of stimulus last year, but growth remained very strong versus 2019 at 53%. Cross-border card-not-present volume growth, excluding travel, remained strong, up 16% year-over-year and well above the pre-COVID trend line at 67% above 2019. Cross-border travel-related spend, excluding intra-Europe, grew 111% year-over-year and indexed at 82% of 2019 levels. Constant dollar cross-border volume, excluding transactions within Europe, grew 47% year-over-year, and were 15% over 2019. Based on results to date and our outlook for the second half, we expect full year net revenue growth in constant dollars in the high teens to 20% range, including approximately 0.5 point of contribution from Tink and Currencycloud."
