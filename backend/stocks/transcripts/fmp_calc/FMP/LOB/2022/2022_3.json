    "content": " Adjusted PPNR was up 21% due to strong net interest income growth of 5% linked quarter and higher fee income driven by $9 million of gain on sale income versus $5 million in Q2, which more than offset continued investment in people and technology. Going forward, we will continue to be opportunistic on hiring, particularly for revenue producers but we expect to see our expense growth moderate into 2023. Credit trends, as I discussed on Slide 21 look great, having 43% of your total loan portfolio government guaranteed is both a great comfort and a great responsibility that we take very seriously. And again, because we're cycling through and readjusting our loan yields, in particular, to the market and funding costs, we think the margin stabilizes into 2023, depending on when the Fed stops raising rates, we could start to see it modestly moving up again. But like we said on the call, this product doesn't have the treasury management capabilities some of the largest small businesses need, and we'll be coming at that end of the market in the first quarter, which we think is where we'll get to some of the more significant balances in the market. So I think what Huntley just talked about with our title mass market, small business type products rolling out early next quarter, our larger treasury management offering and then embedded, I really think that by the end of 2023, you'll really start to see some momentum, particularly from the first 2."
