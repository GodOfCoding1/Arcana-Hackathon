    "content": " So starting on Slide 5, you\u2019ll see that our first quarter earnings per share were $0.76 a year-over-year basis, we generated 91% growth and adjusted PPNR driven by 44% revenue growth on 24% expense growth. On Slide 10, you\u2019ll see total revenue growth of 3% linked quarter and 44% year-over-year was driven by the strong loan growth and resulting net interest income, which was up 5% linked and 44% year-over-year. And secondly, while premiums remained relatively stable with recent trends during the first 45 to 60 days of the quarter, we did start to see some meaningful changes in demand and pricing due primarily to shifting market sentiment on the Fed\u2019s rate and economic outlook. So with the FinTech gain of $120 million booked in the second quarter, we will take the opportunity to moderate our guaranteed sales in the second quarter and allow the markets to further digest the Fed\u2019s rate moves. So we brought on 48 net new folks in the first quarter, that pace will likely moderate a bit in the back half of the year, but we\u2019ll continue to take opportunities to bring the best and brightest folks together here and we think it\u2019s a real competitive advantage for us. With this gain, we\u2019re able to invest in incremental $10 million to $15 million per year in technology, some of which is already showing up in our first quarter numbers."
