    "content": " Since inception in \u00e2\u0080\u009808, we have originated $19 billion in loans, two-thirds of which were in the SBA 7(a) program and as you can see $14 billion or 74% of our $19 billion in originations were loans to small businesses. Our net interest margin of 3.89% held up really well in Q2 during the beginning of Fed's rate increase cycle, loan production was solid at $960 million. We continue to be a talent magnet adding 13 net new lenders in the quarter and our core business performance along with continued success with our Ventures investing continues to add significant tangible book value per share, resulting in 19% increase from the second quarter of last year. Also related to the secondary market dynamics, as Chip talked about, our servicing asset rebound is very high this quarter at $8 million, write-down versus $16 million in Q1, primarily due to the rapid decline in market premiums as though our servicing asset is a non-cash item and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s insignificant from a balance sheet perspective at less than 4% of capital, fair value changes do flow through our income statement. You'll see, adjusted PPNR was down due to that intentional reduction of guaranteed sales, despite not a strong net interest income growth of 7% linked quarter and lower expense growth of 4% linked quarter. Breaking down the components of revenue on slide 13, you will see total revenue growth still up 13% year-over-year despite this quarters lower gain on sale income, driven by strong loan growth and resulting net interest income, which was up 34% year-over-year. Equally as exciting on the deposit side, we saw a really strong growth in our business savings product with 18% linked quarter growth over $1.3 of business savings accounts. Highlights for the quarter include many of our flagship small business industry verticals like healthcare, veterinarians and investment advisors, along with strength in our middle-market lending and the conventional side and our general SBA lending team that Chip mentioned, which continue to source attractive opportunities across the nation and across a variety of industries. I would say, the small business pipelines have been pretty consistent, dipped a little in the beginning of the year and starting to see more in the way of business acquisitions, where I think when capital markets sort of earlier in the year really started to move, rates start to move, buyers and sellers had a hard time figuring out pricing and so certainly took a pause and we saw that through the first part of the year."
