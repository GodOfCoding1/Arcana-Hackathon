    "content": " While linked quarter revenue was down modestly as continued NII growth was offset by lower gain on sale income, total revenue growth was up 16% year-over-year, even with significantly lower gain on sale income, thanks to 31% year-over-year growth in net interest income. So looking at Q4 and that sort of core expense number, I think will be in high single digits or mid single digits of growth over that kind of call it less than 10% growth on that number, but to BJ's point that'll translate year-over-year higher, just given the ramp up over the course of last year. But one of the thing I did say that I wanted to reiterate now that we've got our gain on sale as a percentage of quarterly revenue somewhere in that 7% to 10% revenue range and gives us a total revenue mix of let's say around 80% spread income 20% fee income versus historically over the last couple years, we've been more 70/30. So we'd love to think that we could turn that dial to be 20% ROE and 20% grower that's sort of I think the optimistic case, but pretty reasonably think that a 15% ROE to support our growth is pretty reasonable. And kind of our arrow in the quiver so to speak is we were 50 if you normalize some of these onetime costs and the gains and all this we're a 15% to 20% ROE business today with a deposit platform, that is market rate. Even if we grow the balance sheet faster than the retained earnings we still have a couple of years of runway before tier one leverage gets down at the bank shears level towards 7.5% or 7% range, in which case, we would probably have to think of something else absent more ventures gains."
