    "content": " We are encouraged by the positive interim Phase 1/2 results we announced last month, not only because they build upon our ongoing work indicating that DNA medicines have the potential to treat HPV associated diseases, but more importantly because these data could be the first steps toward a new therapy to improve the lives of those patients suffering from this horrible disease. The trial demonstrated statistically \u00e2\u0080\u0093 statistical significance based on the clinical endpoint of a reduction in the number of RRP surgical interventions in the year following administration of INO-3107, compared with the year prior to treatment in the initial cohort of 21 participants."
