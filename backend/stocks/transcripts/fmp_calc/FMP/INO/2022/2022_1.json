And during this meeting, the FDA advised us that our regulatory strategy to use REVEAL2, which is the second of two Phase 3 trials for VGX-3100 to evaluate efficacy in biomarker-selected population would not provide sufficient evidence to support approval of a potential marketing application for VGX-3100 in that biomarker population. The FDA recommended that using REVEAL2 as an exploratory study to evaluate a biomarker-selected population and then to conduct one or two additional prospective, well-controlled trials in the biomarker-selected population would be more likely to provide sufficient evidence to support approval of a marketing application."
