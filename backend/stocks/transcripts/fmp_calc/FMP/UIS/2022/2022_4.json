    "content": " This will be helpful when looking ahead to our 2023 expense performance, which on the service will show declines in total revenue, profit margin and EBITDA margin due to the light L&S renewal schedule we discussed last quarter, overshadowing the underlying improvement we expect to achieve at our ex L&S solutions. For the full year 2022, company revenue totaled $1.98 billion, a 0.1% increase on a constant currency basis, in line with guidance we provided last quarter and a 3.6% decline on a reported basis. In the fourth quarter, revenue increased 3.3% year-over-year and 7% on a constant currency basis, driven by strength in our acquired application development solutions as well as a strong license renewal quarter within TCS, particularly in the travel and financial sectors. As Peter mentioned, we have a multiyear view into the majority of our L&S revenue, and in 2023, we expect it to be approximately $350 million, with 55% and 45% between the first and second half of the year, with 30% to 35% of of L&S full year revenue expected in the first quarter. In 2023, we expect a non-GAAP operating margin of 2% to 4% and adjusted EBITDA margin of 9.5% to 11.5%, reflecting year-over-year margin compression due to lower L&S revenue, partially offset by improvement in DWS and CA&I combined gross margins of approximately 250 basis points, driven by growth in Next-Gen solutions and delivery efficiency initiatives. This increase of $650 million in cash contribution requirements to our U.S. qualified decline benefit plans since year-end 2021 is primarily driven by 2 factors: First, the funding rules by which our contributions are determined, use discount rates that are based on a 25-year average, causing our contribution requirements to be less sensitive to changes in market interest rates than our GAAP deficit."
