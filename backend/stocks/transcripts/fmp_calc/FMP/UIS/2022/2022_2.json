    "content": " With respect to the Company overall, as we look to the second half of the year, we expect revenue in the third quarter to be up 50 to 150 basis points year-over-year in constant currency, though down 375 to 475 basis points year-over-year as reported, in part as a result of ECS renewal timing with more significant constant currency and reported revenue growth in the fourth quarter, leading second half revenue to be up year-over-year overall. Despite the positive momentum and encouraging leading indicators supporting a strong second half, the delayed signings and FX deterioration since the last earnings call have led us to lower our revenue growth guidance for the year from our original range of 5% to 7% to 2.5% to 4.5% on a constant currency basis or negative 1% to positive 1% as reported, approximately 350 basis points of the change versus our original range was due to foreign exchange and approximately 250 basis points was due to contract signing delays."
