    "content": " Subscription revenue was down as expected 5% year-over-year and our contracted annual recurring revenue was $201 million at June 30th, 2022, which is down 4% year-over-year, driven by the health plan attrition discussed earlier. Professional services revenue was down 25% or $2.7 million year-over-year, which is primarily due to ongoing customer projects being delivered later in the year as well as the implementations associated with new customers booking during the year. We are seeing the benefits of our efforts, including increased sales activity with key brokers, indicating our go-to-market strategy is working and improved customer service metrics year-over-year as we head into the open enrollment season."
