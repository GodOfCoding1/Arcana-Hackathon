    "content": " And we would expect that fuller pathway inhibition with an improved therapeutic window would be expected to drive to differentiation of VTX-958 vs deucravacitinib meaning that we'd have greater coverage of the TYK2 IC-50 And especially IC-90, that could be expected to drive improved efficacy, not only in indications like inflammatory bowel disease were very high doses and IC-90 coverage may be necessary, but also improved efficacy and indication such as psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. So VTX-958, will enable clinical differentiation across multiple indications has the potential to offer a differentiated clinical profile in psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis and lupus by dosing two levels of TYK inhibition that are greater than that that can be achieved with competitors, with a more narrow therapeutic window be uniquely positioned among TYK inhibitors to address Crohn's disease and IBD indications where IL-12/IL-23 and IL-12 antibodies is proven effective at higher doses than is what you do."
