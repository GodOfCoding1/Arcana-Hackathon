So what we believe is that the range above 55% reduction is unexplored in ulcerative colitis and given what's been seen with multiple sclerosis, we think it's very logical that what's been seen with multiple sclerosis going to 70% something reduction, and the linear relationship between load intermediate lymphocyte reduction and ulcerative colitis, that it's very logical to think that you could add to the magnitude of efficacy that was seen with etrasimod, and so we're really looking for 20% plus efficacy across the important outcome measures, but the primary endpoint will be clinical remission and you know, if you think about most of the existing drugs, the difference between drug and placebo is about 10%, so a 20% plus delta becomes really critically meaningful, especially for a safer role therapy. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open."
