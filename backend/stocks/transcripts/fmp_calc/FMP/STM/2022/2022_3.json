So clearly, here, okay, we confirm that, okay, both from a, let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s say, data point visibility we have in our backlog, but conversation with our customer the demand from \u00e2\u0080\u0093 for electrical vehicles, so the transformation of electrification is calling for strong demand of semiconductor. And the demand of semiconductor in automation, robotics, okay, power energy, infrastructure, renewable energy, a charging station for electrical car, all are calling for very, very important demand and here, same both data points, so means the backlog we have in our hand plus, let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s say, the discussion we have with customers are showing, let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s say, a very strong dynamic whatever is the geographies. So all in all, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the reason why when we look at the data point, okay, provided by the various, let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s say, industrial analysts, it is clear that the sum of in terms of growth, both in 2022 and in 2023 is showing a much better picture than the term of semiconductor. I was giving a rule of thumb many times, let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s say, about the 1% change in the \u00e2\u0080\u0093 every dollar, how this translates in our operating margin on our \u00e2\u0080\u0093 in our operating profit and our gross profit, let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s say, in the range of 1% of difference in terms of, let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s say, exchange rate, euro-dollar exchange rate it translates between $2.8 million , equally split substantially between gross profit and operating profit. In respect to the question on the grants, I would say that at the end, in terms of grants for R&D, we do not expect a significant change in respect to what we have had in the past in the sense that at the end, we are \u00e2\u0080\u0093 this year, just to give you an idea, let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s say, the overall other income and expenses will be, as already anticipated, more or less in the range of $140 million, something like that."
