    "content": " Net revenues increased 26.4% to $16.3 billion, driven by strong demand in automotive and industrial and our engaged customer programs. On Q1 2023, at the midpoint, our first quarter business outlook is for net revenues of $4.20 billion, increasing by 18.5% year-over-year and decreasing 5.1% sequentially. Based on our strong customer demand and increased manufacturing capacity, we will drive the company based on a plan for full year 2023 net revenues in the range of $16.8 billion to $17.8 billion, representing a growth range of 4% to 10% compared to full year 2022. Gross margin was 47.5%, increasing 230 basis points year-over-year, mainly driven by favorable pricing, improved product mix and currency effect net of hedging, partially offset by the inflation of manufacturing input costs. For 2023, based on our strong customer demand and increased manufacturing capacity, we will drive the company based on this plan for full year 2023 revenues in the range of $16.8 billion to $17.8 billion, representing growth over 2022 of about 4% to 10%."
