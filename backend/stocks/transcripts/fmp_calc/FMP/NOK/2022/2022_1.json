    "content": " What was particularly pleasing in this quarter was the strong gross margin 40.7%, which is 250 basis points up and this was particularly driven by mobile networks and cloud and network services. And one of the key investment areas is campus wireless where we are adding R&D investment, which is one of the reasons why I want to caution you now that and repeat what we have said earlier that our assumption for the profitability of this business for this \u2013 for the full year 2022 is comparable operating margin between 4% and 7%. And as you saw -- Pekka showed as well that we have a decline of 17% and this is actually offsetting the good growth that we had in mobile networks, but also optical and IP had some decline in Europe. The next area network infrastructure with a small operating profit growth, while operating margin had a decline of 90 basis points just like Pekka mentioned and this is where we invest in R&D as well but also the absence of the one-off in other operating income last year. Alex, please go ahead. In routing, obviously, it's now further strengthened through FP5 and also in fixed access, especially on the optical line terminal side first in PON then GPON and now quickly transitioning to 10 gigabit symmetrical XGS PON and even gradually to 25G PON that is a segment where we have pretty strong competitive -- technology competitiveness, market position and hence also pricing power. Alex, please go ahead."
