If you exclude last year software deal on Nokia Technologies from our results, operating margin would have improved by 330 basis points from 5.6% to 8.9% in Q2, and this does demonstrate the strength of the improvement in our product businesses. First, Mobile Networks, where I was pleased to see a return to growth with a 1% increase year-on-year in constant currency in spite of COVID-19 related lockdowns in the Shanghai region, supply chain challenges and a tough comparison caused by a one-off software deal in Q2 2021. And as Pekka mentioned, if we exclude the one-off software deal from Q2 last year and technologies as well this year and last year, the remaining business operating margin would have improved from 5.6% to 8.9%, which is quite impressive. When it comes to Network Infrastructure, we estimate the market increased from 3% to 5%, and this is largely reflected the strong demand we have seen in Fixed Networks, mainly related to upcoming broadband initiatives and fixed wireless access. Yeah, I can start. Yeah, I can start. Of course, then if you ask that how long will the double-digit growth continues \u00e2\u0080\u0093 it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s impossible to say the comparables are, of course, getting tougher if you take fixed access or fixed broadband grew 35% last year, 29% in Q1 and 22% in Q2. We have identified such risks in the Risk Factors section of our annual report on Form 20-F, which is available on our Investor Relations website."
