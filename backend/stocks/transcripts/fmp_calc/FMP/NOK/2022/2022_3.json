    "content": " On top of the sales growth we have already -- we are already seeing, we also signed some significant contracts in India in Q3 with Bharti Airtel we've been awarded a 45% share of their planned 5G network continuing our long-standing good partnership. In Mobile Networks, our operating margin expanded by 250 basis points year-over-year as the strong net sales growth also translated into good margin expansion. So you've done another good job in the quarter, as you highlighted in terms of the margins, that takes you to about 9.6% operating margins for Mobile Networks on a year-to-date basis. So we haven't given any detailed, but as you see, you pointed out as well, that year-to-date, the margin on Mobile Networks is 9.7 -- 9.6%. That market will come, I mean, there's no doubt about that, but that is, in a way, a bit late cyclical compared to the radio development because that we have -- I mean, we are good in terms of making deals, but the revenue coming through requires that there is traffic, there is load on the networks, and that will come later. When we looked at Nokia's margin in Mobile Networks, you see today 9.6%, 9.7% margin in the first three quarters of the year."
