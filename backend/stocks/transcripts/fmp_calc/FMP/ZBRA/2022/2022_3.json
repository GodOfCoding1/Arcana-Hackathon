    "content": " We now expect our free cash flow to be at least $400 million for the year, which we have significantly reduced from our prior outlook due to lower profits and elevated inventory levels that we will be working down into 2023 as we rationalize safety stock and execute on our North America distribution transition. You may now go ahead. You may now go ahead. But if you look at the overall reduction from $200 million to $190 million in premium supply chain costs, some of that's volume driven, just over half, but also $4 million of that or so was due to the lower rates we're experiencing. You may now go ahead. Now as we're seeing some caution in the market, it's -- again, the largest customers that are being cautious first, some of the deferrals that we've referred to and that you asked about were larger customers with large orders while the medium-sized and small customers continue to go very strong with even double-digit growth. You may now go ahead. You may now go ahead. You may now go ahead. You may now go ahead. You may now go ahead. So I'd say as we look at it going into next year, obviously, we think there's -- just based on the second half run rate, there will be a meaningful improvement from a year-on-year perspective."
