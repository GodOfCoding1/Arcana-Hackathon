    "content": " Although Q4 was strong, the full year was significantly lower than last year, primarily due to a higher use of working capital due to elevated inventory, higher incentive compensation payments given our exceptional 2021 performance, and $135 million of previously announced settlement payments, which are scheduled to conclude in Q1 of 2024. From a year-on-year perspective, if you look at the EBITDA guide of approximately 21%, the supply chain benefit or the premium supply chain benefit is about 3 points, but that's offset by 2 points of FX. And we had particularly strong growth from a solutions perspective with print, data capture, RFID, tablets, but partially offset by lower mobile computing sales in Europe, due in part to the exit from Russia in Q1 of last year. I think, as you look at the full year guide, which is about, from an organic perspective, slightly down at the midpoint, as you mentioned before, I think it's a combination of the two, right, both kind of cautious in the overall assumptions due to the macro environment and how that's going to play out through the rest of the year as well as to your other point of how we kind of look at each -- look at some of those large opportunities and probability weight those for the year."
