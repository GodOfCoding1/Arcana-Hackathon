    "content": " For the quarter, we realized sales growth of nearly 7% and adjusted EBITDA margin of 21.9%, a 170 basis point decrease, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $4.61, a 1% increase from the prior year. Adjusted gross margin declined 200 basis points to 46% due to higher premium supply chain costs and China import tariff recovery in the prior year period, partially offset by higher service and software margin. For the first half of 2022, we generated $123 million of free cash flow, which was lower than the last year primarily due to a higher use of working capital as sales volume shifted to later in the period due to the China lockdowns; higher incentive compensation payments given our exceptional 2021 performance; and the initial $45 million quarterly installment payment related to the settlement I just mentioned. And when you dig into that, over 2 points increase from strong volume leverage, the pricing benefits, taking traction from what we've executed over the last 9 months, as well as we're seeing solid improvement in the underlying gross margin across the portfolio, but that's offset by nearly 2 points of FX, as we're forecasting slightly above parity. One would be continued improvement in overall premium supply chain costs, as we are taking actions here in the third quarter to reduce air freight, moving print ocean that you'll see the benefit for in the fourth quarter, as well as you get nice volume leverage sequentially in terms of revenue -- increased in revenue on a relatively flat OpEx profile. Yes, so if you look at our free cash flow, again, the -- for the first half decrease in relative to what we expect in the second half was really around the higher use of working capital and the timing of sales, as particularly in the second quarter with the China lockdown."
