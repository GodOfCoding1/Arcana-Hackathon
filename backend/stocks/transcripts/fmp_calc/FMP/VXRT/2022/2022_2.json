    "content": " Before we get started, I would like to remind everyone that this conference call -- that during this conference call, Vaxart may make forward-looking statements, including statements about the company's financial results, financial guidance, its future business strategies and operations and its product development and regulatory progress, including statements about its ongoing or planned clinical trials. Over the past several months, we've reported multiple data sets supporting the broad potential of COVID-19 vaccine candidate to tackle the challenges of the evolving virus, and that continues to -- and the virus that continues to overcome immune protection provided by the currently approved vaccines. Also, as Andrei had mentioned, based on recent FDA guidance, we're evaluating both Wuhan and Omicron-based vaccine candidates to determine really the best approach to providing maximum protection against currently circulating strains as well as strains that are likely to evolve in the future. In June, we reported positive preliminary data from a Phase Ib trial of our norovirus vaccine candidate in subjects aged 55 to 80 years old, which showed stimulation of very robust immune responses across all doses with a dose-dependent production of IgA antibody screen cells. And then back to one of your questions that you had answered earlier in terms of that's the under age 5 population for the over 65 population, we believe that this probably would get used like the influenza vaccines currently used in the U.S.\n Well, thank you."
