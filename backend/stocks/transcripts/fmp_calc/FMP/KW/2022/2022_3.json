    "content": " These include organically growing our multifamily net operating income, further expansion of our debt and industrial portfolios and the near-term completion of our $3 billion development pipeline, which is expected to produce $92 million of incremental NOI to KW, 83% of which we expect to be stabilized by the end of 2024. These areas of growth should meaningfully add to our $473 million of estimated annual NOI, which is up 9% for the year and up 15% from Q3 of '21; and to our $5.6 billion of fee-bearing capital, which has increased by 12% for the year and by almost 50% in the last 2 years. The logistics market continues to see positive rental growth rates driven by low vacancy across the U.K. Our global logistics portfolio, which now totals almost 11 million square feet, continued to remain almost fully occupied with occupancy at 99%. Including unconsolidated investments, our share of recurring NOI, loan income and fees increased by 17% to $130 million in the quarter from Q3 of last year. Overall, our U.S. market rate portfolio has an average loss to lease of 11% which, to put into context, could result in another $22 million of NOI to KW over time if captured. Post quarter end, we completed another $165 million of new originations, bringing our platform to $2.6 billion in loan investments, of which KW holds a 7% interest. In total, our global development and lease-up portfolio is expected to add $92 million to our estimated annual NOI and we anticipate that 83% of this will be in place by the end of 2024."
