    "content": " I'd like to point out that in Q2 of 2021, we had a $330 million gain related to selling a 49% interest in a portfolio of wholly owned multi-family assets. Our assets under management totaled $23 billion and is comprised of over 38,000 multi-family units and 26 million commercial square feet, including $2.6 billion of gross development projects, which 62% is represented by new construction of approximately 4,700 multi-family units. Including unconsolidated investments, our share of recurring NOI, loan income and fees increased by 33% to $130 million in the quarter from Q2 of last year. Overall, our U.S. market rate portfolio has an average loss to lease of 14%, which, to put into context, if fully captured, equates to an additional $27 million of NOI to KW over time. Post quarter end, we have completed another $220 million of net new loans, bringing our platform to $2.4 billion in loan investments, of which KW has a 7% interest. Our Q2 acquisitions added 1.9 million square feet, growing our premium portfolio to 6.5 million square feet in 18 months in Europe, with strong occupancy in excess of 97% and solid term certain of 6.8 years and 8.3 years to expiry, all notable achievements by the team. Including investments made through our fund and deals exchanged, we are on track to grow our European logistics platform to approximately $1.7 billion across 95 assets that make up 9.5 million square feet and generate $62 million of gross NOI."
