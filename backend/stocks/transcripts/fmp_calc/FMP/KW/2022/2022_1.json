    "content": " Operating results continue to improve, driven by robust tenant demand, the completion of construction, new acquisitions and increasing rental rates and asset values, all resulting in an improvement in our key financial metrics, including adjusted EBITDA, which increased by 25% from Q1 of last year and totals $160 million. We continue to allocate capital to these high-growth markets in Q2 and as Bill mentioned earlier, we recently acquired off-market another 1,100 units across three assets in Scottsdale, Albuquerque and Las Vegas for $418 million which brings our unique Mountain West portfolio up to almost 14,000 units. We have taken the occupancy from 79% at the end of Q4 2021 to 100% leased, including a recent signing of a new 14,000 square foot lease in Q1 and a further lease expected to close in Q2, driving growth in total estimated annual NOI to $18 million. Growth in fee-bearing capital in the quarter continues its upward trajectory, growing by 6% from year-end to $5.3 billion and up 29% from Q1 2021. Including investments made through our fund and deals under offer, we are on track to grow our European logistics platform to approximately $2 billion across 74 assets that make up approximately 10 million square feet and generate $66 million of NOI currently. So I would just pivot to something \u2013 I don't think we've talked about in a while, but clearly, Dublin occupancy rebound in multifamily, really an impressive snap back, right, in occupancy year-over-year, 6.4%, which kind of begs the question, the Sherbrooke hotel, how do you see that performing in a post-pandemic type of era?"
