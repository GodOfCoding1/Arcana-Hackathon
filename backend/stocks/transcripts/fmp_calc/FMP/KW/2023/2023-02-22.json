At year end, our industrial portfolio totals 109 assets across almost 11 million square feet, with total AUM of $1.7 billion. In 2022, we acquired 35 assets, totaling $500 million in this platform, representing 40% growth to $1.2 billion in assets and $400 million in fee-bearing capital, over 80% of our industrial portfolios in the UK where fundamentals remains strong in Q4. Occupancy in our portfolio remained strong at 98% as we completed 40 lease transactions, totaling 700,000 square feet last year, resulting in a 32% increase in rents. This will add significantly to our existing $5.9 billion of fee-bearing capital, which grew by 18% in 2022 and has doubled in the last 3 years."
