    "content": " In Q1, one hybrid cloud revenue grew 8% year-over-year, led by outstanding growth in our All-Flash-Array business, which increased 23% to an annualized net revenue run rate of $2.8. When combined, software revenue, recurring support, and public cloud revenue totaled $1.1 billion and increased 17% year-over-year, representing 73% of total revenue, versus 71% in Q1 21. We now expect revenues to grow 8% to 9% year-over-year with billings growth expected to outpace revenue growth, given the continued strength and recurring support contracts and our public cloud platform. Operating expense expectations remain unchanged at 2.75 to $2.8 billion, driven by continued investment in revenue-generating activities, including expanding our public cloud portfolio, targeted investments in go-to-market resources, and continued investment in our customer success sales team.
