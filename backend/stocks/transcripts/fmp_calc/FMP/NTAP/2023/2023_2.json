    "content": "  During today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s call, we will make forward-looking statements and projections with respect to our financial outlook and future prospects, such as our guidance for third quarter and fiscal year 2023, our expectations regarding future revenue, profitability, and shareholder returns, our alignment with industry megatrends and expectations regarding the future growth in the number of cloud customers and their usage of cloud services, our ability to deliver innovation and focus on our strategic growth opportunities while optimizing our operating costs, and our ability to drive sustained growth in both our Hybrid Cloud and Public Cloud segments in a turbulent macroeconomic environment, all of which involve risk and uncertainty. Actual results may differ materially for a variety of reasons, including macroeconomic and market conditions such as inflation, rising interest rates and foreign exchange volatility, the continuing impact and uneven recovery of the COVID-19 pandemic, including the resulting supply chain disruptions, and the IT capital spending environment, including the focus on optimization of cloud spending, as well as our ability to keep pace with the rapid industry, technological and market trends and changes in the markets in which we operate, execute our evolved cloud strategy and introduce and gain market acceptance for our products and services, and manage our gross profit margins and generate greater cash flow."
