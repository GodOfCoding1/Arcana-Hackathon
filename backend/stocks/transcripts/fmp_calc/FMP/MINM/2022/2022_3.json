    "content": " We ended the quarter with outstanding debt of $5.8 million, which was a drawdown on the company's $25 million line of credit, this compares with $5.6 million in outstanding debt as of June 30, 2022. Dustin, do you want to take that? What we've been doing is to make sure we, as I mentioned, even on the call, that there is no additional purchases, there's a limitation of purchases only buying high volume products or NTI and continue to burn down the $30 million of inventory that we have. And I suspect you all have investments in the company so I'm not picking on anybody for a lack of investment, but I thought with the stock price so low, if you all are so upbeat in the company's future, why the Board or senior management doesn't initiate their own stock purchases to bolster the price because \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and I'm not exactly sure what the float is. I know there's about $46 million outstanding, but I don't know if that's the float or is the float some lesser number where if you all bought a couple of million shares of stocks, it's $0.20 to $0.30, $0.40, even if the price gets driven up, why would you all be considering that? And then I also \u00e2\u0080\u0093 I did talk to James about it, but there was a day where I don't know, I don't remember how many shares traded in the last 60 days, I think, 12 million plus or minus shares traded in the stock price went to $0.38. So that's something that we're \u00e2\u0080\u0093 we mentioned even on the call that, that's been our goal into \u00e2\u0080\u0093 going into next year, and you'll see in the second half of the year probably as early as second quarter that some of those things are going to get executed and allow us to generate revenue and a reoccurring stream that we don't have today. Dustin, do you want to take that?"
