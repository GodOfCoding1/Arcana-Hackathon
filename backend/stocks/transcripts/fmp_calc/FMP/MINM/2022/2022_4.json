The workforce reductions have already been implemented - they were executed and closed as of end of this quarter, so we anticipate the savings effective April 1 and go forward, including all the restructuring costs, have all been booked at this point into the Q1 numbers, so going forward that should result into future savings that we mentioned, around roughly 20% annualized, so that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s one aspect that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s already been done. To withdraw your question, you may press star and two. We do intend to get there, we expect to get there this year, and so obviously we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve worked on our AP, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve worked on our inventory and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re working on our cash balance, so it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all coming to that one direction as we try to right our financial statements."
