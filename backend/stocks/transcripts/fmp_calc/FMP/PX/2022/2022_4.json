    "content": " And so I would certainly direct questions to Crossroads, but given where we started 18 months ago with a clean slate, now having hundreds of millions of dollars deployed at what we think are great returns, great risk-adjusted returns and really importantly, the impact that this portfolio generates, we think, is second to none. And to the extent that institutions are wanting to commit capital maybe for the first time to things like GP stakes and NAV lending, lower middle market private equity, venture capital, impact equity, venture credit, to the extent they are looking to commit those and those are more structural, less cyclical, we pop up as top of the list. And so given we do have things like NAV lending, impact credit, GP stakes and venture credits that are growing faster than P10 as a whole, it's that balance where we certainly are getting paid more on every fee-paying dollar, but we also are giving up a little bit of margin."
