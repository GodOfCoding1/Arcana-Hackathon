    "content": " So the new dividend quarterly dividend of $0.03 if we look forward, or should we think of you in the future kind of targeting payout range with growth 20%, 25% or is there anything that we can think of as we look ahead, to kind of peg that too, and then maybe the second part of that is with the repurchase of the options, does that flow through to this, just want to check is that flows through to the share count so all else being equal say like a million odd shares exceeding commodity adjusted share count next quarter. So if you fresh my memory, is 55% kind of exiting the year or if you're thinking 55% average for the full year, which would imply obviously, a big margin step up over the next couple of quarters and given the fundraising goals you have and fact that they may be more backend loaded this year and into next year."
