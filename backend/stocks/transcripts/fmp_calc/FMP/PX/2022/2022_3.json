    "content": " When Bonaccord Fund II began charging fees, Bonaccord Fund I's fee rate methodology changed from committed capital to invested capital, causing a temporary step-down in fee-paying AUM of $206 million. We anticipate recapturing all of that fee-paying AUM, as Bonaccord Fund I is fully committed and will deploy its remaining capital over the next year, primarily in the second and third quarters of 2023, with a small portion of approximately $25 million deployed during 2024 and 2025. Operating expenses in the third quarter were $39.7 million, a 47% increase over the same period a year ago, primarily driven by an increase in compensation and benefits expense, which relates to the additional compensation expense from the Bonaccord and Hark acquisitions as well as an additional $4.5 million of acquisition-related stock-based compensation expense for the restricted stock grants to employees of Hark and Bonaccord due to fundraising performance this year. We expect additional acquisition-related expenses over the next few years up to a maximum of $19 million in total, depending on fundraising performance for Bonaccord Funds II and III. GAAP net income in the third quarter was $5.6 million, a 38% increase when compared to the year ago period. Adjusted EBITDA in the third quarter was $27.8 million, a 28% increase over what we reported in the third quarter of 2021. For the third quarter adjusted net income, ANI, was $25.1 million, a 56% increase over the $16.2 million reported in the third quarter of 2021. Concurrent with the WTI acquisition closing last month, we closed on an additional $125 million of debt through the accordion feature of our existing credit facility, of which $87.5 million was available in term loan debt and $37.5 million available under the existing revolver with the same terms."
