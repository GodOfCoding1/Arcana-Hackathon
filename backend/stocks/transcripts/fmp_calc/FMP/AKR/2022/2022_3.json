    "content": " And this positive momentum is being driven by our street leasing with approximately 70% of the leases executed or renewed this quarter coming from our street portfolio, resulting in a 150 basis point increase in sequential leased occupancy to 92% at September 30 with leased occupancy gains of 210 basis points in New York, 190 basis points in Washington, D.C., and 140 basis points in Chicago. And as a reminder, our 5% to 10% multiyear growth has always and continues to reflect our rollover assumptions across our portfolio, including our core assets in North Michigan Avenue in Chicago, which given the dynamics and realities of the submarket, our two core assets will likely be part of a redevelopment as we explore alternative usages and formats. In terms of future funding and capital allocation, the projected cost to fund the $30 million to $40 million of projected core NOI growth over the next several years is about $100 million and we expect to self-fund these costs. Furthermore, over the next 18 months or so we anticipate generating $150 million to $200 million of proceeds from a variety of sources, including retained cash flow from the REIT, repayments from our lending book, the continued monetization of fund assets, including all or a portion of our Albertson's investment, along with the possibility for a handful of strategic core asset dispositions. At September 30, we have approximately $850 million at our pro rata share of core interest rate swap contracts that expire at various points over the next several years with a weighted average duration of about 5.5 years and fixes our current all-in borrowing costs at about 4%. One moment for our next question, please. One moment for our next question, please."
