    "content": " And now while it's a little early to provide 2023 guidance, I did want to provide an update on our continued expectation of 5% to 10% multi-year core internal growth. And the 360 basis points equates to about $6.7 million of ABR and $8.3 million of NOI, representing about 5% of embedded growth, with over 85% of these leases expected to commence in the second half of the year, with the majority in the fourth quarter, which results in about 15% of the $8.3 million of NOI showing up in 2022 and the balance in 2023. And we are seeing similar strength across the high growth markets that Ken discussed, which compromise (sic) , as he mentioned, the majority of our street portfolio with growth in Washington DC of about 40% along with double-digit growth in LA, Armitage Avenue and Rush & Walton in Chicago, along with Greenwich and Westport, Connecticut, as well as our most recent acquisitions in Williamsburg, Dallas and City Point which are further complementing this growth. In addition to the 3% contractual growth, our street leases have a shorter duration along with fair market value resets, where on average we have an opportunity to mark-to-market our leases in under five years as compared to nearly 15 years in our suburban portfolio. Again, we don't think this 6% yield is indicative of where the market is for that kind of a high quality asset, with Trader Joe's and Target and everything else that Amy discussed in terms of the future growth, well beyond the 6s."
