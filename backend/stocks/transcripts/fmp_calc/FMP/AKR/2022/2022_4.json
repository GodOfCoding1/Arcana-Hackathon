    "content": " So while overall, we're about 95% leased within our much higher rent than dollar value street and urban Portfolio, physical occupancy is still only 89%, and based on the increasing demand and leasing progress on most of those streets, we are well positioned for multi-year growth here. Secondly, we increased the physical occupancy in our core portfolio by 270 basis points with solid rent cash rent spreads, resulting in 6.3% same store ROI growth, which exceeded the upper end of our guidance. First, our same store guidance is unadjusted for the headwinds from prior period cash collections, which I estimate will have a negative drag of about 200 basis points or said differently our 5% to 6% of projected same store growth would've been closer to 7% to 8% absent the headwinds from prior period cash collections. Our historical credit loss, excluding periods impacted by the pandemic has ranged between 50 to 150 basis points, and while we have yet to see any significant signs of retailer distress or declines in our monthly cash collections, given the realities of the macro environment, our 5% to 6% projection of same store growth, conservatively factors in 150 basis points of a general credit loss. Now keep in mind, as I shared a few moments ago, our assumptions related to these tenants are separate and in addition to the 150 basis points of credit loss that I discussed earlier, as a reminder, we have two Bed Bath locations and one Regal Cinemas in our core portfolio with an aggregate exposure of approximately 3% of ABR."
