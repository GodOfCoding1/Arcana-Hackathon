    "content": " As revenues have increased much more than expenses during the first 9 months of the year, which have increased 10% mainly due to 3 reasons: a 17% increase in technology costs and new ventures, which include the technology expenses for our digital transformation as well as new investments in payments; a 9% increase in personnel cost, which is mainly coming from the increase in mandatory employee profit sharing in line with improvement of the local GAAP earnings; and a 14% increase in variable costs related mainly to credit cards and in line with the percentage increase in credit and debit cards turnover, which generates fee and financing volumes."
