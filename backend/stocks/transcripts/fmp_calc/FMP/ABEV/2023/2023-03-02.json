    "content": " In Canada, despite market share gains in beer, we were unable to grow volumes on the back of a weak industry and normalized EBITDA declined about 4%; thanks to commodity and full inflation, more than offsetting net revenue growth. And regarding specifically the Manaus free trade zone, in addition to what we've publicly stated and disclosed, it's worth reminding everyone that these tax incentives are set forth in the Brazilian constitution, and our subsidiary, ADosuko  has been producing concentrate for Guarana Antarctica and other non-alcoholic beverages in the region for over 20 years, investing in our local production capacity, sourcing Guarana seeds locally as well as generating jobs for local communities. And in terms of what should be different from last year, number one, although input cost pressure remains a headwind, we expect our cash COGS per hectoliter for Brazil Beer, excluding non-Ambev marketplace products to grow between 6% and 9.9% for the year, which is significantly lower than the 16.6% growth in 2022. Thank you very much. In Q4, okay, what we saw was in terms of the Brazilian real hedges, we actually didn't see an increment, because although the exposure was higher in Q4 of 2022 versus Q4 of 2021, the carry cost in Q4 of 2021 was already around 7%, a little over 7%, which was also the case for Q4 of 2022. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you very much."
