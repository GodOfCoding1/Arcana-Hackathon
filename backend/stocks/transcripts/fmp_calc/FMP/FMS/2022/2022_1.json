    "content": " And Latin America revenue increased by 15% in the first quarter, mainly driven by strong organic growth in both the healthcare services and healthcare products business. Here, we show the operating margin development for the first quarter with 180 basis points, the largest impact on margins year-over-year relates to adverse developments in business growth driven by the already mentioned negative effects of COVID-19 on the utilization of our clinics and downstream assets. But I think there's got to be a reality factor here that people understand that we're going through the highest inflation, particularly in the U.S. at the moment, but really worldwide that we've had in years, and we can't just see there an act like it's not happening, and we don't intend to do that. I think for us, obviously, what we're keeping a mindful eye on is measures do we need to put in place that are helping to overcome the challenges, but that are more temporary in nature for 2022 versus -- which is things like retention measures, for example, or onetime sign-on payments versus permanent measures, which are more of the things that we're seeing on wage compression and trying to -- as we fill those positions."
