    "content": " The success from our previously announced 2022 plan to raise $30 million of non-dilutive capital, the $7.5 million investment from the recent public offering combined with our plan to significantly reduce our inventory exposure should position Greenlane to be properly capitalized well into 2023 where we intend to inflect to profitability. Looking to the company's balance sheet, we saw the company move as significant portion of its inventory in 2022 through to the third quarter of the year, with a $19 million decrease in inventory, which was driven by strategic initiatives, designed to deplete third-party, lower margin products as well as lower purchases of inventory during the quarter, as a result of the decrease in revenues. Now we are able to see some of the fruits of those efforts come into play where we are going to watch inventory sort of reduce naturally under these initiatives, that's going to bring money back into working capital and it's going to fuel us to run the business and invest in the new product areas that I'd turn it over to Craig, that Craig is leading today. And so I think moving the business right now from a part of the supply chain that's going to be coming under more and more increasing price pressure, and that's on the industrial side into the consumer side, which becomes a more accretive revenue and margin opportunity as these current climate dynamics play out is a really smart move on our part."
