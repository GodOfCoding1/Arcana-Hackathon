    "content": " We\u2019re confident that if all of these measures are successful that we can generate in excess of $30 million of non-dilutive capital, which we estimate will be enough to get us to positive adjusted EBITDA and hopefully beyond as the equity capital markets continue to languish amid rising interest rates and inflation, the devastating geopolitical and humanitarian situation in Ukraine, and additional supply disruptions caused by China\u2019s recent COVID lockdowns. And then second question for me, just moving up north to Canada \u2013 I know a lot more focus is on the U.S. now but could you just remind us where you see the Canadian market right now in terms of where it fits for the Greenlane, particularly because it\u2019s still a very competitive market? You talked about lower margin products there historically so is that still one where you\u2019re looking to maybe shift away focus right now, especially as you look to be a little more asset-light and focus on profitability."
