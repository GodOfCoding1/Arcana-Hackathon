I'd now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Mr. Matthew Dodds, LivaNova's Senior Vice President of Corporate Development. Joining me on today's call are Damien McDonald, our Chief Executive Officer; Alex Shvartsburg, our Chief Financial Officer; and Briana Gotlin, Director of Investor Relations. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that the discussions during this call will include forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are discussed in the company's most recent filings in documents furnished to the SEC, including today's press release that is available on our website. Also, the discussions will include certain non-GAAP financial measures with respect to our performance, including, but not limited to, sales results, which will all be stated on a constant currency basis. Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in today's press release, which is available on our website. In the quarter, we achieved 5% revenue growth, reflecting solid execution in Neuromodulation and Cardiopulmonary. More broadly, as a company, we continue to navigate macro headwinds, including supply chain, inflation and foreign exchange volatility. For the Cardiopulmonary segment, revenue was $121 million, an increase of 7% versus the third quarter of 2021. Oxygenator revenue grew in the high-single digits, driven by continued procedure volume recovery. This range considered the strong performance in the first nine months of the year and continued demand for the S5 HLM, particularly in the rest of world region. Epilepsy revenue increased 11% versus the third quarter of 2021, with growth across all three regions. This performance was primarily driven by replacement implants, as well as improving market dynamics and focused commercial strategies. US epilepsy revenue increased 9% year-over-year, with total implants up mid-single digits with price contributing the balance. Similar to prior-quarter trends, total implant growth was driven by replacements which continue to benefit from a catch up in procedures deferred due to COVID related challenges. Additionally, both new patient and replacement implants improved sequentially. US epilepsy results continue to be supported by our go-to-market initiative, which currently encompasses 14 dedicated CEC teams. Epilepsy revenue in Europe grew 6% versus prior year, primarily led by the Nordic region as acute pandemic impact softened. The rest of the world region achieved 28% growth, led by Brazil. For the full year, we now expect global epilepsy revenue to grow 6% to 8%. Our forecast includes sequential growth in new patient implants in the fourth quarter, as we expect healthcare related challenges to modestly improve. In addition, we anticipate a continued tailwind in replacement implant related to the backlog created during the pandemic. ACS revenue was $9 million in the quarter, representing a decrease of 44% from the third quarter of 2021. Results were impacted by continued reduction in severe COVID cases, hospital-related challenges and product mix. Our field data suggests ACS case volumes related to COVID declined more than 90% year-over-year, as fewer hospitalized patients progressed to a severity that required ECMO therapy. Notably, ACS non-COVID case volumes increased more than 20% year-over-year. Before turning to the ACS outlook, I wanted to provide a brief update on the field action and related Class I recall. Importantly, the FDA is not requiring that we remove the product from the field and the device is considered safe for use when used in accordance with the operations manual. And before year-end, we expect to release a software upgrade to address the screen error message. For the full-year 2022, we now expect ACS revenue to be down approximately 30%. And for 2022, we now anticipate DTD revenue of approximately $8 million. As stated previously, we believe a series of interim analyses is likely needed as we collect patient follow-up data over time. Our interim analyses for the unipolar cohort to date have confirmed the study's continuation, with the next interim look at 400 patients expected by the end of this month. In heart failure, ANTHEM-HFrEF US pivotal trial continues to advance. The independent statistical analysis committee will conduct the next interim analysis after the 500th patient is enrolled, which we anticipate will occur in the fourth quarter, with a read-out early in the first quarter of 2023. If all the pre-specified conditions are met, including safety, a trend towards the primary composite endpoint and success in the three functional endpoints, we would expect to submit the functional data to the FDA. As planned, the Supreme Court hearing took place on October 5 regarding the appeals of liability and damages, and we anticipate a decision in the first half of 2023. During my portion of the call, I'll share a brief recap of the third quarter results and provide commentary on the full-year 2022 outlook. Turning to results, revenue in the quarter was $253 million, a 5% increase versus 2021. Adjusted gross margin as a percent of net revenue was 70%, which was in line with third quarter of 2021. Adjusted gross margin was favorably impacted by product mix, offset by supply chain challenges and inflationary pressures. R&D as a percent of net revenue was 16%, up from 15% in the third quarter of 2021. While sequentially flat, the year-over-year increase was driven by lower spend in the prior-year period. SG&A as a percent of net revenue was 39%, up from 37% in the third quarter of 2021. Similarly, the SG&A increase was driven by lower spend in variable expenses and marketing costs in the prior-year period. Adjusted operating income margin was 15%, down from 18% in the third quarter of 2021. Lastly, in the quarter, we recorded a $129 million non-cash goodwill impairment charge for the ACS reporting unit to reflect current market conditions, which is excluded from our non-GAAP results. Our cash balance at September 30 was $506 million, up from $208 million at year-end 2021. Total debt at September 30 was $540 million, up from $240 million at year-end 2021. We are maintaining our guidance ranges shared in August as we continue to navigate supply chain challenges, the inflationary environment and anticipated foreign currency headwinds. We expect constant currency revenue growth between 4% to 6%, excluding heart valves, and adjusted EPS range of $2.25 to $2.45 and an adjusted free cash flow range of $60 million to $80 million. Let's open it up for questions, Charlie. Help us think through both the drivers of performance this quarter, the C team contribution to growth. Overall, I'd say, first and foremost, if the market we do think improved a bit in the third quarter, some of the bottleneck at the EMU, we think, loosened up a bit. It's still an issue, but we think it improved a bit. Your question on our go-to-market, we increase the implants from 22% to 20%. I would say, looking at what we have left on the EOS, again, it's not perfect math. As s you can tell from the quarter, EOS was very strong both year-over-year and sequentially. For next year, we're not giving guidance yet on any specifics. But as I think you can surmise, we do not expect EOS to have quite the same performance in 2023. So, we're looking for the new patient growth to accelerate next year. Both in the community and the CECs, which is why we're pleased with the continued pod structure performance, it's still outperforming the baseline business considerably. I think we're at roughly 30%, 35% of the CECs are covered. And that's up, again, another couple of percentage points. I know you're not ready to give guidance, you just said it. Just at a high level, maybe Damien, you could talk through. No touchy feely, but hoping you can give us something as we start to put our \u00e2\u0080\u0093 revisit our models today. We've seen it opening up in the US, as Matt just said, the EMUs are putting patients through a little more proactively. So, I think, overall, I'd say procedure trends are looking positive. I think the macro factors are going to continue to remain challenging that the supply chain, inflation, foreign exchange. And we know that that's an important factor for us, that heart lung machines and rest of the world continue to track well. And even though we're launching Essenz, the rest of world, most of those markets don't come online for Essenz until 2025, 2026. So, seeing the continued growth of HLMs there is important. I'd say looking at the consensus for 2023, though, I don't believe people have fully factored in the foreign exchange impact on the current rates. Just looking at sort of the timing of when the FX really started to trend in the wrong direction for us, in terms of sort of the estimates, we see a potential of $0.05 to $0.10 EPS impact In terms of the negative FX. I'm curious on the Essenz launch, next gen HLM. And in terms of supply chain, we're actually pretty confident about the material for the first units, both through the clinical cases and then the limited commercial release. So, I think that's progressing well. The follow-up on ACS, understand the kind of evolving case mix dynamics, looking at the revenue sequentially, down a bit, but round numbers kind of in the $9 million a quarter range. When you look at the third quarter, Damien highlighted, we were down 44%. We think, based on third-party data, the market was down 30%. So, we were down a little more this quarter. Remember last year, we said COVID was 40% of the procedures in the third quarter of 2021. I would say the other couple of things that impacted the quarter, the issue we had with the reclassification that came at the end of the quarter, but the sales force was dealing with it because we put the letter out in July. And then, I'd say, finally, there's been some additional competition on the cannula side that's impacted us a little bit. For the fourth quarter, we do expect probably a modest improvement. Matt, at 375, just based on the trial design, there has to be some separation. But, overall, when you look at, the trial was designed to run at the full 500 patients and still hit the statistical significance. For stopping early, the original paper did suggest that there were odds of this, but we've always assumed it would occur later in the year. Overall, we still think there's a very good chance we stop early. If we don't stop early, we would essentially have to run the full 500 12 months. At this point in time, we're not certain that we would be allowed to shift to a registry, but that's not clear. Your SG&A and R&D \u00e2\u0080\u0093 or I guess, OpEx overall was up a fair bit. And I heard Alex's explanation was that it was lower last year, but I guess, conversely, it was higher this year. If you recall last year, we were sort of heading into the Omicron stage of the pandemic. So if you look, it's really just the phasing and timing of spending. On the question of, when we hit the third quarter, we did say some of the third quarter expense will move into Q4 at that point. As far as sleep apnea goes with OSPREY, so if you're submitting the data, I think you said you expect to submit it late next year. Because it's a pivotal, it would have to be in line with the FDA approving and then finding a venue for that at the appropriate sleep apnea conference. They grew low-double digit year-on-year and above the 2019 levels, which was important. And that for us was an important step, and I think the best NPI performance year-on-year for this year, year-to-date. So, overall, I continue to expect the NPIs to improve sequentially. The expectation is that we hit the 500th patient somewhere, mid to late Q4 we'll have the data. So, the nine month safety data, the primary endpoint, advancing on the composite mortality and morbidity, and the functional endpoints, which left ventricular ejection fraction, six minute walk and quality of life. But we're, again, very confident about safety given we've been part of over 125,000 of these. So, it's really the other four that we're looking for green lights at this time. It's probably a bit higher, Phil. Again, we're sort of lapping, I'd say, the first half of the year, which was probably less impacted by FX. Flipping back to the RECOVER trial, interested kind of more qualitatively what the implication is of the trial running a little bit longer before early completion versus what you've kind of messaged previously in that 325 to 375 range. In terms of where we are in the trial versus the original trial design, because of COVID, where we are in the average follow-up number of patients that have reached 12 months, we're still a little bit behind at this stage of 375, where we thought we would be in the in the original design. So, you can't look at time in response and the different percentages between a control arm and a therapy arm versus other depression trials because nobody else has used that. So, we still think that the spread or the difference between the two arms can be very powerful. And any of the three scenarios we laid out, overall, you need to see the full data set, ultimately, to, I think, better compare it to other depression trials. Even though we're at 375 or approaching 400, the number of patient months accrued is a little bit lower than what you would have anticipated previously because of the impacts of COVID and it sounds like there's still some \u00e2\u0080\u0093 definitely feel like the potential for the powering of this study, if successful, is still there with some confounding factors through the last couple of years? That and the number of patients that are at 12 months completion \u00e2\u0080\u0093 they're called completers as the PIs call it, so both the numbers are still slightly behind. And again, I think it's important, the paper was studied \u00e2\u0080\u0093 powered to run to 500 patients. And on behalf of the entire team, we appreciate your support and interest in LivaNova and we look forward to updating you on the Q4 results in the new year. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's call."
