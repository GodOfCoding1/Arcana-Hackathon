    "content": " For the cardiopulmonary segment, revenue was $126 million, an increase of 14% versus the second quarter of 2021. As a reminder, our heart valve business was divested on June 1 of last year and heart valve revenue for the second quarter of 2021 was $15 million. Revenue in the quarter was $254 million, a 7% increase versus 2021, excluding heart valves. Adjusted operating income was 13%, down from 14% for the second quarter of 2021 as a result of product and geographic revenue mix and supply chain pressures, including inflation. We now expect constant currency revenue growth between 4% to 6%, excluding heart valves, an adjusted EPS range of $2.25 to $2.45 and an adjusted free cash flow range of $60 million to $80 million. I feel like we've seen sort of the strong performance from the cardiopulmonary business in the first half, which gives us confidence that we can achieve this guide with epilepsy, where we still believe that we could achieve the 5% to 7% growth range."
