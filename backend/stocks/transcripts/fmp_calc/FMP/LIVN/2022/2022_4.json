Turning to results, revenue in the quarter was $275 million, an increase of 6% versus 2021. For 2023, this 3% to 5% is really looking at a decline in end of service as we previously discussed as we anniversary into this \u00e2\u0080\u0093 the backlog of the COVID delayed cases, and then we're expecting sequential improvement in the NPIs throughout the year."
