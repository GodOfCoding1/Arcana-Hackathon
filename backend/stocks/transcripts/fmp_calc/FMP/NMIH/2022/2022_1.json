    "content": " National MI continued to outperform in the first quarter, delivering significant new business production, strong growth in our high-quality and short portfolio, record financial results, and continued success in the capital and reinsurance markets. Overall, we delivered strong results for the quarter, with significant new business production, an increasing persistency, driving growth in our high-quality insured portfolio, and favorable credit performance and expense discipline driving significant profitability and strong mid-teen returns. And we'll look to be programmatic, in how we layer on risk protection in the portfolio still going forward, but now we've got another outlet for us to consider and -- so we feel we got we found a better outlet in the excess of loss market, and that's something we'll consider each time we're looking to transact in future periods."
