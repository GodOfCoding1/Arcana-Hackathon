    "content": " National MI continued to outperform in the third quarter delivering significant new business production, strong growth in our high-quality insured portfolio, continued success in the reinsurance market and record financial results. And while the labor market currently stands as a bright spot, and existing homeowners are well positioned with strong credit profiles, record levels of home equity and sustainable fixed payment obligations at record low mortgage rates, we would expect unemployment to rise and an increasing number of households to face stress in the event of a recession. We delivered record financial results in the third quarter with strong new business volume, significant growth in our insured portfolio, continued resiliency in our credit performance and expense efficiency driving record profitability. Book value per share, excluding the impact of net unrealized gains and losses in the investment portfolio was $20.85, up 5% compared to the second quarter and 19% compared to the third quarter of last year."
