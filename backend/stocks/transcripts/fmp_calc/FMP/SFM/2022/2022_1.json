    "content": " I think grocers did an amazing job through the pandemic as we did, but we inevitably became less farmers market feel because people aren't able to drive excitement in the store when you come in and do sampling and taste some of the products and get some of the new products into people's mouths, we see that as a significant opportunity for us to drive that basket back. It's about how we flow the goods into the store, which we've got -- I think we said in Chip's remarks or my remarks, we talked a lot about how we're investing in technology to try and make it easier for the stores to get in stock the way we want to do.
