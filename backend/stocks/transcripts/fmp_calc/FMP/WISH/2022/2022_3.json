    "content": " The remarks made today include forward-looking statements that are related to, among other things, our financial expectations, business and turnaround plans, the turnaround timeline, consumer experience and engagement, expectations regarding merchant relationships and strategic partnerships; the potential impact of our strategic, marketing and product initiatives, including ad spending and the rebrand; and the anticipated return on our investments and their ability to drive future growth. Stepping into the interim CEO role two months ago, I was immediately impressed by how much the Wish team has done in strengthening the foundation of Wish over the course of one year, improve app experiences, reduce shipping time and improve on-time delivery rate, adopt a new pricing practice for buyers, implement new commission structures for merchants, launch a rebrand campaign, relaunch our women\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fashion category, and this list goes on. Total revenues were $125 million, down 66% from the third quarter of 2021, mostly driven by lower ad spend and our new pricing practice which was fully effective in Q3. As I said, Q3 is the first quarter where that new pricing practice is implemented globally, and going forward it will be consistent, but if you compare our Q3 and Q4 performance to last year, before we started this change, it would be apples to oranges in terms of top line performance."
