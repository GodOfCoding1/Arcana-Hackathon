    "content": " We expect lower free cash flow year-over-year, continued earnings growth and strong services collections are offset by disbursements, but we expect free cash flow conversion to remain solid. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re expecting organic revenue growth in the high single-digit range, $1.60 to $2 for adjusted EPS, which includes about $4.2 billion to $4.8 billion of adjusted profit and a range of $3.4 billion to $4.2 billion for free cash flow. Just wanted to ask about cash flow sort of through the year and also the uses of your cash, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s something maybe refreshing to talk about for the first time in a few years, but on the cash flow through the year, when we think about the seasonality, I think you had sort of free cash was minus $900 million first quarter a year ago. To the power, I have to just start by saying looking at where we landed the year and what the team delivered, $1.2 billion of profit and 7.5% of op margin, really getting to high-single digits, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s quite an achievement. I think as we look at margins next year, rather this year, we would expect they would be flat, but the revenue growth will give us an opportunity to drive profit growth up, call it, 15%. That said, we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to suggest that we are immune with 60% of revenue now and services tied to those real-time dynamics we are watching carefully, but we wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be guiding a high-single digit top line number this year if we weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t confident that our positioning both with the aerospace recovery and the energy transition sets us up to do well here in \u00e2\u0080\u009823."
