    "content": " At the same time, higher inflation, currency and investments are impacting operating profit, which we now expect to be $2.6 billion or more and we expect free cash flow in a range of $2.1 billion to $2.3 billion based on the higher inventory build to meet demand in the fourth quarter and into 2023. And Andy, I think our current intent now that we have just come out of our strat plan cycle, and are heading into budgets here over the next several weeks is to effectively do what we've, I think, done in the last several years and provide that forward-looking outlook cash and everything else at fourth quarter earnings in January. We have led the last several years, as you know well, here in North America in the U.S. And I think all you're really seeing is do with respect to the restructuring, the selectivity efforts and the change in our product road maps is to really make sure that we are in a position to lead through this order's trough, particularly in North America, but come out of it not only with better products, better value propositions, better cost structures but ultimately, better performance as we move forward here, both for our customers and investors. And so I really want to try to understand the path for normalizing free cash flow in the healthcare business because -- it seems like you're running about $1.4 billion behind this year as of the middle of the year, things will only improve a little bit sequentially in the third quarter."
