    "content": " I think it's important to remember that these products are highly complex, remain without any generics and are in line with Amphastar's business model  challenging to develop products in hopes of increasing patient access to these high-in-demand products while benefiting from its difficulty as it creates market sustainability, insulating our portfolio from substantial price erosion and product sales life cycles that occur with traditional generic products. As for intranasal epinephrine, another proprietary product representing a potential plus $1 billion market opportunity, the pipeline candidate continues to progress well within several studies and discussions with the agency. As we have seen with previous approvals and launches, such as the impressive execution on Primatene Mist, epinephrine and glucagon, all of which were exampled in recent quarters in driving growth while being supplemented with our high-in-demand IMS products, we are confident that challenges met to approvals remain within the company's reach to overcome. Just looking at a couple of the individual products and performance of the quarter, specifically lidocaine, epinephrine, I know you mentioned strong unit sales, but the numbers are just kind of so far above historical levels and baseline."
