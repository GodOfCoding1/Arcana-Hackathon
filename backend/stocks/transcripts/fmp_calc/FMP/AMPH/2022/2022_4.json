    "content": " As announced in our press release and financial results published earlier today, our net revenues for the fiscal year have reached a new high at $499 million, reflecting a significant 14% increase with a corresponding 25% increase in gross profit. Primatene MIST continues to show strong sales growth during the quarter with sales up of $22.3 million, up from $21.5 million in the prior year. Epinephrine showed strong sales in the fourth quarter amid continued shortages by our competitors, growing to $21.4 million from $18.9 million in the previous year's period. Other finished pharmaceutical product sales totaled $33.1 million, up 52% from 2021 as the company recorded stronger sales of sodium bicarbonate, dextrose and isoproterenol, while benefiting from the 2022 launches of vasopressin and ganirelix. Gross margins increased significantly to 53% of revenues in the fourth quarter of 2022 from 47% of revenues in the fourth quarter of 2021 due to strong sales of higher margin products like Primatene MIST, glucagon, and epinephrine. Non-operating income in the fourth quarter of 2022 was $3.4 million, primarily related to the -- gain on foreign currency compared to the prior quarter's non-operating income of $2.9 million, which was primarily related to a legal settlement. The company recorded net income of $33.9 million or $0.66 per share, which is up 72% and 66% respectively, compared to the previous year's fourth quarter net income of $19.8 million or $0.39 per share."
