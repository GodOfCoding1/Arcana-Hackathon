    "content": " Some other steps we've taken to deal with this slower market in general and the uncertainty includes postponing further debt reductions until the housing market stabilizes, re-underwriting all of our existing land and option contracts to make sure that they still make sense even if the market deteriorates a little further from the current market conditions, temporarily suspending most of our new land acquisitions, slowing land development spend on land that we already own on a community-by-community basis where we don't want improvements to get too far ahead of our needs, and reviewing our staffing needs on a division-by-division basis."
