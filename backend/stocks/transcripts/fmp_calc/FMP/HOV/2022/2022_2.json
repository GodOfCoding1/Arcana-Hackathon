    "content": " Moving to the right hand portion of the slide, you can see that our adjusted gross margin increased 530 basis points to 26.6% this year, compared to 21.3% in last year\u2019s second quarter. In the left hand portion of this slide, you can see that our SG&A was 9.7% for the second quarter, compared to 11.7% in last year\u2019s second quarter. While we\u2019re not going to review our multiyear key metric targets that we discussed last quarter, I will note that when we prepared those key metric targets, we assumed and showed that our pace and gross margins would eventually decline to lower, more normal levels. Although we continue to raise home prices in many communities, during the month of May, if mortgage rates rise further, going forward it\u2019s reasonable to expect moderation in both, current sales pace and in home prices. For the second quarter of \u201822, our cancellation rate was 17% compared to 16% in last year\u2019s second quarter."
