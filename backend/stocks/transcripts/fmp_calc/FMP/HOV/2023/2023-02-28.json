    "content": " As you can see on slide 6, starting in the upper left-hand corner, this led to a 9% decline in revenues in the first quarter of fiscal 2023 compared to 2022. However, because of the strength of our backlog, recent improvements in home sales pace and above average gross margins on both new contracts and in backlog, we expect better financial performance for the remainder of the year, and we'll give some more specific guidance on our next quarter toward the end of the call. To enhance affordability of our homes and define the market clearing home prices, gross margins were adversely impacted by a 470 basis point increase in incentives and concessions compared to our first quarter last year. On the right-hand portion of the slide, you can see that our net income for the first quarter of 2023 was $19 million, which included a $6 million tax benefit from energy-efficient home credits compared to $25 million in net income in last year's first quarter. On the left-hand portion of the slide, you can see that contracts per community for the first quarter are down significantly compared to a year ago, but are close to the level we achieved in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 before COVID. On Slide 20, we show our percentage of lots controlled by option increased from 44% in the first quarter of fiscal 2015 to 71% in the first quarter of fiscal 2023."
