    "content": " As mentioned previously, our methodology for valuing all of our debt investments, are to take into account changes in credit metrics during the quarter, any change in the perceived credit risk, and we adjust our yield return expectations accordingly. So that affected the overall average slightly -- you had one of our larger positions Barry, that was an attractive investment for us that was above the average yield, and that came off in the fourth -- during the fourth calendar quarter, and then there's also a bit of a lag as far as us benefiting from the increase in SOFR, during the quarter because of the three month contracts."
