    "content": " The primary drivers of the variance to 2021 actuals for the third quarter were, a decrease in G&A expenses of $3.5 million, primarily driven by a decrease in people costs, interest expense increased by $4.3 million due to higher interest rates and an increase in the second lien term loan and FDP partnership loan balances, same-store NOI increased by $1.5 million, but was offset by a decrease of $1.2 million in non-same-store NOI, following the sale of our interest in Gloucester Premium Outlets and a decrease of $700,000 in lease termination revenue."
