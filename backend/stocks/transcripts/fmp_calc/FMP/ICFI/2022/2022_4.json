    "content": " First, our strong year-on-year increases in service revenue up 24% for the quarter and 15.8% for 2022, which reflected double-digit organic growth across our key growth markets in the aggregate was the impact of 2 -- of our 2 acquisitions that benefited revenues from federal government clients. As expected, offsets like lower facility costs, administration efficiencies and effective tax strategies enabled us to report substantial growth in non-GAAP EPS for both the fourth quarter and full year of 2022 and the midpoint of our 2023 non-GAAP EPS guidance points to 9.2% year-on-year growth. Revenues from federal government clients increased 45.6% year-on-year in the fourth quarter, comprised of 15.4% organic growth plus the contributions from our Creative and SemanticBits acquisitions. Revenues from state and local governments increased 7% in the fourth quarter, reflecting year-on-year growth in both disaster management and environmental services in support of infrastructure projects. After a fourth quarter of record contract awards, we ended 2022 with a business development pipeline of over $8.5 billion, 20% higher than 1 year ago, in part due to revenue synergy opportunities related to the 2 larger acquisitions that we completed in 2022. Our fourth quarter total revenue increased 22.6% to $475.6 million, and our service revenue was up 24% to $339.1 million, which led by a strong year-over-year revenue performance from our federal, state and local and commercial energy client categories. Primarily for the same reasons I just mentioned, we delivered a fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA margin on service revenue of 16.3%, 240 basis points ahead of the comparable period last year. Conversely, this year's fourth quarter non-GAAP EPS increased 31.1% to $1.56, up from $1.19 per share in the fourth quarter of 2021."
