    "content": " The strongest year-on-year revenue comparisons in the first quarter were in our federal government business which was up 25%, reflecting organic growth across our growth markets and the acquisition of Creative Systems and Consulting which we completed at the end of 2021. We also saw strong year-on-year growth of 14% in revenues from state and local government clients which represented both our work in the disaster management arena and our climate, environmental and infrastructure services. As expected, we saw modestly lower first quarter revenue comparisons given the timing of the startup and wind down of various programs as well as our exceptional 12% growth in the first quarter of 2021. In this year's first quarter, revenue from energy efficiency programs increased 1.3% and energy markets advisory work was steady year-on-year. To sum up, in the first quarter, we continue to expand our capabilities, backlog and pipeline in key growth areas which we expect to progressively increase as a percentage of ICF service revenue in the periods ahead, supporting our expectations for substantial growth in 2022 and beyond. To start, our 2022 first quarter total revenue increased 9.2% to $413.5 million which is inclusive of organic revenue growth of approximately 5%. Excluding special charges totaling $4.4 million related to our new headquarters, M&A and severance expense, adjusted EBITDA outpaced our revenue growth, increasing 12.1% to $42.3 million from $37.7 million in last year's first quarter."
