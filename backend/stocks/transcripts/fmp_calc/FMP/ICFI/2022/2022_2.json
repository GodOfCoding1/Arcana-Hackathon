Our federal government pipeline was at a record $5.9 billion at the end of the second quarter, and the backlog of pending awards in the federal government is significant, so we expect to see considerable growth in contract awards in the second half of this year. Our second quarter revenue growth reflected many of the same business drivers as this year's first quarter, and was led by strong double-digit increases in revenue from our federal, state and local government clients. Excluding special charges totaling $2.4 million, largely related to M&A activity and noncash rent expense of $1.9 million, which is associated with our new Reston, Virginia headquarters, adjusted EBITDA grew at a faster pace than revenue, increasing 10.3% to $44.1 million.
