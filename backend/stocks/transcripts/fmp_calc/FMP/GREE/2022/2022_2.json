    "content": " We expect the electrical service in Spartanburg to be upgraded to 50 megawatts by the first quarter of 2023, and expect to have all mining infrastructure at that location in place and miners installed when the service upgrade is complete. At that site, we plan to develop at least 2.1 exahash of mining capacity powered by approximately 60 megawatts of mining infrastructure, which entails installing approximately 200 petahash of additional mining capacity compared to what we had at the end of the quarter. At our site in Spartanburg, South Carolina, we plan to develop at least 1.5 exahash of mining capacity, powered by 50 megawatts of mining and infrastructure by the first quarter of 2023. Our plan to develop these sites to 3.6 exahash is fully funded, substantially all the equipment\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been procured, including the transformers, switchgear, PDUs and portable mining structures as I mentioned, and we expect that the remaining build costs at the two sides will be less than 7.5 million. Our adjusted EBITDA of $2.9 million in the second quarter was down from $8.1 million in the second quarter of 2021 and our adjusted EBITDA margin declined to 9.2% in the second quarter of 2022 compared to 49.9% in the prior year quarter, as the combination of the lower bitcoin price and higher energy costs, which was driven by significant rise in natural gas squeezed margins for the industry. As a result of changes in the market, we've refocused our strategy to maximize liquidity, while building two existing sites to operational scale with combined capacity of at least 3.6 exahash by the first quarter of 2023."
