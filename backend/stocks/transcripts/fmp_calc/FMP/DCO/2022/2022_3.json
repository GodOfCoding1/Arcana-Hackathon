    "content": " The company's defense business after two years of unprecedented growth in 2020 and 2021 was only down slightly in Q3, but once again delivered solid performance of over $100 million in revenue. In addition, Q3 2022 commercial aerospace revenue was $46 million or almost 75% higher than a year ago, a great sign that growth is accelerating this part of our business. For backlog performance, the commercial aerospace backlog increased sequentially for the fifth consecutive quarter from $276 million at the end of Q2 2021 to $431 million at the end of Q3 2022, an increase of over 55%. Within our commercial aerospace operations, third quarter revenue increased year-over-year to $68.3 million, driven mainly by build rate increases on large aircraft platforms, in flight products for Viasat, other commercial aerospace platforms and business aviation. The year-over-year increase reflects $27.2 million of growth across our commercial aerospace platform, partially offset by $7.3 million of lower revenue within the military and space sector. We posted total gross profit of $38.6 million for the quarter versus $35.3 million in the prior year period, while gross margins were 20.7% and 21.6% in 2022 and 2021 respectively. The year-over-year increase reflects $19.4 million of higher sales across our commercial aerospace applications, partially offset by $4.8 million of lower revenue within the company's military and space markets. These results reflect $7.8 million of higher commercial aerospace revenue, partially offset by $2.6 million in revenue across the company's military space customers. Electronic systems operating income for the third quarter was $13.9 million or 12.2% of revenue versus $15.3 million or 14.6% of revenue in the prior year period, primarily reflecting a favorable product mix, partially offset by favorable manufacturing volumes."
