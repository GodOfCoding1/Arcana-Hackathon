    "content": " It's also reflected in some of the new roles that we have in the company, including both of our heads of Commercial and Consumer Banking, our Head of Marketing and Customer Experience, our Head of -- our Chief Human Resources Officer as well as the top two individuals, both running our credit risk management organization and our risk management organizations. In that light, here's a couple of highlights from the quarter's results, $29 million of net income, meaningful year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter increases in PPNR, driven through significant margin expansion. In our commercial book, we saw C&I balances increase by $20 million as our customers continue to actively manage cash and focus on rebuilding inventory levels as supply chain issues stabilize. The deposits and the timing of -- and the reaction of our customers is a little bit harder to predict, but we do expect the NIM and the interest income to increase fairly significantly, at least for the next two quarters. And the fact that we started to do a little bit towards the end of the quarter, indications that we're taking a much harder look at that, especially given -- even though the out -- you said the outlook is tough, but we expect our earnings to be good over the next several quarters, which should be supportive of the capital levels which then should support the buyback. And those are the smaller companies, let's call it, around $10 million in revenue, a really strong and deep team of business bankers that I think that we have opportunities to build capabilities around, not just in asset generation, but more importantly, going back to that deposit focus on -- the deposit-rich segment of the market that is highly dependent upon physical distribution, both human beings and the branches that we have."
