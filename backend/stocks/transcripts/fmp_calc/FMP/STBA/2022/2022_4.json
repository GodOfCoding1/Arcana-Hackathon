    "content": " But as you can see on Page 3, we had record earnings of $1.03, that's an 8% increase link quarter, it drove -- was driven by a 29 basis point increase in our NIM, achieving 4.33%, obviously, aided by the higher interest rates as well as our -- the asset sensitive nature of our balance sheet. So those are the things that I can think of that would\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\n And then I would say on the commercial side, the treasury management business, I mean it's a growth focus for us, and we're going to be intensely focused on that as we move forward. Well, the consumer business split is about -- it's about 60-40, and that's in the business side is where we've seen a lot of the growth over the past several years. So we -- and so there's a fair amount of this expense or from a people standpoint is embedded in our run rate today because we're building for the future, and we're setting ourselves up for that process and recognizing even when and if we -- when we go over $10 billion, there's still some evolutionary time to work through there. So it's important to us but it's really -- whether it's $10 billion or $15 billion, it's all about building a foundation for growth and ensuring that we're not only generating the growth from a top line standpoint, but we're doing things in a compliant way in line with the regulations. On the maintenance side, it's more about this back to this deposit franchise and trying to maintain higher quality so that, at the end of the day, we have customers that are rate -- a little bit less rate sensitive that aren't as demanding for the top of the market rates and our hot money."
