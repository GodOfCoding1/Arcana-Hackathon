    "content": " In the first quarter of 2022, this strategy has been successful and generating $24 million in gross premium written across the 10 programs launched over the last year, including three this quarter, representing a run rate of approximately $100 million, which we expect to grow in consecutive quarters with a strong pipeline of prospective programs going into the second quarter. Turning to our distribution business, our insurance distribution segment led by Xchange, our first MGU partner is profitable and growing, having placed over $45 million of premium for the first quarter of 2022, an increase of nearly 13% over the prior year, which represents a record quarter for the company. For the first quarter of 2022, Ambac reported net income of $2 million or $0.04 per diluted share compared to net income of $17 million or $0.08 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2021. Premiums placed in the distribution business totaled $45 million in the first quarter compared to $40 million in the first quarter of 2021, an increase of 12%. Taken together, P&C insurance production was $69 million in the first quarter, up 71% over the first quarter of 2021 and over 2x the production of last quarter. The decrease in investment income during the first quarter was related to three items: first, pooled fund investments generated a net gain of about $1 million in the quarter compared to $28 million in the first quarter of 2021. Public Finance experienced $190 million of positive development in the first quarter compared to a $9 million loss in the prior year, all of which was driven by Puerto Rico. Net gains on derivative contracts, which are positioned as a partial economic hedge against interest rate exposure in the financial guarantee and investment portfolios were $57 million for the first quarter compared to gains of $25 million for the first quarter 2021."
