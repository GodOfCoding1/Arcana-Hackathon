    "content": " So with that, let me start by saying for the quarter we delivered strong top-line results of 273% year-over-year growth, along with very strong gross margins of 58.1%, which was an increase of 450% versus a year ago, an improvement of 15.2% in terms of gross margin expansion sequentially. Gross profit margin was 58.1% versus 39.3% a year ago, an increase of 450% gross profit increased by $1.8 million due to improved gross margins at all our brands. Distribution expenses were $222,000 versus $70,000 a year ago, driven by the addition of Harper and Jones and Stateside distribution expenses in this quarter versus approximately one-third of Harper and Jones distribution expenses and no distribution expenses for Stateside a year ago. Excluding the non-cash charge associated with the change in fair value of contingent considerations, net loss attributable to common stockholders was $3.6 million or $0.10 per diluted share compared to net loss attributable to common stockholders of $7.7 million or $1.41 per diluted share a year ago."
