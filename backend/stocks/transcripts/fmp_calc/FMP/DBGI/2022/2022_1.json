    "content": " We expect to continue to experience significant revenue growth year-over-year, throughout 2022, in addition to leveraging our fixed operating costs throughout 2022, as our fourth quarter and first quarter results illustrate. The results for the first quarter, net revenues increased 740% to $3.4 million in the first quarter of 2022, compared to $0.4 million in the first quarter 2021. G&A expenses were $4.6 million in the first quarter of 2022, which included a non-cash charge of $1.1 million for amortization of loan, discount and fees versus 223,000 in the same period a year ago. This resulted in total non-cash charges in G&A of $1.8 million in the first quarter of 2022 versus 223,000 in the first quarter of last year. This compared to a net loss attributable to common stockholders of $3 million or a loss of $4.55 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2021, and again that's a loss of $0.59 per share versus a loss of $4.55, and it includes over $3.5 million in non-cash charges between one-time expenses and depreciation and amortization."
