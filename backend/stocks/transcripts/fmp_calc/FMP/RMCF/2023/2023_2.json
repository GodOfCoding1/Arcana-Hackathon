Looking at the revenue drivers in the quarter, total factory sales for the second quarter of fiscal 2023 were $4.8 million, compared to $5.2 million for the year ago period, primarily due to lower shipments of product to certain non-Rocky Mountain customers, as well as lower sales to franchised and licensed retail stores. Royalty and marketing revenue was also relatively flat at approximately $1.9 million for the three months ended August 31, 2022. Franchise fee revenue increased to $54,000 for the three months ended August 31, 2022, compared to $47,000 in the year ago period.
