    "content": " Welcome to today's Conference Call to discuss the Financial Results for Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory's Fiscal Third Quarter Ended November 30, 2022. You will find reconciliation tables and other important information in the earnings press release and Form 8-K we furnished to the SEC earlier today, which will be available on the company's Investor Relations section of its website within approximately 24 hours after this call has ended. The groundwork our team has put in place since I arrived in May of last year has begun to generate strong momentum as evidenced in part by our flagship Durango store generating record sales in the fiscal third quarter, up 34% compared to the prior year. For the first time ever, Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory will have a resident, trained R&D expert who will help us not only with product formulation and new product development, but also with quality and regulatory compliance. The council was formed to foster timely, consistent and transparent dialogue among franchisees at Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory, which is critically important given the transformation underway. While our financial results this quarter were a strong step in the right direction, we're still facing some level of macroeconomic pressure resulting in labor and supply chain challenges, albeit not as bad as the pressure we faced earlier in calendar 2022. During our fiscal third quarter, however, we rolled out several new hiring and retention policies at the factory, which included enhanced new hire retention bonuses, resulting in a 150% increase in applications versus the third quarter last year. It's worth noting, while we raised prices early in this fiscal year, which helped to offset inflationary cost pressure, our volumes have held up relatively well and are flat to slightly higher compared to the year ago quarter, which I believe speaks to the quality of our products and the loyalty of our customers. While the transformation of the business is still in its infancy, a very solid third quarter and recent holiday season has proved us not only that we are on the right track with our plan, but that our commitment to extensive dialogue with the franchisee network and other stakeholders have begun to bear fruit. Total revenue increased 11% to $9.5 million for the three months ended November 30, 2022, compared to $8.5 million. Breaking down our revenue, total factory sales for the third quarter increased 14% to $7.3 million compared to $6.4 million, primarily due to higher shipments of product to our franchised and licensed retail stores as well as higher sales to customers outside of the Rocky Mountain franchisee network. Same-store sales at all domestic Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory locations increased 3% during the three months ended November 30, 2022, and same-store sales at the company's domestic frozen yogurt cafes increased 14%. Retail sales increased 7% to approximately $679,000 compared to $636,000 in the fiscal third quarter of '23. Franchise fee revenue was also relatively flat at approximately $60,000 compared to a year ago period. Total gross margin increased 50 basis points to 26.3% compared to 25.8% in the year ago period -- the year ago quarter, with the increase -- primarily due to increased pricing, which was partially offset by higher labor, material and inventory costs. Operating loss was reduced to $216,000 for the three months ended November 30, 2022 compared to a loss of $2 million in the year ago period. Net loss in the third -- in the fiscal third quarter improved significantly to $212,000 or $0.03 per share compared to a net loss of $1.5 million or $0.24 per share. Our adjusted EBITDA increased nearly 30% to $1.3 million for the three months ended November 30, 2022, compared to $1 million in the year ago quarter. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $3.2 million compared to $7.6 million at the end of our last fiscal year, which was February 28, 2022."
