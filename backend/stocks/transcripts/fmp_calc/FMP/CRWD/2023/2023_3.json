    "content": " In our smaller, more transactional non-enterprise accounts, we saw customers increasingly delay purchasing decisions with average days to close lengthening by approximately 11% and net new ARR contribution decreasing $15 million from Q2. Falcon Complete continues to shine with net new ARR growing close to 20% quarter-over-quarter as customers embrace our extended lineup of complete services, including Identity Complete and Cloud Complete. Given the elongated sales cycles due to macro pressures in smaller non-enterprise accounts that George discussed, the composition of net new ARR in Q3 was weighted more heavily toward our $1 million-plus customer cohort with no outsized contribution from any one deal. Thanks for taking my question. Thanks for taking my question. Thanks for taking my question. Thanks for taking my question. When we do talk about net new ARR, I did talk about in the prepared remarks about how we think about up to 10% headwinds going into Q4 from Q3, and that's just to coincide with some of the headwind activity that we saw accelerated at the end of this quarter. Thanks for taking my question."
