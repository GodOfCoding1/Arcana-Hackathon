On the second part, in terms of where we\u2019re seeing uptick with respect to new customers and new logos, obviously, a lot of the velocity is coming from some of the smaller -- the SMB and mid-market because it does take less time for -- to contract a deal. I think, thematically, it\u2019s customers are looking for a next-gen endpoint workload technology platform like CrowdStrike combined with next-gen network technology, and they\u2019re looking to replace their legacy Palo Alto Networks. So, if I look at Q1, your net new ARR of $144 million, that\u2019s up 68% year-over-year in Q1 versus a 65% comp last year, which is just a really impressive number."
