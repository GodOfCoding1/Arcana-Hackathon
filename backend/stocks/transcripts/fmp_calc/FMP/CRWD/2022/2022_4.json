    "content": " Second, our success outside of traditional endpoint security is now punctuated by both scale and hyper growth as we surpassed the $150 million ARR milestone, while growing in excess of 100% year-over-year for our IT hygiene, vulnerability management, identity protection and log management modules collectively. Third, we exited the year with tremendous momentum for ARR derived from Falcon deployments in the public cloud, where ARR eclipsed the $100 million milestone and grew 20% quarter-on-quarter as we lead the effort to transform security for the public cloud. And in fiscal year 2022, we delivered 65% ARR growth, 66% total revenue growth, 215% operating income growth, 157% net income growth and record free cash flow of $442 million, or 30% of revenue. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. So we see broad-based demand on all revenue, people are buying the endpoint security modules primarily for two reasons: one, protection to visibility, which we get both; in order to enhance the protection, they've add the identity module, which makes sense given that many of the breaches don't necessarily even use malware in today's environment. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open."
