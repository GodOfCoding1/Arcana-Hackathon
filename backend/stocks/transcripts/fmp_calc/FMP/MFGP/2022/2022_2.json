Overall, we have delivered an increase in free cash flow of 36% to $190 million in the first half, compared to the first half in \u00e2\u0080\u009921. So in summary, we've improved our free cash flow from $140 million to $190 million in the first half. Looking forward to the full-year, we now expect exceptional costs to reduce from our previous guidance of $100 million to approximately $50 million, excluding the profit on disposal of Digital Safe. And our cash tax is expected to be approximately $130 million, representing an improvement of around $120 million year-on-year."
