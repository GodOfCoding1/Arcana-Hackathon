I think we already, when we look at the amount of consideration there is out there for the brand, we believe there's clearly an opportunity for us to maintain our current customer base that we have in place now while continuing to work through how do we elevate that, and that's kind of the model we've been running for the past couple of years as we've gone through what we kind of call our constraint model, where we've actually been holding back a tad in order to kind of optimize the way in which the brand shows up and the fact that we've continued to reduce our exposure in the off price market and working away from undifferentiated doors can't say that this morning undifferentiated doors is a great example of how we think we can continue on that journey. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. Your line is now open."
