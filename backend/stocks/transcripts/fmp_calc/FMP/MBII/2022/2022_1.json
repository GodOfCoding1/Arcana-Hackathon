    "content": " Our first quarter results with solid revenues in the row crop markets, and difficult weather conditions for specialty craft growers in the Western U.S. underscore the importance of our strategy to diversify our product mix and our geographic reach, and while our merger agreement with Bioceres is key to the expansion of our business across the segments. On a positive note, as we indicated in our fourth-quarter call, we continue to foresee a sharp rebound and revenues in the second quarter, putting us on track for low to mid-teens growth for the first half of the year, which would represent a material increase over our revenue growth in the first half of 2021. You're right, the South American drought and also the fertilizer prices are of course putting the farmers in a situation where they're thinking what to do and how to manage their crops, but our products that we're now rolling out in what we launched last year in the market are really key to the farmers decisions because we have our full-year fertilizers, so especially the fertilizer rolling off to the market."
