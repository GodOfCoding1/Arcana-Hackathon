    "content": "  Our U.S. Building Services segment had an excellent quarter with an operating income margin of 6.4% and 38.7% operating income growth, driven in part by revenues of $710.7 million which represented 13.8% revenue growth quarter-over-quarter and that was all mostly organic revenue growth. Reported operating margin of 5.6% represents a reduction from the 8.3% in last year's quarter, the decrease in both operating income and operating margin is due to a less favorable project mix within the commercial, institutional and transportation market sectors, coupled with certain discrete project write-downs totaling $10.5 million during the quarter, which negatively impacted the segment's operating margin by 170 basis points."
