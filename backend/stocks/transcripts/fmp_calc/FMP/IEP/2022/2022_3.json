    "content": " For the nine months ended September 30, 2022, net income was $72 million or $0.23 per depository unit and our adjusted EBITDA was $812 million. For reference, last year's first nine months figures were a net loss of $122 million or a loss of $0.47 per depository unit and adjusted EBITDA of $715 million. For Q3 2022, we had net loss of $123 million, and adjusted EBITDA of $70 million compared to a net loss of $148 million, and adjusted EBITDA of $88 million in the prior year period. In Q3 2022, our Energy segment reported net sales of $2.7 billion compared to $1.9 billion in the prior year quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was $124 million for Q3 2022, compared to $143 million in Q3 2021. Q3 2022 refining margin per through per barrel was $16.56, compared to $15.03 in the prior year quarter. Q3 2022 average realized gate prices for UAN improved by 42% and to $433 per ton and ammonia improved by 65% to $837 per ton, when compared to the prior year quarter. Q3 2022 net sales and service revenues for the Automotive segment were $625 million, an increase of $31 million from the prior year quarter. Q3 2022 automotive service revenue increased by $55 million, as compared to the prior year period, mainly due to volume and price increases. Adjusted EBITDA was $7 million for Q3 2022, compared to $2 million in Q3 2021. I think the year-over-year price that we're getting just in third quarter, year-to-date alone is something like $37 million dropping to the bottom line. Well, and if I'm allowed to cosmically say, I know it's a small holding for you guys in one sense, but in terms of percentage if there's anybody that could benefit -- I mean, EBITDA has been $50 million forever."
