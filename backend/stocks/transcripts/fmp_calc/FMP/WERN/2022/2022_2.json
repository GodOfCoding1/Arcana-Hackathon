    "content": " We increased revenues due to 8% growth in TTS trucks and Dedicated fleet expansion, freight rate increases, higher fuel surcharges and Logistics revenue growth. TTS revenues increased 25% due to 8% more trucks, 14% higher rates and $61 million of increased fuel surcharges, partially offset by 7% lower miles per truck. The TTS adjusted operating ratio net of fuel was 86.6%, and would have been 310 basis points lower, excluding the $15.6 million TTS segment impact of unusually high insurance and claims in second quarter 2022 compared to our last eight-quarter average. Dedicated revenue per truck per week increased 9.1% in the second quarter, ahead of our full year growth expectations, due to customer rate increases to offset inflationary cost pressures. One-Way Truckload revenues per total mile for the second quarter increased 13.7%, slightly below the bottom end of our second quarter guidance range, due to a moderating freight market. Okay, that's very helpful. Okay, that's very helpful. And the other sign of the level of stickiness is, if you look at revenue per truck per week, it's increased seven out of the last eight years in Dedicated, which just illuminates how much less volatile it really is. I want to re-mention it again that you can mix that fleet differently quarter-to-quarter based on what new Dedicated opportunities are in the pipeline and see some revenue per truck per week increases or slow that growth, and yet still be modeling at the exact same OR and still performing at the same OR, or improving it. 44% growth in Logistics and a $9.1 million operating income increase and 360 basis points of operating margin improvement year-over-year, that's a business unit that is really finding its footing."
