    "content": " In light of our decision last quarter to initiate a formal process to evaluate strategic alternatives, we have committed to funding certain programs with the goal of maintaining the base business we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve established for Vazalore, including its current broad retail distribution. In order to do that in our first year of launch, we have identified those 1,000 or so healthcare professionals that have adopted Vazalore into their practice, and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s why we came up with this program to ensure that the retain their patients on Vazalore, provide them a sample, a high value coupon to drive them to the retailers, but also provide patient education materials that really describe the difference between Vazalore and the other aspirin formulations on the market and why it is so different and why this is relevant to managing their own disease."
