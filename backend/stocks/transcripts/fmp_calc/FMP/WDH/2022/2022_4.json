    "content": " Our net operating revenue increased by 12.5% year-over-year to RMB639.5 million, which primarily due to the increase of insurance-related income crowdfunding service fees and digital clinical trial solution income. To break it down, operating costs were RMB278.6 million up by roughly 41% year-over-year, mainly due to the increase in professional and outsourced customer service base of RMB51.2 million and the recording of crowdfunding-related service base of roughly RMB67 million from sales and marketing expenses to operating costs and we started to generating crowdfunding service base, since April 2022."
