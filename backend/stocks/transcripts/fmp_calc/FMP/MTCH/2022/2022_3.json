    "content": " Tinder performed slightly above our expectations in the quarter, delivering direct revenue of $460 million, up 6% year-over-year, 16% on an FX-neutral basis. Selling and marketing spend decreased $24 million or 16% year-over-year, the second consecutive quarter where we've seen a year-over-year reduction as we continue to reduce marketing spend at our more Established Brands and to show ROI discipline overall. We expect Tinder's Q4 direct revenue to be relatively flat year-over-year, up high single digits on an FX-neutral basis with mid-single-digit payers growth as ALC softness due to weak macroeconomic conditions impacts payers. While visibility into 2023 is challenging, we're focused on delivering 5% to 10% year-over-year revenue growth in 2023. But sitting here today, making our best guess on what economic conditions are going to be for next year, we're confident in that 5% to 10% growth for the overall company as well as at Tinder on the revenue side. You are right to assume that we're going to see marketing spend increases next year at Tinder for the reason that BK explained about wanting to make sure we establish the brand narrative better than we have in the past as well as at Hinge, which we talked about extensively. There is going to be an increase in our marketing spend at the Match brand in Q4 of this year, but that's because we have a discrete new brand campaign that we're launching."
