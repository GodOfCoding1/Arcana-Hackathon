    "content": " We\u2019re trying to pace that out so that each phase of what we\u2019re looking at pays for 100% of the cost of the horizontal development that we have for what we\u2019re delivering to our homebuilder customers, but also what we\u2019re retaining for the company itself so that we\u2019re really fully -- we\u2019ve gotten full returns on all of that investment into the roads, curves and gutters and then we go vertical with that and are using very attractive financing rate to be able to do that. And this company is probably going to be well positioned in a hard asset play as you can get with land, water, which is one of the most sticky assets, sticky customers that you get because you have to have that water, you\u2019re going to make sure that you continue to pay your water bills and then also single-family rental. The summer really is beautiful out here, and you\u2019ll be able to see kind of the progress that we\u2019re making on all fronts of the business, on the water side, really get a chance to tour our state-of-the-art water reclamation facility, see how we\u2019re managing our oil and gas systems and delivery of raw water and reuse water to oil and gas operations, the delivery of our second phase, we\u2019ll have broken ground on the charter school aspect and then continuing development of our single-family rental."
