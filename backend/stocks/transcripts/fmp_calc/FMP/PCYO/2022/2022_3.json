    "content": " I would say, the real advantage for the segment and this is something that we highlight a lot is, we may not be diving into the Single-Family Rental market, if we were going out buying the score at fair market value, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s probably not the highest value thing that we think we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re good at doing is to define where these market home, where the homes would be in the highest market potential for that, but because we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re adding value to the community, because we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re adding value to each of our individual lots, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s where we think that this is so compelling for our shareholders is that it not only increases the value of the asset class, these homes are appreciating at 5%, 6%, 7% and in Sky Ranch\u00e2\u0080\u0099s example, because we started the community, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen as much as a 40% increase in value of the homes from our Phase 1."
