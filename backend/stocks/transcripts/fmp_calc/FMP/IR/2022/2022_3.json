    "content": " The company delivered third quarter adjusted EBITDA of $376 million, a 20% year-over-year improvement, and adjusted EBITDA margins of 24.8%, a 110 basis point year-over-year improvement and a 160 basis point improvement sequentially from Q2. And note that on a 2-year stack, the ITS segment organic orders grew approximately 50%, which is in line with the Q2 2022 2-year stack, meaning that thus far, we continue to see strong demand for our products. In terms of 2022 guidance, given the ongoing strength in commercial and operational performance, we are raising our organic revenue guidance from the total company to 12% to 14%, 100 basis point increase from prior guidance based on both our ITS and PST segments. So when you put all this together, kind of comparing to the total company from an EBITDA perspective, and this is fairly similar, I would say, in the segment level, is that you would continue to see improved price realization Q3 to Q4, given the actions that we have already taken and inflation staying flat, I mean relatively flat to Q2 exit level."
