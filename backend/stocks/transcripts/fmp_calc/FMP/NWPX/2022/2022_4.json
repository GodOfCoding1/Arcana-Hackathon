    "content": " Steel Pressure Pipe segment sales increased 0.8% to $72.1 million compared to $71.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2021, driven primarily by a 28% increase in our tons produced mainly due to changes in our project timing, partially offset by a 21% decrease in our selling price per ton, primarily due to decreased raw material costs. Precast gross profit increased 101.4% to $9.9 million or 28.5% of Precast sales from $4.9 million or 15.9% of segment sales in the fourth quarter of 2021, primarily due to the contribution from ParkUSA and higher pricing at our pre-existing Precast operations. Steel Pressure Pipe segment sales increased 18.4% to $307.6 million compared to $259.8 million in 2021, driven by a 20% increase in selling price per ton due to increased material costs and changes in product mix, partially offset by a 1% decrease in tons produced, which was resulted from changes in project timing."
