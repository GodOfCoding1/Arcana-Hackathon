    "content": " The steel pressure pipe segment sales increased 20.5% to $83.7 million compared to $69.4 million in 2021, driven primarily by a 17% increase in our tons produced mainly due to changes in project timing as well as a 3% increase in our selling price per ton, resulting from changes in product mix. Precast segment sales increased 158.6% and to $39.3 million compared to $15.2 million in the third quarter of 2021, primarily due to $20.5 million contribution from ParkUSA operations. Precast gross profit increased 210.4% and to $10.9 million or 27.8% of precast sales from $3.5 million or 23.1% of segment sales in the third quarter of 2021, primarily due to the contribution from ParkUSA as well as higher selling prices realized at our pre-existing precast operations."
