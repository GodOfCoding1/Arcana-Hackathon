    "content": " In addition to successful SaaS transitions, overall sales momentum continued to be strong during 2022, due in part to the changes we've made over the last three years to our go-to-market teams, most notably building out dedicated customer base and new logo sales teams. As Jason noted, we made tremendous progress on SaaS transitions during fiscal 2022 and that execution is now being reflected in our financial results, with SaaS ARR growth accelerating to 31% in Q4, and maintenance revenue declining at a faster pace. For the full year of fiscal 2023, we expect total revenue to be in the range of $241 million to $244 million, subscription revenue to be in the range of $178 million to $180 million, which is at the high end of the preliminary outlook of $175 million to $180 million that we provided on our Q3 earnings call. For the year, we have assumed the continued transition of our business model, which should result in accelerated SaaS ARR growth, but partially offset by steeper declines in maintenance revenue, with the blended growth rate reflected in our guidance for subscription revenue. So, yes, so as we talked about, we hit the 70% mark, on customer conversion, SaaS transitions and so we are still expecting to get some contribution from that in the new year, or in fiscal 2023 this year. And then, as we've talked about, over the past year, SaaS transitions have really been a catalyst for us to get into customer accounts and build multi-year roadmaps to drive expanded use of Model N. And so I do think we're going to continue to see fantastic yield out of the customer base in this fiscal year."
