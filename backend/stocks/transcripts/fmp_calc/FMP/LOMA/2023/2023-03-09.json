    "content": " Consolidated gross profit for the quarter declined 24.9% year-on-year with margin contraction by 810 basis points to 26.5%, mainly impacted by a lower price performance of our core segment, higher costs related to higher thermal energy inputs mainly due to the stimulus plan to increase natural gas production, and increase in maintaining cost and a higher inflation scenario that was partially compensated with a decrease in electrical energy input. Concrete adjusted EBITDA decreased Ps.67 million compared to fourth quarter 2021, mainly explained by extraordinary results in other gain that affected the quarterly comparison, while a positive price performance and higher volumes compensated the cost increase, margin contraction of 334 basis points, reaching 2.7%."
