    "content": " Consolidated gross profit for the quarter slightly improved 0.6% year-on-year with margin contracted by 205 basis points to 28.1%, mainly impacted by a lower price performance of our core segment and higher depreciations due to the completion of L\u00e2\u0080\u0099Amal\u00c3\u00ad second line, partially offset by proper cost management due to our operational improvements and production flexibilities. Our adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter stood at $63 million, up 31.7% from $48 million in the same quarter a year ago, boosted by our top line and other cost management. In pesos, adjusted EBITDA was up 2.6% in the quarter, reaching ARS 7.3 billion with consolidated EBITDA margin of 29%, contracted by 151 basis points year-on-year affected by cement margin contraction and the higher participation in the top line of the other segments with lower margins. Concrete adjusted EBITDA increased ARS 46 million compared to second quarter '21, mainly explained by a positive price performance and very good volumes with margin expansion of 371 basis points but still in negative grounds. Aggregates adjusted EBITDA improved from ARS 25 million in second quarter '21 to ARS 64 million this quarter, reaching a margin of 9.7% and showing a great recovery for the segment, favored by a better pricing and higher sales volume. Finally, Railroad adjusted EBITDA decreased ARS 55 million to ARS 73 million for the quarter with a margin of 3.4%, mainly due to the impact of price performance affected by product mix and a lower average transported distance despite the volume expansion."
