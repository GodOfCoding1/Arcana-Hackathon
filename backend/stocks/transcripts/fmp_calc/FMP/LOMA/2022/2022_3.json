    "content": " In particular cement national industry sales are going from outstanding momentum and in this quarter in a new historical level, up 10% from third quarter 2021, while the nine-month accumulated volumes show an increase of 11%. Consolidated gross profit for the quarter declined 13.9% year-on-year with the margin contracting by 448 basis points to 21.3%, mainly impacted by a lower price performance of our core segment, higher depreciation to the completion of L'Amal\u00c3\u00ad second line, and higher energy inputs related to the winter period, partially offset by a proper cost management due to well operational improvements and lower natural gas availability. Our adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter stood at $68 million setting a new record for a quarter up 33.9% from $51 million in the same quarter a year ago, boosted by our top-line and other great cost management. In pesos, adjusted EBITDA was down 12% in the quarter, reaching \u00e2\u0082\u00b17.5 billion with consolidated EBITDA margin of 22.1%, contracted by 426 basis points year-on-year mainly affected by cement margin contraction and the higher participation in the top-line of the other segments with lower margins. Cement segment adjusted EBITDA margins reached 24.3%, contracting 516 basis points, mainly due to a softer pricing dynamics and higher energy inputs partially offset by an increase in sales volume. Concrete adjusted EBITDA increased \u00e2\u0082\u00b1155 million compared to third quarter 2021, mainly explained by a positive price performance and higher volumes with margin expansion of 637 basis points reaching 2.4% and reverting negative figures.
