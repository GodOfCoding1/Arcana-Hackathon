Consolidated gross profit for the quarter declined 13% year-on-year with margin contracted by 288 basis points to 33.4%, mainly impacted by a lower top line performance of our core segment, a higher depreciation to the completion of L\u00b4Amal\u00ed second line.

Cement segment adjusted EBITDA reached 37.4% margin contracting by 332 basis points, mainly due to a softer pricing dynamic, partially offset by lower production costs due to principally lower maintenance costs and an increase in sales volume.

Aggregates adjusted EBITDA improved by -- from negative ARS 23 million in first quarter of 2021 to negative ARS 18 million in first quarter '22, showing still a negative margin of 4.6%, favored by a pricing mix and higher sales volume. Finally, railroad adjusted EBITDA increased ARS 51 million to ARS 97 million for the quarter with a margin of 5.9%, mainly due to the impact of its top line performance."
