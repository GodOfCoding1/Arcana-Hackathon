Importantly, we are still projecting underlying high single-digit revenue growth for the full year, driven by continued strength in our direct-to-consumer business led by the international regions. We are focused on what is within our control and pleased that we delivered underlying revenue growth of 6% and EPS above our guidance for the second quarter, driven by disciplined management of expenses and a lower tax rate and despite a greater negative currency impact and a shortfall in revenue compared to expectations. 2025 targets, we are very focused on making sure that we execute on the PVH+ drivers, the five-plus drivers, on winning more with product, winning even more with consumer engagement, winning in the digitally led marketplace and getting to that demand-driven supply chain and investing behind that growth and driving efficiencies.
