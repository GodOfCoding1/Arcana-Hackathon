    "content": " The non-exclusive deal we signed to license the name and likeness of Stan Lee to Marvel Studios for movies and television and the exclusive license to the Walt Disney theme parks and attractions to create Stan Lee merchandise and consumer products to be sold in the Walt Disney theme parks cruise ships and other entertainment venues for the next 20 years, all of which Genius Brands will enjoy royalty income from. While the company received a $2.5 million license fee, the bulk of the revenues that Genius will get as a result of this agreement, we expect to come from royalties that will be generated from Disney's creation and sale of Stan Lee merchandise in the Walt Disney theme parks and theme park experiences for the duration of the 20-year agreement. As we continue to roll out the subscription-based Kartoon Channel Kidaverse and its metaversal features, we believe Kidaverse will be a breakthrough first-of-its-kind offering for kids including avatars, emojis, games, Kidaverse VR goggles, immersive content, NFTs for kids, collectible digital cards based on many of the channels popular with characters, including Stan Lee universe, a digital currency for kids, which we refer to as KidaBucks, childsafe messaging, which we refer to as Messies, podcasts, music and more. The combination of Genius Brands' WOW!, Frederator Channel, Ameba, and Your Family Entertainment now provides Genius with one of the largest and most desirable children's content catalogs in the world as well as a fully integrated distribution system and consumer product infrastructure to maximize value. This transaction is a transformational event for Genius Brands as the company will continue to execute on its strategy to establish itself as a foremost producer, broadcaster and licenser of high-quality children's entertainment and children's consumer products on a global basis."
