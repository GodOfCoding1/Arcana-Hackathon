    "content": " In fact, our Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Dr. Rafael Bejar, will discuss why we believe our lead candidate, 239, is the best-in-class oral kinase inhibitor designed to treat the disease of AML, not just treat a particular target and superior to the competitors for the treatment of AML patients with adverse mutations. But just prior to EHA, we plan to hold a KOL corporate event during which we plan to present available clinical data from all patients and all dose levels enrolled in our clinical trials for both 239 and lux. As we have reported, the kinase inhibitory profile of 239 already has translated into strong, durable, and broad antileukemic activity in a diverse array of relapsed refractory AML patients with the striking array of highly adverse co-mutations, delivering multiple complete remissions in the Phase 1 trial thus far. Our observations to date illustrate antileukemic activity at multiple dose levels and 239 appears to have the potential to treat FLT3 mutant patients compromising about a third of  AML, as well as FLT3 wild-type patients, the other two-thirds, both fit and unfit patients, since it has been so well-tolerated at active doses today and the relapsed refractory population, as well as the newly diagnosed frontline AML population. If we're able to see enough patients that are FLT3 wild-type but yet are able to treat these patients with these other adverse mutations, we're able to identify subgroups there as Dr. Bejar was mentioning, we'd want to pull those in, possibly get fast tracked."
