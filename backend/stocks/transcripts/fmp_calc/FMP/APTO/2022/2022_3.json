    "content": " Ironically, as we presented to fundamental healthcare investors with domain knowledge, the common viewpoint emerged that our lead clinical candidate HM43239 or just 239 looks like a real drug that gives complete remissions as a single agent in very challenging AML patients, and they were surprised that they had been unaware of 239 and its strong clinical activity. Indeed, Tuspetinib already has demonstrated clinical responses with compelling response rates in multiple mutationally defined target populations of relapsed or refractory AML patients, both with and without FLT3 mutations. I'm happy to report that we have successfully completed the dose escalation and dose exploration stages of our Tuspetinib Phase 1 trial and have treated approximately 60 relapsed or refractory AML patients, previously treated with multiple agents, including chemotherapy, BCL2 inhibitors, hypomethylating agents, FLT3 inhibitors and other targeted agents. This trial is designed to confirm activity through patient enrichment, specifically genetically defined AML populations including FLT3 mutant patients who have been failed by prior FLT3 inhibitor and supported by a fast track designation and are significant response rate to date. We will include relapsed or refractory AML patients with unmutated FLT3 that have other adverse mutations exploring safety and activity in these patients  treatment, both as a single agent and in combination with venetoclax."
