    "content": " That was our experience this year as positive performance in our growth markets, utilities, and energy renewables was largely offset by a loss that we recognized on a pipeline projects in the mid-Atlantic and lower overall revenue in our pipeline segment. Looking at future opportunities, our Energy/Renewables segment has signed more than $325 million in new projects for the segment during the first quarter alone. The year-to-year comparison is somewhat skewed by the fact that in first quarter last year, we achieved substantial placing on three pipeline projects, accounted for more than $71 million in revenue. As Tom mentioned, our first-quarter revenue was $784.4 million, a decrease of $33.9 million compared to the prior year, mainly due to the $63.8 million reduction in pipeline work, which was in line with our expectations. Gross profit for the first quarter was $56.5 million, a decrease of $23.7 million, primarily due to poor performance in our pipeline segment. Gross profit was $39.9 million for the quarter, a $2.7 million decrease from the prior year, primarily due to lower margins, partially offset by higher solar revenues. But it's important to note that during the quarter, we invested in other $35 million in prepaid materials for our solar projects in order to ensure timely delivery uncertainty at price. We continue to gain momentum in our growth markets as evidenced by the total dollars of new business we brought in during the quarter for those two segments, more than $750 million. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open."
