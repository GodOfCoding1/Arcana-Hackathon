    "content": " It's actually additive, and it's really, as David mentioned in his earlier comments, it's one of the selling effectiveness opportunities where it allows a BD rep to really kind of work with their Phoenix customers or new opportunities on Phoenix and bring in Pheno together as a solution that would really be a total solution for all susceptibility testing. And also, what I didn't talk much about today is Arc and really continuing to move Arc forward as we work with the FDA to get Arc on market in the U.S. From a market standpoint, it's going to open up an entirely new segment of the market for us, that high-volume, low acuity market in susceptibility testing that's focused on isolate samples."
