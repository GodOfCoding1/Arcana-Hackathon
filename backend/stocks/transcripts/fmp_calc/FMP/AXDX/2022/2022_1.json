    "content": " As we mentioned on the script, if you take a look at our sales funnel, which is always the early indicator to contracting and therefore revenues, the new opportunities around Pheno are about equally split between those customers that are being targeted for IDAST. Clearly, we want to see greater results from the standpoint of new contracts and new customers going live, and we expect to see that as we progress throughout the quarters in the year. It's really opened up there and access to customers is much greater now, and we have good funnels going on, and we expect the business to continue to grow in 2022 and see some good growth out of the markets that we're focused in."
