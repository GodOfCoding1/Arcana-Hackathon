    "content": " From a front end standpoint in areas like MALDI, where MALDI is one of the best solutions on the market today, it is very, very well established in microbiology, but there's a major drawback and it's very slow for identification of organisms, it takes several days complimenting that very good solution with Arc is really an opportunity to change how MALDI testing is done globally. Absolutely Pheno and ID/AST and Arc are absolutely important additions right now for BD and they're excited to start commercializing those products and helping their overall solution to be stronger and be successful with our products as well, but they are very interested in accessing our future innovation. And then the last thing I would say about BD is as someone that's been in diagnostics for 30 years now, I've known Becton, Dickinson for that long because they've been in business for many, many years, as we know they're an, a company \u00e2\u0080\u0093 they're a company with impeccable values."
