    "content": " I'm pleased to report that customer demand continues to be strong, and we added 23,100 new customers in the quarter, a 63% increase year-over-year, that shows a persistent level of strong customer demand for residential solar and for SunPower specifically. Importantly, adjusted EBITDA per customer has grown to $2,100 before Platform Investment, and we believe we'll be able to achieve our Analyst Day guidance for $2,000 to $2,400 for the full year. For the third quarter, we are reporting $33 million of adjusted EBITDA and $470 million of non-GAAP revenue, an increase of 67% year-over-year, which continued to accelerate over the 63% year-over-year growth we saw in Q2 and the 41% from Q1. First, we expect to see continued improvement in gross margin from higher customer pricing to offset cost inflation that will result in a net incremental improvement of $25 to $300 EBITDA per customer for the full year metric. I think the IRA will probably allow us to deepen our relationship with new dealers and new customers and some of these underrepresented communities across the U.S. That's where I think it's a really interesting value proposition because the people who probably would benefit the most from the savings of solar, are the people on these underrepresented communities. But that's why we continue to harp upon this issue of customers are really making rational decisions here because their energy prices are going up so much, they're really interested in getting solar because it's going to save them money. And I think as we go forward, we really believe that we're going to continue to be on a ramp of increasing that attach rate each and every quarter and every year as we go forward until either all or nearly all of all the finance business from our customers uses SunPower Financial."
