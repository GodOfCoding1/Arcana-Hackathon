    "content": " On Rising supply chain prices, I think it's important to start to remind everyone that SunPower did not raise prices for our dealers and for our customers in 2021. I think we've had the most success is there's a great opportunity for us on new homes to really install a complete solar system with panels, batteries and EV chargers, all integrated into one. And obviously, we're quite excited about the opportunity to really reinvent the panel world and be something that's never existed before and be able to have something that's a big exclusive for our dealers and something that we think would delight our customers. I think from a first quarter perspective, as you bridge that from a modeling point of view to the rest of the year as well as the out years beyond 2022, you would expect to see that number come down and actually we'll get cash back onto the balance sheet as we start to utilize third-party capital that we alluded to earlier in the call."
