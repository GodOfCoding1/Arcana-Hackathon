    "content": " The analysis based on those assumptions shows an immediate 200 basis point increase in rates as of March 31, 2022 that is sustained for a 12-month period will result in a decrease of approximately $2.2 million in our net interest income and CAD, or approximately $0.10 per BUC, which is down from approximately $0.23 per BUC as of December 31, 2021 which is primarily a result of the previously mentioned $104 million in interest rate caps that we executed in the first quarter."
