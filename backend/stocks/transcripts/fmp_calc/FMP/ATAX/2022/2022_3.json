    "content": " In terms of the Partnership's investment portfolio, we currently hold $1.1 billion of affordable multifamily investments in the form of mortgage revenue bonds, governmental issuer loans and property loans, $103 million in joint venture equity investments and $59 million in direct real estate investments. In October 2022, we executed a $16 million commitment to fund the construction of Freestone at Greeley, a 306-unit market-rate multifamily property in Greeley Colorado. Our quarterly earnings benefited greatly from the $10.6 million realized gain on sale of Vantage at O'Connor in July of 2022, which contributed approximately $0.48 per unit to earnings during the third quarter before related general and administrative expenses. As of September 30, our net carrying value of the mortgage revenue bond was $4.6 million for GAAP purposes, inclusive of accrued interest which equals our expected proceeds upon final settlement of the bankruptcy case. The fair value of our mortgage revenue bond portfolio declined $32.2 million from June 30, due primarily to a $20 million decline in our overall unrealized gains due to rising market interest rates, and $11.6 million in redemptions and paydowns during the quarter."
