    "content": " TPV\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 8-point growth premium versus net revenue was almost entirely driven by our Powered by Marqeta customers, whose TPV continues to grow over 200%. The strong net revenue growth was broad-based with 20 of our top 30 customers growing at least 40% in the quarter, but led by Cash App in particular, fueled by their strong active user growth. Our net revenue take rate was 1 bps lower than last quarter and 3 bps lower than Q3 2021, mostly due to the growth of our Powered by Marqeta business, whose share of our total TPV increased 2 points versus last quarter and has doubled since Q3 last year. Q4 gross profit margin is expected to be 42% to 43% as our business mix shifts toward large customers who have better economics with us and the outsized growth of our financial services vertical, which carries a lower margin than other verticals. We now expect 2022 net revenue growth to be 44% to 45% \u00e2\u0080\u0093 44.5%, gross profit margin to be 42.5% to 43%, and adjusted EBITDA margin is expected to be negative 6% to 6.5%."
