    "content": " The net revenue and gross profit outperformance was primarily driven by three factors where results exceeded our expectations for the quarter: first, higher TPV across customers of all sizes; second, higher net revenue take rate due to favorable volume mix both in terms of merchant mix as well as PIN versus signature debit mix; and third, more robust usage of additional services not directly tied to TPV, such as card fulfillment. So more cash in, cash out, money in, money out type capabilities in support of our customers is we're just finding more and more of our customers and potential customers are -- have some aspect of a neo bank-like aspirations in their business, where they're taking deposits of multiple forms and then want to offer their customers flexibility to use those in different ways. And then customers where it's more of a monetization play and maybe not central to their business, they're saying, \"Well, we're scaling back on some investment, and a lot of that is going to be directed at the core business and not some of the additional new things we're going to try to do.\" And what we're really saying is for those newer customers, we don't think it's going to be one to three quarters."
