    "content": " Total revenues in 2022, were $205.6 million, an increase of $57.4 million or 38.8% compared to $148.1 million in 2021. These increases were offset by lower counterparty sharing revenues of $13.2 million in 2022 compared to 2021, due to these arrangements ending. Offsetting this decrease is an increase in general and administrative expenses of approximately $3.6 million, or 337.5% in 2022 as compared to 2021 associated with the Montauk Ag Renewables acquisition. Our corporate insurance premiums increased approximately $0.4 million, 6.8%, during 2022 compared to 2021 primarily related to premium increases. Finally, excluding our Montauk Ag Renewables acquisition, our professional fees increased approximately $0.8 million or 19.2% in 2022 as compared to 2021. Revenues from renewable electricity facilities in 2022 were $17.2 million, an increase of $1.7 million or 11.1% compared to $15.4 million in 2021. Our Bowerman facility contributed $1.2 million of the increase, which was primarily driven by a temporary shutdown of the facility in the fourth quarter of 2020 due to California wildfires, resulting in $0.6 million in reduced environmental attribute revenues in 2021 compared to 2022. RNG operating profit for 2022 was $94.4 million, an increase of $44 million or 87.6% compared to $50.4 million in 2021.
