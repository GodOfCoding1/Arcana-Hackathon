Pet remains an attractive growth category and while our sales were down in the quarter, we drove an increase in our POS by 6% versus prior year. As such, we are maintaining our EPS guidance of $2.60 to $2.80 for the year. Net sales were $628 million, a decline of 5% as we are comping strong growth in the prior year first quarter. Gross margin of 27.4% was down 260 basis points, largely driven by our Garden segment due to further cost inflation and commodities and much lighter sales volumes, resulting in unabsorbed overhead, which were partially offset by our pricing actions. Pet segment operating income declined by 13% to $40 million and operating margin decreased 90 basis points to 9.5%, largely driven by inflation and lower sales, partially offset by our pricing actions. Garden segment sales were $212 million down 6% due to lower sales in our live plant business and controls and fertilizer, which were partially offset by continued strength in wild bird and grass seed.
