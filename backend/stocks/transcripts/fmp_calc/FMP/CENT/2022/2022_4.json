    "content": " First, Central delivered solid fiscal 2022 results in a challenging environment, characterized by poor weather during the peak garden season, high inflation across key commodities, freight and labor, evolving consumer behavior and unfavorable retailer inventory dynamics, all of which manifested more prominently in the second half of our fiscal year. Second, while the near term economic outlook remains volatile and likely unfavorable, we remain confident in the macro trends that support pet and garden industry growth, the competitive strength of Central and our Central-to-home strategy as the roadmap to capture profitable growth in the years ahead. Our operating income grew 2% versus prior year, given net sales growth and gross margin expansion, offset by a 20 basis points increase in SG&A due to both higher logistics cost and continued investment in building key capabilities aligned to our strategy. Pet net sales for the fourth quarter decreased 4% to $440 million, unfavorably impacted by SKU rationalization and the purposeful exit of low profit private label product lines. CapEx for the year was $115 million, an increase of 43% over the prior year, reflecting our heightened focus on capacity expansion and automation and the purchase of a live plants growing facility in Paris, Kentucky to support our long term organic growth."
