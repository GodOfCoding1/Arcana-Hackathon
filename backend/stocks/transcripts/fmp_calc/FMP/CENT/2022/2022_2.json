    "content": " We feel good about the solid performance of our business given the current environment, especially after record net sales growth of 33% and EPS growth of 69% in the prior year quarter. However, looking at the growth over a 2-year period organic sales grew at a 14% CAGR in the second quarter. Pet segment operating income was $61 million, a decline of 2% compared to prior year, and operating margin declined 40 basis points to 12.2% due to inflationary headwinds in commodities freight and labor as well as purposeful investments in our growth initiatives to drive long-term growth. As Tim mentioned, the decline was driven by 3 factors: first, unfavorable weather across the country, causing a late start to the garden season, more than offsetting pricing action taken to cover inflation; second, some pull forward into Q1; third, our Garden segment is comping extraordinary growth in the prior year, and when looking at the growth over a 2-year period, organic garden sales increased at a 17% CAGR."
