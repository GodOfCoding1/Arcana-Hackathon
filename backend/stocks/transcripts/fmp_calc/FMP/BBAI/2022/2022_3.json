    "content": " Revenue for the third quarter was $40.7 million compared to $40.2 million in the third quarter of 2021, about 1% year-over-year growth and 8% quarter-over-quarter growth driven primarily by the September award of the GFIM OE Phase 2 contract. Our Analytics segment drove $22.7 million of revenue this quarter compared to about $21 million over the same period last year, which is 8% year-over-year growth, largely attributable to the addition of ProModel and the GFIM award in September. We also booked $1.6 million of restructuring costs and $600,000 of transaction costs in our Q3 operating expenses that are categorized as nonrecurring, although Q3 operating expenses were higher than the same period last year due to public company and infrastructure costs as well as integrated related expenses. The new agreement, we're going to have access to roughly $25 million of the credit facility going forward, and it's going to be related and based on our really strong government receivables."
