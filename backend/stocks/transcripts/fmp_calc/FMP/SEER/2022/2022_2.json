    "content": " As a reminder, these objectives are: first, supporting customers with an industry-leading experience while helping them to systematically scale their use of the Proteograph Product Suite for projects of increasing size and scope; second, expanding our global customer network and installed base of instruments; third, continuing to build out our team, commercial capabilities and geographic footprint; fourth, driving our product road map to enable more applications for our proprietary engineered nanoparticles; and fifth, expanding our partnership efforts to make it even easier for customers around the world and across markets to adopt our technology. The increase in R&D expenses was primarily due to an increase in product development efforts related to the Proteograph Product Suite, including $2.6 million in employee compensation costs and other related expenses, including stock-based compensation, due to growth in research and development personnel and an increase in expenses related to the build-out of our facilities to support our R&D efforts."
