    "content": " In closing, let me just say that 2022 was about growth and execution at EVgo, culminating in the company achieving the high end of our revenue and adjusted EBITDA guidance and continuing to lead in the EV charging sector in the U.S. As we continue to expand as one of the largest fast charging public networks in America, we look to leverage our operational expertise from our decade-long track record and continue driving operational efficiency, deploying capital that meets our robust return requirements."
