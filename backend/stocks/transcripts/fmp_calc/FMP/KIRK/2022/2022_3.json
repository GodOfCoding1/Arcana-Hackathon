    "content": " And then e-commerce has been a really intense part of our focus on making sure that we have the right platform, the customer experience, using our new CDP to be able to detail out, how do we make sure that we're sending the right emails to the right customer base, and not having to be promotional across the base, and really taking advantage of the fact that, we've got lots of new customers coming into the organization, and we want to treat them a little differently than what we've done in the past with some of our core customers that have expected a highly promotional environment. But overall, I would say we want to maintain the store base kind of where it is right now around, give or take 350 stores, most of them have worked their way into better rent situations over the last few years, as we achieved a lot of reductions post COVID, we've been able to maintain most of that, it's getting a little bit more difficult to do that. And that is one of our long range goals is to make sure that as we move into the specialty store pyramid, away from the Big Box pyramid that we've been kind of like, compared with over the years, we've got to do a great job of making sure that our stores look great and our assortment is really reflective of home furnishings, the same kind of things you might see at higher end retailers, but in our store can be offered at a little bit better price point with lower cost structure."
