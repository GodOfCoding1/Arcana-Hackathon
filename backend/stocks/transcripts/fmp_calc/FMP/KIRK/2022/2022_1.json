    "content": " Lastly, our plan to finally be in stock from an inventory perspective and bring in product for Q1 and Q2 sales early had a negative impact on our working capital that was compounded by the slow sales in the first quarter, which resulted in the $35 million draw on a revolving line of credit. We have taken a series of actions to reduce our reliance on the credit facility, which includes reducing expected inventory receipts by approximately $50 million in the back half of the second quarter through the remainder of the year, implementing operating cost reductions in the remainder of the fiscal year of $12 million to $15 million and increasing our level of promotion to turn through existing inventory at a faster pace. Please go ahead with your question. In terms of getting that inventory level down below $100 million, the first part is understanding the composition of the elevated -- I think by my math was, inventory was up about 70% year-over-year, obviously seen sales trends down high-teens in total. So we will have to be more promotional, I think in the coming months to liquidate through and get ourselves right at the right level of inventory, which I think Nicole said is around $100 million or a little bit less as we go into the next year. Please go ahead with your question. Please go ahead with your question. Please go ahead with your question. And then how much of that, inventory -- the difference between, let's say 100 and where you are now are in sort of spring seasonal goods like the outdoors, that you really want to sort of move before you get to the holiday versus, inventory that's everyday kinds of things that you would normally carry around. Please go ahead with your question."
