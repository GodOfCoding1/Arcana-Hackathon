    "content": " In 2022, we grew GoPro subscribers 43% year-over-year to $2.25 million, exceeding our annual target of $2.2 million and bringing our subscription and service revenue to an annual run rate of $100 million with 70% to 80% gross margin. Our 2023 plan is to maintain GoPro's ongoing profitability and end the year with a strong cash position of $325 million to $350 million, while investing in critical long-term growth opportunities that we believe will position GoPro well for when the global economy recovers. And so as we look ahead, as we drive more than $100 million of subscription and service revenue and continue to drive GoPro.com, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll probably be over 40% on our B2C business in 2023, right?"
