    "content": " And then, I\u2019d also point out, if you look at kind of how we guided Q2, historically, we have list, sequential lists of between 10% to 20% on units, and we're up 17% in Q2, which is driving the $240 million revenue guidance we gave, plus or minus $5 million. A primary driver of why we've been able to improve that conversion rate from last year's 18% to 39% in Q1 of this year, is because we've done a much better job of incorporating the benefits of being a subscriber into the Quik app, which is our GoPro app, and getting those benefits in front of users that have bought their GoPro at retail. So, we expect -- even today, as we're seeing strong usage trends and we're really happy to see how subscribers are taking advantage of the benefits, we think that that's going to increase over time, as we make the whole experience even more convenient for them. So, we're excited about that. As Brian noted, and it's a really important point, that we're seeing similar subscription rates amongst owners of all of our cameras, whether it's HERO8, HERO9, our flagship 10 Black, Max. So, we're excited about that."
