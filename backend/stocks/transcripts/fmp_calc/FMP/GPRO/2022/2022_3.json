The management commentary, slides as well as a link to today's live webcast and a replay of this conference call are posted on the Investor Relations section of GoPro's Web site for your reference. As we shared in the management commentary, which we posted to the Investor Relations section of our Web site, in Q3 2022, GoPro delivered revenue of 305 million at the high end of guidance and cash flow from operations of $41 million. On a constant currency basis, Q3 revenue would have been approximately $18 million higher year-over-year, or up 2%, gross margin over 40% versus 38% actual results and EBITDA to revenue approximately 16% versus 12% actual results. At the end of Q3, GoPro subscribers and subscription and service revenue grew respectively by 55% and 48% year-over-year to 2.1 million and $21 million, which positively contributes to gross margin and our bottom line."
