    "content": " Total inventory at the end of the first fiscal quarter increased 112% to $527 million compared to a year ago, driven by the return of seasonal inventory built and acquired businesses. Gross profit increased 9% to $110 million in the first quarter compared to the prior year, primarily driven by margin insulation offered by our service, parts, and other revenues, partially offset by a shift in the mix of the size of the boat sold. Your line is open, please go ahead. Your line is open, please go ahead. Your line is open, please go ahead. The other thing I'll point out, right is just to reemphasize the point we've made a handful of times, despite this haircut on the new boat margins, we're seeing used boat margins hold up well, we're also seeing that our expansion into parts and service, those expansions that higher margin business, really supporting our overall margin and keeping it that 30%. I think the whole entire sales staff saw coming out of the boat shows that hey, it's not like it used to be, we have to get back to be the elite sales team that we were and we're going to step up our game, because nobody's going to beat us."
