    "content": " At the end of the second quarter of 2022, we held $293 million of inventory, an increase of $107 million compared to the prior year period. Second quarter revenue increased 34% to $442 million from $329.6 million in the prior year quarter, fueled by a significant increase in parts, service and other revenue and an 8% increase in same-store sales. Gross profit increased 61% to $142.5 million in the second quarter compared to $88.8 million in the prior year, primarily driven by the increase in gross margin of new and pre-owned sales and the fundamental mix shift towards the higher-margin service, parts and other sales. Operating income increased 53% to $59.4 million compared to $38.7 million in the prior year, driven by an increase in gross profit primarily offset by SG&A expenses. Net income for the fiscal second quarter totaled $42.4 million, or $2.54 per diluted share, up 38% from $30.6 million, or $1.83 per diluted share, in the prior year."
