    "content": " We delivered another record quarter, with revenue increasing 41% to $569 million and adjusted EBITDA rising 45% to $95 million compared to the prior year. At the end of the third quarter of 2022, inventory totaled $269 million, which includes our recently acquired dealerships, compared to the fiscal second quarter of 2022, inventory was down $24 million. Gross profit increased 45% to $184 million in the third quarter, compared to $127 million in the prior year quarter. Operating income increased 35% to $88 million, compared to $65 million in the prior year, driven by the increase in gross profit. As a percentage of sales, operating income margin was 15.4% in the quarter, and as a result, adjusted EBITDA increased to $95 million, compared to $66 million in the prior year. Net income for the fiscal third quarter totaled $65 million or $3.86 per diluted share, up 25% from $52 million or $3.04 per diluted share in the prior year. Total inventory as of June 30, 2022, was $269 million and remains constrained as evidenced by our same-store inventory being down approximately 10% in dollars compared to June 2019, this despite the price increase that have occurred over the past three years. Looking ahead for the full fiscal year 2022, we are raising our outlook for adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $240 million to $250 million and earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $9.20 per diluted share to $9.60 per diluted share. And as you think about that, we indicated before that we expect that to close here in our fiscal fourth quarter and it will not have a meaningful impact to the quarter, it maybe grows maybe $1 million a month of EBITDA out there."
