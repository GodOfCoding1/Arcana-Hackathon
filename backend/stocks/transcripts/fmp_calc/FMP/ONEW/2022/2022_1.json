    "content": " Revenue for the first quarter increased 57% to $336 million, and even in the face of an ongoing industry-wide supply chain constraints, we increased same-store sales by 28% on top of an incredible 38% comp in the prior year. Fiscal first quarter of 2022 revenue increased 57% to $336 million from $214.1 million in the prior-year quarter, which was fueled by a 28% same-store sales increase. New boat sales grew 56% to $236 million in the fiscal first quarter of 2022, and pre -owned boat sales increased 39% to $53.4 million. Finance in insurance revenue increased 56% to $9.3 million in the first quarter of 2022 and service parts and other sales increased 111% to 37.3 million, driven by our same-store sales growth and businesses recently acquired. Gross profit increased 93% to $101 million in the first quarter, compared to $52.4 million in the prior year, primarily driven by the increase in gross margins of new and pre -owned boat sales and an increase in the higher-margin, service parts, and other sales. And this quarter just happened to probably have some deals push out and then the boats came in early because everybody took some Christmas time, so we didn't have as much dependence on the last seven to 10 days between Christmas and New Year was not as -- we weren't as dependent on that as we would be like the last 10 days of March. So I think it's -- I think we'll be able to be in and around the number from last year and then just like Austin said, it's going to depend on how those flow at the end of the quarter. It's something that I think that my views are that the old model of having two turns a year like most dealers do, we were always much higher, but ordering the right boats and using the technology that we have to make sure that the boats that we have in stock are what everybody wants, instead of -- I've used this example in the past."
