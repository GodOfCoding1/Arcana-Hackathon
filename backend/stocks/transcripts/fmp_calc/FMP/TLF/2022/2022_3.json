    "content": " Although sales were down 1.2% over Q3 of last year, improved gross margin and operating expense discipline resulted in $1 million in operating profit for the quarter and $1.5 million in adjusted EBITDA, adjusting for non-cash items such as depreciation and stock-based compensation, as well as interest, taxes and onetime expenses related to the restatement. While the end of Q3 is usually our high point of inventory for the year as we built for Black Friday and holiday at $42.3 million in inventory at the end of Q3 this year, were down $1.4 million compared to the end of Q3 last year as we adjusted our buys to reflect the lower trend of sales. The higher gross margin rate reflects a combination of factors, the better full price selling that I just mentioned, the modest price increases that we've been taking in response to significantly increased product-related costs and the channel shift, more sales came from e-commerce, our highest margin channel unless from commercial, which has lower gross margins. Better gross profit, combined with a 4% decline in operating expenses over last year helped deliver $1 million in operating income and $1.5 million in adjusted EBITDA. On a year-to-date basis, we're still behind last year's operating income by $0.6 million, but this quarter has helped us make up some growth."
