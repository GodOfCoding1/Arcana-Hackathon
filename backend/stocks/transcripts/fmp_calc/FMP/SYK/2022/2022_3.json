    "content": " We remain confident in the outlook of our business and expect to continue to deliver sales growth at the high end of med tech, which is reflected in our narrowing of full year organic sales growth to the higher end of our prior range, now 8.5% to 9%. Though the inflationary pressures and supply chain challenges will continue to impact next year, the strong growth outlook, combined with our pricing and cost actions, will position us well to return to strong earnings growth. Our adjusted gross margin of 62.6% was unfavorable approximately 370 basis points from the third quarter of 2021, reflecting the impact of the purchases of electronic components at premium prices and other inflationary pressures primarily related to labor, steel and transportation costs as well as inefficiencies from supply chain disruption and the unfavorable impact of price and foreign exchange on sales. Considering our third quarter results, our strong order book for capital equipment and the sales momentum in our implant and capital businesses, we now expect full year 2022 organic sales growth to be in the range of 8.5% to 9%. Next year, which might be a little high given the trends we're seeing here, would love to hear if you have any initial comments on thoughts on 2023 and particularly what that strong EPS growth means. We have a number of new products we're launching: System 9 camera in the early part of the year -- sorry, System 9 power tool in the early part of the year; 1780 camera around the middle of the year; and then we've got a defibrillator, which is a little less certain on timing because it's a PMA product, but the life pack perhaps towards the latter part of the year."
