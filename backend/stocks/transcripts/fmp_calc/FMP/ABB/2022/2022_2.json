    "content": " Looking ahead into the third quarter, we expect a clearly stronger growth rate for comparable revenues than the 10% we had in the second quarter, and somewhat of a sequentially higher operational EBITDA margin. RA's operational EBITDA margin decreased by 330 basis points year-on-year to 8.2%, mainly driven by Robotics as the missing volumes from the lockdown in China and cost inflation more than offset cost measures and positive impact from price. Good morning, Ann-Sofie, Bjorn and Timo. Robotic business is now also seeing relief from the semiconductors and we will see a good improvement in deliveries during the second half and also improvement well over 10%, both during these quarters coming up there. Good morning, Ann-Sofie, Bjorn and Timo."
