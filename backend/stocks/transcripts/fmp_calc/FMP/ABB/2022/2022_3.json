    "content": " Looking ahead into the fourth quarter, we expect double-digit growth in comparable revenues and the seasonal pattern to repeat, meaning a sequentially lower operational EBITA margin. In addition to a strong underlying market, the 24% comparable growth was also driven by large orders, including the approximately $170 million in traction orders. Looking at comparable revenues, it was good to see RA return to positive growth of 12% after having been held back by shortages of electrical components and COVID-related lockdowns in China in recent quarters. Similar to the other business areas, RA's profitability benefited from higher volumes and a positive price impact as the operational EBITA margin increased by 170 basis points to 12.8%, underlined by both divisions in double-digit territory. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you very much."
