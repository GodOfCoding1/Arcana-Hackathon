    "content": "  In the September quarter, our net investment income, or NII, was $99.3 million, or basic NII of $0.22 per common share exceeding our distribution rate per common share by $0.04 and 22%. Our NAV stood at $10.01 cent per common share in September, down $0.47 and 4.5% from the prior quarter, largely due to unrealized mark to market depreciation from macro condition. Over the 10 quarters from the pre-pandemic December 2019 quarter to the June 2022 quarter, Prospect delivered the highest growth in the business development company industry in net asset value per common share with NAV per common share increasing by 21% over that time period. In the September quarter, our net debt-to-equity ratio was 53.5% down 20.6 percentage points from March 2020 and down 3.3 percentage points from the June quarter as we continue to run an underleveraged balance sheet, which has been the case for us over multiple quarters and years. As of September, our portfolio at fair value comprised 51.8% first lien debt, up 1.9% from the prior quarter; 19% second lien debt, down 0.4% from the prior quarter; 9.2% subordinated structured notes with underlying secured first lien collateral, down 0.2% from the prior quarter and 20% unsecured debt and equity investments, down 1.3% from the prior quarter. To date, we have raised approximately $1.2 billion in aggregate issuance of our perpetual preferred stock across our preferred programs and listed preferred, including $288 million in the September 2022 quarter and $163 million to date in the current December 2022 quarter, with the ability potentially to upsize such programs based on significant balance sheet capacity."
