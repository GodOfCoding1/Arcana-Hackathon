    "content": " Q3 revenue for BEST Supply Chain Management increased by 15.2% year-over-year to RMB461.5 million, and its gross margin improved by 3.5 percentage points to 7.2%, primarily due to newly signed key account customers with better unit economics, paired with the continuous efforts to discontinue certain low-margin legacy accounts. Selling, general and administrative expenses were RMB260.5 million, 12.8% of our total revenue, compared with RMB250.1 million or 8.9% of the total revenue in the second quarter of last year, primarily due to additional expenses related to wind down of BEST Capital."
