    "content": " For the third quarter of 2022, we achieved revenue of $53.4 million, which outperformed the high-end of our financial guidance by approximately $1 million and represented a growth of 34%. We exited the quarter with 13.7 million registered users live on our digital banking platform, up 2.3 million or 20% compared to last year and up 390,000 digital users sequentially. Through the third quarter, we renewed 11 client relationships representing 5% of ARR and adding over $40 million to our clients\u00e2\u0080\u0099 remaining purchase obligation or client contract backlog. Our adjusted EBITDA loss for the third quarter was $4.6 million, which is probably 16% better than our expectations and $1.5 million or 24% better than the prior year quarter. And then also, Andrew, what I think is equally as important is we exit Q3 with $43 million of ARR in our implementation backlog, and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s up well over 50% from the prior year quarter."
