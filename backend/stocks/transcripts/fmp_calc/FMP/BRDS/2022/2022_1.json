    "content": " Through our cost savings initiatives, we expect to achieve at least $80 million in annual run rate cost savings for fiscal year 2022, the majority of which will be realized by the third quarter resulting in an annual adjusted operating expense run rate of no more than $160 million. Furthermore, we're targeting our first full year of positive adjusted EBITDA in 2023, which is achieved with year-over-year revenue growth of approximately 20% to 40% based on our current expectations for 2022 alongside an acceleration toward positive cash flow generation. We expect to realize the majority of the associated cost savings by Q3, which we believe will position us to deliver our first quarter of positive adjusted EBITDA in addition to delivering on other profitability and cash flow objectives, which Yibo outlined. And however, given the timing of the actions we're taking, we're not really in a position to give Q2 guidance in light of the cost savings initiatives and the updated , the full year top line performance, we do expect some headwinds, potentially in the back half of the quarter with the slowing of the expansion that product sales portfolio, as I mentioned earlier. So as you mentioned, we have pulled up a significant amount of our CapEx through the last two quarters, we saw a pretty significant outflows of vehicle CapEx for primarily 2022 deployments and 2023 deposits, we did end April with over $90 million in total cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash and cash equivalents."
