    "content": " To recap this substantial progress we made in 2022: first, we sharpened our geographic and product focus on our highest yielding cities and business lines and exited lower-margin markets and products; Second, we initiated cost optimization efforts that we expect will result in an approximately 60% reduction in operating expenses to no more than $100 million in fiscal 2023 versus our second quarter 2022 run-rate; Third, we enhanced our Executive and Board leadership, adding members with the track-record of success in our industry to support our strategic focus on shared micromobility."
