    "content": " At the end of March, we had more than a quarter million customers enrolled in Utility Assistance Programs, with $71 million in funding applied to those accounts, compared to the first quarter of 2021 that\u2019s an increase of more than 17% in contributions directly benefiting customers enrolled in these assistance programs this year. Excluding the impact of our recently issued equity, rate credits provided to Ohio customers under our PUCO approved stipulation last year and an accounting policy changes, operating earnings increased by $0.03 per share compared to the first quarter of 2021. In our transmission business first quarter results increased $0.03 per share, primarily due to rate base growth associated with our ongoing investments in our Energizing the Future program and in our corporate segment, our results compared to the first quarter of 2021, primarily reflect lower interest expense and higher investment returns. It\u2019s moved our funded status from 82% at the end of last year to 84%, which is about a $350 million improvement in the liability, which improves credit metrics by about 20 basis points. Please proceed with your questions. Please proceed with your questions. A lot of it\u2019s going to depend on what we do with the final $800 million of the proceeds, whether we fund the pension or take out additional holding company debt. Please proceed with your questions. Please proceed with your questions. Please proceed with your questions."
