    "content": " Starting with revumenib, our highly selective menin inhibitor, our pivotal Phase 2 AUGMENT-101 trial evaluating revumenib in patients with relapsed/refractory NPM1 mutant or MLLr acute leukemia is ongoing. Enrollment is now complete in our pivotal Phase 2 AGAVE-201 trial evaluating axatilimab in patients with chronic graft versus host disease, and we expect to report data on the trial in mid-2023. First, our pivotal Phase 2 AUGMENT-101 trial is designed as three single-arm Phase 2 trial that enroll independently and can each provide the basis for a co-regulatory filing in the U.S. Each trial is designed to enroll approximately 64 patients, adult patients and up to 10 pediatric patients, aged 1 month or older. This trial is supported by positive Phase 1/2 data in 40 cGVHD patients that we presented at ASH in 2021, where the overall response rate was 68% and the median time on treatment was over 6 months. Please go ahead, your line is open. I think we talked \u00e2\u0080\u0093 about the fact that the enrollment in Phase1, I think, was initially skewed more towards MLLr patients than NPM1 is the initial patients who came into the trial did quite well and received a response with the MLLr. Please go ahead, your line is open. Please go ahead, your line is open."
