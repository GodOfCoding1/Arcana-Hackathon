    "content": " Our pivotal Phase II AUGMENT-101 trial evaluating revumenib in patients with relapsed/refractory NPM1 mutant or MLLr acute leukemia is enrolling well and we continue to expect data from one of the three cohorts, beginning in the first half of 2023. Our pivotal Phase 2 AGAVE-201 trial evaluating axatilimab in patients with chronic graft versus host disease or cGVHD, is enrolling well and we continue to expect data in the first half of 2023. As we look at the competitive landscape and engage with experts in the field, we believe revumenib's compelling clinical profile as demonstrated in the robust Phase 1 experience in 59 patients that we presented at ASH in 2001, positions revumenib to not only be the first-in-class but also at potentially best-in-class treatment. Beyond the AUGMENT-101 pivotal program in relapsed/refractory disease, slide 5 highlights some of the additional opportunities that we are exploring with revumenib, all of which build on revumenib's excellent safety and efficacy profile that lends well to the treatment across all settings and in combination with currently approved agents. This trial is supported by positive Phase 1/2 data in 40 cGVHD patients we presented at ASH in 2021, where the overall response rate was 68% and the median time on treatment was over six months."
