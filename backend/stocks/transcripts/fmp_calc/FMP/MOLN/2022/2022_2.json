    "content": " What is -- why do we do both every 3 and every week, that's also the partnering dimension as in combination trials, you want to have the flexibility to go more often is the partner product is given more often and to Q3 weeks would allow you a more extended less frequent dosing, but then you can actually choose what you want to do. The basic part, we just touched on, and then Radioligand, but also other things we're doing kind of really exciting times for building value in our pipeline, and we really look forward especially to next year where we can unveil a few of our programs that are then likely going to reach candidate stage and we'll be ready to be discussed with you. So we don't -- we can sort of ask those companies, large ones, midsized pharmas that are on that pathway and the interest is definitely given to look at the data and then let's see when the data holds also partner. But we're making good progress on radioligand therapy, and it is a bit an antithesis to the multi-DARPin so that's one reason we wanted to also highlight at this time."
