    "content": " As we begin the call, I think it's important to remind everyone we committed to our shareholders during the first quarter of 2022 to solely focus Vyant Bio as an emerging global drug discovery company pursuing the discovery and development of novel and repurpose therapeutics to treat neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative diseases such as RET syndrome, CDKL5 deficiency disorder or CDD, and Parkinson's disease. The compound has already been approved by the FDA as a cognition-enhancing medication for dementia related to Alzheimer's disease and there are readily available safety data, VYNT0126 exhibits a consistent dose dependent rescue of several Rett disease phenotypes and our Rett patient-derived organoids and we are working with the International Rett Syndrome Foundation to file an investigational new drug application for Rett repurposing candidate in Q4 of 2022 and the request Orphan Drug Designation."
