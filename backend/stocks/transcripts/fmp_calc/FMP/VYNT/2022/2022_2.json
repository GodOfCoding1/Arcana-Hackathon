As disclosed in our Form 10-Q filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission this afternoon, in July 2022 as part of the company's periodic evaluation of factors that impact the company's execution of its business, financial and research development plans, particularly in light of the current status of the overall biotech financial markets, the company is emphasizing its operational focus and capital resources on developing therapeutic candidates to treat Rett syndrome.

Total revenue from continuing operations decreased 50% or $164,00 to $165,000 for three months ended June 30, 2022 as compared with $329,000 for the three months ended June 30, 2021.

The increase in discontinuing operations losses in the first half of 2022 as compared with the prior year is the result of non-cash impairment charges of $1.5 million in the second quarter of 2022 based on offers we received for the vivoPharm business and a $4.3 million impairment charge during the quarter ended March 31, 2022 resulting from change marketing conditions for contract research organizations from December 31, 2021 to March 31, 2022."
