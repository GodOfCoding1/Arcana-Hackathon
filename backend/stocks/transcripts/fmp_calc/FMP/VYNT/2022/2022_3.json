    "content": " I will now turn the call over to our Chief Scientific Officer, Dr. Robert Fremeau, who will talk to you a little more about the scientific meetings and take us through some of the compelling data that we have generated from our R&D work on our discovery platform, as well as details of the collaboration with the International Rett Syndrome Foundation to advance VYNT-0126 into a proof-of-concept clinical trial in Australia. Our current drug discovery programs are targeting two rare CNS genetic neurodevelopmental disorders, Rett Syndrome and CDKL5 deficiency disorder and Parkinson\u00e2\u0080\u0099s disease, the second most common neurogenic disorder. Based on these findings and with the support and encouragement of the clinical trial committee of the International Rett Syndrome Foundation, I am pleased to announce that on November 14, 2022, we submitted a clinical trial application with the Alfred Hospital Human Research Ethics Committee to conduct a Phase 2 proof-of-concept clinical trial for donepezil in adult Rett patients in Australia. For me, these recent events really represent important milestones for Rett Vyant Bio as we strive to establish the value of our proprietary CNS drug discovery platform to discover novel therapeutics for CNS genetic diseases that could potentially halt disease progression or perhaps even cure disease. As we come to the final part of today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s call, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d like to conclude by reiterating our intense focus on meeting key milestones initially with our programs to further validate our drug discovery platform through the work we are doing in the two rare diseases for Rett and CDKL5 deficiency disorder and the subsequent R&D investments we are making to the identification of novel therapeutics to address these diseases."
