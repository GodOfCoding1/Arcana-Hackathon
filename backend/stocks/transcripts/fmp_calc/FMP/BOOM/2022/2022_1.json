    "content": " Arcadia maintained consistent gross profit dollars versus the first quarter last year despite a more than 20% increase in the cost of aluminum, which is Arcadia\u2019s primary input. At NobelClad, our composite metals business, rolling 12-month bookings at the end of the first quarter were $91 million, up from $81 million at the end of last year\u2019s first quarter. Sales at NobelClad were $21.9 million, up 3% sequentially and up 25% versus last year\u2019s first quarter. Consolidated gross margin in the first quarter was 27%, up from 18% in the fourth quarter of 2021 and 23% in last year\u2019s first quarter. NobelClad\u2019s first quarter gross margin declined to 19% from 20% in the fourth quarter and 26% in the year ago first quarter, primarily due to less favorable project mix and the prior year CARES Act credits. First quarter adjusted net loss attributable to DMC was $3.1 million or $0.16 per diluted share versus adjusted net income of $559,000 or $0.04 per diluted share in last year\u2019s first quarter. Stephen, your line is live. First of all, all three of our businesses are manufactured products and asset-light business models where there\u2019s either a know-how in NobelClad, a system approach versus a component approach in DynaEnergetics or a combination of different product and end markets that Arcadia brings. Stephen, your line is live. Our margin\u2019s percentages have softened over the last \u2013 well, it\u2019s up over the fourth quarter, but we feel that they should be stronger in the second half of the year compared to the first as we work through our backlog with lower-price materials and also get our price increases implemented."
