    "content": " Lastly, turning to our fixed income business, for the first quarter of 2022, we generated fixed income revenues of $55 million, up 9% compared to the fourth quarter of 2021. We generated net revenues of $362 million for the first quarter of 2022, driven by strong results from our advisory and brokerage businesses. Your line is open. I would say just to your first question on advisory, while we certainly have a handful of deals, especially the ones that are impacted by public stock price that that have gone away, for the most part our sponsor business is quite strong and relative to signing up new deals sort of in the first four months of this year, we feel really good about that pace. Your line is open. Okay, that's very clear. Yes, so one thing I would say is, we do definitely see that our activity in our fixed income businesses, quite highly correlated to the level of interest rates, obviously, higher rates creating higher activity, we saw some of that in the quarter as we picked up from where we were at the end of last year. Okay, that's very clear. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open."
