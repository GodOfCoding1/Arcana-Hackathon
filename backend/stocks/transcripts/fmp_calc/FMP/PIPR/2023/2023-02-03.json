    "content": " We generated total corporate investment banking revenues of $258 million for the fourth quarter of 2022, up 20% sequentially, driven by strong performance in our advisory business. Specific to advisory services, we generated $221 million of revenues during the fourth quarter, up 26% sequentially, a strong finish, but given the market headwinds, this was less than the typical seasonal pickup of our fourth quarters historically. For the full year of 2022, we generated $108 million of municipal financing revenues, down 34% from last year. For the fourth quarter of 2022, we generated fixed income revenues of $50 million, up 34% on a sequential basis, and flat compared to the fourth quarter of last year. We generated net revenues of $391 million for the fourth quarter of 2022, up 17% from the third quarter, driven by solid performances across our advisory and brokerage businesses. Net revenues for 2022 totaled $1.4 billion, down 28% from the exceptional prior year, which benefited from record corporate investment banking, municipal financing, and fixed income brokerage activity. Non-compensation expenses, excluding reimbursed deal expenses for the fourth quarter of 2022, was $62 million, up 3% compared to the third quarter of this year, and consistent with our expectations. During the fourth quarter, we generated operating income of $76 million, and an operating margin of 19.3%, our strongest quarter this year."
