    "content": " Yesterday, after market closed, we reported Q2 net investment income per share of $0.41, driven by higher levels of investment income earned across our portfolio investments during the quarter. While BCSF's investment in the SLP represented just 2% of our portfolio with fair value as of quarter end, we can grow this investment over time as we identify new loan opportunities, and this can contribute to higher levels of interest income and dividend income for our shareholders. At the end of the second quarter, the size of our investment portfolio at fair value was $2.3 billion across a highly diversified set of 122 portfolio companies operating across 31 different industries. As of June 30, 71% of the investment portfolio at fair value was invested in first lien debt; 4% in second lien debt; 2% in subordinated debt; 3% in preferred equity; 9% in equity interest; and 10% across our joint ventures, broken out between 8% in the ISLP and 2% in the SLP. ISLP's investment portfolio at fair value as of June 30 was approximately $541 million, comprised of investments in 31 portfolio companies operating across 14 different industries. As of June 30, SLP's investment portfolio at fair value was approximately $433 million, comprised of investments in 45 portfolio companies operating across 20 different industries. Within our internal risk rating scale, 92% of our portfolio at fair value as of June 30 was comprised of risk rating 1 and 2 investments, indicating the companies were performing in line or better than expectations relative to our initial underwriting."
