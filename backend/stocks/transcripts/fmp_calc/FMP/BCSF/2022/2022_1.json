    "content": " Q1 new investment fundings were $371 million across 42 portfolio companies, including $247 million in 11 new companies, $72 million in 29 existing companies, $11 million in the ISLP, and $41 million in SLP. In addition, the company contributed $351 million of investments to SLP, resulting in our net funded portfolio declining by $150 million quarter-over-quarter. As of March 31st, 70% of the investment portfolio at fair value was invested in first lien debt, 5% in second lien debt, 2% into coordinated debt, 3% in preferred equity, 9% in common equity interest and 10% across our joint ventures split between 8% in the ISLP and 2% in the SLP. As of March 31st SLPs investment, pardon me, SLPs investment portfolio at fair value was approximately $372 million comprised investments in 41 companies operating across 21 different industries. As of March 31st, 91.5% of our portfolio at fair value was comprised of risk rating one and two investments. Those had been marked in the mid-80s and as we've seen the market for those companies pick-up meaningfully those marks moved up quarter-over-quarter, contributing to that north of 1% NAV improvement across our standard first lien investment."
