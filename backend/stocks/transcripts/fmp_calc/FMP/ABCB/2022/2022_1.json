    "content": " Exclusive of CPP runoff, loans grew over $350 million or 8.9% annualized during the first quarter. This quarter, our margin actually expanded by 17 basis points and our NII increased by $5.7 million or just over 3% compared to last quarter. And you can see that excluding the PPP runoff, net loan growth was $350.7 million or 8.9% annualized for the quarter. And you went in and out a little bit there, but I think your question was mortgage and the fact that it's been kind of that the retail mortgage is about 12%, 12.5% in the last two quarters and where do we kind of see that, especially as rates go up. It is about $1 billion to $1.4 billion, $1.5 billion of loan growth and then about $500 million to $1 billion in the bond purchases, $250 million is public fund cyclicality that we still -- we have a half run out in the first quarter. I think if we take that, it looks like maybe adjusted for seasonal expenses and the negative credit resolution, maybe $140 million is kind of a good base rate. But through -- so far through yesterday, we purchased a little over $300 million, we're getting about a 3% yield, maybe a little bit better than that and about a 4-year duration."
