    "content": " For the second quarter, we reported net income of $90.1 million or $1.30 per diluted share and $81.5 million or $1.18 per diluted share on an adjusted basis when you exclude the quarter's MSR recovery. On the asset side of the balance sheet, we deployed approximately $1.5 billion of our excess liquidity this quarter by investing approximately $500 million in our bond portfolio and then organically growing loans by $1.4 billion during the quarter. As previously mentioned, we did report a $15 million provision in the second quarter due to strong loan growth and updated economic forecast. So as you mentioned, for the second quarter, we reported net income of $9.1 million or $1.30 per diluted share. On the revenue side of things, our interest income for the quarter increased $19.2 million over last quarter and $28.8 million from the second quarter of last year. We've deployed about $1.5 billion of excess liquidity into higher earning assets to include about $500 million in the bond portfolio, and we funded the $1.4 billion of organic loan growth. So in the second quarter, we portfolio-ed about the $515 million, and that was at a really good rate of about 4.73% rate of what we portfolio-ed. So we definitely feel like we have the liquidity, but we don't anticipate as big of a push in the future is what we did this quarter between the mortgages and the portfolio, from the loan growth and then the $500 million of that bond portfolio."
