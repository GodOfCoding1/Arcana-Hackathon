    "content": " Despite adverse weather during the fourth quarter of 2022 and continued supply chain constraints that impacted productivity, I am proud of the hard work and perseverance displayed by our talented teams throughout our organization. Total revenue for the full year ended December 31, 2022, was $362 million compared to $229 million for the full year 2021. On a year-over-year basis, we sold 40% more sand in 2022 than the prior year and the average price per ton increased $10.35 or 62% when compared to the 2021 average. Adjusted EBITDA, as defined and reconciled in our earnings release, was $24.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2022 as compared to $17.2 million for the fourth quarter of last year. Excluding the non-recurring $3.5 million of bad debt expense that our Sand division incurred during the fourth quarter of 2022, adjusted EBITDA would have been $27.6 million for the quarter. Full year adjusted EBITDA was $86.1 million in 2022, an increase of $97.7 million year-over-year."
