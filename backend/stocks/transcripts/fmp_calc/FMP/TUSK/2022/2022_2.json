    "content": " Total revenue was $89.7 million, up 44% sequentially from our 2022 first quarter revenue. Net income was $1.7 million, a major positive swing compared to the net loss of $14.8 million we reported in the first quarter of 2022. And our second quarter adjusted EBITDA was $23 million, a sequential increase of 147% compared to $9.3 million for the first quarter of 2022. Our robust second quarter growth in revenue, net income and adjusted EBITDA resulted from substantial gains in our infrastructure services, well completion services and our sand business. At today's pricings -- pricing, we would expect seven operating fleets to generate between $63 million and $84 million in net income per year and between $105 million and $126 million in EBITDA per year. The 44% sequential increase in revenue is primarily attributable to the more favorable macroeconomic environment surrounding our key business segments, most notably, well completion services, which posted the strongest quarter since mid 2019. Our sand division sold approximately 350,000 tons of sand during the second quarter of 2022 compared to 255,000 tons of sand during the same quarter last year, and 329,000 tons of sand during the first quarter of 2022. Adjusted EBITDA, as defined and reconciled in our earnings release, was $23 million for the second quarter of 2022 as compared to a negative $3.3 million for the second quarter of 2021 and $9.3 million for the first quarter of 2022."
