    "content": " Our gross margin in the first half and the second quarter of 2022 has been impacted by broad ranging increases in direct material costs, indirect costs, including freight and logistics, as well as the launch of the FX20 in Q1 2022, which continues to experience higher component material and labor costs as we ramp this exciting new product to commercial production. In the case of the FX20, we think that costs are back in line for us Q1 next year, really by the end of this year, but you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll see the impact of that Q1 of next year as we are reaching what we would call commercial volumes. I was hoping just to shift gears a little bit, that you could comment a bit on the Digital Metal acquisition sort of, I guess, maybe commenting on why this is the right fit and how to think about \u00e2\u0080\u0093 how we should think about it from a quantitative perspective in terms of ramping over the next few years."
