    "content": " While in the Americas, we are experiencing delayed purchased decisions as a result of near term macro uncertainty we executed on our growth strategy in both the EMEA and APAC regions in the fourth quarter of 2022, with revenues growing 36% in EMEA and 20% in APAC year-over-year. For the fiscal year 2022, our revenue increased 11% to $101 million compared with revenue of $91.2 million for the full year 2021. For fiscal year 2022, gross profit was $51.3 million compared to $53.4 million for fiscal year 2021 reflecting a 50.8% gross profit margin in 2022 compared to 58.5% in the prior year. We expect operating expenses to decline as a percentage of our revenue including the impact of the two acquisitions we completed in 2022, resulting in a non-GAAP operating loss in the range of $55 million to $58 million for the full year. Please proceed with your question. Please proceed with your question. Please proceed with your question. And then just can we talk a little bit more about gross margin and just with the goal here of trying to understand where the sources of improvement could come from the company was running at like 58% gross margin and then going into '22 and then '22 originally you're expecting 56% in the supply chain, it's the cost of the FX20. And do you see that we are launching a new product now with the PX100, which is a very, very fast binder jetting solution for metal parts, can do up to 1,050 per hour, it's also just over $0.5 million solution that we believe will have some impact during 2023.
