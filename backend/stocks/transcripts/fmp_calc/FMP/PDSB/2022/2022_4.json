    "content": " This randomized, controlled Phase 3 trial will investigate PDS0101 in combination with KEYTRUDA versus KEYTRUDA alone in ICI na\u00c3\u00afve patients with recurrent or metastatic HPV 16 Positive head and neck cancer. For example, assume we design a 350 patient trial, but wait a few months later and understand exactly whether we actually see an improvement in overall survival potentially with a dual combination, maybe we end up starting a few months later, but with a much smaller design that's a lot more efficient, which would then dramatically reduce our cost and speed to commercialization. We are targeting to present data potentially either at ASCO, ESMO, and also potentially SITC related not only to the updated clinical outcomes in the ICI na\u00c3\u00afve population as it relates to PFS and overall survival, which, again, Frank noted, will inform our design of VERSATILE-003, but also confirmation and examination of the immunogenicity parameters that we are seeing in VERSATILE-002. And so, that delta is really going to determine the statistics in terms of what's the size of the patient population that we're going to need before we see PFS, if we have seen an increase in PFS, but very importantly, we would also want that to be associated with an increase in overall survival, at least an indication that we improved on overall survival. However, to complete design of that trial and to have an efficient trial, we're also looking at PDS0101 plus KEYTRUDA which is a commercial checkpoint inhibitor in this exact patient population we're going to be treating, which is recurrent metastatic head and neck cancer. And so, we hope to see, in addition to whether or not we see tumor shrinkage and declines in circulating tumor DNA and whether or not those are predictive of disease recurrence, we would potentially design a randomized trial to look at PDS0101 alone versus PDS0101 in combination with KEYTRUDA in this neoadjuvant treatment setting."
