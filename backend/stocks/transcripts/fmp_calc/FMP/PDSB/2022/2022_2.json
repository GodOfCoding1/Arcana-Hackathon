    "content": " Earlier this morning, PDS Biotech issued a press release announcing financial results for the quarter ended June 30, 2022. We encourage everyone to read the press release as well as PDS Biotech's report on Form 10-Q, which will be filed with the SEC shortly. Before we begin, we need to remind everyone that, on today's call, the company will be making forward-looking statements regarding regulatory and product candidate development plans, as well as research activity. Certain information in this presentation may include forward-looking statements, including within the meaning of Section 21E of the United States Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended in Section 27A of the United States Securities Act of 1933 as amended, concerning PDS Biotechnology Corporation and other matters. These statements may discuss goals, intentions and expectations as to future plans, trends, events, results of operations, or financial condition or otherwise based on current beliefs of the company's management, as well as assumptions made by, and information currently available to, management. Except to the extent which is required by applicable law or regulation, PDSB undertakes no obligation to update the forward-looking statements included today to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. As you can see, we're utilizing slides to help summarize our programs and milestones and aiming to streamline the presentation of background information and updates. This past quarter, the PDS Biotech team has worked diligently to advance the development of our oncology and infectious disease pipelines, and we have made tremendous progress on these fronts. Here you can see the broad overview of our lead Versamune-based candidate, PDS0101, an investigational immunotherapy designed to treat human papilloma virus or HPV16 associated cancers. As a reminder, our Versamune technology platform promotes the delivery of tumor associated proteins, also called antigens to the immune system and simultaneously activates the immune system to induce antigen-specific killer T cells. PDS0101 combines Versamune with HPV16 antigens, and therefore promotes the induction of CDA positive killer T cells that target and kill tumors that are HPV16 positive. This combination of Versamune with cytokines leads to the reduction in the population of immune suppressive cells, such as myeloid derived suppressor cells, also called MDSC. In the three most progressed studies, we are evaluating PDS0101 as a combination treatment with various anti-cancer agents in advanced and refractory cancers. In the fourth trial, investigators at Mayo Clinic are leading a study to evaluate PDS0101 as a monotherapy or in combination with KEYTRUDA in early stage oral cancer. As we look ahead, our key priority is to advance PDS0101 as rapidly as possible to commercialization. To date, we have reported efficacy and/or safety data from 80 patients in two trials. These results have also been accurately predicted by our preclinical studies, which is highly encouraging. Importantly, we presented very encouraging data in June at ASCO from two of our ongoing Phase 2 clinical trials. As I mentioned earlier, this combination of Versamune, the checkpoint inhibitor and IL-12 may enable us to treat a broader population of refractory and very difficult to treat patients. In addition to the data presentations, we also have some exciting news announcements related to the VERSATILE trial during the quarter. As we announced in May, we received notification of the acceptance of the clinical trial application, or CTA, to allow expansion of the VERSATILE study into the UK. Due to the time taken to prepare international sites for trial, we believe that this approach of getting the various regulatory agencies familiar with our product could facilitate rapid transition to an efficiently enrolling pivotal trial to accelerate the development. Also during the quarter, based on the results so far from the VERSATILE-002 trial, we were granted fast track designation by the FDA for PDS0101 in combination with pembrolizumab for the treatment of HPV16 positive head and neck cancers. As you know, the FDA's fast track designation program is designed to aid in the development and to expedite the review of drug candidates that could potentially treat serious or life threatening conditions and that demonstrate the potential to address an unmet medical need. Lastly, on VERSATILE-002, our independent safety data monitoring committee, or Democrats, met for its scheduled review of the administration of PDS0101 in combination with KEYTRUDA. Specifically, as of the DMC review, there were no drug discontinuations related to toxicity and no grade three or higher treatment related adverse events attributed to the combination. The safety profile of PDS0101 plus KEYTRUDA continues to hold up, and we continue to believe that the Versamune based immunotherapies may enable not only more effective cancer therapies, but also safer and better tolerated therapies. Our third PDS0101 trial is the ongoing MD Anderson led Phase 2 IMMUNOCERV study which is evaluating PDS0101 in combination with standard of care chemoradiotherapy, or CRT, in patients with locally advanced cervical cancer, who have either lymph node metastasis or tumors of size greater than 5 centimeters. This study is evaluating clinical responses, as well as immunological biomarkers, both in the tumor environment and in the blood circulation to better understand how PDS0101 may be working immunologically and how it may improve standard of care. In this trial so far, promising clinical results, as well as immunological data have been generated. We continue to believe that it is in the best interest of all shareholders for our data to be scrutinized, peer reviewed and presented to a larger audience of investors, potential partners and key experts in the field. We project, based on current results, that the dual combination will focus on checkpoint inhibitor na\u00c3\u00afve patients and the triple combination will address checkpoint inhibitor refractory indications due to a greater breadth of anti-immune suppressive activity. Our goal is to prioritize commercialization of PDS0101 and this could, therefore, cause us to adjust the timelines for initiation of the PDS0102 and PDS0103 clinical studies. Similar to our Versamune oncology pipeline, we continue to leverage strategic collaborations to advance our Infectimune infectious disease programs with minimal capital outlay. Last month, our collaborator, Dr. Ted Ross and his team, presented preclinical data on the universal flu vaccine at the 41st American Society of Virology Meeting. Based on these promising results, we continue to work with the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, also known as NIAID, to advocate for advancing PDS0202 into the clinic. As part of this process last month, Dr. Ted Ross and Professor Jerry Woodward, PDS Biotech's collaborator, at the University of Kentucky School of Medicine, presented the preclinical universal flu efficacy data to the larger NIAID group. Last week, PDS presented the Infectimune clinical manufacturing in-human safety data to NIAID program staff. I'll turn the call over to Lauren, who will discuss these data in detail. As Frank just mentioned, we recently presented encouraging preclinical data from our influenza vaccine program in a poster at the American Society of Virology Meeting. In this study, it was found overall that PDS0202 neutralized multiple strains of influenza and provided full protection against lethal infection in animals. The PDS0202 universal flu vaccine contains the Infectimune nanoparticles formulated with computationally optimized broadly reactive antigens, or COBRA, influenza antigens developed by the laboratory of renowned influence expert Dr. Ted Ross. Importantly, no detectable virus was found in lungs from animals vaccinated with PDS0202. Currently, there is no universal flu vaccine that provides broad protection against multiple strains of influenza. According to the World Health Organization, the flu is estimated to result in about 3 million to 5 million cases of severe illness and up to 650,000 deaths each year. Here, we summarize the data presented from our VERSATILE-002 Phase 2 clinical trial providing an update on the first arm of the trial, which is being conducted in checkpoint inhibitor na\u00c3\u00afve patients. The goal of the VERSATILE-002 study is to double the objective response rate, or ORR, over vaccine with KEYTRUDA monotherapy, reported to be about 17% in the KEYNOTE-048 study. Keeping that in mind, let's get into the data presented at ASCO. Additionally, two of the seven patients had no evidence of disease or complete response. 89% of patients treated were alive at a median of nine months, suggesting a survival benefit with PDS0101 as administered with KEYTRUDA. Clinical benefit, which is the percentage of patients who have stable disease, plus those who have experienced objective responses, was 76.5%. At the time of the data cut off, patients had received a median of 4 out of 5 doses of PDS0101 and 9 out of 35 doses of KEYTRUDA. On the safety side, there were no treatment-related adverse events greater than or equal to grade three in the 19 patients and no patients discontinued treatment as a result of toxicity. This compares favorably to KEYTRUDA monotherapy, where grade three or greater treatment related adverse events were reported in 17% of patients. As Frank mentioned, we'll be discussing these data further with the FDA soon to determine a path forward to potentially begin our registrational phase of development. As a reminder, this is the NCI-led triple combination study evaluating PDS0101 in combination with two investigational immune-modulating agents, owned by Merck KGaA, Bintrafusp alfa and M9241, which is also known as NHS IL-12. The triple combination is being studied in patients with extremely difficult to treat HPV positive, advanced, relapsed and refractory cancers. Historically, objective response rates in checkpoint inhibitor refractory patients have generally been less than 10%. Ultimately, most patients treated with checkpoint inhibitor therapy will continue to progress and become checkpoint inhibitor refractory. As Frank mentioned, the proprietary combination of Versamune and NHS IL-12 is expected to expose a greater population of tumors to the immune system and can be achieved with checkpoint inhibitors alone. This may allow PDS0101 induced killer T cells to kill a greater number of HPV16 positive cancer cells, resulting in better clinical outcomes. As I mentioned, these terminally ill patients historically would have been expected to live generally for a median of only three to four months. 75% of checkpoint inhibitor na\u00c3\u00afve patients were alive at a median follow-up of 17 months, again suggesting promising durability of the immune response. 43% of patients experienced grade three treatment-related adverse events, with 7% experiencing grade 4 events. Importantly, similar responses occurred across the entire range of HPV16 positive cancers, including anal, cervical. These results, combined with the previously reported data from this trial, showing that tumor shrinkage only occurred in HPV16 positive subjects, suggests the potency of PDS0101 across both trials. We continue to manage our cash carefully and have been fiscally prudent with our clinical strategy, leveraging partners to allocate costs to cover the investigation of a wide range of HPV16 associated cancers. For the second quarter ended June 30, 2022, research and development expenses increased to $3.8 million for the three months ended June 30, 2022 and $2.8 million for the three months ended June 30, 2021. The increase of $1 million was primarily attributable to an increase of $0.4 million in clinical study and research and development costs, $0.7 million in personnel costs, $0.1 million in facilities, and this was partially offset by a decrease of $0.2 million in manufacturing services. General and administrative expenses increased to $3.3 million for the three months ended June 30, 2022, up from $2.3 million for the three months ended June 30, 2021. We finished the quarter with nearly $53 million in cash, a strong position as a result of our partnering model and continuous financial discipline, which we expect will fund our operations into 2024. In May, we welcomed Sanjay Zaveri as Senior Vice President, Business Development to lead our business strategy and manage the company's potential licensing and partnering opportunities in support of our pipeline. And we anticipate that getting the EU sites, getting those regulators familiar with our products and our data to date, even if we have to transition into a pivotal trial, will be very beneficial in getting those trials running outside the United States. As you may be aware, sometimes it takes several months and even sometimes close to a year to get some of those ex-US sites up and running. And so, getting those activities going sooner than later, we believe, could potentially be very important in allowing us to efficiently enroll in the trial and get the trial executed efficiently. I think there has been some data announced recently showing that the seasonal flu vaccine result is comparable to what's seen with the current flu vaccine, Fluzone, for example. And so, the way we see it is that with a successful universal flu vaccine, the current approach of trying to understand what strain of flu is going to be prevalent in a particular year and rapidly trying to generate a vaccine for that particular strain of the flu more or less becomes obsolete because you have a universal flu vaccine that is effective against multiple strains of the flu. And that's the ultimate goal of an effective universal flu vaccine, a vaccine that is going to be effective against several strains. And that's the approach, the computational approach that Professor Ted Ross has taken has been to evaluate multiple strains of the flu over the last couple of decades and to try to incorporate the immunogenic regions of those particular flu strains into these COBRA proteins. And I think with a physician feedback, I will hand over to Lauren, and Lauren can give us an update on what the physician feedback has been today. The feedback at ASCO 2022 regarding the VERSATILE-002 poster, as well as the NCI triple combination poster was significant. The feedback from physicians on VERSATILE-002 was not only the objective response rate of 41%, which is historically greater than a doubling of the 17% objective response rate seen with KEYNOTE-048. The second focus of the comments that we got was the tolerability of the regimen and specifically that there were no greater than or equal to grade 3 treatment-related adverse events, and that there were no discontinuations of drug therapy associated with the combination regimen. Regarding the triple combination, everyone was very, very impressed and there was a lot of commentary on the survival data, not only in the CPI na\u00c3\u00afve patients where the follow up was more extended, 17 months of follow up, but the fact that even in CPR refractory subjects that had received the triple combination, whether it was low dose or high dose, that the survival was approximately 77%. So, it was really about survival associated with the triple combination, as well as the differentiating tolerability of the dual combination profile in the VERSATILE-002 study. I think the more data we continue to generate, the stronger and stronger the PDS story becomes, and the more compelling the data also becomes. And I think also, with the large pharma companies, as you know, partnering is one of our strategies, but I think they will make their internal decisions as to what is critical or important for them in their partnering strategy. But I think at PDS, we continue to progress our data generation. So, I think we are looking at a broad business development strategy. We believe the data that has been generated to date \u00e2\u0080\u0093 as I mentioned, we have data already from 80 patients across both trials. So, yes, Jim, it is an important piece of our business strategy, and that's something that we're focused on. And so, by the end of this quarter, we should have strong feedback from the FDA in terms of whether or not we can move that trial forward into a pivotal. If we do get the green light to do so, we anticipate that the trial could be started sometime in the first half of next year. With the universal flu vaccine, I think as I mentioned during the earlier part of the call, we are working with the NIAID. And he's working with the NIAID to also present to them the data, the opportunity and so forth. And so, my anticipation is that I would say the earliest it could potentially go into human clinical trials will be sometime next year if everything works out and this program is green lighted and funded by the NIAID, but we will updated on that progress. Frank, in the VERSATILE-002 data you presented at ASCO, there was an analysis based on the CPS, the complete positive score. For everyone on the call, just to reinforce, the entry criteria for all study subjects on VERSATILE-002 is that the composite score, the CPS score, measuring PD-L1 in the patient's tumor tissue, they must have a CPS score greater than or equal to 1. In doing the PD-L1 characterization, we also look to see whether or not individuals have composite scores that are greater than 1, specifically greater than 20%. Frank, I just want to ask how those data may change or add to your plans in 2023 and beyond with respect to continued development of the candidate in cancer. So, just want to ask how you may look to deploy resources alongside the KEYTRUDA combo and head and neck as pending the IMMUNOCERV data set. The early data that's been generated by MD Anderson is also very compelling, but it's still it's still early. So, I think we would like to see what the data looks like, the full data package, when it's available. If we see some compelling improvement over the standard of care and, as we see with VERSATILE-002, no compounding of the toxicity, I think that would be, again, very compelling. But that's a little bit behind those studies, and very interesting data to date. I think with the universal flu vaccine, one of the things we want to do currently, looking at the infectious diseases versus oncology, is to really focus our resources on the oncology and move those programs towards commercialization as rapidly as possible and to be overall financially efficient. And the approach that has typically been taken has been to put together probably viruses, two or three different strains of the flu together into a single vaccine with the hopes of generating antibodies against those specific strains of the flu that have been incorporated into that particular vaccine. What's been done differently here is the antigen approach in terms of that computational design where a much broader number of strains have been taken into consideration over the last several decades in terms of, okay, what strains of flu have we seen over this last decade, how have they changed over the years, what are the consistent regions of those strains that can be modeled into a specific antigen. Now, when that is done, when you give that vaccine, even without Infectimune, you can see that you get some immune responses, but they are not as broadly protective as when you combine those novel COBRA antigens with Infectimune. The beauty of Infectimune is its ability to do what is necessary to generate a powerful immune response, which is presentation of the antigens into the right processing presentation pathways, as well as activating that critical immunological signaling pathway. When you put those two together, we've seen for the first time broadly neutralizing highly potent flu antibodies, as well as, very importantly, T cells. I think one of the things that we will do is our business development activities will not just focus on oncology only, will very much look at opportunities, infectious diseases too. However, we believe that having some early human clinical data confirming the breadth of immune response in humans, as well as confirming the safety will be very significant in allowing us to bring on additional partners in the infectious disease space too, just like we've done with oncology, generated that early human data, generated significant data to date, really showing, demonstrating very compelling results. But those are key goals for PDS and those are key things that we're working on to hopefully get it into clinic, generate that data, while also potentially talking to prospective and potential partners. But in terms of the trials, I think that one of the key things we want to do is to have that discussion with the FDA, have them understand what we're thinking and also get some feedback on what they would like to see in that trial. We're also preparing, just in case, we would want to move them forward on our own independently. Currently, what we would want to do would be to \u00e2\u0080\u0093 we have, between now and when we get those trials going, to really understand what the partnering opportunities are and will be and look at what those opportunities are and hopefully make the best decision as we typically would strive to do for the company and the company's shareholders. We estimate that a pivotal trial looking at the VERSATILE-002 combination, which would involve PDS0101 plus KEYTRUDA versus KEYTRUDA monotherapy in the exact same population that we are currently studying VERSATILE-002 would require approximately 250 to 270 subjects. As Frank had mentioned, the concurrence with the FDA and advice from the FDA regarding the strategy and the pivotal trial design is going to be critical. And we will hear about that before the end of this quarter, with the hopes that we would start the study in the first half of 2023. The other issue is that, as Frank also mentioned during the call, our expansion into Europe, we believe, is laying the groundwork to not only introduce VERSATILE-002 ex-US, but also set up that infrastructure for our global study. To date, PDS0101 has been administered to over 100 patients in the ongoing PD-L1 trials and we have provided data from 80 patients in both the KEYTRUDA combination and the National Cancer Institute led triple combination. The fact that recruitment is progressing well and that both the safety and efficacy continue to appear to be strong is extremely encouraging, and we believe provides validation and proof of concept."
