    "content": " On a GAAP basis, gross margin was 61.1%, GAAP operating expenses were $133 million for the fourth quarter, GAAP operating margin was 9% for the fourth quarter and 12% for the full year, GAAP earnings per share were $0.76 in the fourth quarter and $2.54 for the full year. Please go ahead with your question. We gained some large customers but we also gained a lot of customers in the tail, in the mid of the market which gave us some strength in our ASPs, and then the product cycle piece is with our Series 2, as we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve mentioned multiple times, we have an unprecedented amount of products coming out in \u00e2\u0080\u009922 as well as \u00e2\u0080\u009923, which gives us a lot for our sales team to work with and in a lot of cases, there is no alternative to these leading products in the marketplace, so that helps give some strength to the ASPs as well. Please go ahead with your question. Please go ahead with your question. The confluence of all these things coming together really creates a strong position that is, simply said, fueling the revenue growth we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen over the last couple of years, which is, I think, a strong testament to the strength of that portfolio, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also fueling that design win momentum that I mentioned in my earlier remarks, where that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s grown over 120% over the last two years, which is remarkable. Please go ahead with your question. As we said in the remarks, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve actually seen our relationships with our customers and suppliers improve over the last couple years through all this challenge, and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s allowed us to position ourselves to continue scaling very quickly in the coming years, which is a key component to a lot of these wins. Please go ahead with your question."
