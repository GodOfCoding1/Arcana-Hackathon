    "content": " I'm pleased to report that strong revenue performance for the second quarter set a new record, at $263 million, up 55% year-on-year and above the top-end of our guidance range. The home and life business was also up strong for the quarter to $119 million, an increase of 49% year-on-year, with particular strength in connected home applications. Non-GAAP operating expenses were slightly elevated, ending at $110 million, due to additional product development costs, higher variable costs on upside business performance, and increased travel as we resumed more normalized travel patterns in Q2 coming out of the pandemic. On the pricing piece, we took a little bit different approach than some others, and we did a increase one time that   our customers, we're trying to not nibbling it to that death on this; we're trying to reflect what we think is going to happen over the course of the year based on what we're being communicated by our suppliers as well as  , and that's worked pretty well. However, if I simply extrapolate out your $113 million non-GAAP OpEx guide that you're putting out there for the third quarter, it looks like you might be a little below that long-term 20% margin target; maybe, call it, high-teens percent."
