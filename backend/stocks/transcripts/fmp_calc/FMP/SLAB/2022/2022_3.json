    "content": " Revenue for the third quarter grew 46% year-on-year, ending at $270 million, in line with expectations and well above our target model growth rate. Our depth and domain expertise is driving leading wireless performance, battery life, security and ease of use in the adoption of our products and 100% focused and commitment on driving phenomenal growth in IoT wireless connectivity has enabled us to double our revenue over the last couple of years in the middle of the supply chain crisis. Please go ahead with your question. Please go ahead with your question. Please go ahead with your question. Please go ahead with your question. And so when we're thinking about going into the first half of 2023, if there's kind of continued softness in the consumer market, if this is mainly driven due to order pushouts -- I mean trying to match the demand-supply. Please go ahead with your question. So we fully recognize the uncertainty that's out there right now in the semiconductor space and the overall economy, but we do believe that whatever this ends up being, because of those share gains and that strong product cycle, we're going to gain share and outperform just like we have when things were strong, when things are uncertain, we think we're going to outperform there as well."
