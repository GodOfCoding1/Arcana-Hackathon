    "content": " Our Industrial & Commercial business delivered revenue of $127 million in Q1, growing 61% year-on-year, with strength across the diverse end markets of commercial infrastructure, smart city applications and in particular, industrial applications where we saw the strongest top line performance. I will say, we\u2019re quite encouraged by the strength we continue to see in the business with design win momentum up nearly 80% year-on-year for the first quarter and continue to enable more supply. At the same time, our design wins are accelerating even faster than our revenue, which is really important to us because that\u2019s one of the stronger leading indicators we have of future demand moving forward. And so I just wanted to get a sense in terms of the capacity conditions and those dynamics throughout this year and kind of how you\u2019re thinking about it next year because, as you know, there\u2019s a strong investor concern about over capital \u2013 an oversupply industry leading to kind of a disconnect between demand if demand accelerates and more supply comes online. So we see a path that we like going into the second half of this year and into 2023, I think, which is very important because that\u2019s also a major component when we\u2019re working with our customers on design wins that we can give them that visibility and ability to support those new designs as they come online. But I mentioned earlier the Series 2 platform and xG24, it\u2019s worth calling that out that that\u2019s just indicative of why we see this longer-term demand that we know the end market is growing strongly. As I said earlier, when you think about the demand environment we\u2019re seeing, that\u2019s really only based on historical solutions in the first two or three products coming off the Series 2 platform."
