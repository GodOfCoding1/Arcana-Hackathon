    "content": " Our industrial division generated revenue of $6 million and $12.9 million in the second quarter and year-to-date, respectively, and has a contracted backlog of approximately $105.8 million expected to be completed within 12 to 18 months. Now that we have secured a massive pipeline and a growing backlog with years of projects ahead of us, our focus will be on embracing a culture of constant improvement and maximizing efficiencies by leveraging our digital sales and marketing to expand our brand recognition to new markets, by decreasing sales to inflation timelines to provide world class service to all of our customers, by increasing efficiencies in all of our shared services throughout the organization, and by increasing collaboration and operations to drive down the project costs. And I think in the future, as we as we look forward, I think that there'll be additional savings available there as well in shared purchasing powers, certainly if you're buying panels or equipment for a community solar asset that might be 5 megawatts or less, your buying power is quite different than what you would see somewhere else on larger projects. And just to be clear on that point, what I was referring to was the line in the press release that said, our utility division also has a 993 megawatts of projects currently under development projects, achieving NTP \u00e2\u0080\u0093 so that's where we're \u00e2\u0080\u0093 I just want to identify that's the area we're talking about where you will eventually have ownership."
