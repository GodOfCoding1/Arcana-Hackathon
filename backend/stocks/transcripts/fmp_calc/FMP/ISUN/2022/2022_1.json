    "content": " Our customer demand continues to accelerate, evidenced by the growth of our overall backlog totaling 128.3 million with new demand of 41.2 million generated in the quarter. Our residential division has seen a tremendous increase in demand in Q1 with a 37% increase in customer orders from December 31, 2021. Our commercial and industrial divisions have seen an increase in demand in Q1 with a 23% increase in backlog from December 31, 2021. Currently, we have 120 megawatts of projects in development that we will retain the installation services of our commercial and industrial divisions, and 550 megawatts of projects in development that we will retain the installation services of for our utility division. While we continue to execute against our existing backlog, we also generated new demand and added 41.2 million in new business during Q1. And finally, I found the backlog growth of 41.2 million based on new demand simultaneous to the 40 million drop in annual guidance a little confusing, and I'd appreciate a little bit of expansion here."
