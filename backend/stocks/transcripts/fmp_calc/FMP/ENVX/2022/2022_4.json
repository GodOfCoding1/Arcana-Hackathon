    "content": " We explained last time, the way we work with our customers is to get them samples of our batteries, which then they test and then they you know put them in products that they're actually going to launch and move them along the product creation cycle. And I'll be transparent about our progress on unit production, important milestones, things like yields, and also what we what we're doing to derisk, our Gen-2 line, which actually is going to produce high volume batteries. Now for everyone that runs financial models, I would like to give a couple of pointers for the models, one is we are anticipating here to increase cash and non-cash expenses that we are recognizing cost of goods Sold versus operating expenses, primarily as we shift the resources from R&D into manufacturing The shift of higher cost of revenue will take shape in Q1, and you can see here and expect around $4 million of sequential increase in cost of revenue, whereas only $2 million decrease in operating expenses, both on a non-GAAP basis. And those cell milestones are showing that we increased sort of our active designs and design wins by about $200 million in this last quarter, which is by far the biggest jump and really shows that these customers are now fully engaged, because they've taken essentially the batteries off of our production line, and have done their own full qualification. We've done a lot of proof of concept, experiments to make sure that whatever issues we saw on Gen-1 are actually resolved in Gen-2 so we know what we're going to get is going to be at the high throughput. And the learning from that will actually make sure that the Gen-2 we build will be at much, much higher yield right off the back, which is really the number that matters because that's where we really going to ramp majority of our production."
