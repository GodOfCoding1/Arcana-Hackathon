In the first quarter, we made significant progress to reduce net debt. In particular, exercise of our warrants contributed a reduction of net debt exceeding $120 million and a commensurate increase in equity, recognizing our improved near-term debt maturity profile, as well as the completion of our new revolving credit facility in February, one of the major debt rating agencies raised its issue-level ratings across our notes. Revenue from operations for the first quarter was $569 million, a 5% sequential improvement, more than offsetting a 2% reduction in available days - fourth quarter. As our fleet reprices to market, we expect this favorable rate trend to India  For the second quarter, we project our Lower 48 average daily margin to continue expanding and reach approximately $8,500 per day.
