    "content": " U.S. Drilling revenue increased by 17% to $287 million, Lower 48 revenue grew by more than 19%, reflecting higher rig count and an increase in daily revenue of over $3,600 or 14%. For the fourth quarter, we project Lower 48 margin between $13,400 and $13,600 per day, as we continue to roll our rigs onto contracts with higher pricing, we anticipate an increase of four to five rigs in the fourth quarter. NDS gross margin per day for the Lower 48 increased to $2,429 in the third quarter, yielding a combined drilling rig and solutions gross margin of $13,600 per day. Yes, the other issue here is to bear in mind that the international market in some ways is about five years behind the U.S. market and existing rigs even, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s opportunities with existing rigs for increased profitability by encouraging operators to think about upgrading them because if they move to related technology, we think it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s good cost benefit return for them. What I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll say is the following that the rates there combined with the new builds, combined with what I just mentioned in terms of activity, if you put that all through the process, at the end of the day, we think when you look at margin and internationally, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re on a path of $16,000 to $17,000 all in the world."
