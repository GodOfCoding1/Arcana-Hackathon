    "content": " Despite persistent supply chain and COVID challenges, we increased revenue by 10% over last year's first quarter and by almost 12% compared to the fourth quarter. As expected, we saw a significantly higher cost in the first quarter compared to last year, driven by inflationary pressures and supply chain challenges, but I would point out that these costs were largely in line with fourth quarter levels. Mobile Industries' adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter was $79 million or 14.7% of sales, compared to $80 million or 15.9% of sales last year. And then, also as we talked about either the last call or the one before that, we spend a little bit of time on some larger possibilities, and I would say we're back to 100% focused on cultivating and getting active, the small to mid-size that you've seen us do, say, Spinea size up the 2 to 3 times that size. Just given the fourth quarter, you would think - should provide a relatively easy year-over-year comp, but it looks like you're implying the rest of the year, the margins are only flat year-over-year. So, as I said I think what we would be planning for in this or assuming in this guide is probably a similar progression from this point through the end of the year what we saw last year, which is prices modestly going up quarter-to-quarter for the rest of the year. But, again, it's a market that go back five or six years ago would have been sub-1% of the company, because we weren't in automatic lubrication systems in these other markets."
