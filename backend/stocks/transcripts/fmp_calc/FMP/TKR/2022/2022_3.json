    "content": " Well, I would tell you, what we've seen in the last two quarters, is that number has gone up and material logistics gone down and we're seeing pretty broad-based inflation across the manufacturing space of everything else that we over our other input costs beyond steel and logistics, where it's a lubricant or grinding wheel or a pallet. And would you mind giving us a sense how large the backlog is right now, like I mean essentially the genesis of the questions here, I mean if you can really do 10% in the fourth quarter, and it's not just chewing through backlog, it obviously suggests at least as of now, unless you get cancellations, the first part of '23 also starts with pretty healthy organic. Yes, and the other comment I might make, David, too is on the fourth quarter is, we did -- the guidance does imply a pretty normal sequential step down in revenue, you know, call it, sort of the mid-single digit range, which is pretty normal, which kind of says some of that healthy growth obviously had to do with the comp from last year as well."
