    "content": " I'm delighted to report that revenues and profitability were at a new record for the third quarter, since the company's rebirth in 2013, building comprehensively on the momentum of our record performance in preceding quarters News Corp delivered $2.5 billion of revenues up 7%, despite the vicissitudes of currency volatility. Over the past two years, third quarter revenues of the Digital Real Estate Services segment have increased by 59%, which gives a measure of both the growth and the opportunity. Fiscal 2022 third quarter total revenues were approximately $2.5 billion, up 7% reflecting strong growth across our core pillars led by digital real estate services and Dow Jones, which includes benefits from our recent acquisitions and our continuing shift to digital across the company. News revenues were $170 million similar to last quarter and up 5% year-over-year, this followed 37% revenue growth in the prior year and is now approximately 44% higher than pre-pandemic levels in the third quarter of fiscal 2020. REA had another very strong quarter with revenues rising 30% year-on-year on a reported basis to $246 million, which includes a $38 million contribution from the Mortgage Choice acquisition. Turning to the Subscription Video Services segment, revenues for the quarter were $494 million, relatively stable from the second quarter and down approximately 6% compared to the prior year on a reported basis due to foreign currency headwinds. Segment EBITDA in the quarter of $79 million was down 13% versus the prior year, driven by higher programming costs, partly due to increased availability of entertainment content as well as modestly high marketing investment in streaming. Dow Jones continued its strong performance in the quarter with revenues of $487 million, up 16% compared to the prior year with digital revenues accounting for 76% of total revenues this quarter, up two percentage points from last year. Advertising revenues, which accounted for 21% of revenues this quarter, remained very strong, growing 20% to a $102 million, despite difficult prior year comparisons. Turning to News Media, the momentum in this segment continued during the quarter revenues were $580 million up 5% versus the prior year, which included $25 million or approximately five percentage points of negative impact due to currency headwinds.
