    "content": " We had 22% revenue from our loan recommendation services, 47% of revenue from credit card recommendation services, 10% from data driven and system-bases risk management services, and 21% from our advertising, marketing and other services versus 19%, 54%, 18% and 9% in the corresponding quarter of 2021, and 21%, 51%, 16% and 12% in full year 2021. That\u2019s why around two years ago, we launched our social media and partnership program into the ecommerce sector, and this brings us diversified revenue streams on top of credit card recommendation, loan recommendation, insurance-related recommendation, and data and risk management services as well as advertising and marketing and digital related revenues from ecommerce. We believe the digital transformation trends for the financial service sector as well as other sectors and industries will continue for years to come, so we believe our investment in the last few quarters will put us in a much better position in terms of growth of revenue streams, in terms of more diversified revenue, and in terms of more efficiency and improved unit economics and also help us to achieve better economic scale going forward."
