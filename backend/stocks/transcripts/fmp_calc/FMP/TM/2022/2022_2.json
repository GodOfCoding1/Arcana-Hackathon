    "content": " Consolidated financial results for the first half of this fiscal year were sales revenues of JPY 15,481.2 billion, operating income of JPY 1,747.4 billion, income before income taxes of JPY 2,144.0 billion and net income of JPY 1,524.4 billion. Based on this, our forecasts for full year consolidated financial performance are: sales revenues of JPY 30 trillion, operating income of JPY 2,800 billion, income before income taxes of JPY 3,440 billion and net income of JPY 2,490 billion. The operating income forecast has been revised upward by JPY 300 billion from the previous forecast, taking into account the increase in operating income due to the revision of FX assumptions, reflecting the weaker yen and the decrease in operating income due to the increase in raw material costs. And also about the downward revision that we are interpreting the forecast in a very tough perspective, to explain that, for the first half results, for example, compared with last year and 2 years ago, we do understand that it is a large increase in operating income."
