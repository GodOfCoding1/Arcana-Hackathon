    "content": " This investment is expected across the country with Texas and California, two focus areas for MYR Group forecast to see the most near-term spending Texas's forecasted spend is driven primarily by capacity issues stemming from the integration of clean energy sources, while California is driven by clean energy integration and fire mitigation. And it's very difficult too at this time because a big percentage of the work bit Tod does every day on our T&D side it has to do with that clean energy side coming into play, and the utilities really don't release what lines we're working on that just have to do with pure clean energy."
