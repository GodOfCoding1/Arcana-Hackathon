    "content": " Excluding purchase accounting accretion and PPP related income, our adjusted net interest margin increased 36 basis points to 3.01% from the prior quarter driven by a favorable shift in our mix and increased yields on our earning assets, while our cost of funds was unchanged at 10 basis points. When compared with last quarter's outlook, given the incremental interest rate and market driven headwinds on mortgage, wealth management, and swap fee income, we have made a slight reduction to the run rate for non-interest income that we expect by the fourth quarter of 2022, adjusting the run rate to be approximately $50 million, down from the prior range of $52 million to $54 million. Exclusive of acquisition-related expenses, our non-interest expense increased $22.5 million from the prior quarter, which was primarily attributable to the additional one month of Great Western's operations and consistent with what we told you to expect last quarter. Our loans held for investment increased $262 million, excluding PPP loans from the end of the prior quarter with growth in all of our major portfolios with the exception of ag. At the end of the quarter, the duration of the investment portfolio was 3.9 years - or 3.8 years when you include the impact of our remaining $200 million interest rate hedge. The strong performance of our loan portfolio is also reflected in the very low level of net charge-offs, which were just $300,000 or one basis point of average loans in the quarter. Again, we continue to have 26% of our loans that are going to reprice immediately part of our investment portfolio even if we do a little bit of - have a little bit higher cost of funds, we should see core net interest margin expansion next quarter."
