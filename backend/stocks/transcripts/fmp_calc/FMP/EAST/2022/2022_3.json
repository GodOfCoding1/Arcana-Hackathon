After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today to discuss Eastside Distilling\u00e2\u0080\u0099s financial results for the third quarter 2022. Joining us on today's call to discuss these results are Mr. Geoffrey Gwin, the company's Interim Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer; Ms. Tiffany Milton, Eastside's Controller, and Mr. Bruce Wells, Craft Controller. For this quarter's call, the company is also providing a presentation or slide deck that is available to all interested parties via Eastside Distilling\u00e2\u0080\u0099s website. We encourage you to access this presentation and follow along by visiting www.eastsidedistilling.com, clicking on the Investor page and then selecting Events and Presentations on the left hand navigation panel. From there, you'll be able to download and view today's presentation. The reliability of forward-looking statements is subject to risks and uncertainties, and you should not rely upon forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. You can identify forward-looking statements by words such as anticipate, believe, could, project, or the negative of those words or other similar terms that express our expectations for the future. We may not actually achieve the expectations expressed in forward-looking statements, and so you should not place undue reliance on them. Some of the key factors that could cause actual results to differ, the expectations expressed in our forward-looking statements are set forth in the section of our most recently filed annual report on Form 10-K titled Risk Factors, and you should refer to that text for detailed information about those risks. This presentation and the oral presentation that will accompany include references to adjusted EBITDA, which is a supplemental measure of financial performance, not required by or presented in accordance with GAAP. We define adjusted EBITDA as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization adjusted to exclude the impact of certain non-cash and other items that we do not consider relevant to our evaluation of ongoing operating performance. These excluded items may include professional fees, equity-based compensation expense, write-offs on property and equipment, deferred rent, financing expenses, and certain other charges and gains that we do not believe reflect our underlying business performance. However, this non-GAAP measure should not be considered as a substitute for the most directly comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP such as net income or net loss or net income per share or net loss per share as a measure of financial performance, cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity or any other performance measure calculated in accordance with GAAP. Before I turn it over, I would like to just mention a reminder in case anyone is just joined the call that we do have a presentation deck to go along with today's earnings call. You can access that by visiting the company website, www.eastsidedistilling.com, then clicking on the Investor page and select Events and Presentations on the left hand navigation panel. Now with that said, I would like to turn the call over to Geoffrey Gwin. Thank you, Heather, and let me also add my welcome to our third quarter earnings call. This quarter, we included a few slides to help illustrate the progress we are making. As Heather said, you can find these slides on Eastside's website on the Investors page. When you look at the performance of the company on a consolidated basis, or for that matter, both Craft and Spirits individually. We are still reporting a substantial operating loss on a consolidated basis, but there is a great deal of improvements in both businesses that I will talk about today. On prior calls, I have talked about the importance of digital can printing and I would be happy to answer more questions on it in the Q&A here in a minute, but suffice it to say, we are seeing strong demand for this new service. What we've seen at Craft has validated our decision to move in this new direction, more on that in a moment. The other business we operate is our premium Craft Spirits business, here on the right. In that business, we have been navigating a reset to position the business to survive and grow in a very exciting growth category. In the past year, we have repositioned the business and focused it on core markets and core brands. We have exited unprofitable channels, improved distribution, and rebuilt our sales team. Now turning to Slide 4, we have opportunistically taken advantage of high wholesale whiskey values throughout the year. However, taking those sales out, you can see sequential improvement in the pro forma sales at the bottom of this slide. Now, I believe as we do this, we can achieve strong gross margins, probably higher than we've achieved in the past. Turning to Slide 5, clearly the highlight of the quarter was the performance at Craft, sales continued to improve both sequentially and year-over-year, as we have walked away from selling blank cans through our mobile business. And we now sell digitally printed cans to a much larger group of customers, including legacy mobile customers. To see this development, take a look at Slide 6 and let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s talk about the digital can printing ramp up. Craft launched its digital can printing operation in Q2 and on the left of this chart, you can see the increase in total cans printed year-to-date, and we believe that number on the left can go well beyond 20 million in a single year. To the right, you can see utilization as we ramp up printing. This is a series of process and operational improvements, hiring more staff, working around bottlenecks and supply chain improvements. And as we do this, margins improve as well as cash flow, and I believe this will be a very profitable business. In the past, Craft was focused on a smaller subset of Craft beer customers. This area is full of hundreds of small innovative new customers that not only need great cans and great packaging, but also help filling them. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve used digital printing to launch us into that space and during the quarter we began operations at Galactic Unicorn Packaging, our first fixed site co-packing plan. Building the Spirits brand that is true value doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t happen with a deal to open, let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s say a thousand doors, and it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t happen once you sign a celebrity endorsement. Azu\u00c3\u00b1ia, a super premium single estate tequila, the Pacific Northwest best small batch premium whiskey aged in Oregon Oak, Burnside, and Portland\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own vodka PPV. Case volumes in 2021 at this point in the year were 27,912 cases and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve walked away from some unprofitable cases, business pulled out some one-time sales, the impact of out of stocks and destocking and some distributor issues and we believe our underlying performance is a negative 5% year-over-year decline, which is more in line with retail depletion trends. We are not satisfied with negative case sales, but we believe we have cycled most of the unprofitable accounts and we are now rebuilding much more profitable sales. Now turning to Slide 10, let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s talk about Spirit a little bit more. So we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve made some significant improvements and some of these improvements are in the distribution and supply chain and these things take a while, but we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve taken price increases and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve invested in savings initiatives. And most recently we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve rebuilt our Oregon sales and marketing team, and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a lot for one business in a year. But I want you to know that we expect improvements in Q4 in Spirits, and we definitely think these improvements in these initiatives that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve undertaken will become much more obvious as we move into next year. Now, the last slide of our slide deck, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m going to leave for Tiffany who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also going to take us through the financials for the quarters. In addition to Tiffany today, I have both Amy Lancer and Bruce Wells with me from Spirits and Craft respectfully, and they can help answer any questions you have. Before we review the third quarter, let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s look at Slide 11. We have raised $8.2 million through October 2022, allowing us to repay almost $6 million of outstanding debt through the same period. During October 2022, we closed on a new facility on favorable terms by eliminating restrictive covenants. On a consolidated basis, our growth sales were over $3 million for the third quarter of 2022, compared to $3.3 million for the third quarter of 2021. Spirit sales were $1.2 million for 2022 compared to $1.5 million for 2021 due to volume softness in Azu\u00c3\u00b1ia as we reduced discounting, we had a price increase and two large one-time inventory purchases in 2021. Craft sales were $1.9 million for 2022 and $1.8 million for 2021, reflecting our success in can printing, but offset by mobile canning. Our consolidated gross profit was $200,000 for Q3 2022 compared to $900,000 for Q3 2021. Spirits margins were 29% for 2022 and 36% for 2021, and Craft had margins of negative 7% for 2022 and 19% for 2021. Craft margins did improve from last quarter, however, were still down from Q3 2021. Adjusted EBITDA was negative $1.1 million for 2022 and negative $600,000 for 2021 due to the weakness in both businesses. We raised a net $500,000 during the third quarter of 2022, ending with cash of $400,000 as we continue to pay down debt, which we fully repaid a $500,000 loan at Craft. As Geoffrey said, we are also expecting better results from the hard work of restructuring Spirits, which will be more apparent in the coming quarters. The team has executed well on several funds and I think during the investor presentation slide is a huge improvement, so really great job on that. We actually had a catch up entry in Q3 related to unallocated overheads, which were due to the lower volume production. Due to the things that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve previously outlined, they reduced discounting and the price increases, so that is offset by the increase in the overheads. Based on what I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m seeing, we printed nearly 2.5 million cans in quarter three. Definitely a huge improvement, but we are still seeing \u00e2\u0080\u0093 we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re still operating on a negative gross profit margin. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll take this one and Bruce, you can jump into if you have some thoughts on it. So, Kelvin, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re right, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re \u00e2\u0080\u0093 this is the business that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re ramping up that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to have the biggest near-term impact on the company. I mean, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got our own projections, but we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been wrong a couple times on our projections on where things ramp up and how things change. When you have a customer shows up and he wants to run 100,000 cans in a day and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a unique size can, the margins on that are very different from competing for, say a 12 ounce guy that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s running smaller margins. So when we firstly \u00e2\u0080\u0093 first priced this service, we price it to get win volume immediately, right, from our competitors. So now we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re working on improving margins and mixes, but the chart that I showed in the slides is important because it shows you where we are. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re much higher than we reported here on the chart today, because we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re now well into November. And if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re printing 2 million cans a month, then utilization of the machine is going to be much higher. On a four walls basis, I think we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re really close to breaking through and starting to generate positive cash at Craft. As I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve said to a lot of people, when we talk about the company, this company still has to navigate the fact that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s really small and bears the public company costs of \u00e2\u0080\u0093 that we all talk and know about. And so we have to make improvements on both sides of the business to get to a point where we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re generating positive EBITDA, positive operating cash flow and net income. So as I said in the script, and we were referring to here on the slide that you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re calling out there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an \u00e2\u0080\u0093 would it surprise me, but at the same time, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s requires to be creative. A lot of the people that are coming to us for the digital can printing service are looking to take advantage of the market opportunity you have with really high quality impact graphics, not in a sticker label or a shrink wrap label. They\u00e2\u0080\u0099re looking for logistics help, right, storage. So that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s naturally what we historically have done, right in our mobile business. But the challenge with the mobile business is, as we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve talked about in prior earnings calls, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a business where you are going to a customer site filling on site for them. And so when we did the deal earlier in the summer with Aprch, when we I think we announced that and we talked about on the last call Aprch is a partner that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re producing their CBD water for them. And they had grown through their ability to really continue to build their production assets, right, and then wanting to go more towards a brand focus and asset like strategy with their CBD brand. And so now that facility has been renamed Galactic Unicorn Packaging, and we now have, I believe it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s four customers there. They\u00e2\u0080\u0099re small, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a small facility, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an example of the kind of ways that you can grow here. So we sell cans to these customers, we deliver the cans to our own facility. And this facility won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be one where we can scale it dramatically, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a kind of a test case to show how you can bring can printing kind of the opportunity to sell the can, but also sell additional services. Is to sell more things down one funnel through the customer, broader set of customers, generate more profitability from one customer, control more of the wallet, earn more of their wallet and have a much bigger market share of Craft services for the beverage sector, particularly in the Pacific Northwest. One is, you sing the praises of Azu\u00c3\u00b1ia and Burnside and you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re just not selling a great deal. Amy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s background, as we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve talked about it many times is squarely in this space and has seen these different size brands grow and develop. One of the things that I think investors have to think about with the history of Eastside is, is that there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a lot of different views on how you can build a Spirits business. And this business, frankly, was built from the \u00e2\u0080\u0093 from our legacy, really, the big addition as we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve talked about in the past, Ross. Redneck Riviera and that jump over to distributor, bring a celebrity in, have him pull the product through Walmart and the mass channel into every nook and craning corner, get to 10,000 points of distribution, have it everywhere. And Eastside couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t do that well, and we also couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t do the logistics, bring the whiskey to the West Coast, bottle it, send it back to the East Coast. And then we did the Azu\u00c3\u00b1ia acquisition and thought we could bring it through the same channel was also poorly thought through, because we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to need even more cash to keep Redneck Riviera going. So when we pulled back to markets where we really have more of a presence the key piece that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s missing in my view, it has been missing is the investment with the distributor. So we didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t partner with the distributor, right, last year. What we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve done is and as I try to make it clear, both in this call and in prior calls this year is, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re turning the page and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not going to sell Azu\u00c3\u00b1ia and let the distributor capture all the gross margins. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to go back, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll work with distributor and they get paid for their part of the sale, But we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to put it in places where it is going to be sold, we can invest alongside our distributor partner, start to build the velocity. And as I said in the script, really build that brand equity, which is people coming in saying, I'm looking for Buckman, I love this stuff. I've really enjoyed, Azu\u00c3\u00b1ia Black, and we find opportunities where we show up. There's one recently where one of our competitors with black label tequila wasn't able to produce the volume that people were looking for, and we stepped in and I think people loved the product that was in place of our competitor. So we have to continue to do that, Ross, win them one at a time. Now you can see it, and Amy alluded to this with the question that Kelvin asked at the very start, like the Q&A, which is volume so down exposes the fixed infrastructure of the business. And so we have more work to do to lower our overheads there, but when we get the volumes moving in the right direction, I'm pretty confident we've got a good team in place in the field to do this, taking little time this year. But when we start getting the volumes heading in the right direction and heading north, then the margins are going to be much more apparently, obviously better, better in the bottle and outside the bottle as well. So I mean, that's how I attack that question. Yes, I mean, the only thing I'd have to add is that, hands down the number one thing that we have going for us is the liquid, and every one of our brands. On premise with the pairing dinners and at events where we can sample hundreds of people, not a handful of people as well as digital media on that area will be another focus. Another question is obviously, you guys are right now trading your market cap, equity market caps about equal to the value of one of your printing machine, your canning machine. What do you \u00e2\u0080\u0093 it makes no sense to stay public at this level, but the market's unwilling to reward you with a going enterprise value also. One, why is the market wrong when it's telling us right now that you're not going to be around and there's not going to be any recovery that we're probably better off owning certain tokens and coins. The second is that, looking at this situation, you've got \u00e2\u0080\u0093 you've talked about the value of this business. There's obviously, something we need to do to kind of get that close. So how do we get, so basically talk to me about how you get rid of the going concern issues. You've been able to pay down debt, you've restructured it, you seem to have a good relationship with the person who holds the debt that you have outstanding. Basically last quarter, I haven't seen the queue yet for this quarter, but you actually were able to reduce operating cash \u00e2\u0080\u0093 slightly positive operating cash flow last quarter, and all the stock units lose 70% of its value. So talk to me about that, about what your vision is and where we go and how we get this to a level where, quite honestly, I mean, right now, share will trade more than penny candy. So, clearly when you look at the market cap of the company, people have questions about the company's ability to move forward from here. And I don't think that's dissimilar for a lot of small cap companies facing interest rates where \u00e2\u0080\u0093 on the spectrum of risk we see big double-digit numbers, right. But I think that part here that is important is, this isn't a company that has simply one path to walk down. And I tell this to the team, I tell it to external investors, obviously I talk about it with the board, we talk about it internally a lot and with the key stakeholders. I mean, this is a company that, as I said in the first slide, was purposeful has two paths to see value grow. And a lot of people call me and I have gotten phone calls where people say, hey, I'm interested in this business, or I'm interested in that brand, or I'm interested in your printer. And I was thinking, we'll shoot it 17 tons, it'll be pretty heavy to lift and drag it out the facility. Companies for sale every day, right, basically a public companies for sale every day. So I think Ross, the answer to that is to continue to show people what these two businesses can do, right. And for unfortunately for external investors, it's hard to follow it. I mean, your CT, you're following through the Q and the K and the earning  We can give you company stakeholders of people that are not \u00e2\u0080\u0093 have not have private inside information and they're looking at a different set of companies that we're guiding both companies towards the best possible outcome. I want to head down that road, but do it in a way where we don't marginalize all equity holders, right. So I'm working on charting that course, that's a course that I can't really talk about in a lot of detail about what the ideas are now. The board's engaged in that, the team's engaged in that. And right now we're focused on winning the next opportunity, selling more cans to the printer, getting . Spirit is seeing volumes improving, we have a whole new sales team in Oregon, getting the sales team going, marketing focused individual that's hit the ground running or focused on field marketing closer to the our markets. And I think when we do that, people respond positively and that specifically means with more capital. And that solves the biggest problem we have, which is company has big opportunities, right. Big opportunity, but it needs incremental capital, right, incremental capital to achieve some of the big opportunities, one of the big opportunities I've shared one. One is the second printer, right. Think about the fact that you're sitting and you come visit our digital campaign site, walk in mountains of cans around it, pulling cans in one side on an automated \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and out the other side, automatically stacked into a stack of 8,000 cans wrapped. Second machine in that facility, dramatically changes the contribution margins of both machines now you have two machines contribute to the same labor force, same , same overhead, so that's an example of where you can really make a case and show people how this get to be a pretty substantial and important valuable business. But it sounds to me like to get that you're going to need to have a strategic or an equity partner, someone willing to step in, what can be done to make that happen. I'm sorry, I'm just getting \u00e2\u0080\u0093 one of my teams just texted me and said that you can't hear me very well, so I'm going to take my headset off and speak more directly on the phone. Like I said, I think there are a lot of creative ways that we could accommodate incremental capital. And I'm hopeful we can do it in a really \u00e2\u0080\u0093 significant, or I should say it this way, in a way that really improves the economics of the business, but also does not have a huge negative impact on shareholders. The team's done an outstanding job raising liquidity, improving the liquidity of the company. The company, as I said in the past, has a substantial amount of assets that are valuable that we sit on. For example, we've monetized a lot of our barrel inventory that we didn't necessarily need this year or for that matter next year. So you have trade-offs there, but I think that there's a couple paths we can navigate to get us closer to a bigger win where we can get enough capital to really start to unlock the value of both businesses going forward. But, Ross, this is something that's hard to speculate on now, but we'll be the first one to tell investors when we have a good idea and can be talk about it publicly. I think that you made the year before, I don't remember now. And I'm here fighting with the company to see a better future for investors and I'm comfortable with saying, as I said on the earnings call, that this is a strong \u00e2\u0080\u0093 very valuable company, two very valuable businesses. And I want to see them, see the two businesses thrive, the people win and see the whole combination be rewarded by a higher stock price. We've highlighted the fact that we think things will improve for digital can printing, and I'm hoping that our sales improve also in the fourth quarter. Well, thank you for your direct answers and I have confidence that the going concern risk is misplaced, so thank you. Again, we appreciate the time tonight to listen to our third quarter conference call. If you have any other questions and you want to follow up with us, you certainly can reach out to me and the team and we can spend some time and walk through the results and talk about our plans going forward."
