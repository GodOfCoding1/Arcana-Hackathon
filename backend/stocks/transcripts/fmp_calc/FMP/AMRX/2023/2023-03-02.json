    "content": " Our AvKARE business continues to perform exceedingly well with Q4 net revenue of $108 million, up $18 million or 21%, compared to the prior year period, due to continued growth of our distribution channel and new products to better meet the demands of our customers. (ph) net revenue grew 16% driven by the distribution channel, while specialty net revenue declined $4 million or 1%, a strong growth in Unithroid, up 33% and Rytary up 8% offset the Zomig loss of exclusivity, which is an impact we could now annualize."
