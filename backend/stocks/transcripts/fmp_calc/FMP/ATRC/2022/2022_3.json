    "content": " Strong momentum from our initial launch carried into the third quarter, driving nearly 21% growth in the U.S. open ablation revenue year-over-year, reflecting a mix of new adoption and additional revenue per procedure upon conversion to the EnCompass Clamp. Sales of appendage management products in the U.S. were $27.6 million, up 18% over the third quarter of 2021. International revenue was $13.4 million, up 4.2% on a reported basis and 13.5% on a constant currency basis as compared to the third quarter of 2021. Given the ongoing momentum across our business, we now expect to achieve approximately $328 million to $333 million in annual revenue, reflecting full year growth of approximately 20% to 21%. So I don't think you're going to see tremendous impact in the fourth quarter, but I do think that as we look at next year and the year after, you're starting to see really some traction, the increase in the number of accounts and more depth within those accounts as well. The other half is from an uptick in pricing that we're seeing on the EnCompass Clamp, followed by the appendage management business, which reported about 18% growth in the U.S. year-over-year, then EPi-Sense -- the EPi-Sense tool was 12% and then offset by a decline in the legacy MIS tools year-over-year."
