    "content": " In the second quarter of 2022, we generated $84.5 million in revenue, reflecting growth of 18% over the second quarter of 2021, a remarkable achievement given the strength of the comparable quarter. The consistent performance of our AtriClip product line continued into the second quarter of 2022, with 18% worldwide growth this quarter over an outstanding second quarter last year. Open ablation product sales, which now excludes pain management were $22.1 million compared to $19.5 million, up 13.2% over 2021, showing early strength from the EnCompass launch with a combination of new adoption and incremental revenue per procedure. Give an ongoing strength across our business and results for the second quarter, we now expect to achieve approximately $323 million to $333 million in revenue for the year, reflecting growth of approximately 18% to 21%. Your line is open. Your line is open. What percentage of sales, I think, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not going to \u00e2\u0080\u0093 I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know that I can pinpoint that specifically because I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m also hopeful as things kind of get back to the growth that we expect out of the hybrid conversion longer-term, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to obviously have an impact on it to some degree as you look out over the next several years. Your line is open. Your line is open. When you think about the step-up in revenue in the second half of the year, what we typically see is a decent step down or better leverage in your SG&A expenses compared to kind of the growth that you see in the second half of the year, which is really the calculus when you think about kind of the bottom line and how we will turn to EBITDA profitability for the balance of the year. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open."
