    "content": " And now turning to our financial results for the quarter, our first quarter 2022 worldwide revenue of $74.6 million increased 25.8% on a reported basis and 26.7% on a constant currency basis, when compared to the first quarter of 2021. Given the strength in our underlying business and the results of the first quarter, we now expect to achieve approximately $318 million to $330 million in revenue for the year, reflecting growth of approximately 16% to 20%. And the other piece that's kind of important is that, more and more, there is a conversation about adding the left atrial appendage in the management of the appendage with the clip and we're at about a 75% attachment today, and that's up from really kind of 60% to 70% most of last year. Maybe David, I would just add, I think that just given this as the first quarter, even though we saw strong first quarter results, it's still early in the year and we don't want to get ahead of ourselves. I think the best way without giving specifics on a target profitability date or exact dollar amount of spend on either initiative, I'd reiterate, we do expect pretty naturally in the coming years to hit profitability, despite the investments that we're making in these areas, really leaning into our growth opportunities and expect to see some leverage out of the P&L. We have got new products, new reimbursement in there that we think is going to drive growth, combine that with the work that's being done on the Hybrid side of our business, the label we got last year and the progress we've made in adding new sites."
