    "content": " Gross margin remained healthy and increased modestly on a sequential basis to 35.7%, but was down from a record third quarter performance last year, which included the initial benefits of strong price rationalization and lower cost FIFO inventory sell-through. We continue to maintain strong cost controls but expect to see higher SD&A leverage ratios in the fourth quarter of 2022 as we transition to the new Canada DC and optimize operations, along with the impact of historically lower fourth quarter sales on our fixed cost base. I mean I think you certainly hit on one, and we talked about that around price analytics and our ability to kind of dive deep to understand competitive pricing in this current market, coming off a high inflationary market last year and seeing continued evidence of that this year in certain pockets. So as we pointed out, the private brand was our fastest-growing segment in our sourcing channel in the quarter as compared to the national brand, which really did help maintain that margin as there was some other price pressure on, as we're talking about the FIFO inventory layer still continue to work that high cost of freight of acquired products as well as some of those promotional pricing that we need to work through to get through some of that seasonal inventory that we had acquired."
