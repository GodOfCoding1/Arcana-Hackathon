    "content": " SD&A primarily reflects the fixed cost nature of the business, investments in the expansion of our Canada DC network, including approximately $1.1 million in incremental costs as well as planned marketing investment to support new verticals, and to remain top of mind when our customers search for our products. But we thought we did a little bit better in Q4 than Q3 but when we look at a year-over-year basis, last year in Q4 was really we were fully entrenched in some early price moves that we had made, were primarily related to inflation in the ocean transportation rates, that drove higher selling prices, but also allowed higher gross margins, because we were able to capture that, as we were still working through inventory that had landed prior to the some of those pretty significant increases in costs we saw. And while the ocean freight costs are coming down, I mean, we've seen that in all the different public settings that will be a benefit to the organization, but does take time to work through because obviously we're working through inventory turns to get to that lower cost inventory that will we'll be able to take advantage of and obviously also pass through back to our customers as we move throughout the course of the year."
