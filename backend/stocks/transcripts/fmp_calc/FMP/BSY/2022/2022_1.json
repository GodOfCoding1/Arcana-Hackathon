    "content": " Net of these 22 Q1 ARR impacts in Russia and China, an incremental to year-over-year constant currency ARR, growth of 15% from platform acquisitions, Sequent and Power Line Systems. During the last two years, corresponding not only to our debut as a public company, but also to the pandemic, our initiatives to reinvest pandemic savings have, and I think enduringly, increased our growth rates of new business ARR and revenue, while adhering to our steadfast commitment to steady annual improvements in our normalized operating margins. My premise is that we are performing better now because we have, since 2019, improved through corporate developments not only our important scale economics and competitive mode as the infrastructure engineering software company, but also and especially, we've improved the quality and hence resilience of our ARR and new business, not only as to ARR by infrastructure sector in discipline, but also to review as to ARR by consumption model and as to ARR by geography and as to ARR by account type. Our 2022 Q1 operating results support my conclusion that these cumulative corporate developments since 2019 have increased our underlying intrinsic growth rate through enterprise user success and SMB penetration, have improved our resilience to macro volatility, and have accelerated our upside participation in the world consensus priorities for infrastructure engineering, the limitless, mobility, environment, and grid digital twin opportunities."
