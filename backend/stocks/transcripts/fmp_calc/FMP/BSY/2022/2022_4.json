    "content": " Our key operating results headline is year-over-year constant currency ARR growth consistent with our original and sustained financial outlook of 12.5% in business performance, which excludes ARR acquired with Power Line Systems. Based on feedback to date, I think investors will also prefer our compass setting metric going forward, which is adjusted operating income, including stock-based compensation as encompassing real and substantial economic costs that are conspicuously overlooked in adjusted EBITDA, and this includes capturing operating depreciation and amortization, which becomes more significant for us in 2023 as our digital experience investments include some IT expenditures that require capitalization. From pre-IPO years through the pandemic years, which were subject to normalizing adjustments for the temporary travel and event savings, and as reported today for 2022, leading to our confident 2023 outlook to achieve a compounded annual growth rate over the last five years of just under 16% in adjusted operating income with SBC."
