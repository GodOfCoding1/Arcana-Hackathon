    "content": " Virtuosity's encouraging ARR growth continued seasonalized as here with indeed the majority of its new business generated like last quarter from over 600 further new names, mainly in SMB. But now that 2022 has been substantially post pandemic, I think it's appropriate in my color commentary to henceforth resume distinguishing the tone of business across sectors in terms of our ongoing productivity and generating new business productivity within each, relative to their current proportion of our ARR shown here. Where I suppose all these reasons, bringing this together across infrastructure sectors the most positive sentiment seems to generally correspond to BSY's civil engineering firm footprint in resources, in public works and utilities, and in industrial, with commercial facilities as expected, reflecting less enthusiastic sentiment. Since I last presented this slide, we've added three new investments to our portfolio of growth stage businesses, and the opportunity pipeline of early-stage companies working towards infrastructure digital twins continues to grow. Our account retention rate remains at 98% and our constant currency recurring revenue net retention rate which is a key measure of our success, including recurring revenues with our existing accounts rebounded to 109%, as we expected in line with higher ARR growth rates over the past four quarters and our accounts being as busy as ever. Well we look at each of the top firms, and they're \u00e2\u0080\u0093 we look at their spend with us, their run rate with us, per $1 million of their design revenues, which they report to engineering news record, and that's kind of a report card on how important we are to them and how aggressive they are in going digital."
