Obviously, on a GAAP basis, we did see some significant headwinds this quarter, but a lot of that's behind us, and we're looking forward to continuing the process of putting together very, very detailed and specific plans on how to improve our gross margins, specifically in the fourth quarter and also going into 2023."
