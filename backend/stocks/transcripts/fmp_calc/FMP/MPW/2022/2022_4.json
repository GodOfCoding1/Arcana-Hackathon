    "content": " At the end of this period of transition, we expect that we will have recovered and have available for reinvestment, most or all of our original investment plus any interim deferrals of rent through the following; as we have alluded to in recent months, Prospect owns a valuable managed care business that we believe, based on third-party offers and negotiations and independent valuations is currently worth about $1 billion. During this transaction period, and Ed earlier mentioned that it is likely to extend beyond calendar 2023, and -- we are considering providing rent and interest deferral options to Prospect and expect to account for rental income from our non-California Prospect investments, along with any interest from our $115 million non-real-estate loan on a cash basis. Even at the $1.65 high end of our 2023 guidance, it does not consider incremental FFO that would be created by the recycling of our current investment in our Prospect East Coast investment, assuming succession the restructuring and monetization of Prospect's managed care business. Please go ahead with your question. Please go ahead with your question. Please go ahead with your question. Please go ahead with your question. Please go ahead with your question.
