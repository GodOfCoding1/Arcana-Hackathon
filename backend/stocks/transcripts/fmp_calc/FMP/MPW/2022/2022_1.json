    "content": " So for example, the $2.6 million write-off of straight-line rent shown in this quarter's FFO reconciliation, relates to the profitable sale of one of the former Adeptus hospitals mentioned in this morning's press release. We have always considered and prominently displayed the AFFO metric because we, like many real estate investors think it's critically important to measure results not only based on GAAP, which includes mandated, non-cash straight-line rent, but on a measure that does not include this non-cash unbilled rent concept. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open."
