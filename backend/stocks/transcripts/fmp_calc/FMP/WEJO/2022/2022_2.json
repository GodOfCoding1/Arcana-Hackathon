    "content": " Our efforts to build sustainable pipeline and revenue is reflecting our strong customer partner activity during the quarter, which included 90 deals close to- date and continuing contractual agreements with premier global companies, with also additional customers in a wide range of sectors including, automotive, insurance, audience immediate measurement, retail and Departments of Transportation. But we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not just focused on revenue, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve also taken aggressive actions to reduce our cost structure to accelerate our path to profitability, using adjusted EBITDA as a proxy t cash, we believe these actions will reduce our monthly cash burn rate from $10 million to $5 million to $6 million by quarter four. Despite our cost prioritization efforts, we will still onboard vehicles at the $27 million to $32 million range this year, focusing on vehicles that give us incremental sensor data, electric vehicles and vehicles that deliver PII data, which is rich with driver and vehicle insights to support our 2022 and 2023 revenue plans. It is very possible that when we talk about $10 million plus that, when we add up our pipeline of activity, we can easily get, if we closed everything to well above $10 million, but we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re maintaining the guidance that we have based on the deals that are immediately in pipeline that we know will close, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the 60% to 70%."
