    "content": " Despite the pandemic-imposed pressure on our product delivery to third-party customers, we were able to achieve the growth mainly attributable to ongoing digital transformation demands from Ping An Group and overseas expansion of our life insurance business. Revenue from operation support increased by 3.9% on a year-over-year basis to RMB1,141 million, which was mostly benefited from increased demands for AI customer service products in Gamma sector. We recorded strong revenue growth performance from our virtual banking business in Hong Kong in 2022, which increased by 210% to RMB107 million from RMB34 million in the prior year, which made a strong contribution to our above average growth of overseas business. Gamma Platform sector, our focus of product innovation in Stage II strategy, contributed the biggest chunk of our revenue, recording a 24.1% growth in 2022 and accounting for 45.2% our total revenue. Digital Banking sector, which accounted for 32.6% of total revenue reduced by 12.1% on a year-over-year basis, which was mainly caused by a reduction in transaction volume of our loan products as a result of the pandemic and adverse macro circumstances. Digital Insurance sector, which accounted for 19.8% of total revenue increased by 8.4% on a year-over-year basis, benefited from newly launched life insurance agent product in the overseas market."
