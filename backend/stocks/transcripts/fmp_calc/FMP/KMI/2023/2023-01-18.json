    "content": " Our Natural Gas segment was up 11% or $138 million, with growth coming from multiple assets, higher contributions from our Texas Intrastate systems, MEP and EPNG, increased volumes on our KinderHawk system and favorable pricing on our Altamont system. The Products segment was down $29 million, driven by higher operating expenses as well as lower contributions from our crude and condensate business, and those were partially offset by increased rates across multiple assets as well as strong volumes on our splitter system. The Terminal segment was flat to the fourth quarter of \u00e2\u0080\u009821 with slightly lower New York Harbor and Houston Ship Channel liquids refined product renewal rates, unfavorable impacts from the 2022 winter weather and unfavorable property taxes, offset by greater contributions from our Jones Act tanker business, nonrecurring impacts from Hurricane Ida in 2021 and contributions from expansion projects placed in service as well as other rate escalations that the segment experienced. So yes, the KinderHawk volumes were basically flat from quarter-to-quarter, but we do expect a nice uplift as we move into 2023, and that is -- it is largely capacity constraints, both on our gathering system, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re spending some capital in 2023 to create some additional capability there and then also a downstream capacity comes online as well. But, what you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re seeing when we have a backlog that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s $3.3 billion, and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re executing it at 3.4x EBITDA multiples is that our network is well positioned, and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re able to make relatively modest capital efficient investments in our grid to expand, to serve the supply and demand growth that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re seeing across the network."
