During 2022, we were able to achieve our full year revenue of $321 million, representing an increase of over 17% compared to full year 2019 revenue, the most recent prepandemic comparable period. Excluding the one-time goodwill impairment charge, operating costs for the fourth quarter would have decreased to $51.5 million, primarily due to lower cost of revenues and decreased marketing expenditures. Excluding these one-time non-recurring charges, operating expenses in 2022 would have decreased to $233.3 million primarily due to lower cost of revenues decreased marketing expenditures and lower depreciation and amortization expenses.
