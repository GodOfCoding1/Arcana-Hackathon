    "content": " In the fourth quarter, we delivered $207 million in net sales and $19.7 million in adjusted EBITDA compared to $255.9 million in net sales and $30.9 million in adjusted EBITDA for the 2021 period. However, we also continue to see the sustained impact of the current economic environment on consumer demand in Europe and, to a lesser extent, Asia Pacific, exacerbated by the War in Ukraine and the impact of Brexit on the U.K. economy, which resulted in another tough quarter for retailers and in turn, for our European business. We are focused on lowering these costs and this quarter, we successfully reduced distribution expenses by $4.6 million, driven primarily by an ongoing labor efficiency program. As we reported this morning, net income for the fourth quarter of 2022 was $3.3 million or $0.15 per diluted share versus a loss of $600,000 or $0.03 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of '21. Adjusted net income was $4.7 million for the fourth quarter, $0.22 per diluted share compared to $14.4 million or $0.65 per diluted share in '21. U.S. segment expenses increased $3.7 million to $32.3 million, primarily due to an increase in sales support expense, the inclusion of S'well and a higher allowance for bad debt. Interest expense increased by $1.2 million due to higher interest rates on our variable rate debt and the effective income tax rate for 2022 exceeded the statutory rate primarily due to foreign losses, which no benefits recognized partially offset by an R&D tax credit. And while liquidity was enhanced by an increase in our credit facility commitment, we achieved this level by actively managing -- actively managing our inventory down by $48 million during the year and without reducing selling prices in this challenging business environment."
