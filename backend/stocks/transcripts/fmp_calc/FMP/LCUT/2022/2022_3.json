    "content": " These supply chain challenges and an inflationary environment have created excess inventory issues that are not necessarily specific to Lifetime's categories of goods, but nevertheless do affect Lifetime's sales as retailers focus on reducing overall inventory levels across a range of goods. Inflationary pressures are likely to continue to impact consumer trends and consumer behavior in our core business, but we expect that orders from our retailers will return to more consistent levels once inventory levels normalize. While we continue to focus on gaining share and growing our top line, we've responded to the current market challenges by taking steps to reduce SG&A by 5$.5 million across the business, a 13.1% decrease compared to the third quarter of 2021. However, excluding an estimated charge for the Wallace facility remediation and a non-cash impairment charge for our equity investment and Grupo Vasconia, adjusted net income was $3.5 million for the 2022 third, $0.16 per diluted share versus adjusted net income of $13.4 million or $0.61 per diluted share in 2021. As Rob discussed, high retail inventory levels adversely affected our shipments in the current quarter, and high inflation and other economic factors contributed to weaker end market demand especially in Europe and Asia Pacific markets. It does, we've looked a lot and analyzed that because you're seeing less of the inventory impact, even though a lot of the pure play guys, their warehouses have been full but we basically are flat on a percentage basis in e-commerce, which is consistent with the fact that in brick and mortar there's a gap between POS and our shipments."
