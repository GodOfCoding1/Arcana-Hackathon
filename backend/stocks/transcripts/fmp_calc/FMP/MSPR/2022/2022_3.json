    "content": " Even though we started 2022, having exceeded our projected value of potentially recoverable claims by more than 3 times at a figure of $86.6 billion as opposed to the expected $21 billion, during 2022, we continue to grow with new  clients as well as new recovery rights assigned by existing  clients. Within the income statement for the three months ended September 30, 2022, there were one time non-cash items related to changes in the fair value of warrants and derivative liabilities related to the Cantor facility, which was disclosed in previous filings of $2.7 million and non-cash items for the period related to the claims amortization expense, gain on debt extinguishment and paid in kind interest. So LifeWallet was developed because as we found all these recovery opportunities, and this dated back all the way to 2014, we developed a system called Claims to Med, which essentially provides the transition from what I call somewhat of hieroglyphics, very difficult to understand claims data, if anybody's ever received something from an insurance company, it'll tell you what the diagnosis code was and the CPT code, and it was difficult for even our internal teams to read that. And we also have a system that we created that's about 20 years old now, it stemmed away from before MSP, that lets you really process the cases in a way that no other system exists from a litigation standpoint, from lean resolution, from being able to understand medical records, medical claims, everything that one would need to try to be able to resolve a case."
