    "content": " Assay revenue in the third quarter increased 16% to $3.4 million largely due to a 54% year-over-year increase in billable samples to approximately 18,080. Total revenue for the third quarter increased 18% to $3.6 million up from $3.0 million in last year's period, primarily on higher assay revenue. For the third quarter, we changed collection estimates for tests run-in prior periods due to reduced commercial payer payments which resulted in a $0.5 million downward revenue adjustment. Sales and marketing expenses were $14.6 million during the third quarter, a 49% increase from the year ago period, primarily due to higher player related costs from increased headcount and marketing expenditures. Due to challenges with commercial payers which affect ASP and the potential for significant additional changes of estimates for anticipated cash collections, it's difficult to provide a revised forecast, but we do anticipate being able to achieve at least $13 million assay revenue for the full year 2022 We expect the factors that we have restrained our growth in the second half of 2022 to spill over into 2023. But the bigger issue that we're talking about, this is right now an issue around payers and that's breaking through the payer of challenges that we're having that is the main driver from all the work we did over the last few months that's putting the pressure on the billable sample volumes."
