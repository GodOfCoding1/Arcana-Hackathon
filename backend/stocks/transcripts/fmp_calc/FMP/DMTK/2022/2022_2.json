    "content": " In the second quarter, we engaged with Medicare's billing contractor NCCI and expect new insurance code edits to be adopted in the fourth quarter of 2022 that will improve this issue. Assay revenue in the second quarter increased 43% to $4.1 million largely due to a 56% year-over-year increase in available samples to approximately 18,320. Total revenue for the second quarter increased 36% to $4.2 million up from $3.1 million in last year's period, primarily on higher assay revenue. Third, Medicare samples represented about 24% of our billable samples in the second quarter, which was unchanged as a percentage from the first quarter and up from 19% last year. Contract revenue declined modestly to $0.1 million during the second quarter and remains unpredictable, as it's closely linked to the clinical trial progress of our biopharma customers. Sales and marketing expenses were $15.0 million during the second quarter, a 90% increase from the year ago period, primarily due to higher employee-related costs from increased headcount and marketing expenditures. Your line is open. Your line is open. And as John mentioned too, right, when commercial payers that we've even contracted with, they don't have any of these limitations on usage on per date of service but we did see that they started using these code edits recently which has impacted current trends from a commercial side. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open."
