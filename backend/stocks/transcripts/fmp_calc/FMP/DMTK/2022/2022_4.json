    "content": " We are pleased to report normalized fourth quarter ASP of $239 for the DMT, which is sequentially higher, but we still expect variability going forward primarily due to fluctuating payments from non-contracted commercial payers. Assay revenue in the fourth quarter decreased 9% to $2.7 million, largely due to a $1.5 million of downward revenue adjustment due to changes in collection estimates for samples reported in prior periods. Sales and marketing expenses were $13.6 million during the fourth quarter, a 2% year-over-year increase, largely resulting from higher employee-related costs and marketing expenditures."
