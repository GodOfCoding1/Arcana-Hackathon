    "content": " On a non-GAAP basis, Q1 net income was $102 million up 25% and earnings per share of $3.70 up 35% from the first prior year quarter. I\u2019m confident by placing all elements of our software business under Stephanie\u2019s leadership, as we did years ago with this course business under Jim Wyman will see better alignment, faster and more effective decision making, improved resource allocation against top priorities and stronger end-to-end operational rigor and discipline. Total revenues for the first quarter was $322 million, an increase of 3% over the prior year or 9% after adjusting for the divestiture of our collections and recovery product line last year. Turning to the new software metrics that we introduced last quarter, our software ARR in the first fiscal quarter of 2022 was $547 million, a 10% increase over the prior year quarter. As we said, our non-platform customers\u2019 software usage tends to be mature and relatively stable which is reflected in the non-platform net retention rate of 102% this quarter. Software sales were strong this quarter with annual contract value bookings of $16.6 million versus $12.1 million in the prior year, an increase of 37%. GAAP net income this quarter was $85 million, down 2% from the prior year quarter due to a higher effective tax rate in 2022 as a result of lower excess tax benefit and the previously mentioned gain on sale last year. Please go ahead, your line is open. I know, it\u2019s kind of expected to take a leg down sequentially this quarter and are we kind of at the point now where things are leveling off a little bit, and maybe to services kind of trends with kind of the non-platform side of the software business or are there any more near term kind of run offs that we should keep in mind relative to the 1Q run rate of like 26.5 million? A big part of the decline was the divestiture of a collection recovery business as we disclosed in the 10Q, about $16.3 million of revenue that we had in the first quarter last year that we don\u2019t have this year, about half of that was professional services. There was a little bit of push out of already contracted PS, which will catch up just schedule issue and milestone issues that are typical with any PS business, but the sort of 26 million a quarter 17%, 18%, 19% of revenue it feels consistent with what we\u2019re the rate at which we\u2019re selling new PS business going forward. Please go ahead, your line is open. And then, turning to the B2C business, obviously, solid growth there in terms of the revenues, trying to break that down a little bit further, any color on typically this quarter generally has some $6 million to $7 million of licensing or at least it has the past couple of years. Got it, that\u2019s helpful. Please go ahead, your line is open. Got it, that\u2019s helpful."
