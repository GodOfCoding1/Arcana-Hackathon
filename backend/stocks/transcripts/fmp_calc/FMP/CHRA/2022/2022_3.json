    "content": " Increased new contract awards, strengthened our leadership team, completed certain legacy loss projects that have created a drag on our performance for 2022, and implemented processes to improve our commercial operation and financial rigor and oversight. The net impact of other items within operating income was a net loss of $30.2 million compared to net income of $1.8 million in the second quarter of 2022, primarily attributable to a decrease in scrap sale volume at Gibbons Creek and an increase in ownership and other costs including accretion expense resulting from the Avon Lake and Cheswick environmental risk transfer acquisitions. In terms of the drag on the profitability and both quarter-to-date and year-to-date, I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t specifically comment on the one beneficial use contract, but overall as a group the two beneficial use contracts that have a drag on our profitability, directly impact from a quarter-to-date perspective around a little over $2 million. So, as we look to kind of the remainder of this year in terms of opportunities it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to be limited to those three projects with obviously Avon Lake Cheswick providing some of the cash flow, whereas Gibbons Creek we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re still performing those remediation activities. We look forward to creating value for our shareholders as we focus on, again safety for our employees, growing our business by continuing to partner and provide excellent service to our customers and creating stability and our profitability going forward by increasing our commercial rigor on new opportunities, ensuring we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got the proper tools and processes in place to, to identify and mitigate risk at the project level."
