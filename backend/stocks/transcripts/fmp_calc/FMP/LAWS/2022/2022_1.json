    "content": "  In terms of Lawson's performance for the quarter, we saw great progress on many fronts, including strong growth in our strategic customer relationships; continued growth in our Kent Automotive business, in particular, multisite locations; the relocation of our Western Canadian distribution center more than doubling its square footage size from 43,000 square feet to over 100,000 square feet; the continuation of our investments in the 3 initiatives of market segmentation, Torrent part washers and state and local and education initiative; our ability to manage through a tough inflationary environment while generating additional gross margin dollars to offset various cost increases; strong sales and EBITDA performance by the Bolt Supply House; and we exceeded our first quarter expectations even with increased costs in certain areas of the business, which I'll cover more in a moment."
