    "content": " The net loss attributable to common stockholders of $0.22 per diluted share was higher than the $0.08 loss per diluted share from a year ago, primarily due to: increased depreciation from partner buyouts, a decline in joint venture income due to an insurance gain we recognized in the prior year, and increased borrowing costs on our sub debt and credit facility, offset by improved portfolio results. FFO was $0.40 per diluted share compared to $0.35 per diluted share a year ago, primarily due to an increase in net insurance gains and recoveries and a decline in the early extinguishment of debt, offset by increases in real estate operating expenses, the result of costs incurred related to the extreme weather conditions and increased interest expense on our floating rate corporate debt."
