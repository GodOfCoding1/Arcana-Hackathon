    "content": " Turning to our results for the third quarter of 2022, net income attributable to common stockholders was $7.06 million or $0.37 per diluted share, compared to $28.11 million or $1.54 per diluted share in the same quarter of 2021. Staying true to our discipline of managing our portfolio and recycling capital, in the third quarter, we sold the unconsolidated joint ventures that owned Waters Edge at Harbison, a 204-unit multifamily community in Columbia, South Carolina, in which BRT held an 80% equity interest for $32.4 million. The aggregate mortgage debt as at September 30 for our wholly-owned properties, combined with our pro rata share of mortgage debt for our unconsolidated joint ventures, totals $549.5 million, with a weighted average interest rate of 3.97%, and a weighted average remaining term to maturity of 7.5 years. Also, in the quarter, we strengthened and enhanced our financial flexibility by amending our credit facility, which, among other things, increased the amount we can borrow to $60 million, increased the amount that may be used for working capital and operating expenses to $25 million, extended the term of the facility to September 2025, and reduced the interest rate to the prime rate with a floor of 3.5%."
