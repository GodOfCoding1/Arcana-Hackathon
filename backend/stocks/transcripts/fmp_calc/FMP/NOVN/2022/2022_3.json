    "content": " We have delivered strong volume growth year-over-year for our promoted prescription products with total revenue of over $5 million in the third quarter, results for which we are very pleased. However, and importantly, both brands maintained their rider-based levels from the previous quarter and continue to deliver strong growth compared to same quarter last year and increased commercial focus on our acne brand MINOLIRA led to strong double-digit year-to-date growth quarter versus last year and quarter-over-quarter growth. Prescription volume for RHOFADE in the third quarter came in at 37,900 total prescriptions, representing a 31% growth year-over-year and beating the total rosacea market, which grew only 7% for the same time period. In fact, RHOFADE increased its growth rate of new patients and new prescriptions in Q3 to 32% year-over-year compared to 26% growth year-over-year in Q2, demonstrating the increased use of RHOFADE to treat persistent partial erythema amongst rosacea patients. The increase of $19.1 million was primarily due to $9.3 million of selling, general and administrative expenses related to EPI Health\u00e2\u0080\u0099s commercial operations, $4.8 million of transaction-related expenditures related to the EPA Health acquisition and a $2.3 million increase in investment costs related to the SB206 pre-launch strategy and commercial preparation."
