    "content": " The increase of $6.2 million was primarily due to $3.3 million of selling, general and administrative expenses related to EPI Health's commercial operations; $0.6 million of transaction-related expenditures related to the acquisition and a $1.2 million increase in investment costs related to the SB206 prelaunch strategy and commercial preparation. As you can see, a 28% year-over-year growth in our marketed portfolio prescriptions, excluding Wynzora, which launched last year, coupled with the comparative improvement on the bottom line for the commercial business from Q1 gives us the opportunity to continue to drive optimization of our commercial business while at the same time investing in and looking forward to the potential launch of SB206."
