    "content": " Our highlights can be summarized, and easily remembered on one hand, we're going to count down five, product candidates in our development pipeline, all nitric oxide-based formulations; four, products promoted by our commercial team; three, near-term value creators, through two priority products and one lead product candidate; two, business units, we have an R&D engine and a commercial platform. We'll continue the momentum of our promoted products with a heightened level of focus with our key opinion leaders in our current disease states, as well as, our potential future disease states, along with the continued Salesforce execution and promotional marketing programs that continue to drive growth across the portfolio. Our Commercial Operations segment included net product revenues from sales of our commercial portfolio of $0.7 million, driven primarily by Rhofade, which was $0.8 million for the 20 days ended March 31. This increase of approximately $7.3 million was primarily due to $4 million of non-recurring transaction-related expenditures in current in connection with the EPI Health acquisition, $1.6 million of expenses incurred to support the conduct of EPI Health's commercial sales operations during the quarter, $0.8 million increase in support costs related to the SB206 prelaunch strategy and commercial preparation, and finally, a $0.9 million increase in other G&A costs. And I'm just back on that, that 56% growth in promoted products of -- prescriptions from the first quarter of 2021, it's quite the growth, as John Donofrio mentioned earlier as well."
