    "content": " These risks and uncertainties are discussed in the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s reports filed with the SEC, including its reports on Forms 8-K, 10-Q and 10-K, and in particular, the Risk Factors section of its Form 10-K. Today, I will provide an overview of our loan originations, real estate investments and the health of the investment portfolio, while Dave Bryant will discuss the financial statements, liquidity condition, book value and operating results for the third quarter and provide an update on 2022 projected results. The ACRES origination team delivered $181.3 million of new loan commitments in the third quarter, comprising three hotel loans, two office loans and one multifamily loan. The company ended the quarter with $2.1 billion of commercial real estate loans across 88 individual investments, of which only two comprising 1.4% of the portfolio were delinquent. Earnings available for distribution for the third quarter were $0.40 per share and included the net charge-off of the sale of a foreclosed office property of approximately $400,000 or $0.04 per share, as our EAD policy is to charge off losses upon realized transactions as opposed to loss estimates required by GAAP. The increase to book value per share for the third quarter was primarily driven by $0.36 of per share accretion from common stock repurchases, $0.11 related to the non-cash equity expense and net income of $0.08 per share. In the third quarter the company recorded an increase in loan loss reserves under the CECL calculations of approximately $2.6 million compared to a $500,000 provision in the second quarter. Regarding share repurchases during the third quarter, the company used $1.8 million of the board approved share repurchase plan of $20 million to redeem approximately 198,000 shares at approximately a 64% discount to book value per share on September 30."
