    "content": " These risks and uncertainties are discussed in the company's reports filed with the SEC, including its reports on Forms 8-K, 10-Q, and 10-K, and in particular, the risk factors section of its Form 10-K. Today, I will provide an overview of our loan originations, real estate investments, and the health of the investment portfolio, while Dave Bryant will discuss the financial statements, liquidity condition, book value, and operating results for the fourth quarter. In January 2023, one watch-list loan on a hotel portfolio in the Southwest region with a par value of $56.5 million was paid off in full, which reduced the value of our watch-list loans in half as compared to year-end 2022. Our guidance was for between $0.10 and $0.20 per share of GAAP net income for the year, and we ended 2022 with a $1 net loss, which was largely a result of the $1.28 per share of CECL reserves recorded in the fourth quarter. With net loan growth of $190 million in calendar year 2022, we expect to have net income and for our earnings available for distribution to remain positive and steadily grow in 2023."
