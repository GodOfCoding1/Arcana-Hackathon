    "content": " We are also reducing our annual guidance ranges for service and total revenue by $20 million and $30 million, respectively, reflecting lower incremental investment in sales and marketing initiatives as well as foreign exchange headwinds and continued weakness in CPaaS. After deploying 8x8 UCaaS with Voice for Microsoft Teams for over 1,000 employees in 76 locations across the U.S. and Canada, they expanded to XCaaS by adding contact center this quarter for a single vendor cloud communication platform to help grow their business. Although we expanded our user base with new customers in the quarter, the usage component of the CPaaS business continued to weaken in Q1 and impacted both our ARR metrics and service revenue growth. Service revenue gross margin came in at 73.4%, an increase of 450 basis points from the first quarter fiscal '22 and 100 basis points sequentially driven by continued COGS improvement programs, which drove down unit costs and to a lesser extent, lower CPaaS revenue. For operating expenses, we plan to significantly slow the growth in sales and marketing spend and would like to see us exit fiscal '23 between 38% and 39% of revenue, down from 41% two quarters ago. With this in mind, we are taking into account the recent performance of the CPaaS business and FX, we are establishing guidance for the second quarter of fiscal '23 ended September 30, 2022, as follows: We anticipate service revenue to be in a range of $177 million to $180 million, essentially flat with the first quarter, representing approximately 24% to 26% year-over-year growth. We are updating our guidance for fiscal '23 ending March 31, 2023, as follows: We anticipate service revenue to be in a range of $720 million to $730 million, representing approximately 20% to 21% year-over-year growth. I mean so if you take a look at the $20 million to $25 million kind of service side and $25 million to $30 million, I would say, number one is maybe 1/3 FX, 1/3 CPaaS and 1/3 UC/CC or applications kind of when you mix it all together, and look, for -- be it for me to use the word macro, we're a small fish in a big pond."
