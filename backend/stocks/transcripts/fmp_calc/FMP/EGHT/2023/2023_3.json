    "content": " Enterprise customers accounted for 57% of total ARR, and Enterprise ARR was up 30% year-over-year, but down approximately $1 million sequentially due to the continued decline in CPaaS ARR. Total non-GAAP spending as measured by cost of goods sold plus R&D, plus sales and marketing plus G&A, was up approximately 8% year-over-year, primarily due to the addition of Fuze' operations, but it was well below our 18% total revenue growth. We anticipate service revenue to be in the range of $175 million to $178 million, up sequentially from Q3 at the midpoint and representing approximately 1% to 3% year-over-year growth as we pass the Fuze 1-year anniversary and remain cautious on the CPaaS revenue outlook. Your line is now open. We have made some -- reduced some investments in the sales and marketing front, in line with what we have again said in the past, where we're willing to forgo some revenue growth for increased profitability and the 9.9% operating margins clearly shows that we're taking that seriously. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. Your line is now open.
