    "content": " I want to start today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s call by thanking our employees for delivering another solid quarter despite supply chain disruptions, accelerating inflation and a severe COVID-related lockdown in China, our team delivered mid-single digit core growth expanded our adjusted EBITDA margins and successfully integrated our newly acquired intra-oral scanner IOS business. Before I turn it over to Howard to discuss our second quarter results in more detail, I want to reiterate our long-term vision, provide some insight on current market conditions and offer a quick update on our progress toward our strategic priorities of accelerating growth, expanding operating margins and transforming our portfolio. Our second quarter adjusted gross margin was 58.7%, increasing by 40 basis points compared to the prior year due to higher volume and favorable mix partially offset by the impact of inflation and our material costs. In the second quarter, our combined orthodontic businesses grew 17% versus prior year and with our core bracket and wires growing low single digits, while Spark revenue continues to accelerate. Our implant base two, three placement business grew mid single digits in Q2 2022 versus Q2 of the prior year driven by strong growth in all emerging markets, excluding Russia with more modest growth reported in the developed markets. This is down 120 basis points from Q2 of 2021, primarily due to the significant increase in investments to long-term growth \u00e2\u0080\u0093 to drive long-term growth, as well as the increase in customer facing activities we participated in the quarter. While price positively impacts sales by approximately 4% lower volumes across our imaging, restorative and infection prevention businesses saw core sales drop compared to the second quarter of 2021. I think that we saw a little bit of weak taking down on the inventory side as it relates to the rest of business as well by a few of our large distributors should have been worked out, and we see that in the second half that we get back to normal growth as well."
