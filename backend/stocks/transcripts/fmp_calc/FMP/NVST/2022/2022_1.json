    "content": " Despite a challenging macro environment, the localized COVID lockdowns, numerous supply chain disruptions, meaningful inflation and a challenging geopolitical environment, I'm pleased to report that Envista was able to deliver a strong first quarter, marked by mid-single-digit core growth and better-than-expected adjusted EBITDA margins. In Q1, we saw continued strength in our orthodontic business, with solid mid-single-digit core growth in brackets and wires and over 100% core growth in Spark clear aligners versus Q1 2021. In our Specialty Products & Technologies segment, our core revenue increased by 11.2% compared to the first quarter of 2021, driven by strong growth in implants and continued strong growth from Spark. Our implant Phase II replacement business grew high single digits in Q1 of 2022 versus Q1 of 2021, driven by strong growth in developed markets and most emerging markets partially offset by the impact of the localized lockdown in China. Growth is widespread across various geographies, Western Europe is showing notable strength, and we continue to add -- as far to different geographies through a registration process, we're seeing doctor adoption continue in various years, North America, Europe, China and expansion into the DSOs as well. We have seen a strong growth in other geographies -- and in exactly as Howard said, that was about 14% to 15% down in Q1, the rest of the business did extremely well."
