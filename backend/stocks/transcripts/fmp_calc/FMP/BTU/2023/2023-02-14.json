    "content": " Our strong financial performance allowed us to retire all $545 million of the remaining senior secured debt in the fourth quarter, completing the repayment of over $1.1 billion for the full year. In the quarter, seaborne thermal recorded adjusted EBITDA of $209 million a 22% increase over the third quarter as export volumes increased 700,000 tons to $2.3 million. The Seaborne Metallurgical segment generated $188 million of adjusted EBITDA in the fourth quarter, up 66% from the prior quarter driven by 22% higher realized pricing and 200,000 additional tons. The U.S. thermal mines delivered $82.5 million of adjusted EBITDA in the quarter and $310 million for the full year, both higher than the prior year comparable periods. The other U.S. thermal mines generated $57.8 million of adjusted EBITDA and $242.4 million for the year, an increase of nearly 50% compared to the prior year. At December 31, we had $255 million of cash margin posted for the remaining 552,000 metric tons of Wambo coal hedges that will settle in the first half of 2023. Seaborne metallurgical volumes are projected to be 7 million to 8 million tons an increase of nearly 1 million tons over the prior year, primarily driven by the completion of the Moorvale South project and Shoal Creek's continued progression through tough geological conditions. One, remember, in the first quarter of '22, we had realized about $35 million of hedge losses that's really just weather-related production delays and delivering some of those hedge tons later in the year."
