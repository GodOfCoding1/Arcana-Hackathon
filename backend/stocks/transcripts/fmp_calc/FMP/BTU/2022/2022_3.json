    "content": " In the third quarter, our diversified assets delivered strong performance results, generating free cash flow of over $460 million and adjusted EBITDA of $439 million, while recovering from significant weather events in Australia in the early part of the third quarter. Together with higher demand in the US, each of our operating segments reported higher per ton margins compared to the second quarter, except seaborne metallurgical coal, which despite achieving $30 per ton in lower cost, realized lower market pricing. Seaborne Thermal generated $171 million of adjusted EBITDA and benefited from higher realized prices, resulting in a 48% adjusted EBITDA margin. The segment exported 1.6 million tons at an average realized price of $188, approximately $45 higher than the second quarter. Wilpinjong recorded $115 million of adjusted EBITDA for the quarter, repaid $136 million of its debt, and had over $200 million of cash at September 30. Seaborne Met generated $113 million of adjusted EBITDA as lower average realized prices of $180 per ton were partially offset by higher production and lower costs compared to the second quarter, resulting in a 36% adjusted EBITDA margin. The seaborne thermal segment is expected to ship 2.4 million tons, with 1.2 million export tons priced on average at 122, including 564,000 metric tons hedged at $84. Looking out to 2023 on US thermal volumes, we have 82 million PRB tons priced at $13.25 with some higher-quality 8,800 Btu coal uncommitted and 18.6 million other US general tons priced at $50.70 per ton."
