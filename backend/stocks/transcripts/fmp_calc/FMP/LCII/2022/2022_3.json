    "content": " Well, we are seeing softened RV demand due to the overbuilding of inventory and continued macroeconomic challenges, we were able to largely overcome the nearly 40% drop in North American RV OEM production in the third quarter through strong performance in our diversified portfolio of Marine, RV aftermarket and other adjacent market-focused businesses. Our consolidated net sales for the third quarter decreased 3% to $1.1 billion compared to the prior year period, impacted by a reduction in RV demand, partially offset by growth in our other end markets. Your line is now open. Well, I think there's going to be a couple of things to happen over the next few quarters is, you're going to see some of the deflation happen and some of the commodities certainly, you look at just Lippert, we're heavily weighted toward steel and aluminum and we've seen steel drop and most of our pricing to customers are indexed. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. Your line is now open."
