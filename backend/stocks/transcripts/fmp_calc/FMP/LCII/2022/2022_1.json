    "content": " I think from an industry standpoint, it still sounds like, with other suppliers, other vendors that there\u2019s still some pricing to give, but for us, we\u2019ve got, as I just mentioned our, the steel index swung pretty good in our favor for the first time in five quarters. I think there\u2019s anticipation that the next few weeks that the retail will start getting a little bit better, but I\u2019d say that our, we\u2019re planning on a run rate as we\u2019re planning on kind of a 525,000 unit number for the year based on all the inputs that we\u2019re hearing both on the retail and the wholesale side with plan downtime and things like that. I mean, I\u2019ve, even though volumes have come down, I\u2019m excited about what the, next 12 months looks like for us, because we\u2019re going to add about $350 million in market share gains and just RV alone and just some of the stuff business we\u2019ve closed over the last quarter or so that\u2019ll run out through next year as we start some of this new business stuff. And if you look at the hitch business, which is a lot of steel components, there\u2019s certainly a heavy weighting to price as we had to chase steel all the way from $0.25, $0.30 per pound  all the way up to almost a $1 per pound, it\u2019s probably been the most meaningful within our RV and marine components, which is why we\u2019ve spent most of our time talking about the price as it relates to those markets. Certainly when you step back and think about all the different components that we supply to within an RV, many of which, I think, I\u2019ve said before that, of our materials that would consume approximately 50% of them are steel and aluminum, and that\u2019s the dominant share of that is steel."
