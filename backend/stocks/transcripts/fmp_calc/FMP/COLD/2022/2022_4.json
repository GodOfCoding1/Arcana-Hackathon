    "content": " For the full-year, we expect economic occupancy to increase by approximately 50 basis points to 150 basis points as we expect food manufacturers to continue to ramp up production, the benefit of recent commercialization efforts, and softer throughput volumes. In the midpoint of this 2023 range is slightly down from our 2022 core SG&A expense of 203 million, primarily due to last year's core SG&A expense being elevated from the company achieving the higher-end of its performance based annual cash incentive compensation program. The second half of this year \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and really ongoing, if you go back to our previous discussions, it's all about labor, getting permanent labor in that you can give the three months of time it takes to be a productive permanent employee and limit the need for contract labor, which as we've said all along, cost more and is far less productive. New employees, less than three months on the job, higher content of contract hours given that fourth quarter is our busiest quarter, but if we can get through the fourth quarter, as well as we did and we did a really good job on customer service at the 85% level, I have no doubt we can grow occupancy 50 basis points to 150 basis points this year."
