    "content": " With our third quarter results, we have exceeded many of our digital revenue metrics a whole quarter early and we are on track to achieve our full year adjusted EBITDA guidance of $95 million to $98 million. As a result of our industry-leading digital growth, total digital revenue over the last 12 months grew to $224 million, up 24% compared to the prior year. In the third quarter, total operating revenue was $195 million, down less than 1% to the prior year, as the growth of our Digital Revenue stream almost offset the decline in our Print revenue stream. Total Digital Revenue increased 27% in the third quarter to $61 million, driven by rapid growth in Amplified Digital and in Digital-only subscription revenue. Digital-only subscription revenue over the last 12 months totaled $37 million, pacing well ahead of our full year target of $33 million. Amplified Digital, our full service digital marketing solutions agency fueled the growth with revenue of $20 million -- $21 million in the quarter, up 74%. Amplified Digital revenue totaled $66 million over the last 12 months, exceeding our fiscal year-end estimate of $65 million. We expect continued growth in digital-only subscribers, earning $11 million in revenue in the fourth quarter. On the Advertising side, we expect $47 million of digital advertising and marketing services revenue in the fourth quarter, with about $22 million of that coming from Amplified Digital."
