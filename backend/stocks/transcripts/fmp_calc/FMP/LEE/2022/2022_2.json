    "content": " We reported 59% growth in digital subscribers, 108% growth in aside digital revenue and 33% growth in total digital revenue, putting us ahead of our plans to achieve our fiscal '22 digital revenue targets. This growth is expected to achieve $435 million of digital revenue in 2026, and it's being driven by increased digital subscriptions and increased digital advertising revenue. The strategy and execution are expected to achieve $435 million of recurring sustainable digital revenue by 2026 and with our second quarter results, we're nearly halfway there. Digital-only subscription revenue over the last 12 months totaled $32.9 million, nearly at our year-end target 6 months early. Amplified Digital, our full-service digital marketing solutions agency fueled that growth with revenue of $19 million in the quarter, up 108%. As Kevin mentioned earlier, our second quarter growth in digital revenue has us on pace to achieve our full-year 2022 outlook for each of the digital revenues and digital-only subscriber metrics we have outlined."
