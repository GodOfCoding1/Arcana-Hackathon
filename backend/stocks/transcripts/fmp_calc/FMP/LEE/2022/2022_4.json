    "content": " Amplified Digital revenue grew 82% in the fourth quarter and 83% for the full year with revenue totaling $76 million for the fiscal year, pacing well ahead of other DMS solutions in the industry and our guidance. As a result of driving industry-leading digital growth, total digital revenue for the fiscal year was $240 million, up 27% compared to the prior year and accelerating from a 19% compound annual growth rate over the last 2 years. To reiterate Kevin's sentiment, we are pleased with our fourth quarter and full year results and the digital transformation at Lee as we exceeded expectations for digital revenue and digital subscriptions. In the fourth quarter, total operating revenue was $194 million, flat compared to the prior year as the growth and outperformance of our digital revenue streams offset the decline in our print revenue stream. Total digital revenue increased 31% in the fourth quarter to $65 million, driven by the rapid growth at Amplified and in Digital Only subscription revenue. Digital Only Subscription revenue increased 46% and totaled $11 million in the fourth quarter, driven by increases in digital subscribers and rates. Digital Advertising and Marketing Services revenue totaled $49 million in the quarter, a 33% increase over the prior year and represented 55% of our total advertising revenue in the quarter. Total print revenue was $129 million in the fourth quarter, an 11% decline compared to the same quarter a year ago due to continued secular declines in the demand for print. With the strong digital revenue guidance combined with continued reduction to our cost structure, we are guiding to a full year adjusted EBITDA of between $94 million and $100 million."
