    "content": " Sustainable long-term digital revenue growth from our Three Pillar initiatives will transform the mix of our revenue base, driving margin expansion and stronger free cash flow generation, which will fuel debt reduction, enhancing our balance sheet. On the advertising side, digital advertising revenue increased 12% compared to the first quarter last year, driven by a 45% growth in revenue at Amplified Digital. However, I couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be more proud of this team for their smart thinking, steadfast commitments toward our Three Pillar Digital Growth Strategy and the rapid execution of our plans to drive industry-leading digital revenue growth and a commitment towards achieving our adjusted EBITDA goals. In addition to driving industry-leading digital revenue growth, we are focused on maximizing the profitability of our legacy business and achieving our long-term leverage target. Decreases in cash costs were attributed to continued business transformation efforts, partially offset by strategic investments in digital talent and technology tied to our digital growth strategy, increased digital cost of goods sold and general rising prices. While we remain focused on operational excellence and reducing the cost structure of our legacy print business and growing profits, our main priority is to drive long-term sustainable digital revenue growth. As a reminder, our credit agreement with Berkshire Hathaway, our sole lender, has favorable terms that are incredibly important for us as we execute our strategy, as it allows us the ability to make the necessary investments in talent and technology that fuel our recurring sustainable digital revenue growth. To account for the current market conditions, we are widening the range of our total digital revenue guidance, lowering the midpoint of the range with expected growth between 13% and 19% year-over-year."
