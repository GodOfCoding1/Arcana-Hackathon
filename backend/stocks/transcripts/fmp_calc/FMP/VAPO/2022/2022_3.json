    "content": "  We expect revenue growth will be achieved through 5 levers, including: one, introducing higher clinical value products, such as the HVT2.0; 2, leveraging our 1H1D strategy to drive disposable turn rates to pre-COVID levels; 3, consistent disposable ASP uplifts; 4, expanding into new core care areas; and 5, our long-term product road map which will introduce additional high-growth products to our respiratory care offerings. First, we will drive 20% revenue growth by getting disposable turn rates back to historical levels by expanding usage in the 4 care areas in our gold accounts using 1H1D, educating all accounts on use with hypercapnia patients, expanding into shock and launching important new products like HVT2.0, especially into the general care floors."
