    "content": " In the first year post Precision Flow Plus launch, we replaced roughly 5% of the legacy Precision Flow installed base and expect similar results with HVT 2.0 in the pre-COVID install base as hospital capital budgets begin to normalize. While the onetime setup cost of our Mexico operations, which we expect to incur in the fourth quarter of 2022 will negatively impact our gross margin in the short term, they will set us up to better handle future fluctuations in customer demand and to achieve our long-term gross margin objective of 60% by 4Q 2023. Cash operating expenses, excluding impairment charges, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation expense, change in the value of contingent consideration and the impact of severance accruals were $21.7 million in 2Q 2022 versus $24.3 million in 1Q 2022. This compares to approximately $28 per hour here in the U.S. We continue to expect to reduce our inventory balance by more than 50% by mid-2023 as we return to historical inventory turns at 4 turns per year, which we were operating at pre-COVID. We now expect cash operating expenses, excluding impairment charges, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation expense, change in the value of contingent consideration and the impact of severance accruals in the range of $84 million to $86 million in 2022, a decrease from previous guidance of $86 million to $88 million. We expect to end 2022 with $15 million of cash plus another $15 million of excess inventory, which we expect to convert into cash by mid-2023 as we return our inventory turn rates to our pre-COVID level of 4 turns per year. In closing, we're going to go back to work and execute on our plan to drive 20% revenue growth, improve gross margins to 60% and normalize our cost structure to pre-COVID levels or sub-$18 million per quarter in 2023."
