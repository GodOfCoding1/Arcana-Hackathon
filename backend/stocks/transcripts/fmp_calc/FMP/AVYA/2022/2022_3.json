    "content": " Revenue contribution from CAPS, Cloud, Alliance Partner and Subscription, represented 53% of total revenue versus 40% a year ago, but in absolute dollars was down approximately $85 million sequentially primarily due to the reduction in Subscription point in time revenue that you heard Alan discuss. Third quarter non-GAAP operating income was $20 million, representing a non-GAAP operating margin of 3% versus 20% in the year ago period. Adjusted EBITDA was $54 million, representing an adjusted EBITDA margin of 9%, down from 24% last year due to the aforementioned revenue reductions, partially mitigated by the expense reductions previously announced in Q2."
