    "content": " However, a handful of deals impacted our in-quarter revenue recognition by approximately $40 million versus our model and versus Q2 guidance. For the second quarter of our fiscal 2022, revenue was $716 million, down 3% as reported and 2% in constant currency against the $738 million as reported in the year-ago period. Second quarter non-GAAP operating income was $115 million, representing a non-GAAP operating margin of 16%, down 400 basis points year-on-year. Adjusted EBITDA was $145 million, representing an adjusted EBITDA margin of 20%, down 370 basis points year-on-year, primarily due to the previously mentioned point-in-time revenue dynamics and lower product gross margins. For the third quarter of fiscal year 2022, we anticipate revenues of $685 million to $700 million, which at the midpoint represents a constant currency decline of about 4% or down 5% on an as-reported basis. For the third quarter, non-GAAP operating margin is expected to be between approximately 16% and 17%, and our adjusted EBITDA to be between $140 million and $150 million or between 20% and 21% of revenue. Due to the combination of the full year reduction in revenue and the rapidly accelerating shift to OneCloud and away from traditional CapEx license sales with cash is received over time versus primarily upfront, we are reducing our expectation for full year fiscal CFFO to be approximately negative 7% of total revenue. So we first and foremost, of the $60 million that we're attributing to the impact to our full year revenue guidance coming from the conflict in Ukraine, $45 million of it is coming out of Russia itself, and essentially, it's from customers, some of which are like SpareBank that have been sanctioned and we can no longer take revenue from those customers, we can't do business with them."
