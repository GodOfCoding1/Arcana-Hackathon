    "content": " Today, second quarter sales were lower than expected; sorry; total second quarter sales were lower than expected at $2.7 billion, although net flows of nearly $900 million continue to reflect our client's buy and hold long term approach to investing. This combined with higher Canadian segregated fund DAC amortization elevated operating expenses due to Salesforce leadership events and a normalization of operating leverage from the very strong levels last year, led to a 17% decline in pre-tax income to 59% -- $59 million for the quarter. As we look to third quarter, if markets remain where they are now, we expect asset-based net revenues to decline about $3 million and sales-based net revenues to decline about $10 million year-over-year. In our corporate and other distributed product segment, the $5 million year-over-year increase in pre-tax operating losses was driven by higher insurance and other operating expenses, as well as lower segment net investment income as the allocation to Term Life increased to support growth in that business."
