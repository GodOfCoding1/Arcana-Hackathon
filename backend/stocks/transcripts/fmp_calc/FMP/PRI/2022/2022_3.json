    "content": " We always have possibilities for improvements of our products in a shoot that we're always working or looking for an opportunity to make an adjustment, make change based on what we see in the marketplace or just point some friction that we've identified in our own system, but as we surveyed the market, a couple of years ago, we recognized there were a number of opportunities emerging and none of them are innovations that are unique to Primerica, but I believe what Primerica strength is, is combining innovations and creating a new set of innovations that's unique in the industry and it was a pretty long list of improvements."
