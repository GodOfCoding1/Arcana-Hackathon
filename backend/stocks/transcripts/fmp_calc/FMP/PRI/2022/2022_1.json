    "content": " Starting on Slide 3, adjusted operating revenues of $693 million, increased 9% year-over-year, as both our core Term Life Insurance and investment businesses, benefit from two-plus years of strong sales and robust equity market appreciation. Although we saw a decline in the number of issued policies compared to the first quarter of 2021, estimated average annualized issued premium per policy increased by 2% year-over-year and face amount in force ended the quarter at a record $910 billion. While second quarter sales volumes are expected to be down around 10% year-over-year, they should remain 4% or 5% above 2019\u2019s pre COVID levels. Consolidated insurance and other operating expenses on Slide 11, increased 23 million or 19% year-over-year, about $8 million of which was tied to the Senior Health segment that did not exist in the prior year period. Looking ahead, we expect second quarter insurance and other operating expenses to again be elevated, increasing about$ 25 million or 22% year-over-year. Mark, your line is open. Mark, your line is open."
