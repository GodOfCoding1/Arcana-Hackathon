    "content": " First, our luxury resort portfolio continues to outperform and help drive comparable  EBITDA of $59.4 million for the quarter, an increase of 26.9% versus the comparable quarter in 2019. Additionally, RevPAR for all hotels in the portfolio increased approximately 68% for the first quarter of 2022 compared to the first quarter of 2021, and our comparable portfolio RevPAR increased approximately 19% when compared to the first quarter of 2019. We believe this property is a great addition to our portfolio and are very excited about the prospects of this acquisition as the hotel's performance during the first quarter delivered comparable RevPAR of $1,725 with 56% occupancy and an ADR of $3,083. During the summer of last year, our team decided to re-categorize several room types in the premium rooms within the hotel, which contributed to the hotel's RevPAR outperformance of 27% relative to the first quarter of 2019."
