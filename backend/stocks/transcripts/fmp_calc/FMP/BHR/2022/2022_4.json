    "content": " Good morning, and welcome to today's call to review results for Braemar Hotels & Resorts for the fourth quarter and full-year 2022 and to update you on recent development. First, as we've been anticipating, our urban hotels continue to ramp-up strongly, with comparable hotel EBITDA growth of 195% in the fourth quarter over the prior-year quarter. Additionally, RevPAR for all hotels in the portfolio increased approximately 8% for the fourth quarter of 2022 compared to the fourth quarter of 2021, which also represents an increase of approximately 20% when compared to the fourth quarter of 2019. We continue to be encouraged with the continued ramp-up of our urban hotels, which generated $11 million of comparable hotel EBITDA in the fourth quarter. Looking at our three most recent acquisitions, the Four Seasons Resort Scottsdale Troon North, Ritz-Carlton Reserve Dorado Beach and Mr. C Beverly Hills, all are performing nicely and produced solid operating performance during the fourth quarter. Adjusted EBITDAre for the quarter was $39.2 million, which reflected a growth rate of 33% over the prior-year quarter and which was 54% higher than what we reported in the fourth quarter of 2019."
