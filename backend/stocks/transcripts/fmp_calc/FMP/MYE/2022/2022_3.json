    "content": " On an organic basis, excluding the incremental $19.4 million of net sales from the Trilogy and Mohawk rubber acquisitions, our revenue grew 4%. As I mentioned, we experienced another quarter of strong revenue growth driven by sales increases across both of our operating segments, with net sales for the company of $228.1 million, up 14% compared to the third quarter of 2021. As Mike mentioned on Slide 4, our net sales were up $28 million or 14% compared to the third quarter of 2021, driven by strong sales in both the Material Handling and Distribution segments. Adjusted gross profit increased $17.5 million or 32%, primarily driven by pricing actions and incremental contributions from the Mohawk Rubber and Trilogy acquisitions and partially offset by a change in sales mix and lower volume. Adjusted operating income increased $9.5 million or nearly 76% compared to the prior year, driven by the higher gross profit, partially offset by higher SG&A expenses. Excluding the incremental $2.9 million of sales from the Trilogy Plastics acquisitions, organic net sales increased 2%. Adjusted operating income increased $9 million or 59% to $24 million, driven by ongoing benefits from strategic pricing actions and operations excellence initiatives. Excluding the incremental $16.6 million of net sales from the Mohawk Rubber acquisition, organic net sales increased 11% due to favorable volume and price. Given our solid execution in the first three quarters of 2022, we are reiterating our 2022 sales outlook with sales growth anticipated to be in the high-teens range, with approximately 45% of the increase due to the acquisitions of Trilogy Plastics and Mohawk Rubber."
