    "content": " We had sales of $225 million, up 29% compared with the first quarter of 2021, which, in part, was due to stronger-than-expected seed demand, healthy demand in most of our end markets and incremental revenues from the acquisition of Trilogy Plastics. Given the strength of our results in the first quarter, along with the additional pricing actions we've taken, we now anticipate our net sales to increase in the low to mid-double-digit range versus our previous outlook of a high single to low double-digit range."
