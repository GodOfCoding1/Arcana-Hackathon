    "content": " Adjusted gross profit increased 36% or $20 million, primarily driven by pricing actions and benefits from the Trilogy Plastics and Mohawk Rubber acquisitions. Adjusted operating income increased $8.5 million or over 56% driven by higher gross profit, partially offset by increased SG&A expenses. Adjusted SG&A as a percentage of sales increased to 22% in the second quarter, compared to 21.3% in the prior year, primarily as a result of inflationary impacts. Material handling's adjusted operating income increased $11 million, or 65% to $28 million, primarily driven by the continued benefits of our ongoing strategic pricing actions. Excluding the incremental $6 million of net sales from the Mohawk Rubber acquisition that we completed at the beginning of June, organic net sales increased 8% primarily driven by pricing actions. The increase in working capital was primarily a result of the Trilogy Plastics and Mohawk Rubber acquisitions, the effects of inflation, higher accounts receivable balances driven by higher sales and an increase in inventory levels to mitigate supply chain disruptions and to better serve our customers. If I can squeeze in two more before I pass the reins here, on the SG&A front $52 million obviously reflects only a partial period for Mohawk, you know, would 55 million be kind of like a good run rate estimate for SG&A going forward or if it's easier, you know, in terms of percent of revenues SG&A was up 100 basis points, I think it was to 22.4%?"
