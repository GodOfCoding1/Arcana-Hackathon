    "content": " Our fourth quarter net sales were up $13.3 million or 6.6%, compared to the fourth quarter of 2021, primarily due to incremental sales from the Mohawk Rubber acquisition and our Distribution segment. Fourth quarter adjusted operating income increased $4 million or 32.2%, compared to the prior year as a result of higher gross profit, partially offset by higher SG&A. These pillars provide the framework for successful execution of our strategy, and I'd like to take a few minutes to walk through our progress on slide 11. we achieved 10% organic growth during 2022, due to strong demand in select end markets throughout the year, as well as benefits from previously announced strategic pricing actions. Lance, your line is now open. Lance, your line is now open. But Mike, look, there's no question, you've done a great job over the course of the year, really, since you arrived at Myers, but it certainly feels like you ended the year on rather a low note with really no organic sales growth in the forecast for 2023. And then related question, if we think about Horizon 2 of your strategy, getting to $2 billion of sales over the next few years, I think -- and this -- please correct me if I'm wrong, but I think you had initially talked about that growth roughly in terms of two-thirds from M&A and one-third organic."
