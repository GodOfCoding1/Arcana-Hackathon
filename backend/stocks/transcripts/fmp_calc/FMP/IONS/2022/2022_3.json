    "content": " With 8 positive key data readouts so far this year, our rich Phase III pipeline is poised to expand the 2 new Phase III starts expected in the first half of next year. And based on all our pipeline progress, we're well positioned to continue delivering a steady cadence of Phase III data readouts in 2023, 2024, 2025 and beyond. Importantly, based on our current rate of enrollment and the added power from additional patients, we remain on track to report data in the first half of 2025. and our broad clinical program supporting the larger severe high triglycerides or SHTG, indication also continues to progress well. Next year, we're looking forward to more key catalysts, including the potential approval of tofersen in the first half of the year, both 66-week data from the NEURO-TTRansform study of eplontersen the potential FDA approval of eplontersen later in the year, Phase III data from olosarsen and FCS patients, along with the initiation of 2 new Phase III programs among other important advances. As Richard said, melecarson delivers on that based on a very significant large Phase II study, which we are suing the same patient population, the same Phase III dose, but also there's now emerging data, published data indicating that if you go too low on Lp(a), you can also close some problems. As you said, of course, if you look at the epidemiology data, the risk is different for certain types of patients with regard to outcomes and that's what we're trying to maximize here, of course, bringing in more hereditary patients, fewer patients who are on tafamidis therapy and obviously patients at later stages of their cardiomyopathic compression is going to be a priority, and that's what we're trying to do with the remainder of enrolled population."
