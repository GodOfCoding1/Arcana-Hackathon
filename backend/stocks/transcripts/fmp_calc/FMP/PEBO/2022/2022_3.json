    "content": " Our return on average stockholders equity grew 31 basis points to 12.92%, while return on average assets increased 5 basis points to 1.45% compared to the linked quarter. Our allowance for credit losses comprised 1.15% of total loans at quarter end compared to 1.14% at June 30, 2022 and 1.43% at year-end. Excluding PPP loans, our loan balances increased by over $35 million or 4% annualized compared to the linked quarter end. Leading the growth this quarter was our consumer indirect loans, which were up $29 million or 21% annualized. Our nonperforming loans also declined compared to the linked quarter end due to reductions in our non-accrual loans of nearly $2 million, which were partially offset by increases in loans 90-plus days past due and accruing. For the third quarter, our net interest income grew 9% compared to the linked quarter and our net interest margin expanded to 4.17%, up 33 basis points from the linked quarter. Accretion income, net of amortization expense from acquisitions declined to $2.8 million, compared to $3.9 million for the linked quarter, adding 16 basis points and 25 basis points respectively to net interest margin. Compared to the prior year quarter, net interest income grew 57% and net interest margin expanded 67 basis points. Our net interest income and margin grew 55% and 40 basis points respectively through the first nine months of 2022, compared to 2021. Our reported efficiency ratio improved to 57.2% for the third quarter, compared to 58.8% for the linked quarter and 94.7% for the prior year quarter. Our professional fees declined $3.6 million, compared to the third quarter of 2021, which had been driven by acquisition-related expenses last year."
