    "content": " Adjusted EBITDA for fiscal 2022 was $111.2 million, an increase of 23% compared to last year. Cash provided by operating activities, net of acquisitions was $16.5 million for the 12 months ended September 30, 2022 compared to $48.5 million for the same period last year. But the $75 million to $100 million would be our -- continue to be our estimate of acquisitions because with Blue Water, we're actually losing some revenue with the quarry that we traded, but we're picking up more revenue in Tennessee. Please proceed with your questions. Please proceed with your questions. Please proceed with your questions. And as we talked about Jule's mentioned, the first six months of the year, most of that increase came out of our profit, and that suppressed our margins as we began to bid that in our later work and most of the work that we're carrying into 2023, we got that built in. Please proceed with your questions. But the strong demand we're seeing in other private work in our markets, we don't see that shifting back to, I'd say, our long-term average is 70:30, but we really -- we've been a little bit closer to the 65 or even below that in some periods, especially 2020 and a little bit in '21 when North Carolina was not letting any public work, but not a huge shift. Please proceed with your questions. Just if I look at it over the last five years or so, you're forward 12 month revenue to backlog average somewhere around, call it, 1.4x, and the guidance for this year represents something quite a bit below that, just based on where your backlog was at end of September. Brent, just to add to that, we have -- historically, if you go back for 20 years, typically, what we have on backlog that we're going to complete in the next 12 months would represent between 60%, at the most 65% of our next 12 months' revenue."
