    "content": " In the first quarter, Construction Partners achieved a record quarterly revenue of $285 million, a 49% increase compared to the same quarter last year. Adjusted EBITDA in the first quarter was $26.4 million, up 12% compared to the same quarter last year. 09:13 Gross profit was $33 million, an increase in 7.7% compared to the same quarter last year. 09:56 Adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter fiscal 2022 was $26.4 million, up 12.2% compared to the first quarter last year. 15:16 Well, Josh, we are focused on gross margins and when you look out year-over-year, compared to the first quarter of 2020 where we had some real tailwinds, from oil and energy dropping so much, this year was exact opposite. I mean, typically what we see, a little bit in our first quarter because it's usually a drop off from our fourth quarter is little bit more positive cash flow, but I guess the good news was, you know our revenue actually grew between our fourth quarter of last year and the first quarter, but certainly as the revenue, as Jule said, kind of balances out in that second quarter, we should see a much more positive cash flow. 36:43 The second quarter is going to still be dealing with some of the jobs that we weren't able to get into the   a year ago, versus the nine months ago, when we bid those jobs, we didn't have some of the contingencies that are in bids now, so we're working through the lower contract margin jobs."
