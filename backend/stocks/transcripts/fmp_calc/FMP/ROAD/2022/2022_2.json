    "content": " Maybe discuss how much of the backlog that's going to be burned in the second half is new backlog that recognizes this would be kind of one way to frame that answer, but other things that you could add would be helpful, I think. But as you know, in the spring time in summer, we do a lot of book and burn work that we were able to book in the winter and the pricing acceleration that we've seen this fiscal year and this winter, we think is going to really help our second half of the year and start to show up in the results. To Jule's point, last year, we started off the first two quarter is pretty good, but we kind of faded in the last two quarters, last year because we were beginning to hit those inflationary costs, and they were beginning to impact what should have been the best half of our year and muted that a lot."
