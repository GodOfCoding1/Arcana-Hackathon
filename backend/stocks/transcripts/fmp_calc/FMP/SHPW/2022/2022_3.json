    "content": " All forward-looking statements, including without limitation, statements regarding our business strategy, future financial and operating performance, projected financial results for the fourth quarter of 2022, expected growth, impact of recent acquisitions, new offerings, market opportunity and plans for compliance with the NYSE\u00e2\u0080\u0099s continued listing standards are based upon current estimates and assumptions. When we think about auto, we're still in the very early stages of this rollout with that being said, I think we've seen \u00e2\u0080\u0093 we've been able to monetize quite a bit of customer base through series of features, and there's a lot of additional customers that we have access to based off of the acquisition that we did with the MFG customer base. We expect to exceed over $1.5 million in revenue this year, coming from the different features on the auto platform will also achieve over 500 customers \u00e2\u0080\u0093 active customers paying customers on the platform by the end of the year. And so there's a \u00e2\u0080\u0093 I would say right now that because of the MFG acquisition and the MakerOS acquisition, we're really focused on unifying the platform and rolling out those features to drive customer acquisition and retention. I think what we've seen so far is quite a bit of qualification orders, right, where you go through the first article inspection, you go through qualification, you become certified supplier, and there has been a handful of customers, unfortunately we haven't been able to talk about those customers yet because of confidentiality, but they are similar, they are using additive manufacturing for the value that it really does create."
