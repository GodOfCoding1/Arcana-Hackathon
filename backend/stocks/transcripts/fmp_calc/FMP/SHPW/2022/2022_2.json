    "content": " Our forward-looking statements, including without limitation statements regarding our business strategy, future financial and operating performance, projected financial results for the third quarter of 2022, expected growth, impact of recent acquisitions, new offerings and market opportunity are based upon current estimates and various assumptions. In the second quarter, we continue to make tangible progress on each of our four key growth initiatives, which include: one, the expansion of our additive manufacturing capabilities; two, executing a comprehensive go-to-market strategy; three, expanding our manufacturing service offering to include more traditional manufacturing processes; and four, commercializing our software. We're encouraged by our growing pipeline and the positive feedback we are hearing from prospective customers, while the sales cycle associated with this type of enterprise customer is longer than our historic self-service business, we expect to accelerate these sales over time given our strong business development team and the compelling value proposition we offer our target verticals. And then, I guess, excluding the new customer pipeline, I want to tie this question back to your overall strategy because presumably, you've got core customers as it is that have some sort of wallet spend, you're getting some of that today, but now you're broadening your offering, you've got software, you've got \u00e2\u0080\u0093 you've got traditional processes, you're broadening additive."
