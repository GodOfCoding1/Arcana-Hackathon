    "content": "  For the quarter ended March 31, 2022, total revenue was RMB 204 billion, an increase of 9% that was primarily driven by the revenue growth of China commerce segment by 8% to RMB 140 million; local consumer services segment by 29% to RMB 10 billion; in Cloud segment by 12% to RMB 19 billion. International commerce segment adjusted EBITA losses was a loss of RMB 2.6 billion in March quarter, losses slightly increased the year-over-year, mainly driven by Trendyol\u2019s investments in new businesses, such as international businesses and local consumer services in Turkey, partly offset by continued profit growth of Alibaba.com, narrowed losses of AliExpress and narrowed losses of Lazada through optimization of OpEx and logistics cost. Revenue from Cainiao after inter-segment elimination was RMB 11.6 billion in March quarter, an increase of 16% year-over-year, primarily contributed by the increase in revenue from consumer logistics services as a result of service upgrade for enhancing consumer experience, partly offset by the decrease in international orders that was mainly impacted by the supply chain and logistics disruptions for parcels entering the Eurozone due to the Russia and Ukraine conflict."
