    "content": " During the September quarter, we have continued to improve operating performance of our loss making businesses by enhancing operating efficiency and optimizing costs that resulted in 29% year-over-year increase in adjusted EBITA to RMB36.2 billion. Our Local Consumer Service segment revenue in September quarter grew 21% to RMB 13 billion, primarily driven by strong revenue growth of Amap as well as higher average order value and more efficient use of subsidies that were contra-revenue of Ele.me. Revenue from Cainiao after inter-segment elimination, grew 36% year-over-year to RMB 13.4 billion, primarily contributed by the increase in revenue from domestic consumer logistics services as a result of service model upgrade since later 2021 to enhance customer experience and also the international fulfillment solution services revenue increased. Revenue from our Cloud segment after interest segment elimination was RMB 20.8 billion in September quarter, an increase of 4%, mainly driven by healthy public cloud growth, partially offset by declining hybrid cloud revenue, as we continue to drive high-quality recurring revenue growth. Revenue from our digital media entertainment segment in September quarter was RMB 8.4 billion, an increase of 4%, primarily due to the increase in revenue from Alibaba Pictures, Youku, which was partly offset by a decrease in online games business revenue."
