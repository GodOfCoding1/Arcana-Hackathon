    "content": " Ele.me's unit economics turned positive this quarter, mainly due to increased average order value, as well as its ongoing focus in optimizing user acquisitions spending and reducing delivery costs per order. Cost of revenue ratio increased to 62% in June quarter, primarily due to firstly, higher proportion of our direct sales business, such as Freshippo and Tmall Supermarket, as well as growth in Alibaba Health direct sales businesses that resulted in increased the cost of inventory as a percentage of revenue. Ele.me's unit economics per order turned positive for the quarter, driven by increased average order value year-over-year, as well as its ongoing focus on optimizing user acquisition spending and reducing delivery cost per order. Revenue from Cainiao after intersegment elimination was RMB12.1 billion in June quarter, an increase of 5% year-over-year, primarily contributed by increase in revenue from consumer logistics service as a result of service upgrades to enhance consumer experience, partly offset by the decrease in international orders for AliExpress. Year-over-year revenue growth of our cloud segment reflected recovering growth of overall non-internet industries driven by financial services, public services, and telecommunication industries, partly offset by a decline in revenue from the top internet customer and online education customer, as well as softening demand from other customers in the China's internet industry. Revenue from our digital medium and entertainment segment in June quarter was RMB7.2 billion, a decrease of 10% year-over-year, primarily due to decrease in revenues from Alibaba pictures, Youku and other entertainment businesses."
