    "content": " Today we reported first quarter 2022 revenue of $41 million, which was 166% versus first quarter 2021, revenue came in 29% above the high end of our guidance range for the quarter. But before I begin, remember that we closed the AlsoEnergy acquisition on February 1, saw results only include February and March financial results from AlsoEnergy for Q1, we reported revenue of $41 million, which was 166% increase versus the $15 million in the first quarter of 2021. Non-GAAP gross margin was $6.4 million, up from $2 million or 45% increase in the first quarter of last year due to higher revenues and the increased mix of software and services revenue. Our contracted AUM on the storage side of the business grew from 1.1 gigawatt hours in the first quarter of 2021 to 1.8 gigawatt hours in the first quarter of 2022, that's a 64% year-over-year increase and again driven by our strong execution on the sales and operating side of the business. On the revenue side, particularly the $41 million this quarter is $9 million, or 29% above the high-end of our guide, but we are well positioned across all of our metrics for a successful year. Wrapping up on Slide 14, with our key takeaways for this quarter's performance, we closed the first quarter of 2022 with strong performance and exceptional momentum, positioning us to achieve the full-year financial metrics driven by customer and market diversity."
