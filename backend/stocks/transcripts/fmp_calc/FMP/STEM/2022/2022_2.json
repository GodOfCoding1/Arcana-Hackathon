    "content": " Turning to Slide 4, today we reported strong second quarter 2022 results, including record revenue of $67 million, which was nearly 2.5 times higher than our second quarter 2021. As John mentioned, we reported record revenue of $67 million, which was a 246% increase versus the $19 million in the second quarter of 2021. Non-GAAP gross margin was $11.3 million up from $1.5 million or a 665% increase in the second quarter last year, due to higher revenues and an increased mix of software and services revenue. Our contracted AUM on the storage side grew from 1.2 gigawatt hours in the second quarter of 2021 to 2.1 gigawatt hours in the second quarter of 2022, that's a 75% year-over-year increase again, driven by our strong execution on sales and operations side of the business. As John mentioned earlier, we are raising our guidance for bookings and CAR for the full year 2022 and we are affirming our guidance for revenue in the range of $350 million to $425 million, non GAAP gross margin in the range of 15% to 20% and adjusted EBITDA in the range of a negative $20 million to $60 million. So I think much like we've talked about in prior quarters, the FTM segment of the business is growing very rapidly and that's where we're seeing -- we continue to see the most momentum there, although we are starting to see some initial -- see on the FTM side, some initial opportunities and on the AE side, as we come out of the AC any competitive component with the government. We're really excited about it as well as we mentioned $226 million, that's 50% quarter over quarter growth and 400% year-over-year."
