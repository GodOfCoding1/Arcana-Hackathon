Record pipeline continued to see strong momentum, bookings up 115% year-over-year, gross margin was flat quarter-over-quarter impacted by greater Front of the Meter hardware mix, and AlsoEnergy underperformance to plan. Non- GAAP gross margin was $12.4 million, up from $5.2 million or a 139% increase in the third quarter last year due to higher revenues and an increased mix of software and services revenue. Finally, on slide 15, we are reaffirming our guidance for revenue in the range of $350 million to $425 million for the full-year, non- GAAP gross margin of 15% to 20%, and adjusted EBITDA in the range of negative $20 million to negative $60 million.
