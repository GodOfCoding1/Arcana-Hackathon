    "content": " We continue to make progress executing our LotteryLink and B2C strategic growth initiatives, produced strong year-over-year growth and generated positive adjusted EBITDA and ended the first quarter with a strong balance sheet. This program contributed to revenue growth with the sale of LotteryLink credit to our master affiliate, which it uses for promotional activities while adding new users on the Lottery.com platform with limited or no marketing spend. While we are currently generating most of our lottery games revenue from the sale of LotteryLink credit, I want to reiterate that LotteryLink is ultimately and primarily designed to drive new referred users to our B2C platform and to drive the sale of more game sales through our B2C platform by both new and returning users. Since the beginning of 2022, we have added new ability to LotteryLink, including existing data customers, which are primarily digital publishers and which we anticipate will generate increased revenue and profitability as a LotteryLink affiliate than they would fully as a data customer. By adding new master and subject the lease to the LotteryLink programs we gained access to their sizable customer base and through promotional programs, we can cost-effectively convert these consumers into Lottery.com users."
