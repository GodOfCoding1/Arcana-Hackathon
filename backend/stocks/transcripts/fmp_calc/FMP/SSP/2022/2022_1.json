    "content": " Once again, in the first quarter Scripps delivered a terrific financial performance, outstanding results in Local Media coming as a result of Scripps\u2019 commitment to new business development and better than expected retransmission revenue. Turning to the Scripps Networks division, revenue for the first quarter of 2022 was $239 million, up 8.5% from the prior year on an adjusted combined basis. We are leading a group of local broadcasters informing a political CTV consortium, nearly $2 billion of the $9 billion in projected election spending this year is expected to go to connected TV and we\u2019re making it easy for agencies to access local broadcasters CTV inventory. So, we\u2019re \u2013 I would say, looking ahead, we\u2019re really focused on third quarter with hopefully lot \u2013 coming back on lots and paired with some outlook of improvement that we\u2019re seeing in the early days of May that we\u2019re really optimistic and confident in our growth trajectory. While the networks generates its revenue and the national ad marketplace, like the other cable network portfolios, we\u2019re sort of uniquely positioned to take advantage of the growth of over the year, which they, for the most part don\u2019t have access to. We continue to have terrific scale and local broadcast that takes advantage of the growing dual revenue streams, of course, including the upside with retrans, but the networks is something we laid on top of our local broadcast business, and it\u2019s a growth story and it\u2019s a strong growth story in the national ad marketplace."
