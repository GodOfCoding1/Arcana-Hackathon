    "content": " And yes, you can have your cake and eat it too, because while investors and Scripps will profit from the disruptions, we will continue to maximize the significant opportunity we have in pay TV, especially given that we will renew 75% of our local broadcast subscriber households next year. Revenue for the third quarter of 2022 was $235 million, up 4% from the prior year quarter due to connected TV and general market advertising performance. Scripps Networks delivered Q3 revenue results today that beat our guidance coming in at 4% above last year\u00e2\u0080\u0099s third quarter, despite the macroeconomic challenges to the national ad marketplace. So from a net retrans perspective, I think the messaging is pretty much in line with what we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve said the last couple of calls that when you look at this year, based on the cadence of pay TV renewals and affiliate renewals, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to see net retrans from a margin perspective, a little bit of a headwind, but dollars that are pretty flat. I also think third quarter DR was light for the quarter, made up for it with political dollars as well as general market advertising and CTV revenue \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and so our approach to selling our portfolio is not changing. I think if I kind of take your political revenues that you mentioned as of today and trended out some retrans coming to a core growth of down 12% year-over-year in 4Q, which would obviously be similar to what you just did in 3Q. And I would guess I would just also add that I think we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re starting to feel like the biggest pressure from supply chain is behind us because not only do we see automotive now gaining momentum, but other categories or subcategories that last year were held back by supply chain issues, like appliances, hot tubs, all of the categories are up."
