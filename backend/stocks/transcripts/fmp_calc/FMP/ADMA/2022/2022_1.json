    "content": " Additionally, included in the first quarter\u2019s net loss, are $1.3 million of non-operational charges related to the ongoing and progressing strategic review process attributable to professional fees, which of course are not a reflection of the improving underlying business operating and margin trends. Further, as a result of our continued commercial execution and resulting revenue growth realized during the first quarter of 2022, we have already achieved the required revenue milestone under the Hayfin credit agreement to access the additional $25 million second tranche of non-dilutive funds from Hayfin at our discretion. On a pro forma basis, the company's total liquidity stands at greater than $120 million, which includes current cash on hand at the end of the first quarter, of approximately $70 million, accounts receivable of approximately $26 million, and access to an additional $25 million, and non-dilutive funds from Hayfin. It may fluctuate from time-to-time, quarter-to-quarter, maybe modestly go up a little bit as we look to exceed the $250 million to $300 million in revenue, but we really think that the largest \u2013 previously the largest single use of cash utilization was inventory and we've built that inventory balance to a very well-funded number."
