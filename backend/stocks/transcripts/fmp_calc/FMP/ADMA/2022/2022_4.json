    "content": " Further, the persistence of encouraging business trends since the start of 2023 gives us confidence in our ability to exceed $210 million in full year 2023 total revenues as well as achieve first-time EBITDA profitability no later than the second half of 2023. Excluding the impact of selling this lower-margin legacy BIVIGAM product, ADMA's estimated fourth quarter 2022 corporate gross margins would have been approximately 200 to 300 basis points higher compared to reported results. Maybe just when we think about the $210 million and just the progress here, the prepared remarks, press release, you talk about just continued uptake of both ASCENIV and BIVIGAM but that you're adding new prescribers and patients, the reutilization rate for patients is sticky."
