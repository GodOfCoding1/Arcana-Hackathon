    "content": " Revenues for the quarter were $99.8 million, and our adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations was a negative $14.6 million. Without the Renewables segment losses, our adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter is 9.9% of revenues. Electric Power revenues were $36.7 million, and adjusted EBITDA was $6.1 million for the third quarter of 2022. In the third quarter, we did experience a reduction in segment revenues for a several-week period due to the summer as customers deferred electric distribution maintenance on critical areas of the Electric Power grid during a period of record high temperatures and elevated load on the electric power system. Without the losses sustained in the Renewables segment, adjusted EBITDA would have been $6 million or an adjusted EBITDA margin of 9.9%. In the third quarter of 2022, the Electric Power segment had a slight decrease in revenues to $36.7 million compared to $41.3 million in the second quarter of 2022. Over the same period, the Telecommunications segment increased revenues to $24.1 million, with adjusted EBITDA of $4.5 million or 18.7% as compared to revenues of $20.4 million and adjusted EBITDA of $2.7 million or 13.2% of revenues in the second quarter of 2022. Total backlog was $472.3 million at the end of the third quarter of 2022, a 4.6% decrease from the second quarter of this year. As it relates to the Electric Power segment, we believe 2022 revenues will range between $155 million to $160 million with adjusted EBITDA margins to be in excess of 20%. In our Telecommunications segment, we expect revenues in the range of $85 million to $90 million with adjusted EBITDA margin expectations for this segment in the mid-teens."
