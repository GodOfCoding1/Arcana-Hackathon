    "content": " As Gail discussed, Arcosa has performed well both in the third quarter and on a year-to-date basis, benefiting from positive fundamentals in our infrastructure driven businesses, particularly construction products, and utility structures, while effectively managing the cyclicality in our wind barge and rail component businesses. Your line is open. I think everything you see around the Utility Structures business is favorable, not only favorable, Julio I would say any forecast you see in the industry trends point to an industry that's good, but it's getting better all the time. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. For the fourth quarter, as we slowdown wind to stay open, let's say, for next year, I think the wind industry, the wind tower is going to weigh more on the margins on the business in the very short-term until we start getting, let's say, more volume to the wind tower business. Your line is open. Your line is open."
