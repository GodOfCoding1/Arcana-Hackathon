    "content": " Less our growth businesses, construction products and engineered structures, our quarter delivered strong first quarter results with adjusted EBITDA growth of 30% outpacing revenue growth. Even so, based on our strong start to the year, we\u2019re raising the midpoint of our 2022 full year adjusted EBITDA guidance and now expect annual growth in the range of 2% to 8%. First quarter order volumes were significantly higher compared to last year\u2019s trough levels, and this business should continue to benefit from improved operating leverage throughout the year. Your line is open. Your line is open. As I said in my comments, we did see our expected \u2013 we did see our first quarter construction margin lower than the prior year, but we do expect, and that is a seasonal slow quarter for us, as and we would expect to see margins, particularly in the seasonally stronger second and third quarter accelerate, and we do anticipate higher margins for the segment year-over-year on a full year basis. I think since we bought StonePoint, it creates noise because it\u2019s a lower-margin business even there, there \u2013 business conditions in the regions where they are, especially the first quarter. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Based on where the market has been, I guess, I\u2019d say, first and foremost, it really depends on what\u2019s going on in the market and \u2013 if we think back a few years, it\u2019s been, I would say the complexion of our backlog was largely tank, and it was really the liquid side of things that pulled us out of the last downturn. I think it\u2019s \u2013 I think the last comment that Gail made is, these are interesting businesses because they are driven by conditions that are unique to each one of the markets of the barges. Your line is open."
