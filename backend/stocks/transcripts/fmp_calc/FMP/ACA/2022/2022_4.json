    "content": " Excluding storage tanks, fourth quarter consolidated adjusted EBITDA increased 13% from prior year period outpacing revenue growth and driving a 50 basis point improvement in margins. On a positive note, adjusted segment EBITDA increased and margins expanded to 11.4%, representing the segment's highest quarterly margin in two years. So, on the business, I think the businesses that are ramping up that have come from very low cyclical times rail components barge and a little bit of wind this year, it's going to be tougher because we're just getting started. So, I would say, the positive news is that both on barge and wind, these orders provide a floor, let's say, a consistent production trend for the company that allows us to then modulate our ramp-up as we see fit, depending on the backlog we generate through the year."
