    "content": " Qorvo's revenue for the fiscal year 2022 first quarter was $1.110 billion, $30 million above the midpoint of our guidance and $323 million or 41% higher than last year. Infrastructure and Defense Products revenue of $274 million was down year-over-year due to especially strong infrastructure demand during the June 2020 quarter, but the segment was up sequentially as Wi-Fi and programmable power management growth continued and infrastructure growth resumed. Qorvo revenue of $1.250 billion at the midpoint is up 13% sequentially, 18% year-over-year and approximately 27% year-over-year adjusting for last year's 14-week quarter. So I think that the biggest thing that's changed me over the five or six-year period you're referring to is how much like their phones are becoming like the true flagships of the world, implementing the latest features and sometimes ahead of the bigger guys, if you will because they're fast, they've got a portfolio that turns over, they're shipping all over the world."
