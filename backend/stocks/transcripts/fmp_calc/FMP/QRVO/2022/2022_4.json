    "content": " As connectivity and electrification trends accelerate and product performance requirements increase, we're expanding our growth opportunities through technology leadership, portfolio management, sustained productivity, reduced capital intensity and broadening market and customer exposure. We get a combined view from our customers what products they're planning to ramp and of course, when we're looking at our total revenue, we're looking across all of our customers, not just our China customer base and looking at timing of handset ramps and where we expect the impacts to be and how we expect them to kind of deteriorate and be less meaningful in certain ramps than others. But I think really what's exciting about that business for us is that when you combine those two and you add the module capability that we have in station market where we can integrate all this technology into kind of a small form factor, higher performance solution, that's really the end game of where we're going with this business."
