    "content": " Lastly, because Qorvo\u2019s smartphone portfolio includes cellular RF, ATP mix, Wi-Fi in emerging categories like ultra wideband and MEMS based sensors, Qorvo can participate broadly across OEMs, product tiers and chipset providers. Qorvo\u2019s revenue for the fiscal year 2022 third quarter was $1.114 billion, $9 million above the midpoint of our guidance. Cash flow from operations in the third quarter was at $117 million, reflecting payments associated with the long-term supply agreement discussed on last quarter\u2019s call. As mentioned last quarter, looking at the business by end market highlights Qorvo\u2019s growth potential over the next several years. So yes, looking forward, we\u2019re really pleased with the 606 launch and a lot of content that we talked about last quarter beginning across integrated modules and tenant control, but also, of course, UWB. It\u2019s elevated for a number of reasons, including build heads for ramps that you\u2019re seeing now and sustained volumes and flagship and also content gains in flagship and mass tier and the increases in IDP and there are other demand factors such as supply/demand alignment in China as some share shifts there. What do you \u2013 given that one quarter with the burn rates going on, what you see now when do you think you\u2019ll get more back to a normal inventory level and your shipments into China will start reflecting really sellout versus what we\u2019ve seen so far, which is just we will take everything they can get. And I think you\u2019ll see us kind of starting out in flagship and expanding towards \u2013 excuse me, starting out in more mass here and expanding towards flagship as the year progresses with heavy BAW content but also \u2013 the power management aspect is also very, very significant and antenna tuning, which we\u2019ve always been quite strong that will continue to be strong and then Wi-Fi, as we\u2019ve been mentioning, the chip-on-board trend."
