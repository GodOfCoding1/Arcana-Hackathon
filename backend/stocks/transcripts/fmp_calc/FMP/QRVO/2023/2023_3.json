Hello, everyone, and welcome to Qorvo\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Fiscal 2023 Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. We encourage you to review the safe harbor statement contained in the earnings release published today as well as the risk factors associated with our business in our annual report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC, because these risk factors may affect our operations and financial results. In today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s release and on today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s call, we provide both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results. During our call, our comments and comparisons to income statement items will be based primarily on non-GAAP results. For a complete reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures, please refer to our earnings release issued earlier today available on our Investor Relations website at ir.qorvo.com under Financial Releases. Joining us today are Bob Bruggeworth, President and CEO; and Grant Brown, Chief Financial Officer; Dave Fullwood, Senior Vice President of Sales and Marketing and other members of Qorvo\u00e2\u0080\u0099s management team. Thanks, Doug, and welcome, everyone, to our call. In High-Performance Analog, quarterly revenue reflected year-over-year growth in defense, broadband and power. In our Connectivity & Sensors Group, the quarter reflected lower end market demand and channel inventory consumption for Wi-Fi products partially offset by strength in automotive. Design activity was strong across customers and products, including ultra-wideband, matter and sensors. Use cases continue to proliferate their benefit from precision location, indoor navigation, seamless connectivity and enhanced human machine interfaces. Lastly, in Advanced Cellular, Qorvo participated broadly across customers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 portfolios. The macro environment weighed on overall smartphone volumes across customers, and revenue reflected channel inventory consumption within the Android ecosystem. Now, let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s turn to some quarterly highlights. In High-Performance Analog, Qorvo began sampling a radar power solution that combines a high-voltage power conversion PMIC and silicon carbide power switches to control a GaN RF power amplifier. In aerospace, we delivered a multichip solution that includes Qorvo\u00e2\u0080\u0099s high-frequency BAW filter as well as a GaN PA for low orbit satellites and other applications. The solution supports cellular satellite links, and we have secured new designs. That means rather than one jet, there will also be many drones; rather than one geo-satellite, there will also be many LEO satellites. At the same time, new capabilities are being added to existing platforms that require increased semiconductor content and higher density and more advanced packaging, all areas where Qorvo is strong and is investing to advance the technology. In cellular infrastructure, we commenced preproduction shipments of our first integrated PA modules, or PAMs, to a Tier 1 European infrastructure OEM for 5G massive-MIMO base stations. We also began sampling our next-generation PAM, which delivers market-leading efficiency for 5G massive-MIMO installations to the leading European infrastructure OEMs. For broadband infrastructure applications, we sampled a CATV power doubler amplifier that maintains linearity and extends bandwidth to enable higher throughput DOCSIS 4.0 capabilities with industry-leading power efficiency. In CSG, we expanded our Wi-Fi content at a Korean-based smartphone OEM to include Wi-Fi 6E and Wi-Fi 7 designs and we ramped Wi-Fi 7 FEMs for access points and routers for our smart home ecosystem customer. There is increase in customer interest related to multi-link operation, which is a key attribute of Wi-Fi 7 and enables higher throughput and lower latency. Lastly, we began volume shipments of MEMS-based sensors, enabling an enhanced HMI experience and true wireless stereo earbuds. Design activity for sensors continues to be strong across markets, including automotive. In Advanced Cellular, we secured multiple design wins across Android OEMs in support of 2023 devices. During the quarter, we commenced the production ramp of multiple components for the leading Korea-based smartphone OEM\u00e2\u0080\u0099s flagship platform. At a U.S.-based Android OEM, we were selected to supply multiple solutions, including ultra-wideband, antenna tuning and BAW-based antennaplexing in support of their 2023 smartphone launches. Lastly, Qorvo was recognized by multiple customers. We were presented with Honor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 2022 Golden Supplier Award, and we received quality awards from Vivo for discrete switches and amplifiers and highly integrated solutions. Before handing the call off to Grant, I want to make a few high-level comments to frame our outlook, both in the near term and further out. At our largest two customers, we are very confident in our ability to grow year-over-year content, and that includes this year. In 2023, we expect growth in BAW-based content as well as other content growth. Equally important, we enjoy a range of opportunities across all of our customers in the future years. In particular, we see expanding market for our BAW technology. Productivity gains in our Richardson, Texas fab have enabled a doubling of our BAW output. And in CSG, we expect growth in the strong double digits. Key growth areas supported by recent wins with silicon carbide devices in EVs and solar inverters, MEMS sensors and notebook track pads and automotive smart interiors and ultra wideband in automotive and Android devices. In the near term, the team is performing exceptionally well while navigating extraordinary events. Factory loadings have been reduced, and we are bringing down channel inventories. We are working to accelerate revenue related to our Omnia BAW-based biosensors by exploring options for the associated Omnia test hardware, meaning the Omnia desktop test unit and cartridges that contain our BAW biosensors. The technology has been proven commercially, and we are engaged with a diverse set of customers. Qorvo remains at the forefront of connectivity, sustainability and electrification. We enjoy exceptional customer relationships, and we are a key enabler of future architectures. These architectures continue to favor higher levels of performance, integration and functional density to deliver the successive improvements in each market\u00e2\u0080\u0099s next-generation products. Our customers value Qorvo\u00e2\u0080\u0099s best-in-class products and technologies, and we are securing broad-based design wins in high-growth markets. As volumes recover, we are positioned to deliver long-term growth and robust free cash flow. As a reminder, our references today will be to our three operating segments: High-Performance Analog, or HPA; Connectivity & Sensors Group, or CSG; and Advanced Cellular Group, or ACG. In our upcoming 10-Q, we will provide historical financial information that reflects these operating segments. Revenue for the third quarter of fiscal 2023 was $743 million, $18 million above the midpoint of our guidance. We enjoyed relatively strong performance in automotive, broadband, defense and silicon carbide power devices. However, elevated channel inventories and weak end market demand pressured revenue and order activity across all three operating segments. In HPA, growth in areas such as defense and silicon carbide power devices was offset by inventory consumption in the 5G base station market and softness in consumer-facing markets like SSDs and battery-powered tools. Finally, ACG revenue of $491 million compares to revenue of $775 million in the same quarter last year. On a non-GAAP basis, gross margin in the quarter was 40.9%. Non-GAAP operating expenses in the quarter were $206 million, $90 million lower than our guidance and down $8 million versus last year due to OpEx discipline, the timing of product development spend and lower employee-related expenses including incentive-based compensation. In total, non-GAAP operating income in the quarter was $99 million or 13% of sales. ACG was 20%, HPA was 19% and CSG was negative 32%. Non-GAAP net income was $77 million, representing diluted earnings per share of $0.75, which was at the high end of our guidance range. Capital expenditures were $34 million, and we repurchased approximately $200 million worth of shares during the quarter. The rate and pace of our repurchases is based on our long-term outlook, low leverage, alternative uses of cash and other factors. As of quarter end, we had approximately $2 billion of debt outstanding with no near-term maturities and $919 million of cash and equivalents. We expect quarterly revenue between $600 million and $640 million, non-GAAP gross margin of approximately 41% and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share in the range of $0.10 to $0.15. For historical reference, the March quarter revenue in fiscal \u00e2\u0080\u009822 for each of ACG, HPA and CSG was $777 million, $211 million and $179 million, respectively. At the volume levels assumed in our guidance, we expect Qorvo\u00e2\u0080\u0099s inventory position will decline in March, but remain elevated. In terms of channel inventory, the picture has begun to improve. For example, total channel inventory for our components in the Android ecosystem was reduced by over 20% in the December quarter. And in doing so, we expect production levels to remain compressed. We project non-GAAP operating expenses in the March quarter will be up approximately $20 million sequentially due to the timing of product development spend, seasonal payroll effects and other employee-related expenses. Below the operating income line, non-operating expense will be approximately $15 million, reflecting interest paid on our fixed rate debt, offset by interest income earned on our cash balances, FX gains or losses, along with other items. With regards to operations, I want to highlight the outstanding progress our teams have made in terms of productivity gains. We continue to make improvements in product development, filter design, process engineering, factory planning, manufacturing efficiency and many other areas. Today, these gains have significantly increased our effective BAW capacity. And looking forward, we can double our BAW capacity in the Richardson facility versus our current maximum theoretical thresholds today. Increasing a throughput of an existing asset not only reduces cost, but can reduce complexity within the factory network as production is consolidated. The BAW productivity gains in our Richardson facility allow us to achieve our long-term growth goals across all of our customers, including the most demanding BAW-based placements. For reference, the site has been incurring approximately $12 million of non-GAAP COGS per year. The Omnia platform, which is based on our BAW sensor technology, has demonstrated significant promise as a diagnostic testing solution. While the revenue impact from a transaction would be negligible, it would reduce total expenses by approximately $32 million per year. At this stage, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s too early to comment on the eventual outcome, timing or potential valuation. Our long-term outlook is positive, and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re well-positioned to weather current macroeconomic challenges. Product performance requirements continue to increase in our end markets, sustainability initiatives underscore the increasing global reliance on power efficiency, and connectivity and electrification trends are accelerating worldwide. We have diversified our opportunities across markets, customers and product categories while maintaining our commitment to technology leadership, portfolio management, productivity gains and reduced capital intensity. At this time, please open the line for questions. You gave really good color on channel inventory, but I was hoping to ask a follow-up there. So, channel inventory as it relates to Android, I think you said, was down more than 20% in the December quarter. So first, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not going to comment on the iOS side of the inventories. I think when we look at the overall channel inventories and when we refer to channel inventories, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re talking about all of our components that are out, whether they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re in our distributors or at the end customers. And so, on balance, overall, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s down about 20% across the entire business, not just within the Android ecosystem. If you look just within our distribution channel, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s down about a third in the December quarter. But as Grant mentioned, we still have a ways to go in there. And then, as my follow-up on gross margins, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re guiding the March quarter to, I guess, 40, 41%, which is essentially flat sequentially. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll touch on margins here, and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll try to cover all of it, both in Q3 and then looking beyond that into fiscal \u00e2\u0080\u009824. For fiscal \u00e2\u0080\u009823, the primary driver of gross margin continued to be under utilization and inventory-related charges. In Q3, it accounted for about 920 basis points of headwind or in that neighborhood, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s expected to remain there in the March quarter, hence the flat gross margin guidance. Inflation across direct costs were approximately 80 basis points in Q3 and again, expected to remain there in Q4. As we stated earlier, in Q3, there was a supplier quality issue representing approximately 30 basis points of headwind in our Q3 period. So kind of walking through that pareto, you can see the dominant factor is clearly underutilization. To your question about getting back to 50%, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s unlikely in fiscal \u00e2\u0080\u009824, although it depends on your view of the macro economy and a number of other variables. And so, as volumes fall, those inventory balances will reflect higher per unit costs. So, we saw this heading into the December quarter, and it will carry forward into fiscal \u00e2\u0080\u009824. The rate at which that high-cost inventory flows through the P&L will obviously depend on variables like our future utilization or product mix including a ramp of revenue over the course of fiscal \u00e2\u0080\u009824, but -- although the precise timing is uncertain, the reduction in channel inventories is very encouraging, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a necessary first step. If I do look out over the course of fiscal \u00e2\u0080\u009824, I could see potentially that 920 basis points of margin get cut in half, again, subject to your view of the revenue trajectory throughout the year. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m just trying to have a better understanding of what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s occurring, I guess, in the legacy IDP segment, which appears driven by some maybe some inventory overhang within Wi-Fi, IoT and maybe telecom infrastructure. So, let me start with our view of the segments in the March quarter. If we go back to kind of comparing our current March guide to our thoughts last November, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a bit of variance in HPA and CSG. Instead of flattish, there will be rather modest declines there in dollar terms for our guide. If you consider the size of our largest customer relative to ACG revenues in December and that customer, excuse me, is seasonally down in March and June, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a sizable headwind, and that really dictates the path of our top line. In terms of our China-based smartphone OEM revenue, it came in largely in line, just a bit above 10%. I guess, just -- maybe just to follow up on that with regard to the China Android OEMs. And I guess, to the extent you could talk about the recovery process or how you see the recovery process for the balance of the year, I guess the question I would like to understand is, given some of the new -- the opportunity in premium-tier Android flagships you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve announced this -- today, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s certainly great to hear. But I guess, if you could discuss the level of confidence you have in demand returning for mid-tier handsets, the balance of the year, would be super helpful because I ask because two very large Korean memory OEMs this week indicated the smartphone market could bifurcate between good demand for flagships, you have weaker demand for lower mid-tier models. And so if you could just kind of comment on, I suppose, the production approach and your design approach for those markets, if they do bifurcate, it would be very helpful. Let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s -- if I decompose it, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll start and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll let Dave tackle the different tiers of handset models. In terms of revenue, as we look forward into the guide, we would expect our China-based smartphone OEMs in dollar terms to be roughly flat but overall, our Android revenue to be up. And then as we look maybe deeper into fiscal \u00e2\u0080\u009824, without going into too much detail or attempting to guide at this point given the overwhelming impact of macroeconomic factors, I can shape it a bit for you and provide some of the drivers. In terms of revenue beyond the March quarter, we would expect June to be roughly flattish. It could be a bit higher, a bit lower depending on your view of the economy or China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s reopening. From there, I would expect September to see significant sequential growth and then December and the March 2024 quarters to be back to strong annual growth from there. So, as Bob mentioned in his remarks as well, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re seeing really nice content growth in the premium tier. So, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re well represented there. And of course, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve always been well represented in the mass tier year as well, 5G. So the rate and pace of that may not be as quickly as we would have liked, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s still a lot in front of us. As you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll remember, we restructured the agreement last quarter to better align our view of demand with supply and are working with that partner on an ongoing basis. First off, it sounds like the competitive environment, especially in China and maybe in Samsung is getting much more difficult. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve gotten lots of feedback of BackSan  being a major competitor in switches, fielding high-band modules, competing in ultra-wideband, which wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t the case two years ago. I think what is overriding everything is the highly integrated modules that require premium filter performance, particularly for those that are being exported as well as for -- within the China consumer market. So, we still feel very good about our position there with our integrated modules, whether it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ultra high-band. What we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re doing, obviously, with mid-high as well as the work that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve done, improved significantly the performance and cost in our SAW filters for low pads. And from a pricing perspective, we haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t seen significant changes there, Ed. In some areas, yes, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a little bit of competition, but we always have that. So, we haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really seen a change in the market. And then on that same note about increasing, it sounds like the MEMS business is -- you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been working on MEMs forever and now they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re showing up. And the ASPs, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re looking to fuel them as tuners and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve tracked that business pretty closely from the time, but it sounds like you might be seeing a significant increase in ASPs to the extent that you want the -- industry starts adopting MEMs. And maybe if I could flip that over, it sounds like since Samsung organize the handset division, now that you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re using open market modules, the actual -- content in ASP for those modules seems to have dropped significantly, whether it be the mid-high band or the low band. And I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m just talking about the flagship, of course, because the master is a big step-up going to modules. As far as MEMs goes, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re still very early on in that, Ed. As far as the RF MEMs go, as you know, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been working on that through the acquisition of Cavendish Kinetics and really just beginning to roll that out. And then second, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re also -- our pressure sensor MEMs, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re doing extremely well there. So people are starting to implement and track pads across -- all of the major OEMs are now looking at it, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re engaged with them. So, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s very early on also in its life cycle. And while the architectures are similar, especially that particular customer that you mentioned, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re still very demanding from a performance standpoint. So, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re very focused on that. So, I wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think of it necessarily as a standard product. On the first one, gross margin and then how your balance sheet inventory affects that over time. So, you mentioned gross margin, I think, 41% for March, and June sales are flattish. So, it suggests gross margin somewhere in the mid-40s in the back half. As that inventory begins to get sold and flow through cost of goods sold, it will drag with it those higher costs per unit associated with underutilization. So, I would expect the inventories to trend down over time, subject to normal seasonal ramps at large customers where we do have to build inventory in advance of those sales. So over time, it will come down, again, offset by some of those growth-oriented builds that we do at seasonal periods of the year. Grant, the reason I asked the question is because I heard before on the call that you think channel inventory normalizes later in the calendar year. Although you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re correct, I think the first stage of that would be a reduction in the channel inventories, increase in order activity from our customers pulling through our inventory, along with, as I said, the offset and builds for large customer ramps, but they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re happening somewhat simultaneously, not perfectly sequentially. And then for my second question, you mentioned content gains at your top two customers. Part of the questions we can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t answer, but I will tell you that the -- it is both content and share gains at our largest customers -- our largest two customers. So these are like multiyear decisions or...\n Can be and some are, some aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t. Maybe I just want to start, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been kind of giving how large your largest customer or 10% customers are. So, our largest customer is a significant portion of ACG revenues, usually representing about two-thirds of that business, if not more, in certain periods. And then, our second largest customer, we haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t commented on, but it generally hovers around that 10% mark. And certainly, with some of the growth we expect there could be more. And then I guess, following up on Vivek\u00e2\u0080\u0099s question, just sort of trying to gauge the magnitude of these content wins you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re speaking to. You talked about being able to double capacity at Richardson, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m assuming you have given the pullback in Android, some excess capacity already. So, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m just kind of curious the time frame in terms of doubling that capacity if you have that on your horizon. I think just at the highest level, there isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t a BAW placement that we can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fully support at any customer. But the productivity gains, the overall die shrinks, the move from 6 to 8 inches, and then, of course, the successive generations of BAW filters that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re running through that factory lend themselves to a significant increase in capacity. So, as we look at Farmers Branch, the need for that, I guess, over time has been somewhat of a safety valve in case any of those initiatives didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t come to fruition. But given the success of the team there, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re able to support all the BAW-based processing we need out of our Richardson facility. I guess, I was going to ask you and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll swap the order because they kind of build on Blayne\u00e2\u0080\u0099s last question. I think one of your U.S. competitors has made a decent amount of progress on their BAW road map internally in the last couple of years, and it seems like some products might be a little bit closer to impacting sort of the market. So, any -- it sounds like you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re really confident in what comes in content gains to the last couple of answers that you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve given, but any competitive dynamic changes with your primary competitors on BAW. And to the earlier follow-on regarding the capacity at Richardson, that is something that we can do over time, not necessarily this year. But again, I just want to make sure that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s clear that we do have to take steps, add equipment, et cetera, in order to make that possible. It will be in the out years, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s really a comment around Farmers Branch and supporting the ability for us to do that in the future given our ability to sell the Farmers Branch facility. As my follow-up, obviously, given how big it is in the revenue, most of the focus of the call here has been on the mobile and smartphone markets. But I wanted to ask quickly on the wireless infrastructure side, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s some -- I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know if they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re correlated, but similar inventory dynamics that are happening. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen inventory build up there, and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s certainly been impactful to our infrastructure business. And it will take some time, we think, for that to bleed off throughout the year. So, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s probably similar, but may even take longer than what we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll see in mobile. I just wanted to break down the commentary about September and December and March, if I could. And then December and March being up year-over-year, obviously, December and March of -- December of 2022 and March of 2023 are relatively easy compares in terms of the revenue. So, just kind of thoughts around December and March would be helpful. So, as we look into September, again, I would just reiterate, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not providing any official guidance into fiscal \u00e2\u0080\u009824, but we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re attempting to shape it just a bit given some of the macroeconomic uncertainty. And obviously, the macroeconomic situation will inevitably dictate the trajectory of revenue. But just looking at some of the drivers that we see seasonally, there is a significant ramp in the September quarter, so. And as Bob stated, we feel as though we are well represented on large platforms across all of our largest customers. So, continued strength at some of those customers as the channel inventories be in clearing will occur as well as a large seasonal ramp gets to a sequential increase in September that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pretty substantial off of a rather low base as we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re talking about a roughly flattish June. So, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the primary driver, call it around September. And then into December and March, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re right, the comps get relatively easy. But with the channel inventory picture clearing up by the end of the calendar year, as we talked about earlier, it should provide for a restocking, if you will, or us selling into potentially demand even at just recurring to normalized levels. Obviously, calendar \u00e2\u0080\u009822 was kind of a horrific year in terms of units. Are the forecasts relatively conservative off that very challenging 2022, are some OEMs more aggressive in their forecast plans. So, the customer sentiment and their forecast is very cautious. First few weeks of January were promising, but we need to see a couple of months of that. So right now, the purchase order patterns, their forecasts remain very cautious through the rest of the calendar year. So, we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t guide specifically to the balance sheet or cash flow, but I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll try to give a little bit of color on the drivers. So, having now collected on sales in prior quarters, our cash flow will likely start to follow the path of the P&L, obviously. As we look forward, we still expect to generate free cash flow, and CapEx should be in the 5% to 7% range of sales, representing discipline there and some reduced CapEx intensity as we move forward, having invested in our facilities over the prior years, and looking forward, will be largely capacity driven as we see demand and obviously, improvements in our performance and technology required. But generally speaking, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d be looking for the cash flow to follow P&L. For the non-handset part of the business, I guess what I heard is some of the infrastructure products that there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s still some inventory to burn off. Is this a situation where this is a little bit slower to come back as compared to the cellular business, or what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the view of that -- those businesses as you proceed through the year. So, the infrastructure business is probably going to be slower to recover. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got Wi-Fi, a lot of that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s consumer-facing. That is probably very similar to what we see in the smartphone space, but some of that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also more operator and enterprise-driven. And so, we saw that occur a little bit later. And then our power management business as well, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s very consumer-facing with power tools and solid-state drives and other types of devices like that that are more consumer-oriented. So, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll go probably very similar to the way the smartphone market goes. Certainly, from a year-over-year standpoint, the comps are relatively easy and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s with a high degree of confidence, we believe we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be able to grow. The degree to which would determine whether it was sequential or not, I think it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a bit premature to comment on. Overall, we still are encouraged by fiscal \u00e2\u0080\u009824 and believe that it will be above fiscal \u00e2\u0080\u009823. Your revenues came down for the guidance for March, but your margins are kind of hanging in there. You mentioned a couple of things, small things, the 80 basis points and 30 basis points issues. I think, generally speaking, if I look back over the productivity gains that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve made over multiple years, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re still seeing those in our margins today, even though the volumes aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t in the factories. And actually, with some of the capacity freeing up, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not seeing the increases that I know we saw some of that earlier last year, last calendar year, earlier in the year, so we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not seeing it. In some cases, to your point, we have been able to pass that on to our customers. And again, as we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve always said, pricing set by the competition, if we all raise prices, we all get an increase; we all don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t, we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get an increase. But as Grant pointed out, the inflation is impacting us in our COGS, about 80 bps. So we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not able to pass it all along, but there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s other inflation in there, not just foundry parts. Well, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re talking about total smartphone inventories, but even some of the other markets that we mentioned earlier in one of the previous questions. We see elevated inventories, not just in smartphones, we see it in a lot of the other markets as well. Like I said, January -- early indications in January or it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s improving. If that continues through February, March and into calendar Q2, then, of course, our inventory is going to be burned off much more quickly. And I think when we -- I know when we file our Q, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll see why I say that. But we haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t given any of that revenue out yet, but we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re very pleased with it. I just had one question, Grant. But in the handset side, you should be able to kind of quantify and tell us, all right, at the peak, it was x weeks, x months and here we are, and then we think if there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s some kind of normal pattern, this is what normal level looks like. I think that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a great question, Ambrish. The issue always is when you look at your days of inventory in the channel, you have to understand what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the sell-out. And so far, and I think I said this last quarter as well, when we work with our customers and we go through all the math, they reduce their production, we reduce ours. Now again, Dave\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mentioned a couple of times on the call, the first three weeks so far in January, at least we can speak to the data that we get, and I think all of you get, the actual sell-out is up, and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a good sign. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s why I think we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re being careful on our comments around June, but we feel very good about September. So, we roughly think it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s in that time frame. So handset inventory cleaned out by September and the rest, as you said, others will take longer. Well, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got different parts of the business. In the Wi-Fi area, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to follow because we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re in a lot of the Android phones with our Wi-Fi products, it will follow more of what I said for the handsets. Then Wi-Fi that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s in some of the retail and some of the industrial applications, things like that, that may take a little bit longer. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a smaller part of our market, not as much data is published. But I think on the infrastructure side, what Dave talked about, that is going to take a little bit longer. The area of our power management that goes into the SSDs, and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a call on the PC market. But the major part of our business is the handsets, as you know."
