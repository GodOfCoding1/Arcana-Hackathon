    "content": " Based on the continuing customer adoption of all our solutions and our momentum in Elastic Cloud, we expect to achieve $2 billion in revenue in fiscal year \u201825, within the next three years, while also continuing to grow our operating margin over time. For example, we recently announced an expanded collaboration with AWS to accelerate momentum and build market and deliver seamless access for shared customers to Elastic Cloud on AWS, while leveraging AWS\u2019 global footprint and breadth of services. In light of the secular tailwinds that benefit our business, the high value we provide to our customers, our continued success with Elastic Cloud adoption and our track record of strong execution across all aspects of our business, we are confident that we can drive profitable growth over a multiyear period. Within subscriptions, revenue from Elastic Cloud was again strong at $87.7 million, growing 71% year-over-year or 72% in constant currency, driven by customer growth and usage. What I heard when I was meeting with customers like SWIFT and ING and so on, fundamentally, the use cases that we are primarily used for, whether it\u2019s security, whether it\u2019s observability, even certain aspects of Enterprise Search when you\u2019re dealing with Tier 1 applications, Security and Observability tend to be much more mission-critical, much more front and center of customers\u2019 minds."
