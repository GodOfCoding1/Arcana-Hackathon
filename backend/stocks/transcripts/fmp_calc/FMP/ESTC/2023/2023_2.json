    "content": " We continue to have confidence in our ability to build a generational company given: one, our market opportunity; two, the criticality of our solutions to our customers; third, our platform strategy, which is more relevant than ever before, giving customers increased desire for tool consolidation in the current environment; fourth, the execution by our team; and finally, our strong fundamentals. The second thing that we saw in October, which is sort of the last month of our quarter, as you know, in certain international geographies where we had seen the dollar tightening having the dollar increase having a significant impact on just the way customers are thinking about things, we saw customers going through more approval processes. In terms of our customer acquisition motions, we continue, as we have done over the past couple of quarters to focus on driving towards customers who have a greater propensity to spend over time with us, which has meant focusing on those customers that are above that 10,000 ACV threshold and focusing less on the long tail of smaller customers that might spend just a few hundred dollars a month, for example."
