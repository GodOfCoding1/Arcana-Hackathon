    "content": " I am incredibly proud of what the team delivered this quarter, as we launched new enhancements for Elastic Cloud that make it easy for our customers to search data anywhere from one platform. Based on the continuing customer adoption of our solutions and our momentum in Elastic Cloud, we remain confident of achieving our goal of $2 billion in revenue in fiscal year 2025, while also continuing to grow our operating margin over time. Within subscriptions, revenue from Elastic Cloud was again strong at $98 million, growing 59% year-over-year or 62% in constant currency, driven by customer growth and usage. With the continued strengthening of the US dollar, we expect currency movements to present a headwind to year-over-year total revenue growth of approximately 5% for the second quarter and approximately 4% for full fiscal 2023 or $10 million incremental headwind for the full year compared to our prior guidance. And recall, as we said the last time and Ash mentioned earlier, that our solutions just fundamentally address mission-critical use cases, and customers see a lot of value in the features in Elastic Cloud, like searchable snapshots and cross-cluster search and cross-cluster replication, which help drive cost down as well as increase operational efficiencies. And as that data is increasing, I can't stress enough the strength that we have and the tremendous differentiation that we have in our platform, in our technology, which means that even when customers are choosing to make decisions around what -- where they want to think about spending in different kinds of environments, we are seeing them continuing to choose Elastic. I've talked about the fact that the examples that I gave of customers like O2 Telef\u00c3\u00b3nica and others, you're seeing a lot of situations where customers are effectively leveraging Elastic for more and more use cases, whether it be starting from log analytics and going to all aspects of Observability or even crossing from Observability to security or vice versa. So what we said when we laid out that $2 billion number continues to be true even today, right, which is at its core, what's really behind that is the strength and resilience that we are seeing with our solutions, particularly on the Observability and Security side, where we are continuing to get used for mission-critical use cases, seeing great customer strength and penetration."
