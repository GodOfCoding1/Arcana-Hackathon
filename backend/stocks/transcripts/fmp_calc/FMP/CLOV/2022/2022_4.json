    "content": " We're proud of our full year Insurance MCR of 91.8%, which was better than our most recent 2022 guidance and is reflective of the continued improvement in core insurance operations and the value derived from Clover Assistant. The combination of our strong 2022 insurance results, our PPO plan being paid on 3.5 stars, and the ability to improve care through Clover Assistant positions us well for an even stronger 2023 where we are initially guiding to an Insurance MCR range of 89% to 91%. As Andrew mentioned, fourth quarter and full year 2022 financial results were highlighted by significantly favorable Insurance MCR performance and strong insurance revenue growth. In summary, we delivered strong insurance performance during both the fourth quarter and full year 2022, and are excited about the impact that our strategic emphasis on profitability for both lines of business will have on 2023 performance as we look to build upon the positive momentum from 2022."
