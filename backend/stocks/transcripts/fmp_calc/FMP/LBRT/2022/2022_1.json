The timing of those builds I'll leave more that to Michael, but for us it's never, well, this year we're going to build X and next year we're going to build Y, it's just engaged with our partners, engage with them and if we can find the right partner that wants the fleet, we can get the right length of commitment, structure of commitment, profitability, and balance sheet wise and investment-wise it makes sense, then we'll do it. It's interesting because obviously you're high quality fleets with the -- in the most demand during last year's, our preseason probably contracted it earlier than some of your lot of fleets. Just for what I think an incremental margin ought to be quarter to quarter if things are going well, call it roughly 35 to 45%, which would imply kind of 50 to 60 million of EBITDA would've been about right, which would say there was 20 to 30 million that kind of came from something else and I was just wondering if we think about it that way."
