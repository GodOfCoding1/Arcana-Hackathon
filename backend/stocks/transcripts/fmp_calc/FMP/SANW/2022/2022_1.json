And I just think that all the work that we have done as a management team is starting to really show in the form of better margins and our work in alfalfa in the Middle East with the market's coming back, our deal with Stevia, with Ingredion and more -- the most important thing in the short term, it's our Double Team trait, which is going to add significantly to the financial returns in 2022."
