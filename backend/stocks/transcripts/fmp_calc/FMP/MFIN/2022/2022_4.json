    "content": " In 2022, with the growth of our loan portfolio, we saw an increase of $32.6 million in our net interest income despite rising interest rate. A loan loss provision trended back towards its normalized level as we in our provision for the year of $30.1 million, which was $25.5 million greater than last year's historically low provision of $4.6 million. In 2022, Home Improvement continued to be our fastest-growing segment with 43% loan growth to $626 million. We also saw growth in our Marine and RV business, which had 23% loan growth to $1.2 billion of loans and our commercial segment had 21% loan growth to $93 million. The continued growth in our Home Improvement segment, the prime loans of which carry a lower coupon than our other lending segments as well as and, to a lesser extent, an increase in our average cost of funds. The increase over last year is a result of higher net charge-offs as we get back to a more normal level of charge-off experience, an increase in our loan loss allowance rates for the consumer loans, an 18 basis point increase for recreation loans and a 13 basis point increase for home improvement loans as well as the need for increased allowances specific to new loans as we grow our portfolios. Like I said before, it's -- to the extent that the provisioning is higher because of CECL with our growth, that's going to trickle down to the bottom line and that increase in equity isn't going to allow for excessive growth and growth at the levels that we've seen in the past couple of years."
