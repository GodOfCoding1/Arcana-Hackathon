    "content": " Net interest income of $42 million grew 8% from the second quarter and 23% from the previous year's quarter with the increase being directly attributable to loan growth and the high yields earned on our loans. The decrease in earnings from a year ago is attributable to the increased loan loss provision I referred to earlier, as well as the absence of a $2.7 million equity gain earned on a fintech investment in the prior year, offset by the 23% growth in our net interest income."
