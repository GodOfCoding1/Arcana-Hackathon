    "content": "  We ended the quarter with comparable sales up 3% compared to the third quarter of 2021, which was on top of strong comp net sales growth last year of 41%. Given our sales increase and the expense mitigation tactics we implemented as soon as we saw some of the macro pressures surface, we were able to hold our adjusted SG&A ratio relatively in line with last year at 25.5% of sales in the third quarter, compared to 25.1% of sales last year. If you think about the big things you accomplished this quarter of growing your top line by 3%, and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s on top of--remember, last year we grew our business by 41%, so there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not a lot of folks I see out there in our space that had those kind of results for the third quarter."
