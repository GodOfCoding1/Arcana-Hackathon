    "content": " This public offering garnered keen interest from biotech specialist investors, including Vivo Capital, RA Capital, TCGX, ECOR1, the Enterprise Associates and Healthcare Management We believe that Geron represents a strong investment opportunity for these and other investors due to our compelling Phase 2 data, the nearness of our lower risk MDS Phase 3 readout, the commercial opportunities of our potential indications and the strength of our internal capabilities and management team. Assuming positive top line results from IMerge Phase 3 trial these key milestones include submission of a U.S. new drug application or NDA in the first half of 2023, submission of a European marketing authorization application or MAA in the second half of 2023 and preparatory activities for a potential 2024 U.S. commercial launch of imetelstat and lower risk MDS. I'd like to remind everyone that the IMerge Phase 3 trial is designed to confirm the Phase 2 results, since the trials use the same patient population, dosing regimen of imetelstat primary and secondary endpoints and geographies for clinical sites with many of the same investigators. We believe that if the Phase 3 trial confirms similar steps for us, durability of confusion, dependence and safety, imetelstat could need significant needs for all patients with lower risk MDS who has failed or are refractory to ESA treatment."
