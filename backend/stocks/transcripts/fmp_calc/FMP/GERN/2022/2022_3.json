    "content": " On the G&A side, the increase expenses for the three and nine-month periods of 2022, compared to the same period in 2021, primarily reflects increased costs for commercial preparatory activities, higher personnel related expenses for additional headcount, and an accrual of approximately $7 million for our portion of the settlement for the class action lawsuit, which we expect will be paid in either shares of General common stock and or cash at our election, after final approval of the settlement by the court by the end of the first quarter of 2023."
