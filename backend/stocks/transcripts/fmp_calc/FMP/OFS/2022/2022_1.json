    "content": " As a percentage of fair value, approximately 97% of our loan portfolio was senior secured at the end of the first quarter, and is well diversified across multiple industries. We posted net investment income of $0.22 per share, and excluding the accrual of capital gains, incentive fee, our adjusted net investment income of $0.30 per share was strong and $0.02 above last quarter's distribution. As Bilal discussed earlier this morning, we announced a distribution of $0.29 per share, a 3.6% increase in the quarterly rate and the seventh consecutive increase. With three-month LIBOR now well above 1% and statements by the Fed and other central banks that rates will continue to rise, we anticipate a positive impact on our net investment income over the coming quarters, as we have over 90% of our loan portfolio floating rate loans, and the majority of our debt with fixed rate. At the end of the quarter we had 95 portfolio investments, totaling approximately $557 million on a fair value basis, with an average investment size of $5.9 million or approximately 1% of the portfolio's total fair value."
