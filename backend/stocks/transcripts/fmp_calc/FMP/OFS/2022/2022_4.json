    "content": " Due to the continued strength of our net investment income, the Board once again increased our quarterly distribution to $0.33 per share, which is up 10% from last quarter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s distribution of $0.30 per share and up 18% from the prior year period. Comparing net investment income quarter-over-quarter, we are up over 8%, in large part due to the rising interest rate environment coupled with the thoughtful construction of our balance sheet. As Bilal noted, despite the modest decline, year-end 2022 net asset value remains approximately 8% above its pre-pandemic level at the end of 2019. Credit trends in our portfolio remained relatively stable, although we did see some incremental spread widening in the quarter which led to some unrealized losses. Total expenses of $9.3 million were up from last quarter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s $9 million, primarily due to higher interest expense due to increasing interest rates on our variable rate credit facilities. In addition, at quarter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s end, 94% of the loan portfolio was floating rate and there has been a meaningful increase in benchmark interest rates. At the end of the quarter, we had 86 portfolio investments totaling approximately $501 million on a fair value basis with an average investment size of $5.8 million or approximately 1% of the portfolio\u00e2\u0080\u0099s total fair value."
