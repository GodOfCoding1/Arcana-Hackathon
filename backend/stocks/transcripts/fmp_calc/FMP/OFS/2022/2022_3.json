    "content": " Earlier this morning, we announced a distribution of $0.30 per share, an increase from the $0.29 per share from the prior quarter due to a stronger adjusted net investment income. Given this meaningful run-up in interest rates and the fact that 65% of our outstanding debt is fixed rate, we anticipate continued tailwinds on our net investment income for the fourth quarter and beyond. At the end of the quarter, we had 92 portfolio investments totaling approximately $517 million on a fair value basis with an average investment size of $5.6 million or approximately 1% of the portfolio's total fair value."
