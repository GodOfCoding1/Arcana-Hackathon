    "content": " As I mentioned earlier, net investment income was $0.47 per share for the second quarter and on an adjusted basis, it was $0.24 per share, after adding back the reversal of the non-cash capital gains fee accrual I just discussed. Given this meaningful run up in interest rates, and the fact that, 63% of our outstanding debt has a fixed interest rate, we anticipate a positive impact on our adjusted net investment income for the quarter ending September 30th."
