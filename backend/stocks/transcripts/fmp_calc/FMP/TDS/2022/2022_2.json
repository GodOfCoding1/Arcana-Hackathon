    "content": " Tower has also produced another strong quarter of double-digit revenue growth, up 13% and that's due principally to an 18% increase in the number of co-locators. Adjusted operating income increased 2% and adjusted EBITDA, which incorporates the earnings from our equity method investments along with interest and dividend income, decreased 2% largely due to decreases in earnings from our equity method investments, driven by higher network expenses in certain of the underlying operating businesses. On Slide 19 total operating revenues increased 2% year-over-year, largely driven by growth in residential revenues, which increased 5% across all markets. As we just mentioned, revenues increased 2% from the prior year as growth from our fiber expansion, an increase in broadband subscribers and average residential revenue per connection, exceeded the declines we experienced in our legacy business. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open."
