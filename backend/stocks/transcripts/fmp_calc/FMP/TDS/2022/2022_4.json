    "content": " So we ended the year at 64% of our postpaid handset customers in contract, and that's in comparison to 59% in June when we initially launched our new promotions, and that's significant because those in-contract customers churn at a much lower rate than out of contract customers. More specifically, excluding the impact of increased loss on equipment and bad debt expense, our remaining cash costs were down 2% year-over-year on a full year basis, and we think there's significant opportunities to reduce costs in 2023 and beyond. As expected, the increased cash expenses to support our growing fiber program resulted in a decline in adjusted EBITDA of 13% for the quarter and 6% for the full year. And that's a key priority and starts with growing our base of connections and that's a key motivator for implementing flat rate pricing and having a really compelling one in two line and up all the way to three, four line price point for our customers and to grow that base and yield service revenue growth over time. I mean if you were building a -- if you're going to go build a tower in rural America, and you were only going to subsidize that if you're only going to pay for that tower with fixed wireless customers, you need in the range of 200 to 250 customers within a 7-kilometer range of that tower, that's pretty dense for rural America. So I believe earlier this year at the investor conference, management mentioned that in 2023, U.S. Cellular and TDS Telecom will step up their collaboration efforts, including an MVNO relationship, you're selling each other's products, potentially applying for big funding or just broadly government funding together."
