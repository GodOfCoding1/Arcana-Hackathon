    "content": " As you can see on Slide 14, we continue to see steady growth in tower rental revenues, which increased by 10% from the prior year, driven by an increase in our tower tenancy rate. On Slide 21, total operating revenues increased 1% year-over-year, largely driven by growth in residential revenues, which increased 4% across all markets. So the -- let me start with low-band because we've actually driven substantive increases in gross adds year-over-year, 24% increase in gross adds year-over-year and that's also gone down to the net adds, and we've done most of that with our low-band product."
