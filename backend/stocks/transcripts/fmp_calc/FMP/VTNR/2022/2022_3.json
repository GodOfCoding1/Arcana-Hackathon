    "content": " Total production of finished high-value light products such as gasoline, diesel and jet fuel represented approximately 69% of total production versus 67% in the second quarter of 2022, reflecting the type of improved yield efficiency which we expect to continue in the fourth quarter following completion of the recent turnaround work. For the 3 months ended September 30th, 2022, Vertex reported net income attributable to common shareholders of $22.2 million or $0.28 per share on a fully diluted basis versus net income attributable to common shareholders of $7.9 million or $0.12 per share on a fully diluted basis in the third quarter of 2021. Additional factors impacting reported third-quarter financial results include a loss on an inventory intermediation agreement related to continued backwardation in the crude and product markets in the amount of $17.9 million, a gain on the change in derivative liability in the amount of $12.3 million related to the warrants associated with our outstanding convertible bonds and $2.9 million of expenses related to the Shell acquisition. The loss on our inventory intermediation agreement of $17.9 million is related to the continued backwardation in the crude and products market, similar to what we experienced in the second quarter of 2022, where the impact was $23.1 million, a 22% reduction quarter-over-quarter. Vertex had total net debt outstanding of $364 million at the end of the third quarter of 2022, including lease finance obligations of $45.4 million, implying a net debt to trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA ratio of 2.5x as of September 30th, 2022."
