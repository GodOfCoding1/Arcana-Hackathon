    "content": " Total production of finished high-value like products, such as gasoline, diesel and jet fuel represented approximately 74% of total fourth quarter production versus 69% in the third quarter of 2022, reflecting improved performance following the previously disclosed catalyst change in our distillate and reforming units. For the three months ended December 31, 2022, Vertex reported net income of $44.4 million or $0.56 per share on a fully diluted basis versus a net loss of $5.3 million or $0.09 per share on a fully diluted basis in the fourth quarter 2021. So my impression is that, this is a bit different from the initial hedges, you guys had in place sort of in prior quarters, where this is really more about the implicit commodity price exposure that it's almost sort of a working capital exposure you're buying the crude one day but those exact barrels of crude that you're buying you want to kind of lock in that margin when they go in the feeder and they go into the process."
