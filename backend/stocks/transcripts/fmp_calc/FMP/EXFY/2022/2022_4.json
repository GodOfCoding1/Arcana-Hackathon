    "content": " So if we want to talk about the money that we actually generated, it's -- that free cash flow number, the $26.3 million. Since the pandemic, we have seen the percentage of pay-per-use users as a percentage of all users increased substantially to about 35% of all users, which is higher than it's ever been, which has introduced a level of volatility in the revenue that we haven't seen before. So a lot of times, people they -- when they sign up, let's say they do 50 subscription and then a year or 2 years later, maybe they have another 50 pay-per-use use, and they just haven't thought about it since they originally signed up. And part of the dynamic here is also what Ryan touched on earlier, like, because the number or actual price is quite low, companies, as they keep growing don't really look at their bill or review their bill or review their total spend because it's actually materially not significant to their spend overall. I think it's -- I mean if we go into recession, recession is not good for anyone, but we -- I think we're better positioned than most, and we are profitable or cash flow positive, and we don't need to fundamentally change anything about our business model. The interchange fees, I've heard you say in the past that in 2023, you're talking about interchange fees of around $2 million a quarter, and then that's stepping up to around $5 million a quarter in 2024."
