Over the past couple of years, as you know, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been investing tremendously in products where everyone else is basically dumping cash into customer acquisition to get these thousands of customers which are worthless to them and then to ditch them, like we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve actually just been pocketing our profits and then investing in a substantially improved customer -- or product platform across the board. Maybe to build on that, I think that the -- it's a reflection of kind of the volatility and sort of sentiment of our customer base if they're like not willing to make an annual commitment."
