    "content": " First, on the launch of KORSUVA injection, we are making meaningful progress in the U.S. For the fourth quarter of 2022, net sales for KORSUVA injection were $2.3 million, translating into $1.1 million of profit recorded as revenue to us, and wholesaler shipments to dialysis clinics totaled approximately 21,000 vials. So, Fresenius -- over the first three quarters, Fresenius primarily took in 180,000 vials in Q3, and now they're -- obviously, a lot of clinics are starting to pull through that, burning through that inventory and utilizing that.
