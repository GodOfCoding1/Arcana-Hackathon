    "content": " Our fourth quarter revenue was $36 million, a 2% increase year-over-year, and our operating income for the quarter was $600,000 versus an operating loss of $3.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2021. With that, as Brent mentioned earlier, our fourth quarter revenue came in at $36.0 million, increasing $0.7 million from the $35.3 million recorded in the fourth quarter of 2021. Service revenue for the fourth quarter was $28.8 million, an increase of $1.8 million or 7% from $27.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2021. This increase was primarily due to a $3.0 million increase in mini-VSAT broadband airtime revenue, primarily offset by a $1.2 million decrease in our content service sales, which was largely due to the sale of our radio business in April of last year. As Brent noted, airtime revenue grew to $26.8 million or approximately 12% over the fourth quarter of 2021, and total subscribers reached almost 6,900. Product revenue for the fourth quarter was $7.2 million, a decrease of $1.1 million or 13% from the $8.2 million in the fourth quarter of the prior year. Operating expenses for the quarter were $12 million, down $3.6 million or 23% from the fourth quarter of 2021."
