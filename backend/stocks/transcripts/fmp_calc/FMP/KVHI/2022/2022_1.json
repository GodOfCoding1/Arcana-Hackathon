    "content": " New customer shipments of VSAT terminals were up 5%, and total mobile connectivity revenue was up more than $2.6 million versus Q1 last year. As Brent mentioned earlier, our first quarter revenue came in at $41.1 million, compared to $42.3 million recorded in the first quarter of last year. And this past quarter was quite light, with, as he said, $700,000 of revenue and, as a result, a drop from last year of the $4.5 million and also, as you can see, a drop in the total revenue year-over-year. Revenue from our inertial navigation segment decreased $3.8 million year-over-year, with gross margin decreasing 12 percentage points to 32%. Service revenue for the first quarter was $26.7 million, an increase of $2.9 million, or 12%, from $23.9 million in the first quarter of last year. As Brent noted, airtime revenue grew to $24.0 million, or approximately 12% over the first quarter of last year, despite a 1% decrease in active subscribers as a result of the shutdown of our legacy network on December 31, 2021. Product revenue for the first quarter was $14.4 million, a decrease of $4.1 million, or 22%, from $18.4 million in the first quarter of the prior year. For our other inertial nav products, combined FOG and OEM revenues increased by $0.8 million, or 13%, and revenue for our inertial nav service business was down by $0.1 million. Operating expenses for the quarter were $20.1 million, or $0.8 million up from the first quarter of last year. As such, on a recurring basis, this quarter was $0.6 million less than the first quarter of last year. Given the timing of the recent changes, the full impact of these changes won't be seen until Q3, and we expect the full year operating expenses to be between $5 million and $6 million less than 2021 on a recurring basis. At the operating income level, the changes in revenue, margins and operating expenses resulted in a loss from operations of $4.7 million, which was up $1.1 million compared with the $3.6 million loss recorded in the first quarter of 2021. Our mobile connectivity segment generated an operating profit of $1.3 million, compared with an operating loss of $0.4 million last year, while our inertial navigation segment had an operating loss of $0.5 million for the quarter, compared with an operating profit of $2.1 million last year. Our unallocated loss was $5.6 million, compared to last year's $5.3 million. For the first quarter, our net loss was $4.7 million, compared with a net loss of $4.0 million recorded in the same quarter last year. On a non-GAAP basis, which excludes amortization of intangibles, stock-based compensation and other nonrecurring costs, such as unusual nonoperating fees, foreign exchange transaction gains and losses, employee termination costs and CEO separation, related tax effects and changes in our valuation allowance and other tax adjustments, after all those adjustments we had a net loss of $1.0 million, compared with a net loss of $0.9 million last year. EPS for the first quarter was a net loss of $0.25 per share, compared with a net loss of $0.22 per share in the same period last year, and non-GAAP EPS loss for the first quarter was $0.05 per share, the same as last year. Our adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was a positive , compared with a positive $1.1 million in the first quarter of last year. Net cash used in operations was $3.5 million, compared to $5.0 million provided by operations in the first quarter of last year. Looking ahead, as we said in our earnings release, we continue to expect consolidated annual revenue growth between 2% and 5% and adjusted EBITDA to be between $11 million and $15 million, assuming that supply chain issues don't worsen."
