    "content": " I'm proud to report on another strong quarter result for the company and that the company remains well positioned to capitalize on recent commodity price tailwinds to include focused high-graded drilling in the core of the Northwest Stack and a continuation of our well reactivation, which will add incremental production this year. That approximate $26 million increase over the quarter was supported by production from our Well Reactivation program, as well as higher commodity prices and realization and net of approximately $5 million in pre-purchases of materials related to our 2022 capital program. We have also held LOE and expense workovers to approximately $10.9 million or $6.76 per Boe during the quarter, partially driven by an increase in workover activity associated with well reactivations and well repairs at higher commodity price. As I mentioned previously, we are pleased with the results in the first quarter and are positioned to capitalize on robust commodity prices with high rate of return drilling in the Northwest Stack, continued well reactivations and further strengthened cash from our already producing properties in Mid-Con. Modest production increases from Q1 2021 to Q1 2022 period in our mid-term position, expanded 2022 capital program of high return projects that further enhanced production and the rest decline, to include nine new wells hydrated in the core of Northwest Stack and continuation of our well reactivation program."
