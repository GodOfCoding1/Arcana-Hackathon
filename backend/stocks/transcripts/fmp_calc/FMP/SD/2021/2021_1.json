    "content": " From here forward, can you maybe talk a little bit about, other than, what well, I guess, with commodity prices, sort of at the centre of it more of an upside case scenario, in terms of what would encourage you to do get out -- get a little bit more aggressive in terms of spending and maybe talk a little bit about, what the next couple years would look like, if it turned out that we're in a temporary price spiked for oil and the script turns out to be more ready for gas than it looks like right now. In terms of the cash balance, this is really the first quarter, as Salah said, we had a significant step up roughly $8 million current net cash position and then as I mentioned, our Board is committed to increasing that cash and using our assets to maximize the shareholder value."
