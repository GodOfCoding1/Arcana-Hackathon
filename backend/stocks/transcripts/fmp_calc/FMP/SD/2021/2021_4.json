    "content": " As a result, we entered the year positioned to capitalize on robust commodity prices with high rate of return drilling in the Northwest Stack, continued well reactivations and further strengthened cash flow from our already producing properties in Mid-Con. As a result of this focus on the Mid-Con, the company was able to keep annual production relatively flat at 18.6% MBoe per day, despite no new drilling or completion activities, driven in part by the reactivation of over 129 wells throughout 2021. Our assets continue to yield significant free cash flow, which added $41 million of net cash included restricted cash this past quarter, now totaling nearly $140 million, net of debt paydown as of year-end 2021. As detailed on Page 14, the company has demonstrated and been the leader in efficiently converting EBITDA to free cash flow, given our low per BOE cost structure and light CapEx last year, as well as improved commodity prices and realizations. This strategy has 4 points: one, maximize the cash value in generation past of our incumbent Mid-Con PDP assets by, extending and flattening our production profile with high rate of return workover and well reactivations, initiating 9 well drilling program in the core of Northwest Stack to economically add production, continuously press on operating and administration costs. This substantial owned and integrated infrastructure provides the company both cost and strategic advantages, bolstering asset operating margins through reduced lifting costs as well as water handling and disposal costs, while derisking positive free cash flow down to $40 WTI and $2 Henry Hub. $140 million net cash and cash equivalent at year-end 2021, which represents net cash of $3.80 per share of our common stock issued and outstanding, flat production over the trailing 12 months with $11 million of invested capital."
