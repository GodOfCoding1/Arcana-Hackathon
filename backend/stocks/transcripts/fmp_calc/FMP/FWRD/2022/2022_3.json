    "content": " Please be aware that certain statements in the company's earnings press release announcement and on this conference call are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including statements, which are based on expectations, intentions and projections regarding the company's future performance, anticipated events or trends, and other matters that are not historical facts, including statements regarding our expected fourth quarter 2022 and fiscal year 2023. But we have had a very, very fortunate approach with our M&A team - Michael Hans, Karl Richter, Eric Walls, that entire team having long conversations, oftentimes over years, with family-owned and run businesses that at some point, will be ready to say, Take our legacy and bring it into a great professional home and please make sure that these people that we've known, those companies have known for three decades, that for as long as they want to go have a great home Forward Air. Now the one thing I would want to say is that for the performance enhancement we had this year and for the performance next year, it is helpful for us when we look at how good are we actually in each of our lines of business, particularly LTL. I do expect that the 5% level of outside brokered miles at highly cost-effective rates that our team is actually getting those outside miles for, is going to be a significant tailwind in the first part of next year."
