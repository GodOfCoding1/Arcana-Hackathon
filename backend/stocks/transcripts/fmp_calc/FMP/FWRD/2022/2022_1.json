    "content": " For those of you who are following us on a kind of quarter by quarter basis, you will see that as we put guidance out for second quarter of this year, as we put a target out for the full year of 2022, pulling forward to $6.30 from lag, from next year to this year, we did not build in the typical sequential build up from Q1 to Q2, or even from the first half to the second half, which in essence means for what we're driving for what we're controlling, there's still upside to what we put out there. One different way that I think put it, I put it a half an hour ago, if you said, let's take fuel all the way back to first quarter of last year's levels, and we just assume hypothetically that's the fuel level that we would have had in the first quarter of this year, we still would have exceeded the top end of our Q1 guidance. The second question is the one that I think Bascome, you are referring to across all of the commercial dimensions, the Chief Commercial Officer that also has marketing, communications, Sales Support under her or his kind of scope, there is where I'm going to spend a few weeks making very certain that I understand whether it's a heavy digital access bend, so that we can access some of the micro companies or whether it's more of the sales machine so that we have a kind of a Sales Machine expert on top off and tag teaming with the sales leaders. Extending the sales discussion at the presentation that you referenced a few weeks back, you put out some numbers basically suggesting that you were earning 10%, 15% better margins on this much smaller pie of SMB business that you're growing very quickly compared to your traditional 3PL business, that's the bulk of what you do in LTL."
