    "content": " We've been successful winning on average $25 million of new business per year in our hardware and protective business from 2021 to 2023 and as we look forward to 2024, we have $27 million of new business already awarded and it's only in February. During the second half of 2023, we expect to see adjusted EBITDA up compared to 2022 in the low 20% range, as our COGS reflect the new lower cost we are seeing today. Yeah Lee, I think as we've said, historically, and I've said it for a couple of quarters and kind of became a broken record that we didn't expect that, that business would have 17% EBITDA margins, given the mix of industrial business, but we do expect, as you think about 2023 and forward that should be a 10% to 12% EBITDA margin type business. As you think about the last couple of years, clearly PS become more expensive to build, just with all the inflation that we've seen across all categories, but we're working with and we'll continue to work with our retailers to make sure that our returns on those machines are appropriate and there's a lot of different ways we can work with our retailers. I don't think so, because as we think about the business, we probably -- we've historically said, we need about $10 million of growth cap -- to build working capital about $10 million a year in order to keep up with the growth in the business."
