    "content": " Given the lighter cash flow numbers for the remainder of the year are primarily due to the timing of inventory reductions moving into the first quarter of next year, we expect to invest less in the working capital during the first quarter of 2023 versus years past. On a sequential basis compared to the second quarter of 2022, adjusted margins compressed by 80 basis points due to the timing of the price increase in our traditional local hardware stores as inflation was not yet fully offset in this portion of the business and a pull forward of promotional activity in our PS business to the third quarter. So we actually -- Lee as you think about entering into the new contracts in May, as we go through the fourth quarter and into the first quarter, we're going to see some of the highest cost inventory we have just given the lag time. And as we said in our prepared remarks, we would expect some of that just given the timing and what we've paid versus what was happening in the second quarter of this year that we'll begin to see some of that benefit in the second quarter of 2023. And I think, Brian, the other thing to keep in mind, I mentioned it last quarter, but we haven't said anything about it this quarter is we have to balance making sure we've got these 25-year partner suppliers that we've been doing business with all the way back to Mick and Rick Hillman. And we're going to continue to make sure that we've got the right cost in the business to drive it forward, not spending in areas that don't provide benefit but spending in areas like Doug said, in the service organization, the sales organization to help fuel the growth that we see in the business."
