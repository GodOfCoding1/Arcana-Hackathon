And then as you think about margin, yes, it actually -- an incremental sale or incremental placement of a machine, while it does take six months to get a full run rate, those do incrementally hurt the full business as you think about a plus 30% EBITDA margin in RDS compared to the rest of the business kind of in a mid teens type location. Your line is open. Your line is open. And we would expect that that will be a nice growth business, particularly as Doug talked about Quick-Tag and as we're able to get the Resharp machines into the field over the next -- the next quarter is probably not as much growth as we'll see over the next year or two. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open."
