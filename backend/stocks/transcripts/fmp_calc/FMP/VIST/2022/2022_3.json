Total revenue in Q3 2022 were $333.6 million, a 91% increase year-over-year, driven by higher production and stronger relapsed oil prices. Oil production was up 35% year-over-year, mainly driven by our flagship development in Bajada del Palo Oeste, where we tie in 2 4-well pads during the quarter and benefited from another pad put on production in . Total ceroid production, including Bajada del Palo Oeste and Aguada Federal represented 77% of our total oil production during the quarter.

Total revenues in Q3 2022 were $333.6 million, a 91% increase year-over-year, driven by our production growth and substantial improvement in realized oil prices. Realized oil prices for the quarter average, $76.6 per barrel, up 34% year-over-year. Realized gas prices increased 7% year-over-year to $4.4 per million of BTU mainly boosted by the sales to industrial customers at $4.9 per million of BTU, applicable to 32% of our sales volumes. Cash flow used in investing activities was $151.7 million, mostly driven by $104 million in grinding and completion activities in our core development projects, Bajada del Palo Oeste and Aguada Federal. As our Vaca Muerta projects continue to drive production growth, we recorded 50.70 BOE per day during the quarter, a 26% increase year-over-year."
