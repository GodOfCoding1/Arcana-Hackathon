    "content": " Total revenues were $308 million for the quarter, an interannual increase of 57% driven by higher production and stronger realized oil price. Adjusted EBITDA during Q4 2022 was $202 million, a 73% increase year-over-year, driven by higher production and realization prices and lower lifting costs per BOE. Total shale oil production, which also includes Bajada del Palo Oeste increased to 36,200 barrels of oil per day, representing 79% of oil production. Total revenues in Q4 2022 were $308.1 million, a 57% increase year-over-year driven by production growth and stronger registration prices. Realized gas prices were $4.5 per million BTU, an increase of 65% year-over-year, mainly boosted by sales to our industrial customers at $3 per million BTU applicable to 44% of our sales volumes, and export to Chile at $8.8 per million BTU applicable to 26% of our sales volumes. Netback was $40.1 per BOE, a 30% increase year-over-year, driven by higher oil prices and lower lifting cost per BOE. Return on capital average employee came very strong at 40% for the year and so was our bottom line with an EPS of $4.2 per share, a free cash flow of $197 million. The certified present value at 10% discount rate attributable to Vista's interest in proved reserve of $3.2 billion, using a price assumption of $72 per barrel for oil and  per million BTU for gas, according to SEC guidelines. According to our estimated and realized prices of USD65 per barrel of oil and USD4.5 per million BTU of gas, the total value to Vista with the transaction could reach a nominal value of approximately $400 million. In 2023, we forecast reduction in lifting costs per BOE of 25% as well as an increase in adjusted EBITDA margin by 5 percentage points to 71%, despite the fact that we will be consolidating  of the production from these conventional assets, estimated at 5,000 BOE per day."
