    "content": " Persistently high inflation readings, rapid and sustained Federal Reserve rate hikes, tightening financial conditions, elevated volatility, geopolitical turmoil, and rising financial stability risks have weighed heavily on markets that have put this in historical perspective, the total return for the Bloomberg U.S. aggregate bond market index was negative 14.6% in the first three quarters of 2022, far worse than the negative 2.9% in 1994, the previous worst year in the history of the index. We continue to position ourselves defensively given sustained volatility and have strong liquidity with more than $6 billion in unencumbered assets, including $4.3 billion in cash and agency MBS, which represents over 50% of our common equity as of quarter end. As you discussed  in the first half of the quarter, interest rate volatility resumed its much higher, risk sentiment turned negative, and agency MBS sharply underperformed interest rate hedges, with spreads widening 25 to 30 basis points. Starting with agency portfolio activity, our holdings grew by roughly $3 billion in market value as we patiently deployed the equity raise during the quarter purchasing meaningful of fewer assets than implied by constant leverage on new capital. Our book value per share was $19.94 for Q3, which decreased by $3.65 per share for the quarter, primarily due to higher rates, spread widening and the continued declining valuations on our agency portfolio, along with lower credit valuations, albeit more modest declines in comparison to the agency book."
