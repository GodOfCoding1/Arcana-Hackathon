    "content": " Our portfolio paid 7.5 CPR in the fourth quarter, more than 30% faster than the 30-year universe and our weighted average seasoning of 42 months and our WACC roughly 1% higher than the broader Agency market positions us well for the current discount environment. Our portfolio ended the fourth quarter at $5.0 billion in market value, essentially unchanged quarter-over-quarter, and the strategy currently represents approximately 19% of the firm's capital. As of the end of Q4, our disciplined approach has resulted in 90% of our GAAP consolidated whole loan portfolio currently being funded through securitizations and a weighted average cost of funds of 3.38%, approximately 260 basis points below the current non-QM cost of funds. And just to run through it, in the agency market, current mark-to-market levered returns range between 13% to 15%, depending on what collateral we're buying in residential credit, looking at OBX securitization and retained holdings with very modest leverage. Generally, we're buying production coupons, and we're somewhat barbelled between really low pay up, but what we think to be good quality pools, for example, new production, retail bank service pools with low WACs coming to pay up of just a few ticks, and that's going to get you on a levered basis, a little over 15%, but we're obviously considerate of the possibility of a rally in the sensitivity of production coupons to prepay in a rally."
