    "content": " Today I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll review the macroeconomic and housing market backdrop, our performance during the quarter, and then provide an update on our broader strategic direction as we begin the second half of the year. Housing activity, however, has slowed recently as the highest mortgage rates since 2008 and 40% cumulative home price appreciation since the start of the pandemic has weighed on both consumer and builder sentiment. Our expectation is that housing will exhibit negative momentum in the second half of the year with the deceleration of home prices and declining month-over-month HPA becoming a realistic possibility, particularly on a regional level; however, a systematic shortage of one to four single family homes relative to future demand, low leverage as measured by outstanding mortgage debt to equity, lean builder inventories, historically tight underwriting standards, and the majority of mortgage borrowers locked into a low fixed rate mortgage suggests a moderation and slight decline in home prices is more likely than a protracted decline. While our MSR residential credit businesses have benefited from rising HPA, we maintain a constructive outlook given the underlying composition of our portfolios and the support from the long term supply-demand imbalance in the housing market. Economic leverage increased slightly to end the quarter at 6.6 turns, and despite our decline in book value, we generated strong earnings available for distribution of $0.30 for the quarter; however, as we have signaled in prior quarters, we expect earnings to moderate going forward, as Serena will cover in more detail. We completed the previously announced sale of our middle market lending portfolio during the quarter as planned, and to reiterate our rationale for the transaction, the sale provided an opportunity to monetize a less liquid, non-core business at an attractive valuation to redeploy capital into our core businesses. Notwithstanding the broader market volatility and disruptions to the mortgage finance sector this year, our residential credit and MSR platforms have built upon their strategic capabilities and gained market share, all while maintaining an intentional focus on credit and risk management. Our 2022 non-QM locked commitments are approximately 50% above our 2021 total locked volume, and Annaly\u00e2\u0080\u0099s balance sheet, commitment to the market and permanent capital are differentiated factors that reinforce our position as an industry leader and a reliable source of capital to the originator community. While the business has grown to 15% of capital in the span of a year, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been disciplined with respect to our purchasing activity in order to responsibly build our MSR assets vis-\u00c3\u00a0-vis our broader portfolio. Also to note, we closed our first MSR credit facility subsequent to quarter end; however, consistent with our prior guidance, we plan to employ only modest leverage on MSR in the facility search, primarily as a tool to manage liquidity. Over the long term, we expect our allocation of residential credit and MSR to approach 50% of our capital based on prevailing returns and where we are in the cycle. As you had discussed, volatility in the fixed income market persisted throughout the second quarter with a continued sell-off in rates and underperformance in risk assets. Agency MBS widened 20 to 30 basis points as supply remained elevated, while on the demand side the Fed began reducing its balance sheet and banks were sellers on the quarter, leaving money managers as the primary buyer of MBS. In the agency universe, a reversion of the trend in the first quarter lowered coupons underperformed as they were weighed down by fears of potential sales from the Fed and investors gravitated towards wider spreads and increased carryover in higher coupons. Specified pools outperformed TBAs, attributable to improved convexity  protection from the extreme levels of realized interest rate volatility, a worsening of the TBA deliverable due to higher average loan sizes, and TBA growth softening over the course of the quarter as new production replenished the float  coupons. During the quarter, we kept the size of our agency portfolio relatively stable while we continued to rotate up in coupon, reducing our holdings of 2s through 3s by nearly $16 billion in favor of 3.5s, 4 and 5s. Moving to our residential credit business, spreads widened materially across both non-agency and structured finance markets, notably underperforming corporate credit in light of the risk of environment and market volatility. The economic  of the residential credit portfolio ended Q2 at $4.8 billion, a $430 million increase quarter-over-quarter. Also to note, as Serena will elaborate on, we chose to technically increase our leverage in the residential credit portfolio given attractive financing terms with dedicated capital declining from 19% in Q1 to 14% at the end of Q2. In residential whole loans, we settled $1.1 billion of expanded credit home loans in Q2 and we issued five securitizations, generating $275 million market . In our MSR business, we continued to take advantage of the record origination volumes and the need for non-bank originators to monetize them as such, growing the portfolio by nearly $500 million in Q2 inclusive of the unsettled purchases. As of the quarter end, our MSR portfolio had sub-3% weighted average coupon and we continue to favor low note rate, high credit quality collateral. With our MSR portfolio over 200 basis points out of the money, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s now fully extended and has minimal duration; however, the position provides strategic benefit to our overall portfolio. It generates high single digit, stable, unlevered returns with low correlation with the agency portfolio and provides a hedge to our lower coupons should the elevated discount speeds begin to subside. Now expanding on David\u00e2\u0080\u0099s comments regarding our outlook, the latter part of Q2 brought about a shift in the market narrative from struggling to price the impact of inflation to preparing for a possible recessionary environment, which has led bond yields to retrace from the highs and regain some of their typical negative correlation with other risk assets. This shift has important implications which specifically benefit agency MBS from the perspective that market pricing and Fed costs in early 2023 to potential for Fed sales of the MBS is now less likely, and a slowdown in housing activity will result in reduced MBS supply. Furthermore, given the favorable liquidity and risk profile of agency, we anticipate that fixed income investors will prefer mortgages over corporate credit in a recessionary environment. Overall, the investment opportunities across our three businesses are as compelling as we have seen in recent years and we believe that we are well positioned to benefit in what we expect to be a less volatile environment, which improves risk sentiment across the fixed income landscape. Book value decreased by $0.87 per share for the quarter primarily due to a continuation of themes referenced in Q1; that is, higher rates and spread widening and the related declining valuations on our agency position. GAAP net income of $0.55 per share and our multi-faceted hedging strategy continued to support book value, providing a partial offset to the agency declines mentioned above with swaps, future and MSR valuations contributing $1.25 per share to the book value during the quarter. After combining our book value performance with our first quarter dividend of $0.22, our quarterly economic return was negative 9.6%. Earnings continued to be strong, resulting from high dollar roll income, increasing MSR net servicing income, reduced amortization due to lower CPRs, and a benefit from our swaps portfolio as it turned to a net receipt position during the quarter on higher short term rates. However, EAD was meaningfully aided this quarter by an increase in specialness and dollar rolls, primarily driven by a scarcity of TBA-type collateral and newer higher rate production coupons. We believe that the anticipated reduction in the specialness of dollar roll combined with the expected rise in the cost of funds due to rising rates should moderate future earnings; however, we expect to out-earn our $0.22 dividend in the third quarter all things equal. Average yields ex-PAA were higher than the prior quarter at 2.87%, up 25 basis points compared to the preceding quarter due to lower CPRs and, to a lesser extent, from the overall composition of the portfolio shifting to higher yielding assets during the quarter. Additionally, the portfolio generated 220 basis points of NIM ex-PAA, up 16 basis points from Q1 driven by the higher TBA dollar roll income that surpassed higher economic interest expense, which included the beneficial net interest component of swaps. Net interest spread does not have dollar roll income and the increase was more muted, up three basis points at 1.76% compared to 3/31/22 as lower amortization and reduced swap interest modestly outpaced higher repo rates during the quarter. Now turning to our financing, funding markets continue to function well with lender repo capacity for agency MBS remaining robust; however, uncertainty about the pace of future rate hikes has led to a shift in liquidity within the repo market towards the front end of the term curve as providers have priced longer dated repo contracts more conservatively in light of Fed uncertainty. Further to note, as Ilker discussed, early in the quarter we increased the repo leverage on our resi credit assets, taking advantage of attractive prevailing haircuts in financing levels. Given the volatility experienced through the first half of 2022, this strategy added to the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s liquidity while taking advantage of beneficial economics in credit funding markets. Additionally as David alluded to, to further enhance the firm\u00e2\u0080\u0099s overall liquidity profile, we added a $500 million facility for our MSR business after quarter end. The upward trend interest rates impacted our overall cost of funds for the quarter, rising by 22 basis points to 111 basis points in Q2, and our average repo rate for the quarter was 81 basis points compared to 20 basis points in the prior quarter. Our activity in the securitization market also impacted funding costs, increasing the weighting of securitization on the composition of cost of funds along with higher effective rates of 2.73% compared to 2.30%, resulting in an increase of 11 basis points to cost of funds. In closing, Annaly maintained an abundant liquidity profile with $6.3 billion of unencumbered assets, down from the prior quarter at $7.2 billion, including cash and unencumbered agency MBS of approximately $4.5 billion. To your point with respect to accounting considerations, and Serena mentioned that our swap position turned to a net receive where we generated income in Q2, and we expect that to grow given higher short rates, and as a consequence, the futures position does not flow through EAD. Look, I would say when we look at levered returns on agency and residential credit, we can get into the details within each of the sectors, but you can earn 15% in both sectors. To answer your question, the dividend yield on book value at quarter end, 15%, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s actually a little bit lower than that given higher book value, but current levered returns are reasonably consistent with the yield. Leverage is a function of three factors: first, capital allocation, and obviously higher allocation to agency, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to have more leverage; and then second, liquidity of the portfolio, and asset valuation. Can you talk a little bit about what you guys are seeing in the residential credit whole loan markets, particularly, I guess on the non-QM side, there were some companies that seemed to have difficulty managing through all the rate volatility to start off this year, so I was curious what you guys are seeing in terms of origination volume in the non-agency loan space and where you think returns would be on newly acquired loan securitization as the market stands today. The way we look at it is we are a partner to originators, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re a liquidity provider, and as the market has evolved over the past six months, the world has turned from scarcity of assets to a scarcity of capital, and that puts capital providers like us in a better position, and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re absolutely taking advantage of it, but responsibly. In the month of June, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been $440 million of lots - that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the highest lot volume that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen to date, and really what you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re seeing is large non-bank originators are entering the space given declining margins, declining volumes, and you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re also seeing small thinly capitalized originators that were bulking and selling it by the bulk market to come to the correspondent market. Look - we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re always looking at the market and evaluating opportunities in the M&A landscape, but the fact of the matter is if you look at the evolution of the company over the past couple of years, our organic build strategy has been very effective in both residential credit through the correspondent channel, as well as the MSR build, so we feel very good about our ability to acquire assets. Now when we look at where we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re at now with respect to the cycle, as I talked about in my prepared comments, we do expect housing to soften certainly, so we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re certainly a little bit more cautious; but to the extent that Mike has opportunities that are very healthy from a credit standpoint, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to add. That being said, it appears to have declined when you look at implied volatility in the market, and so we feel good about the direction we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going, but we have a lot of data coming up and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re always going to be cautious about an increase in volatility, but that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the main risk. For the past 25 years, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve always led with making sure that we maintain ample liquidity, and $4.5 billion is probably excess liquidity but nonetheless, volatility is elevated, and so we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to run in a conservative fashion but there is capacity to utilize that liquidity. To your question about a turn of leverage and what that would do to liquidity, if you think about if you buy 10 billion mortgages with a 5% haircut, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re talking about half a billion in liquidity, so it\u00e2\u0080\u0099d be a 10%, a little over 10% reduction in liquidity. Obviously that reduces the value of the MSR that you are buying, especially for the operating entity, but the ones that we are buying, as you know, they are deep discount ones, sub-3% gross rate  portfolio, and for that the recapture, the value of recapture is much less, so that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s why at least  from time to time prefer those reverse non-solicit deals because the value of the recapture is a lot less. But most of the time, though, supply-demand imbalance cannot be met with the levered money buying, you need money managers, and we will expect more money managers buying in these instances because like fixed income, as we said in our prepared remarks, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the negative correlation in rates and the risk assets finally starts appearing, fixed income money managers will be getting subscriptions, and that will be the marginal demand on the MBS until banks clear their RW issues."
