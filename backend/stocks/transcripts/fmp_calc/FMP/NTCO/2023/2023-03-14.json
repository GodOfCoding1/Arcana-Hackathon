    "content": " And again, there are some actions that we disclosed that we took in the first quarter of 2023, which of course doesn't -- they don't reflect in the numbers of last quarter, of Q4 2022, such as the closure of TBS At Home in the U.S. and the dedicated distribution center in the UK as well restructuring of the global management structure, by which we reduced leadership positions by almost 25%, and again, further headcount reductions in the rest of the global overhead staffing. So the reported EBITDA of course, was impacted by the performance of the business, needless to say, but also through several one-offs impacts and those one-offs are transformational, restructuring, corporate rightsizing, and impairments, which were again a big number, especially in Q4 of the year, which brought the reported EBITDA of the year to low levels compared to historical numbers. Now we have accrued basically none to very little incentives in the first nine months of the year, and with the stronger cash performance coming in the second half, especially of course, given by the high seasonal Q4, that's where again we saw the higher impact given again that we have communicated and we'll continue to communicate, the cash flow is a strong priority for ours."
