    "content": " In this context Natura &Co posted results that were in line with what we had for  in the previous quarter, with top line training better growing by 2.2% at constant currency, while adjusted EBITDA margin, which was stable at the 8.6% continued to be pressured by the external factors I just mentioned, notably on costs. Also an improving margin at Natura &Co. Latam driven by strong top line performance, strict cost control, we continue to deliver cost efficiencies in SG&A across all BUs, which are more than compensating for commodities and FX pressures in gross margin. Not only boosting its new commercial model, but also revisiting the footprint or some unprofitable markets, but also strategy focused in the bottom line with the transformational costs and as we mentioned, if excluding the Russia, Ukraine war, the margins even with the sales leverage will be significantly higher in Q3 of this year. Finally, The Body Shop, just to mention The Body Shop, again though we are also significantly impacted in terms of cost pressure, I think The Body Shop, as we had also mentioned in Q2 hasn't passed fully the price increases to the consumers given the level of inventories, but it's planning to do so over the next few quarters."
