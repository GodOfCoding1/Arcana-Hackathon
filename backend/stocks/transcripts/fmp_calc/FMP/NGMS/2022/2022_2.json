    "content": " When we announced the Aspire transaction earlier this year, one of the key reasons for putting our two companies together were some of the trends we were seeing with our lottery customers, where more and more lottery in globally are expanding into additional verticals within their online offering, specifically online Sports Betting and iGaming operations. The revenues from Aspire nominated functional currency euro grew 17% year-over-year, as well as 5.5% sequentially from the first quarter, this results highlighted strong trends we are seeing in both areas of the business. During the second quarter of 2022, our revenues as reported on the income statement, which excludes our share of NPI revenues was $21.1 million, including an $8.3 million contribution from Aspire Global up 63.4% from last year. One important note when we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re talking about Aspire revenues is something that also touched on our commentary to the quarter, is the fact that, currency fluctuation, especially this year and the fact that the Aspire business by the vast majority is nominated in euros or GBP, British pounds, that would impact also the revenues expectations."
