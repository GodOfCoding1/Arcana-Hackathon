Before we begin our formal remarks, we need to remind everyone that the discussion today will include forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements, which are usually identified by use of words such as will, expect, anticipate, should or other similar phrases, are not guarantees of future performance. During today's call, we will discuss non-IFRS financial measures, which we believe can be useful in evaluating the company's financial performance. Hosting the call today, we have Moti Malul, NeoGames' Chief Executive Officer; and Raviv Adler, Chief Financial Officer of the company. Last night, we released our first quarter 2022 results. This morning, I will highlight some key points about the first quarter performance and provide an update on the trends we are seeing in the market. Overall, there haven't been significant changes since we last spoke only 2 months ago, as the business continues to perform well and in line with our expectations. During the quarter, the total of revenues plus our NPI Revenue Interest climbed modestly, growing 3.8% year-over-year as well as over 5% sequentially from Q4, bringing the total sum to an all-time high of , $22.4 million. We consider this to be an impressive result given the comparison of the first quarter of 2021, which benefited significantly from a double jackpot run from both Mega Millions and Power Ball. Virginia, for example, continues to outperform, with strong growth both quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year. Given the full portfolio of gaming verticals across lottery, casino and sports, which we have geared to play Alberta with, such that the market has become our second largest turnkey account. We view Alberta as a terrific example of the type of account where our lottery customer will benefit from our strategic acquisition of Aspire, for example, content from Pariplay, Wizard Games studio continue to gain traction and wallet share with an impressive introduction that began in Q4 last year. In Michigan, with the first quarter of this year, we have fully lapped the introduction of iGaming in the market in January of 2021. This gives us enough perspective to see evidence for what we believe is sustainable growth in the account, which has continued the growth that started in the second half of Q4 last year into Q1. As we have mentioned in the past, our long-term belief is that after an aggressive period of promotion from iGaming during 2021, the lottery will get to a point where the business stabilizes, and then again, begins to regain growth. We are seeing new players join the system, and in our view, these new players today are more dedicated lottery players because they are all aware of the iGaming offering and have decided to join the iLottery program. While we may still see fluctuations in revenues due to expected impacts from factors such as seasonality or large jackpots, overall, we are expecting the pattern will be trending towards growth moving forward. In April, we also went live in the first Canadian market with Ontario, broadening our partnership with Caesars to include international markets. In Europe, Sazka, another of our multi-gaming product customers, continues to perform well, and we have seen continued growth of revenues with an impressive online performance. The regulatory environment and state authorization in the U.S. for iLottery continues to evolve in some key markets, which we have mentioned on prior calls. However, since we last spoke 2 months ago, there hasn't been much new to report. One with interesting dynamics in Brazil, in which we see continued progress in various states to form, create and regulate lottery authorities as a first step towards gearing up with lottery tech and operations as well as sports betting in the coming years. This is a long-term process, but an interesting market with attractive potential opportunities given its size, particularly when you consider the products that will be offered within this emerging lottery market. Obviously, our biggest news during the quarter was the announced acquisition of Aspire Global in January. To summarize the deal, we view it as a natural development for the progression of NeoGames as the combination with Aspire will enhance our scale and competitive position across all business lines, adding Aspire's proprietary sports betting offering, its iGaming content and aggregation platform, as well as its turnkey B2B gaming solutions to the NeoGames offering. Based on their impressive first quarter results, we remain excited at the prospects of completing the transaction. Currently, given market reception, we are confident we will meet the shareholder approval threshold and we look forward to updating you on our next earnings call. Lastly, I would like to provide an update on the conflict in Ukraine as it relates to our operations, friends and colleagues who remain there during these difficult times. Secondly, we have been so far very successful with our efforts and we are able to completely mitigate all the impacts to our business through various measures such as relocation to safer areas and parallel recruitment outside of Ukraine in a few markets. Like everyone, we hope to see a swift end to this conflict, but until then, we expect our operations to continue with minimal impact. Before I get into the results, as a reminder, when we discuss our results, I would point out that all of our iLottery business in North America operates through a 50-50 joint venture, NeoPollard Interactive or NPI, except in Michigan, which is reflected in our top line revenues. As a result, from an accounting standpoint, as many of you know, we generate revenues and earnings through our wholly-owned operation and through our equity interest in NPI. Our revenue is reported on the income statement, which excludes our share of NPI revenues, was $13.2 million during the first quarter of 2022, down 0.7% over the same period last year. However, our share of NPI revenues grew to $9.2 million during the first quarter of 2022 compared with $8.2 million last year. The sum total of these 2 numbers was $22.4 million during the first quarter, representing an increase of about 3.8% year-over-year. Generally speaking, first quarter earnings were partially impacted by one-time items, which was transaction costs incurred for the upcoming Aspire Global acquisition of $2.2 million. For the quarter, our adjusted EBITDA was $8.5 million, which is down 12% compared with $9.7 million last year. The results represent an EBITDA margins of 38%, up 90 basis points quarter-over-quarter. Our outstanding debt at the quarter end was approximately $13.2 million at a weighted average interest rate of 1%, leaving us in a net cash position of $27.7 million. Corresponding with Aspire capital note terms, we have settled in full, both outstanding principal and accrued interest of a total of $21.1 million. With respect to guidance, we're updating the range to account for our reported results, which were in line with our expectations. We continue to expect solid growth from our existing customer base in 2022, and we still expect 11% year-over-year growth during 2022 based on the midpoint of our guidance range of $91 million to $96 million. Keep in mind, however, that this guidance does not include the launch of any new turnkey contracts nor presumes the closing of the merger with Aspire Global. We look forward to welcoming the team from Aspire Global into the NeoGames family and take advantage of the amazing opportunity to capitalize in global markets of iLottery, iGaming and online sports betting. First of all, yes, we haven't moved our midpoint because we're getting more confident around the guidance overall. We felt that the range of the guidance we provided in our last earnings call, which was because of certain uncertainties on the lower end because we didn't know what impact would be, if at all, from the Ukraine situation, which we're happy to report that we have fully mitigated so far. And on the other hand, there has been a couple of deals on the content side of the business that we launched at the later part of last year that we didn't know how fast it will take for them to pick up on an aggregate value. So relative to margins, as a general statement, we still expect that on a go-forward basis that the business would perform around the high 30s and low 40s, and we feel comfortable where the margins are currently trending. In general, I can say that quarter-over-quarter, we're seeing a better performance in volumes and revenues coming through contracts, which are driving higher margins profile. And also the work that we have done with a contract in Alberta relative to the structure of our costs contributing -- contributed a bit to the margin improvement, and we expect that to -- also on a go-forward basis. First of all, we always said that the U.S. has so much to still open up where we have roughly 10 states, maybe depending on how you count. And also the nature of the deals in the market where we are providing full turnkey account, including the fullest extent of services, provides for those deals to account for the most meaningful portion of our revenues, and we still expect the U.S. market going forward to be the more dominant market. However, like the U.S., it has a lot of internal scaling if you aggregate wins of a couple of states in them, and so we're trying to look for the markets which have a more attractive profile. But again, we still expect that as -- with enough time, let's say, giving it enough time for the markets to open up in its fullest extent, the U.S. market will definitely continue to be the largest portion. On the Aspire side of the business, obviously, the transaction has not been completed, so we have not yet had the chance to strategically see how to blend the prioritization of potential transactions. Obviously, when it does upgrade itself to become a full lottery account with eInstant, we expect that this will create quite a significant impact on our potential revenues in the extent that we have seen when we opened up, for example, eInstant in Virginia in the middle of 2020 -- 2020. And North Carolina is a successful account when it comes to draw games, but very much impacted from jackpot runs, an eInstant will provide. So depending on the timing of when that opens up and how much runway do we still have in the year to transfer that into revenues, the revenue potential will change. And if I may ask another one, we saw the use of IP rights jumped quite a bit sequentially and year-over-year. As you probably know and -- the use of IP is very much linked to Caesars's aspiration of expansion in the U.S. -- in the U.S. market, which we're supporting. So I cannot say that it was one-timer, but given that what we are familiar with their business plans going forward, it should be recurring also into Q3 and Q4 later on this year. The main thing, obviously, while we are still reporting on our existing business, is for us to be focused on completing the transaction and next quarter results, if we close on time, will allow us to provide a bit more color on the joint activities of the company. Because if we close the transaction, obviously, still in Q2 as we expect, by second half of August, we will be able to provide a bit more color that I know that many investors are waiting for."
