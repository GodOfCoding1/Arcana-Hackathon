    "content": " During the third quarter, we reached a number of significant milestones across our business lines, further increasing our conviction in the benefits of our integrated end-to-end iLottery, iGaming and Sportsbetting solutions has to offer to the global gaming market. We saw new markets move towards implementing an iLottery solution signed iGaming and Sportsbetting deals, both in the US and internationally and continued the integration of the Aspire Global business. During the third quarter of 2022, our revenue, as reported, on the income statement, which excludes our share of NPI revenues, was $62.2 million of which $48.5 million is attributable to revenues from the Aspire Global business. As a reminder, Aspire Global has historically recognized its revenues on a gross basis, while NeoGames iLottery business recognized revenues on a net basis. And if you layer on top of that the Pariplay business which represents our iGaming games side of the market or content side, that is certified live and running in five states, then I believe that that is an immediate boost to the Aspire Global market entry of gaming into the U.S. market, because regulatory landscape would have required them to take a year or two before they can get to the point that we brought them. I think the nature of the core business of Aspire, it's mainly -- we call it a timing issue where on the comparable periods, on the revenue side, on the core, you've seen markets such as Netherlands for example, who's been transitioning into regulated market region and licenses has not yet been granted to operators that are having signed contracts to the Aspire, so didn't yet go live."
