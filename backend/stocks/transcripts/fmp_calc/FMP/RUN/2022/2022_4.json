Given today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s higher cost of capital environment, commencing with 2023 reporting, we anticipate increasing our discount rate assumption from 5%, which we used in our reporting throughout 2022 to 6%, as you can see in Slide 12, adjusting the discount rate higher by 1% with lower the total subscriber value and thus net subscriber value by approximately $3,600 in Q4. Because proceeds per customer are already based on market rates, our advance rate in Q4 as a percentage of contracted subscriber value would increase to approximately 80% to 90%.
