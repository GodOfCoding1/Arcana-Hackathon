    "content": " As Mary noted, we have implemented meaningful price increases and expect recently originated customers, when installed, to generate at least $3,000 in incremental net subscriber value, as measured at a 5% discount rate. So, as I hit, basically a lot of what you are seeing that Tom hit that\u2019s flowing through subscriber value is attached to not just the pricing but like are really going at the go-to-market strategy, taking decisive action in some markets where we weren\u2019t hitting the return thresholds, we wanted to and at the same time some streamlining and improvement and putting into place a team and an approach that can help us make significant progress on the backlog in the next couple of months. And so, certainly, that\u2019s helpful if you are experiencing increased costs, whether that\u2019s operational or capital, we are doing our best and I think meeting with some success, getting efficiency up and costs down and all the things that you would want to do in any business anyway, but also have the ability to pass through pricing, because our competitor, the Electric Utility, turns out also capital cost is an input in their business. The interesting dynamic in the market right now, which is that the capital costs for solar loans have gone up almost 2.5% and for the most part we haven\u2019t seen any change in solar loan pricing, like I doubt actually the United States Treasury could make money buying solar loans from us at the moment."
