    "content": " And while we always expected a decline in order rates this quarter given peak growth of over 50% for non-EMV orders in the prior year period, underlying quarter trends and elevated backlog levels position us well for accelerated growth into the back half of this year and into 2023. We're also initiating our third quarter adjusted diluted net EPS guidance of $0.85 to $0.90, which includes assumptions of low single-digit core revenue growth and 20 to 40 basis points of adjusted core operating margin expansion. In our Mobility Technologies platform, core revenue was 3.5%, reflecting growth in GVR in developed and high-growth markets, particularly in North America, more than offsetting the sunsetting EMV impact of nearly $15 million in the quarter. In our Diagnostic and Repair Technologies platform, core revenue declined 3.6% in the quarter as a result of both a difficult compare against the 57% growth in Q2 of the prior year and also normalization of Matco to a more typical growth and operating profile, but still above pre-pandemic levels. For full year 2022, we are maintaining our core revenue guide of low to mid-single-digit growth, with non-EMV growth of high single digits, as EMV is still expected to be approximately a $50 million headwind. We presented this slide last quarter to better dimensionalize our conviction in our ability to offset the impact of the EMV decline in 2023 and most importantly, how we expect to have a rebaseline core revenue growth rate of mid-single digits at accretive margins post the EMV sunset, which we continue to expect completes in 2023."
