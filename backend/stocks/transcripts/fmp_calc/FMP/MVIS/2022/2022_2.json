    "content": " Please note that some of the information you'll hear today will include forward-looking statements, such as, but not limited to, statements regarding our product development, testing and performance, comparisons to our competitors, market opportunity, potential product sales and future demand, business and strategic opportunities, customer and partner engagement, projections of future operations and financial results, availability of funds, as well as statements containing words like potential, believe, expects, plans, and other similar expressions. Using the estimated number of cars to be produced through 2030, we believe the revenue opportunity for MicroVision could still be between $2 billion to $4 billion with a corresponding cumulative EBITDA profile of $1 billion to $2 billion once we're able to secure the series production partnerships with the Tier 1s and OEMs for our sensor units to be included in their fleets. Now coming back to automotive LiDAR revenue as we discussed, we plan to sell a limited number of LiDAR sensors for strategic sales to OEMs and Tier 1s during the second half of this year."
