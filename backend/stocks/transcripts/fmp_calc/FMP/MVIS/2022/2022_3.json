Our technology unlocks all the benefits of 905-nanometer lasers without the high cost and high power structures for 1550-nanometer products, achieving Class 1 paved the way for a second key Q3 milestone, delivering samples to OEMs and Tier 1 customers. I would now like to move our focus to talking about the key features OEMs are looking for in 2023 and beyond in LiDAR technology, and how MicroVision is positioned as best-in-class. The continued engagement with OEMs, highlighting the capability of roofline integration, because our product has one of the most streamlined form factors on the market, along with a low latency highway pilot solution, positions us well to compete in the upcoming RFQs. Sumit, do you want to take that. Sumit, do you want to take that."
