    "content": " Please note that some of the information you'll hear in today's discussion will include forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, statements regarding our product development, testing and performance, comparisons to our competitors, market opportunity, potential product sales and future demand, business and strategic opportunities, customer and partner engagement, projections of future operations and financial results, availability of funds, as well as statements containing words like potential, believe, expects, plans, and other similar expressions. But ultimately, it's this ultra-high resolution point cloud data along with the RalLiDAR and RADAR data feeds that would be fused together in our custom ASIC and passed along to the ADAS, allowing OEMs to create faster and more accurate safety features, along with their unique driving experience. Using this number and the number of cars to be produced through 2030, we believe the revenue opportunity for MicroVision could be cumulatively between $2 billion to $4 billion with a corresponding EBITDA profile of $1 billion to $2 billion once we're able to secure the series production partnerships with the Tier 1 and OEM for our sensor units to be included in their fleets. So -- and that's the reason why we didn't use this facility in the second half of last year and even this quarter, because we saw weakness in the overall equity markets, because I think our goal is to make sure we drive shareholder value and use this facility very judiciously to fund our growth plans. So think about -- I think this is an anomaly of when people are seeing pictures and other things from other LiDAR companies, those are actually in a visualization tool has been like there is multiple points that are left in there beyond what they're saying is that even possible, which is called like super resolution."
