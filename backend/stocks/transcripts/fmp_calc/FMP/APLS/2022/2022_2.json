    "content": " Following the 18-month data reported in March, we have shared additional analysis at key retina meetings, reinforcing that treatment with both monthly and every other month intravitreal pegcetacoplan induced studies demonstrated a clinically meaningful reduction in GA lesion growth with a favorable safety profile. As highlighted on Slide 7 at ARVO in May, we presented data showing the treatment with pegcetacoplan continue to demonstrate a robust effect in patients with extrafoveal lesions and an improved effect in patients with foveal lesions as compared to what we observed in the 12-month results. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. And again, there is something there that we will continue to evaluate that we spoke about at the 18-month time point, which is that with every 6 months segment, we saw that the reduction in the lesion growth became better, not linearly, but essentially the efficacy profile of the drug seem to improve over time. I mean, again, to kind of reiterate, we have the first mover advantage, we have every other month dosing, we have data up to 18 months included in the file, and then we have patients with foveal as well as extrafoveal lesions that are included in this profile."
