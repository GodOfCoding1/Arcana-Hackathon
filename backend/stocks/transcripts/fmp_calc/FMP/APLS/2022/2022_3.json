    "content": " Having the 24-month data included in the label allows us to have a more impactful conversation with the physician, broadens how they think about using pegcetacoplan and allows them to have a more meaningful conversation with their patients. The feedback was very positive this week and with this disease, like geographic atrophy, having understanding the effects over time, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s highly valuable, and physicians understand that, and we really welcome our decision and the possibility of having all our data at 24 months in the label to start with. Separately, did the FDA ever bring up questions around the microperimetry data in any of your earlier discussions, I asked because, obviously, that is another important difference between 18 and 24-month data. So obviously, the team and the whole of Apellis is actually excited about the 24-month data, particularly the efficacy increasing over time, more consistency between our 2 studies and the robust safety. So basically, the conversation changes at the Retina Society based on the 24 months, the implication there was that for the doctors, they know the data, but the ability to have a simplified message towards their patients for these retina doctors is important."
