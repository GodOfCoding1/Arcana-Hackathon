    "content": " We completed the pre-NDA meeting in January, and then in March, we shared 18-month data from our Phase III DERBY and OAKS studies determining that longer-term treatment with pegcetacoplan resulted in an increasing benefit to patients with greater amounts of retinal tissue saved over time and a favorable safety profile. Just this week at ARVO, we shared additional 18-month data analyses that showed that pegcetacoplan reduced lesion growth in patients with extrafoveal lesions and in patients with foveal lesions, further supporting pegcetacoplan's benefits for a diverse population of patients across the GA disease spectrum. As Cedric mentioned, we are excited to share the 18-month data from DERBY and OAKS, which showed continuous and clinically meaningful benefits to a diverse and broad group of patients over time. So obviously, 5 million GA patients worldwide, 1 million alone in the U.S. Now in our discussions with retinal physicians, we've -- we've got to a level where a lot of retina physicians believe that that number is actually greater than 1 million patients because of patients that might not make it to their retina center or to injecting ophthalmologists or something like that."
