    "content": " During our year-end call a few weeks ago, I reported the first of these clinical study milestones with a review of the positive top line results from the respiratory physiology study, led by Dr. Albert Dahan, at Leiden University Medical Center. While studies like Dr. Dahan's investigation are not practical to conduct in the postoperative setting, the data are nonetheless consistent with the observations that we have reported in the clinical setting in our patient studies and thereby strengthen the evidence characterizing the respiratory profile of OLINVYK. I mentioned previously that this study is designed to compare the potential changes in cognitive function in subjects treated with OLINVYK and IV morphine in a head-to-head study design, on a broad array of cognitive performance outcomes including motor coordination, attention, reaction time, memory and higher order executive function. The trial builds on our published clinical data and is evaluating OLINVYK's profile on three important clinical outcomes in the postoperative setting namely respiratory depression, nausea and vomiting, and cognitive function."
