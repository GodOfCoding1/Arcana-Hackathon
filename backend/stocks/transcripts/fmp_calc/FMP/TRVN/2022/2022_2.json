    "content": " Remember that we previously announced positive respiratory physiology data for OLINVYK and we're on track to complete the Cleveland Clinic Outcomes study looking at respiratory, GI and also cognitive function later this year. You may recall that we were prompted to conduct this study based on clinical observations from investigators in our Phase III development program and from clinicians currently using OLINVYK in practice, who've noticed that in their experience, use of OLINVYK appeared to have a favorable clinical profile with regard to sedation and other opioid-related central nervous system adverse effects. Given the potential practical implications of these observations for clinical care, we also believe that this data will be a useful addition to the hospital dossier used by our medical team to respond to questions from formulary committee members, and we look forward to making progress in those discussions."
