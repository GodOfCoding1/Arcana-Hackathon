    "content": " In order to study these outcomes in more detail, we extracted the electronic medical record, or EMR data, from surgical patients treated at the study hospitals around the same period of time that the VOLITION study was conducted. At this time, we've analyzed the EMR data set extracted from the Wake Forest study site, the largest enrolling site in the VOLITION study, which was comprised of 96 OLINVYK-treated patients. OLINVYK-treated patients in the ARTEMIS study had a statistically significant 1.6 days or 27% in average hospital length of stay versus the match cohort of surgical patients treated with other IV opioids, including IV morphine, hydromorphone or fentanyl. I would emphasize though it's sort of -- I said this in my words, but just to point out, the thing that's so remarkable about the finding is it's a pretty good, large representative data set from a homogeneous single site sample, well-matched and highly statistically significant at 1.6-day extension length of stay. This new data set is really what we've been hearing from our customers that they've been looking for it, right, real-world data in patients, robust from large academic medical centers, the added benefit then of having the electronic medical record process data around length of stay also helps that discussion."
