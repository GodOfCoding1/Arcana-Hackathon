    "content": " Additionally, last year's increase in the Black Card membership to $24.99 and the recent increase in annual fees to $49 will add approximately 300 basis points to 400 basis points of margin to new stores as the vast majority of members in a new store will pay these higher rates. So it will be interesting with the 3.5 million teens that did last year, let's call it, the 18, 19 years old are off to college, get backfilled with the new 14, 15 years old, but there's going to be a big chunk of those -- the freshmen junior kids that are still going to do for the second time they're going to speak to their friends about joining them again. So $10 memberships we do on it, even old Black Card members that were paying $19.99 for many, many years were upgrading to the $24.99 just for the halo and signing a new 12-month contract, which was really something to see. But I think, as Chris said, we felt really good about the record growth that we saw in Q4, the momentum coming in the New Year's Eve and carrying forward, so more to come on that on the next call. I think as we still are coming back from getting close back to with their pre-pandemic margins and profitability, today, about we reported last time about 30% of our clubs were at or above pre-COVID membership, and now we're at about 43%. But I think what we don't want to lose sight of either is we're predicting high single-digit same-store sales growth 75 in Q4, like as it's played out historically, three quarters of that growth is member growth, and we expect that to continue back to the opportunity over time to double membership. Really excited to this year with the new continue with the Black Card price at $24.99 and the annual fee increase, which I think is really going to be beneficial and great to see the price elasticity that we have and continue to have and re-kicking off past in a few months."
