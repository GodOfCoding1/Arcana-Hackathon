    "content": " And as we've talked about, even with wage inflation in some markets being fairly considerable, one good year of same-store sales growth because of our model and low labor costs really offsets the impact and margins basically return back to where they were before the wage inflation after 1-year of mid-single-digit same-store sales increase. And I think it's important to note that with our same-store sales of 8.6% -- I mean, 8.2% system-wide, that our corporate store legacy fleet, right, is -- you recall, Max, our legacy fleet, because they're our oldest, most mature markets back from 30 years ago, we don't have a lot of new store builds in the legacy fleet to influence same-store sales. And you might remember, Patrick, we talked about at the time of the acquisition, pre-COVID, the Sunshine mature stores were several hundred basis points higher in 4-wall EBITDA margin than our legacy stores, primarily because of the markets they're in, lower cost to build, lower cost to operate. So I think the big question that I mentioned earlier is we're not sure if they're going to want to open ahead of schedule just because of the cost of opening stores right now, as they want to wait and see if that comes down in a year or 2 because they would sometimes open up units that maybe weren't committed until here right now in 2022."
