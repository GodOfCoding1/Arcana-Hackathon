    "content": " Our Medicare Advantage business development team continues to make pipeline progress and we anticipate a boost in activity in Q4 leading into 2023. International sales were down about $96,000 primarily reflecting lower DPNCheck sales to China and to Japan. Our sales and marketing investments are primarily in headcount and personnel to drive Medicare Advantage, and the Quell Neurotherapeutics initiative, and G&A incremental spending covers IT and ERP system, quality system, board governance and staff retention. First, is organic growth in our established DPNCheck Medicare Advantage business; the second, is to launch and grow our recently obtained Quell fibromyalgia indication in the U.S. market; and the third, is to advance our Quell Neurotherapeutics program, which may lead to additional indications in an expanded addressable market."
