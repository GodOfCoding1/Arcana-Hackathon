    "content": " These modest changes in comparative period revenues for Q2 and for the first half of the year obscure the interesting revenue perspective and that is that DPNCheck, our leading product posted another strong quarterly performance with overall revenue growth of 17.6% in the second quarter and 14.6% year-to-date. The first is organic growth in our DPNCheck Medicare Advantage business, the second is to launch the Quell fibromyalgia indication and the third is to advance our Quell Neurotherapeutics program. As a reminder, fibromyalgia is a complex chronic pain syndrome that affects as many as 10 million people in the U.S. And moving now to the overall Quell neurotherapeutics platform, the third element of our growth strategy is to continue to develop the Quell neurotherapeutics pipeline beyond the initial fibromyalgia indication."
