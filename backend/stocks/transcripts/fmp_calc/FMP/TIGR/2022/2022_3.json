    "content": " Non-GAAP net income was US$6.6 million, increased 91.3% quarter-over-quarter and 26.2% year-over-year. In the third quarter, mark-to-market loss still had an adverse impact on the total net assets, which decreased by 12.8% to US$13 billion compared to the end of the second quarter, but the trend of healthy asset flow continues. Taking Singapore as an example, our company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s largest market in terms of both incremental and existing clients, the average net asset inflows of our newly acquired clients in Singapore exceeded US$11,000 in the third quarter further increased from over US$9,000 in the second quarter, represent our healthy business model in balancing customer acquisition efficiency and client quality. Execution and clearing expense were $3.2 million, decreased 66% from the same quarter of last year, we expect further reduction in clearing expense when we started out clearing Hong Kong equities."
