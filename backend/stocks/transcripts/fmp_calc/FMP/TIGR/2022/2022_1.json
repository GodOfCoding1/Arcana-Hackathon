    "content": " Total revenue in the first quarter was $52.6 million, decreased 35.2% year-over-year. Total revenue were $52.6 million, down 35% year-over-year as weaker market backdrop in the first quarter slowed down commission and underwriting revenue. Execution and carrying expense were $4.5 million, decreased 45% year-over-year and 34% quarter-over-quarter primarily due to more self-clearing of U.S. equities. Branding accounted for around 25% of our marketing expenses in the first quarter, and we expect branding remains a big portion of our marketing for the next few quarters."
