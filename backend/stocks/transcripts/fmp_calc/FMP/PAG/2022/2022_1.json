Your line is open. Your line is open. And my goal, obviously, by '25 would be to be at 500,000 if we can grow it, will certainly be based on availability and the amount of signing we're doing when you look at -- on the full service lease side, that business was up 8% during the first quarter, and contract maintenance was up 14%. So I think in Q1, we benefited by a higher gain on sale, PAG prospectively, got about $25 million, and I think it would be lower in Q2 and Q3 going forward because we've really reduced the vehicles available for sales, as I said earlier, from about 12,000 to 3,000. Your line is open. On the CarShop side in the U.K., they're not sourcing nearly as many vehicles from consumers as we are in the U.S. And what we would see happen there is that over time, they would use the Sytner auction as more of a direction to help gain and get more cars, and that's been somewhat limiting right now because of the cars and trades coming off of either out of fleet or trades coming in from the overall business."
