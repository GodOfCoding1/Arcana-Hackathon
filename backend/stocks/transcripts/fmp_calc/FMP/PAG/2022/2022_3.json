    "content": " PTS produced record quarter driven by strong performance from full-service leasing, our commercial rental business, logistics and remarketing, revenue increased 19% to $3.5 billion, and profit increased 15% to a record $468 million. And basically, with our mix being 70% premium, we're getting the benefit of those higher-priced cars with a big margin for us, and I think that will help us as we go through the next 6 to 12 months to maintain a higher gross margin as we have shown here in the last couple of quarters. And then your second bucket would be CarShop, both in the U.S. and the U.K., we've really been moved out of our sweet spot because the cost of sale has moved up anywhere from $4,000 to $5,000 and what's happening. Well, I think we talked to revenue was up 21% to $3.5 billion and an all-time record of $476 million EBT, that's up 14%. Our commercial rental was $653 million, and that was up 24% and that commercial revenue, when you think about it, half of that revenue comes from our lease customer because they need extras as their businesses go up and down, example would be Coca-Cola needs more trucks in the summer. And then we also, in the U.K., have the Sytner closed bid auction that we can get off-branded vehicles through that that would have normally gone through the franchise business and push those into the CarShop business in the U.K. And I know for everybody that's really gotten terrible, especially for trucking."
