    "content": " To date in the second quarter, we have completed the acquisition of two industrial buildings, totaling 155,000 square feet for $15.8 million at a weighted average cost of $102 per square foot and a weighted average initial projected yield of 5.9%. We also acquired an off-market deal in Augusta, Georgia for $12.35 million, leased to two tenants with a weighted lease term of approximately four years at an ingoing yield of 5.3%. The \u2013 both tenants are paying rents that are currently 15% to 20% below today's market rates and an added benefit to this deal is that, it comes with an additional nine acres of developable land that will enable us to add on to the existing 200,000 square foot structure."
