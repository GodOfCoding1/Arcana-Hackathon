    "content": " While the impact of these headwinds was felt broadly, our brand advertising business grew at a relatively slower rate of 26% year-over-year in Q1, as new headwinds built on top of supply chain and labor supply headwinds already impacting a subset of industry sectors coming into this quarter. Despite the challenging operating environment, we were encouraged by the progress in our direct response advertising business with a year-over-year growth rate of 43% for the full quarter and nearly 50% prior to the invasion of Ukraine. Adjusted operating expenses were $586 million in Q1, up 60% year-over-year, reflecting a combination of our ongoing rate of investment in the business as well as several factors that are further elevating our adjusted operating expense growth rate in the near-term. Excluding the impact of mark-to-market losses on this investment, net income would have improved by $19 million or 7% year-over-year to reach negative $267 million, which is due primarily to the flow-through of the $66 million improvement in adjusted EBITDA, partially offset by $19 million in higher stock-based compensation, $15 million higher depreciation and amortization, $7 million in higher taxes, and $6 million in other net expenses."
