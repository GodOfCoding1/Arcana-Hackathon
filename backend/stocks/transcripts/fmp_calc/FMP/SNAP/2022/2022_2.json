    "content": " The second is investing heavily in our direct response advertising business, and we've articulated 3 key priorities there, including around investing in our first- and third-party measurement solutions as well as continuing to make improvements in our optimization and ranking and product innovation. What we have to do is stay focused on the inputs that we control, and that's around investing in our direct response business and making sure that we get improvements into our first- and third-party measurement solutions as well as continuing to invest in improving optimization and ranking and personalization. Number one, we're improving our first- and third-party measurement solutions; and two, through better ranking and optimization that delivers better optimization for our advertising partners and therefore return on ad spend over time; and then three is really about continuing to cultivate new sources of revenue across our business, and there's lots of opportunity for that. But I think more than anything, when you're thinking about us decelerating from what was a very rapid rate of growth to nearly flat or approximately flat growth currently, one of the challenges, I think, that is clearly difficult is that it's much easier to gain share when budgets are growing and when investment levels are growing. I think that opening up new sources of inventory and new sources of supply over time are really critical to the long-term growth and the long-term health of the business, which is why we're focused on continuing to invest in the growth of the community and continuing to invest in our content businesses and the Map and, of course, our AR capabilities so that we can generate more effective inventory over time."
