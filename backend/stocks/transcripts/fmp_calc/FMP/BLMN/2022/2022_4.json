    "content": " And so if you think about our productivity this year, this $50 million target, that's pretty much doubled, what we did from a productivity perspective in 2022 and the biggest chunk of that increase is coming from this technology initiative that we put in place both in the front of the house and in the back of the house. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. And I just think that equation is something that instead of reinvesting those dollars back in, I think that we feel like that's going to start to pay dividends from a traffic standpoint, as we move throughout the year and into next year. And the last thing I'd add is there's another way to get value to our customer and we talked about this with each of our brands, and that's continued to improve our service levels in our restaurants, we're seeing very good trends there. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Yes, and I'd say if you look at the productivity numbers, it's probably -- look and again, we've said we went from, call it, $25 million to $50 million, this year."
