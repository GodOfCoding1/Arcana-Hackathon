    "content": "   Operator: Good afternoon, and welcome to the Fiscal Year 2022 Third Quarter Results Conference Call for Dell Technologies Inc. During this call, unless we otherwise indicate, all references to financial measures refer to non-GAAP financial measures, including non-GAAP revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, operating income, net income, earnings per share, EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted free cash flow as well as an estimated non-GAAP revenue, operating income and EPS from continuing operations. Three quarters into our fiscal year, Dell Technologies has seen a record revenue of $79 billion, up 16%, along with record operating income of $8.4 billion, up 12%. ISG delivered revenue growth of 5% to $8.4 billion, which was our third consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth. CSG delivered revenue of $16.5 billion, which was up 35%, driven by strong demand across the board: commercial and consumer, notebooks and desktops and across all regions. For the third quarter, we saw a record revenue of $28.4 billion, up 21%, driven by growth in all three business units, led by another record quarter for CSG and continued growth in ISG. I realize it's pretty early, but I'm wondering if you can maybe give some more details on what you're hearing from customers, how we should think about growth in Project APEX then benefiting the $6 billion, I think, you're now running in terms of recurring revenue. And I would remind you, as you think about our capital allocation framework, 40% to 60% of our adjusted free cash flow is going to go towards shareholder capital return to the form of what we believe to be dividends and if the Board approves those next year, our share buyback and then obviously, investment in the business and debt reduction."
