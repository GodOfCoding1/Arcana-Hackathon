    "content": " However, during the second quarter, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen a significant shift in this dynamic driven by two factors: one, inflation has driven our workforce to seek employment that can and will pay higher wages; and two, more and more healthcare providers are willing to hire LPNs in this environment to replace or avoid paying higher rates for travel and temporary agency RNs. Please proceed with your question. In terms of quantifying either of those states, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not going to call that out because we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve already given guidance \u00e2\u0080\u0093 when we early released in July, we gave our guidance of $1.785 billion in revenue or not less than $1.785 billion in revenue and not less than $150 million in EBITDA. Please proceed with your question. I think when the world and the labor markets normalize and the rates can be adjusted to reflect whatever is going to be the new normal wage rate, I do believe we will get back to that growth in that 5% to 6% range year-over-year. Please proceed with your question. Please proceed with your question. Please proceed with your question. Please proceed with your question. Please proceed with your question.
