    "content": " While our team delivered strong production performance and project execution during the quarter, we are obviously experiencing challenging macroeconomic conditions, and these continue to impact operating costs and margins across the mining industry. Lower metal prices during the period, combined with approximately $10.3 million of out-of-period revenue adjustments that Wayne will discuss in greater detail, did impact our financial results during the third quarter. Third quarter revenues of $85.9 million were down approximately $29 million due to the combination of lower average copper and gold prices, lower quarter-on-quarter production and a higher allocation of copper concentrate sales to international customers as well as a $10.3 million in out-of-period adjustments related to the final settlements of provisionally priced copper concentrate shipments from the first half of 2022. In line with our growth initiatives, our capital expenditures increased to over $90 million in the third quarter and were partially offset by strong cash flows from operations of $43 million."
