    "content": " Copper production during the second quarter is also expected to benefit from mining in the upper levels of the Pilar Mine, including the first stope from our Project Honeypot initiative. With the inclusion of this first Project Honeypot stope, as well as incremental challange -- changes in our mine sequence through the rest of the year, we are now guiding to the high end of our full year copper production range of 43,000 to 46,000 tonnes of copper, and we expect production to be roughly equally weighted between the first and second halves of the year. First quarter C1 cash costs at MCSA Mining Complex of $1.31 per pound of copper produced and C1 cash costs and all-in sustaining costs at the NX Gold Mine of $638 and $1,092 per ounce, respectively, were influenced by recent strengthening of the Brazilian reais against the U.S. dollar as well as the influence of inflationary pressures being experienced across all industries. While we expect unit cost performance at our operations to benefit from higher production levels through balance of the year, given the impact of inflation and exchange rate volatility during the first quarter, we are currently taking a cautious approach and guiding to the high end of our 2022 operating cost guidance ranges. As David noted, our first quarter results reflect a continuation of strong margins and operating cash flows that contributed to record quarter end available liquidity of $540.5 million."
