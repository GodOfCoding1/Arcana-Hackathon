    "content": " At Xavantina operations, the impact of inflation was partially offset by higher processed gold grades during the year, resulting in full year C1 cash costs and all in sustaining costs of $560 and $1,124, respectively per ounce of gold produced. While our 2023 copper C1 cash cost guidance of $1.40 to $1.60 per pound assume 100% of our copper concentrate is sold to the export market, we resume domestic sales on a limited basis subsequent to year-end. As a result of this arrangement, we recognized a credit loss provision of $3.3 million in other finance expense during the quarter, which reduced our fourth quarter and full year adjusted net income attributable to owners of the company by approximately $0.04 per diluted share to $0.24 and $0.91, respectively. Our fourth quarter and full year financial results were also highlighted by adjusted EBITDA of $58.2 million and $208.6 million, respectively, as well as cash flow from operations of $34 million and $143.4 million, respectively. The collar established a floor price at $3.50 per pound of copper on total hedge volumes of 33,000 tons of copper, representing approximately 75% of full year production volume in 2023."
