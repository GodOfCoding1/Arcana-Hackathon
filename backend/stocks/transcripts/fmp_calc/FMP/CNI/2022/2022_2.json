    "content": " Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us for CN's Second Quarter 2022 Financial and Operating Results Conference Call. Before we begin, I'd like to draw your attention to the forward-looking statements and additional legal information available at the beginning of the presentation. As a reminder, today's conference call contains certain projections and other forward-looking statements within the meaning of the U.S. and Canadian securities laws. Joining us on the call today are Tracy Robinson, our President and CEO; Rob Reilly, our Chief Operating Officer; Doug MacDonald, our Chief Marketing Officer; and Ghislain Houle, our Chief Financial Officer. It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to CN's President and Chief Executive Officer, Tracy Robinson. Whether you're joining by phone or the webcast, welcome. Now last quarter, we laid out a number of principles that would guide the way that we run our business and the way that we grow. And while we continue to have work ahead of us, as I said last quarter, this is going to take some time. Now we've leaned into our scheduled operations, improving train performance and service to our customers, and we're seeing the beginnings of improvement in velocity. We've begun the work on our book of business to ensure that we're selling into our operating model in a manner that we can deliver to our customers, and we continue to improve our yield performance. More work to do, but we've got a great start. We achieved record revenues of $4.3 billion, up 21%. Now that's on 2% volume growth, higher fuel surcharge revenues and a strong yield management. The operating ratio for the quarter was 59%, a 260 basis point improvement over Q2 last year. The network is fluid, and the operating team has done a great job of improving performance across the network. The commercial teams had a strong quarter on yield, and bringing these together with the work of the rest of the team has enabled us to deliver a record EPS. We achieved $1.93 in the quarter, up 30% over last year. Now as I reflect on my first few months as CEO of this great organization, I got to say that every day, I feel more excited about the future of CN. I spent a lot of time during these last few months meeting with our employees across the system, with our customers, conversations with government and with our investors, including many of you. And since our Q1 call in April, I've spoken about some of my key priorities, and these remain the same. I am really encouraged with the start that we have, and we're far from done, as I said, but I'm seeing a team that is leaning in, doing it together, focused on bringing CN back to being a leader in the industry. But before I turn it over to them, I'll provide a few high-level thoughts. Secondly, it's about being thoughtful and intentional about our book of business. Our customer service levels are better, and we're going to stay focused on this. This is important as we ready ourselves for the volume coming, particularly in the Western network over the remainder of this year. We've seen over the years, a lot of growth in the Western corridor. And as we move forward, we're going to keep focusing on it. But we're also going to lean into more fully utilizing the other parts of the network, densify in the Eastern region, the Southern region. Now Doug is going to provide you with an update on the business environment and double-click a little bit on Halifax, which we believe is a gateway that will provide significant opportunities for CN in the future. Ghislain, Rob, Doug and I meet on a regular basis, and we look at pretty much every contract, every pricing decision. We worked the resource levels, whether it's crews, equipment, and we work our capital spend, where we're investing. Now our decision is not always easy, but we do it as a team, and I think it's driving the right outcomes. And finally, it's about ensuring that we grow the top line at the same time that we're growing the bottom line. Our results this quarter reflect this effort, and I'm pleased with our progress and our momentum here. And this team, see our full team, is focused on delivering solid results as we move into the second half of this year. The team delivered a very solid quarter of operational results, and I want to thank the employees in the field for their continued dedication and focus as we continue to progress on our plan. The initial focus was on train departures, and we started at our 4 hump yards in April. Since then, we've seen solid improvement in our origin on-time train departures, which reached over 90% in June, up 14% from June of 2021. It's also helped our connection performance, which was up 30% to nearly 80% in June. Clearly, the team has made solid progress on executing to the plan. While the second quarter is when the railroad typically gets its footing after coming out of winter, this year's performance is more than your typical improvement and highlights the dedication of the operating team to execute to the plan. The team achieved performance on a number of operating metrics that we haven't seen since prior to the pandemic, particularly in Western Canada, where car velocity is the fastest since Q2 of 2017, network train speed is the best since Q3 of '17 and through dwells, the lowest since Q3 of '16. While volumes were down in the West due to lower grain volumes, GTMs in our Southern region delivered all-time daily records for the quarter. In addition, this quarter, team -- this quarter, the team once again set an all-time record for fuel efficiency for CN and for the industry, which drove the avoidance of approximately 43,000 tons of carbon emissions. Our headcount is up 850 from the end of last year, with a large part of that increase being conductors as we prepare for a strong Q4. We're proud it's been over a year since we've experienced a serious injury in over 18 months since our last strategic fatality, both of which are the longest streaks in our company's history. With that, I'll now ask Doug to provide some color on the marketing side. Thanks, Rob, and kudos to you and the operating team for delivering a solid performance in Q2. We delivered positive volume growth in Q2, with RTMs up 2% and revenues up 21% despite a 40% decline in Canadian grain shipments. We saw solid growth in P&C from refined petroleum products and also crude oil, which is filling available capacity due to lower Canadian grain volumes. As we think about the second half of the year, we continue to assume low single-digit RTM growth for the year. The current demand remains strong, and we continue to dialogue with customers to monitor any signs of weakness. On grain, we are still expecting a Canadian grain crop over 70 million metric tons versus less than $50 million last year. We will continue to benefit from strong coal prices, higher production from Kanuma, restarts of CST and Coal Valley mines as well as continued strength in U.S. coal shipments, both domestic and export. Before I pass it on to Ghislain, let me take the opportunity to highlight an example on how we plan to densify the eastern part of our network. The Port of Halifax, which is solely served by CN has significant opportunities to attract additional container business in the future. We are working very closely with our partners, PSA Halifax, to leverage this unique gateway. With more production coming to Southeast Asia, we view Halifax as well positioned to accommodate this shift of production that wants to make its way to North America. Our service out of Halifax has the fastest transit times from the East Coast to Montreal, Toronto, Detroit and Chicago. Last month, we started a second daily service out of Halifax. And after 4 weeks, we have moved 24% more containers and reduced PSA's ground count by 27%. So in closing, my team's focus is on providing the level of service our customers have come to expect from us and driving top line growth to the bottom line. I will talk to Page 15 of the presentation, which will provide more visibility on our second quarter performance. The top line performance, combined with a solid operating performance, drove record earnings in the quarter. My comments will reflect adjusted results, which exclude advisory costs related to shareholder matters. We delivered adjusted operating income of nearly $1.8 billion in Q2, up 29%. Our Q2 adjusted operating ratio came in at 59%, which was 260 basis points lower than the same period last year. In the quarter, we were impacted with the unfavorable fuel surcharge lag versus last year. Adjusted diluted EPS reached a quarter record of $1.93, up 30% versus last year. We generated free cash flow of almost $1 billion in Q2, up over $250 million from last year, mainly due to higher earnings. Under our current share repurchase program, which runs from February 1, 2022, through January 31 of next year, we have repurchased just over 15 million shares for $2.3 billion as at the end of June. We remain confident on our outlook for the balance of the year and are reaffirming our 2022 financial outlook, including adjusted EPS growth in the range of 15% to 20% with an operating ratio that starts with a 5. We expect volumes in RTMs to be up in the low single-digit range for the year, with strong growth expected in the second half of the year, including a normalized Canadian grain crop starting in the fall. We continue to assume that in 2022, the average price of WTI will be in the range of USD 90 to USD 100 per barrel, and the value of the Canadian dollar in U.S. currency will average approximately $0.80 for the year. We are not modeling any major service disruptions in the second half of the year, and our outlook does not assume an economic recession. That being said, we have a strong bulk franchise, including grain, potash and coal that is less impacted by economic fluctuations and a current backlog of lumber traffic. While we are seeing some inflationary pressures starting to impact our costs, we are closely monitoring the situation and making sure that we control our expenses and continue to price above rail inflation on contract renewals. We have a strong balance sheet that provides us financial flexibility, and we will allocate our capital in a manner that drives long-term value for our shareholders. Doug provided you with 1 example, Halifax, with a significant opportunity to densify the eastern part of our network. And as highlighted by Rob, we're making some good progress on the operating side in the railroads fluid, and we're running faster and more efficiently. We will invest not only in our capacity to accommodate those growth opportunities, but also in our talent to develop the next generation of railroaders. This is a great company with a significant potential, and I'm very excited about our future. Certainly, it's going to be a different environment in the second half. Yes, Chris, when you look at 2022, it's really a tale of 2 halves. Really, the first half of this year has been driven by the southern portion of our network in GTMs and volume. But our focus in terms of running a scheduled railroad, as we've continued to emphasize here, we'll continue to pay dividends, and we'll continue to press that even in the high-volume times of the year, and we expect to see some benefits from that. And then just the sustainability of that into the back half of the year, your visibility there and expectations for next year as well. So listen, we don't really -- we don't guide on what our price is, but we continue to do it well above inflation. And really where the rest of it is coming from is with the supply chain disruptions that are out there, we're providing a lot of additional services to customers for storage and for other things that they need done. So we're actually able when you combine it all together, we've been able to keep well above rail inflation for our pricing. And we continue to see that it will happen really for the rest of this year, and we even see it into next year right now. Congratulations, Tracey and team, on a great quarter. Maybe, Doug, talk a little bit about the ramp of volumes. You noted the opportunity in the East Coast, but you need a sizable ramp to get to that low double -- low single-digit RTM target. Maybe talk about the rolling of grain, maybe the downside of economic pressure that you've built into targets in terms of getting to that target. Well, I'll talk about the markets, and then I'll turn it over to Rob to talk a little bit about the labor. But Ken, so I'll say, listen, a lot of this is going to come out of the Canadian grain crop. I'll say the only little hiccup we've seen recently is the international intermodal, and we've put place well we've put solutions in place for that, that are taking in effect right away actually. With that, I'll turn it over to Rob for any thoughts on labor. And from a labor standpoint, Ken, we have been preparing for this more normalized grain crop in Q4. And certainly, that's what it appears as we sit here today that we're going to be back to those levels. Other than some of the hard-to-hire locations that we typically see, we're in pretty good shape as we go into Q4. Some of the crew issues we experienced in the South where some of the geopolitical issues with Ukraine that really allowed us to move more freight in the South, so we've been hiring for that. As we look into next year, we'll continue to plan for attrition as well. We've shown the ability to adjust when it comes down to labor, we'll certainly take a look at that. But we walked through a number of scenarios out there, growth scenario and also something less than that and we'll be nimble. Obviously, with cars, locomotives, we can do things very quickly in terms of laying those up, and we'll do that as we start to see if we see any of those signs. So sticking on the intermodal theme, Rob, I've heard from some former colleagues in the shipping industry that you guys did metering service off of cost. I'm just wondering if the shift in volume up to the Eastern Canada, Northern Port could be tied to some of the backlogs we're seeing in some of the U.S. East Coast ports. So David, so really the issues are going to say more in line. So it's the Montreal, Toronto areas for us, and we've also seen it a little bit in Chicago. So with the warehouses being full, there's no place for the containers to go once they get in land. That's been backing up the terminals, which then backs up at the ports, which backs up ships at the harbor. At the same time, there's also been a shortage of drayage that we found out. So we've been working with the freight forwarders and the different drayage companies to be able to increase that, and we have seen it really improve in the month of July. So that's all good news, and we've seen dramatic improvement. Now what we're also doing is we're working on new storage locations in Toronto, which is up and running already and a new facility here just outside Montreal, which will be up and running next week. Now on Halifax, we don't have any customer commitments to give us specific volumes through there. We have to build up our service, which we already know is there, and that will attract the new business. So we did have already great success over the last 4 weeks, and we expect to see more of that with the customer base because of the service that's there. Anything from vessel schedules or  services that would give you confidence in sort of 2023 volume or --\n Sorry, David, you're breaking up. But first, let me say that we've got some pretty strong forecasts for fertilizers and grain. As we look forward, it's one of the unique benefits of our Canadian economy. So specifically, just around the fertilizer market, listen, we had actually a fairly wet spring, so we actually saw some lower volumes there in the first half. If you want to talk specifically about potash, we're seeing obviously a very strong market for offshore, and the domestic market suffered the same as the fertilizers, so we see that pick up in the second half as well. We have right now the -- we're starting on those targets in the right place, which is the fuel efficiency. So we have -- see, I think, Rob laid out a 4% improvement in fuel efficiency year-over-year, which is a tremendous improvement. And we continue to be, I think, the best in the railroad sector from a fuel efficiency perspective. Beyond that, we have a plan that will take us towards what is a scientific-based target that the team has developed. Just laying, I just wanted to understand the guidance, the EPS guidance for this year. If I look at the first half, adjusted EPS is up 20% year-over-year. So I guess to get to your full year guidance, it implies a step down in earnings power in the second half relative to what you did in the second quarter. And then, Tracy, I think -- I believe the company brought in Ed Harris as an operational consultant. I just wondering if you could talk about that, why did you and the team decide to bring him with the scope of his work is at CN and maybe share some of the results that has occurred since bringing him as well. Maybe I can start and then pass it on to you, Tracy back. So listen, yes, I mean, you heard a little bit of what Rob talked about in the second half of the year from an operating standpoint, and then Doug talked about what we can do from a revenue and volume standpoint. So when you do all of that math, we come in with, again, reaffirming our guidance of 15% to 20%. Now what -- like we said in here, and we purposely intentionally laid out our assumptions to help you guys understand how we get to those numbers. And as you can see as well, we are assuming a foreign exchange of $0.80. And if you look at it today, the current spot foreign exchange, I think, is $0.76 or $0.77. I think that last year, we did have a couple of service interruptions as well. And then when you get to the back end of the year, remember, we're the railroad of the north. So when you put all of these in, again, we feel comfortable with reaffirming our guidance of 15% to 20% and with an OR that starts with a 5. So if you remember, in Q1, we started a little bit from the back tees that on 66. We expected that because from a seasonality standpoint, Q2 is always better than Q1. And on this, maybe I'll turn it over to you, Tracy. When I came in and we were looking at what to do with our guidance on the year, we considered a whole range of scenarios and building kind of the expectations that we put in front of you last quarter. And I think just today laid out a number of the assumptions that we've made as we look to the remainder of the year, particularly on those things that we don't control, and you just spoke about them now. There's a lot of year left, and we're positive, we're optimistic. As to your second question, we have a few people on the property that are giving us advice, we're pretty intense on where we're going. And so one of those focus is, as you say, Ed Harris in on the consulting arrangement, largely for Rob's purposes. Our goal is really about improving every facet of our business, whether it's operations, marketing, finance, et cetera. So when we have opportunities to bring people in that can help with that and continues -- help us continually improve, we do it. Our operations is about running a safe, efficient operation that continually meets the service our customers expect and need. In the end, the team in the field is what will and is driving the results, and that's really where the credit goes. So on the pricing side, Tracy, you talked about the opportunity to revisit pricing on some of the business. The dialogue in the past have been at around mid-teens ROIC, and we've seen a few of your peers kind of move up into the high teens. So as we think about what we call curating the book of business or being intentional about the book of business, it's not just pricing about understanding our network and our operating plan and where we have capacity. So you heard Doug talk about this, where we have available capacity, whether it's short term or it's long-term, Doug's team sells into that. Where we have more demand than capacity and we can't operate effectively or deliver for our customers, and we make adjustments there as well. And in all cases, we ensure that we've got a book that pays at the appropriate price. So they sit as well being intentional, but what we're putting on our network, drive the right service, the right velocity and the right bottom line growth. And this isn't something that is -- I mean, I think this team has put a really hard shoulder into that this quarter. There will always be opportunities, and I expect it's something that we'll be talking about as we go forward as well. When it comes to our ROIC, I'll just say generally that what we're really focused on, and then I'll turn it over to Ghis. Tracy, I wanted to dig a little deeper on the freight operational alignment. And in the last 90 days, you've definitely taken a focus to the operations of the network, and it shows in a lot of the service metrics, even your outlook for the back half of the year, the double green arrows that Doug has all over to Slide 12. And so most of our focus is making sure that we manage that well, and well means that we're doing it in a way that delivers to our customers, whatever part of the network that we're on. Where we have other opportunities, different parts of the network, if we've got more capacity, we'll do more of what Doug and team have done with Rob in the last quarter, which is identify the capacity to look for the opportunities whether they be short, medium or long term to fill that, that drives growth to the top line. But as importantly, we do it when we can drive growth to the bottom line. So right now, what we're focused on is making sure that the way that we move this big volume that's coming to us in the second half of the year. So Ghislain, I just want to come back to the guidance. But if we're looking at this right, it implies second half operating ratio and volumes are better than second quarter, but the earnings may be potentially a little worse. I think that we ran a lot of different scenarios under -- with Tracy and Doug and the team, and I think I'll leave it at that. We've, as I said, intentionally put out our assumptions out there to help you guys. I know, Doug, you mentioned 600,000 TEUs and now added a second train that's led to a 24% increase. But my main question is on the West Coast, and with the labor disruption or potential labor disruption in LA Long Beach, historically, that's led to volume increases. So for Halifax, listen, it's -- yes, we're starting to train out. It's a little bit shorter than running a full train today as it leased, but we're also picking up a lot of freight in Moncton as well. And by the time that train is running through the rest of our Eastern operation, it's running at full size. So it's a combined train in the end, but which starts out as a full intermodal train, and it's -- so -- and we've been very successful with it. We can't do it day 1, but we got to start somewhere, and it's been working really well. On the West Coast, you're absolutely right. Listen, we haven't seen anything come up north yet. And right now, we are -- the terminals are kind of full in Canada already. So we're working on bringing those numbers down for them, so they're fluid. Doug, I guess in response to that question, you talked about your -- I think, still metering into Toronto and Montreal, if that's correct. So the metering, it has really went on in June more than anything else and for the first half of July. So last week, we put in a new solution in Toronto and what that's allowing us to do is to vacate the terminals. So the issue was that we would -- the boxes would arrive in Montreal and Toronto, and no one would pick them up because there wasn't any place to take them. With respect to Montreal, our solution really starts up next week, and we'll be in the same position there. So that's how that's working, and we expect to see all of August running at full speed, if not higher. Now with respect to the -- we have seen no weakness at all in any of our markets, and we'll keep giving that guidance until some of our customers tell us differently. So Steve, we actually really plan around it. So me and Rob talk about it every month, we go through it with the customers as well. And really, it's 1 larger customer who has the opportunity to do it. It's moving from the Alberta market down into the Gulf Coast, and we've been taking it month by month. So we actually -- we've agreed to take it, I'll say, through the rest of -- partially through the rest of Q3, and probably we'll finish -- and it will finish in Q3. So when grain starts at the end of September, we expect that to be using the capacity and we are fully planning for it, and we will take the crude off the table at that point. Again, based on how excited you guys sound about it, and it sounds like your poor partners and customers as well, it doesn't sound like you guys expect a meaningful shift in near-shoring over time impacting volumes coming in to North America from Asia. So if you can just unpack what do you think happens with that over time, that would be great. So with Halifax, no, we're seeing lots of volume shift over to Southeast Asia for production and for sourcing. And that's coming in -- coming to the East Coast, just as easily as go to the West Coast. Halifax is greatly positioned to take on more of it, and we're working with the customers to do that. And really, that's what the focus has been. There's a lot of talk, and we've seen a little bit of it, but nowhere near that, anything that will impact the volumes for this year or next. Maybe on the -- thanks, Ravi. On the strike impact, I would say, these were 750 unionized folks that were on strike for 16 days. And again, I want to thank our management team under Rob's leadership and Tom Hillier's leadership that kept the railroad running without any blip in the quarter. So I really want to thank all that team that did a wonderful job keeping, as I said, the railroad running flawlessly and safely in the second quarter. So some -- I guess, a question on the intermodal side. Revenue per piece was up, I think, 33%, so a pretty big increase in revenue per piece in intermodal. Obviously, some Walmart news recently that points to softness in the consumer, and I guess that's been kind of a concern for a while. So Tom, so on the revenue per unit, so those numbers, we don't really give guidance on that. So really, what we've done is we've seen continued progression with taking pricing action also on our contract renewals. So we've seen that, and we'll continue to see that. We still see lots of the bullet effect of volumes coming in, trying to go as in a lockdown, volumes drop off, but we're expecting not to see a normalized supply chain to see those storage charges continue for the rest of this year at least. Now on the consumer softness on the international, we're seeing some small dips here and there, but that's more of -- it's just the supply chain. We're not seeing anything around the demand side right now, and the customers say, we may be soft because of some demand issues this month, but next month, they're telling us, please expect a full boat load to come in. And right now, it's to keep running what we're doing. So I wanted to ask about kind of as we think about risks heading into 2023, obviously, there's this big merger kind of pending. You mentioned the uniqueness of CN's network, obviously, being as tri-coastal network. I would say that we're playing our own game, and we're pretty focused on it. You've heard us say before that when this railroad is operating at its best, that it's pretty tough to compete with. As far as the customer front, I mean, I think we're always working with our customers to try and ensure that we are positioned properly for the way they see their business going and growing in the future, and that continues to be the case. Like we constantly evaluate risk with our customers and where they want to go, what markets and where we can go. So the risk is very low for us to begin with, but we'll work with our customers whatever risk there is there and make sure that they can get their products to market. Justin, listen now, just for a matter of modeling, we have all of those businesses in the model, and they are part of the guidance that we've offered. As I'm watching some of those businesses, actually, it's kind of cool there becoming TransX in particular, becoming increasingly efficient and competitive. Tracy and team, congrats on the quarter. We believe with the shift to Southeast Asia that from a cost and, I'll say, timing perspective, it's just as easy to come through the canal system Suez Canal over to the East Coast, and we think we can get there. So we think we provide a great service that services those key markets in Montreal, Toronto as well as Detroit and Chicago. There's also other markets we can reach to, but those are the key ones. There is the potential for it to come from New York, New Jersey, Baltimore, even Savannah, if it's not moving in an optimal powder. So your U.S. subsidiary is bargain with the U.S. rail carriers, and there's some uncertainty as to what that actual union wage increase is going to be from 2020 forward. So yes, so we have accrued for potential back-end wages in the U.S., and we believe at this point that these accruals are appropriate. And if there's a change from what -- from when the negotiation is completed or the mediation completed, then we will make that change when that happens. But I would tell you that we have accrued it, and we believe that it's appropriate. Just from an understanding standpoint, we certainly understand the inflationary pressures are real on all of our workers and all the rail workers in the U.S. And we look forward as much as they do in getting this thing settled and done and moving forward. Well, we're not going to go into that detail, obviously. And as I said, the -- all the railroads in the U.S. are in mediation as we speak. And to Rob's point, I think we're looking forward to get this done and move forward. And your presentation, you mentioned you brought on about 800 employees, I think, since the end of last year. So when we made the cuts last year, that was not focused on our running trades or anyone who operates the trains. And as far as how it's changing in the field, Rob, I'm going to hand that one over to you. Really, you've seen the surge really in conductor hiring. And we've been preparing for this normalized grain crop here in Q4, and that's really where you've seen it. If you have some additional questions, I know you know all of you how to reach out to him."
