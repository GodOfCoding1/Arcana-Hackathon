I don't think -- we're going to look to the outside unless Tracy's got plans I'm not aware of, but I like this team. And so we have discussions and we'll be in negotiations this year with a number of them, and we look forward to that opportunity to work out what an agreement on what works for them and what works for us, and we think that we're going to find something that's in between."
