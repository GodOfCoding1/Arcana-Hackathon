So my gut would tell me that probably commercial like in the second half of last year really gained momentum and perhaps consumer slows down a bit, but I\u2019m \u2013 we\u2019re pleased and by the resilience of the consumer side of the business and how it\u2019s growing. Your line is open. I think last time I may have said that the loan growth would probably absorb all the excess cash and securities portfolio runoff sometime in the third quarter, it looks like now because the deposits are still flowing in that\u2019ll probably take place in the fourth quarter, but we still think we\u2019ll be able to standard $10 billion at the end of this year. And then maybe finally for me, just on the fee income guidance if you could kind of give a little more detail on what you\u2019re thinking in terms of or what you\u2019re assuming in terms of mortgage banking from here that allows you to get to kind of recoup that on the other side with the rest of the line items and fees. And then one other thing, the line item you see on the income statement, it\u2019s a swap fee income just with a commercial being where it is in the first quarter that that swap fee income line is almost always commensurate with commercial lending. Your line is open. And secondly, to piggyback on another question around the $10 billion asset threshold, the 10% earning asset growth for 2022, really puts you \u2013 if you have similar growth next year kind of puts you right up on the really or probably over realistically right at the earn assets are 9.8, 9.9. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open."
