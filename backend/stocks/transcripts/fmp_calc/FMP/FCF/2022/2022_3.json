    "content": " As Mike mentioned, the combination of 13.3% annualized loan growth and 38 basis points of margin expansion produced strong financial results for the quarter. This would include roughly another $0.5 million for incentive accruals that were adjusted upwards in recognition of higher loan production in the third quarter and improved performance, and the continued build-out of our equipment finance business. In light of third quarter results, however, we are updating our previous non-interest expense guidance of $56 million to $57 million per quarter to $58 million to $59 million per quarter, but we'll obviously update guidance for 2023 to reflect the Centric acquisition when appropriate. So we think going forward if the Fed does hike in the fourth quarter, we're going to pass some of that along to our depositors and that's the term period beta assumption. So I mean if there are no hikes in the first, second, third quarter next year if the Fed holds path, our deposit rates will continue to rise just like everybody else such that we still think at the end of the cycle cumulatively, it will end up totaling around 20%. So if the Fed fund raise rates by 100 basis points, we expect passing on 20% of that the profits in the fourth quarter, only the current period. And the rate forecast I gave you actually is based on our -- that's based on our latest rate forecast that we received that it currently expects 275 basis point hikes, so 150 basis points of rate increases in the Fed funds rate by year-end."
