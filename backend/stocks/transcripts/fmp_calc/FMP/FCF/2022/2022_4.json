    "content": "  For the fourth quarter, a $5.7 million increase in net interest income combined with a $1.6 million decrease in non-interest expense to more than offset a $1.6 million decline in non-interest income and a $3.2 million increase in provision expense, despite higher provisioning due mostly to loan growth, credit trends improved on virtually all fronts for the year and the quarter. Equipment finance balances ended the year at approximately $80 million, with equipment finance getting up to speed, we expect loan growth to be around 10% in 2023, which together with our expanding net interest margin should produce strong growth in net income that will lead to positive operating leverage."
