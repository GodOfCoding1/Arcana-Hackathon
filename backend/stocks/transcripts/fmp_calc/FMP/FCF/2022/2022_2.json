    "content": "  Net income of $30.8 million produced core earnings per share of $0.33 for the second quarter of 2022, which was up by $0.04 over the first quarter, robust annualized loan growth of 10.8% ex PPP, coupled with net interest margin expansion to 3.38% helped drive a $5.5 million improvement in net interest income to $73.7 million and a $5.8 million improvement in core pretax pre-provision net revenue to $42.5 million in the second quarter, and that's despite a $1.2 million decline in PPP income, noninterest or fee income was up $535,000 in the second quarter to $24.5 million, as increases in swap, interchange income and mortgage were offset by a downdraft in SBA gain on sale income."
