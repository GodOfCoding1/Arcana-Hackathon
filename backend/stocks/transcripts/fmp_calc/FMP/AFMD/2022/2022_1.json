    "content": " For the AFM13 study in combination with natural killer cells, following the compelling data that we reported in December of last year, we presented updated data at AACR, and we showed a strong increase in complete responses after two cycles of therapy at the recommended Phase 2 dose in very encouraging signs of durability. As you know, we are conducting two studies with AFM13: our registration-directed study for AFM13 monotherapy in patients with relapsed/refractory peripheral T-cell lymphoma also known as REDIRECT study; and our Phase 1/2 study that we are conducting in collaboration with MD Anderson and where we are evaluating cord blood-derived allogeneic NK cells that are pre complex with AFM13, followed by AFM13 monotherapy in patients with relapsed and refractory CD30-positive lymphomas. In the second combination study, instigating the combination of AFM24 with autologous NK cells, SNK01, how we are treating patients with non-small cell lung cancer, again, EGFR white type, squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck and colorectal cancer. As summarized on Slide 7, at NK 2022 in May, we presented preclinical data, demonstrating that AFM28 induces lysis of CD123-positive leukemic blasts of AML patients and that it effectively kills CD123-positive tumor cells, either pre complex or co-administered with cryopreserved NK cells. By combining AFM24 with adaptive NK cell therapy, it is by redirecting these allogeneic NK cells to CD123-positive tumor cells, we believe that AFM28 can induce the depth of response necessary to meaningfully improve outcomes in patients with AML and MDS.
