    "content": " The second AFM13 study is the Phase I/II study in collaboration with the MD Anderson Cancer Institute, evaluating co-blood-derived natural killer cells pre-complex with AFM13, followed by single agent AFM13 treatment, again, in patients with relapsed/refractory CD30-positive lymphoma. Data presented at this year's AACR conference by Dr. Yago Nieto, the lead investigator of the trial at MD Anderson, demonstrated that after a second cycle of treatment, the complete response rate at the recommended Phase II dose increased from 38%, as reported in December 2021, to 62%. As of July 31, 30 patients have now been treated, including 24 at the recommended Phase II dose of 1x10^8 cord blood-derived NK cell per kilogram, which represents an additional 11 patients treated at that dose since our latest data update at ACR. As shown on Slide 5, we continue to enroll patients in all 3 ongoing studies, including the expansion cohort for our monotherapy study and the dose escalation for the combination studies, one with atezolizumab and the other one with the SNK01 autologous NK cell product from NKGen."
