    "content": " We are in track to launch our Esports product in Calendar 2022, including Esports Book, which will be our regulated sports betting product with a focus on Esports throughout Europe and other regulated markets that we have access to and Browser Bets, which is our unique browser extension that will allow a consumer to bet directly in the video stream that they're watching. Keep in mind, there are already 550 million fans of Esports globally, and we are here to build products for that audience by developing odds and models, that is fair to the consumer, a modern UI UX that gives them the site they're comfortable with and technologies that allow them to bet where they watch the sports they love. And then just, I guess one more clarification, if I can slip it in, you talked about calendar 2022, the two new products, the Esports book in Europe and the Browser Beds ES Sports that's the odds tightening, the technology you've kind of invested in to drive the lower odds for consumers. Esports book is actually full scale sports book dedicated to Esports consumers, but people that also want to play on traditional sports book as well, focused towards Gen Z and Millennials, but we're able to launch that product through regulated markets like the UK and Germany, whereas Gogawi is more focused on countries like the Philippines, Brazil and Thailand."
