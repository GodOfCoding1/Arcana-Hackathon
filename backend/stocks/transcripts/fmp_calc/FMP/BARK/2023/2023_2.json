    "content": " Total revenue in the fiscal second quarter was $143.8 million, a 20% improvement compared to the same period last year. Our healthy top line performance, coupled with continued cost efficiencies resulted in an adjusted EBITDA loss of $2 million, a $6.8 million improvement compared to the same period last year, an $11 million improvement from the previous quarter and $6 million ahead of our guidance for the quarter. And while we still have work to do, we are raising our full year adjusted EBITDA guidance for the second quarter in a row to negative $31 million. Overall, total revenue was $143.8 million, up 20% compared to last year, and roughly $9 million ahead of our guidance for the quarter. Our EBITDA margin also improved to negative 1.4%, up roughly 6 points compared to Q2 last year and better than our previous five quarters. Nonetheless, our full year guidance of negative $31 million suggests that we will cut our adjusted EBITDA loss nearly in half or a $27 million improvement compared to fiscal year 2022. In the most recent quarter, we booked a charge of $1 million related to these warrants, as compared to a gain of $23.4 million in the same period last year. On that note, GAAP net loss last quarter was $11.9 million as compared to net income of $6.4 million last year. On an adjusted basis, which removes the impact of the warrants and other items, our net loss improved by 39% to $6.7 million as compared to $11 million last year. Adjusted EBITDA was negative $2 million, a 77% improvement compared to the negative $8.8 million we generated last year. Through the first half of fiscal 2023, we had negative operating cash flows of approximately $35 million which is a substantial improvement compared to last year."
