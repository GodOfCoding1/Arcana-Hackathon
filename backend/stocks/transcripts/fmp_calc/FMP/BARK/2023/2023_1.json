    "content": " Our average order value for the quarter came in at $31.7, an increase of nearly $2 compared to the same quarter last year, and nearly $1 compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022. Another driver of our recent direct-to-consumer revenue growth was cross-selling, which drove $10 million of revenue, a 42% increase compared to the same quarter last year. And to that point, what makes our recent average order value growth and cross-selling revenue even better is that we acquired these higher value customers at a highly efficient cost of acquisition coming in at $50.80 for the quarter. Last quarter, direct-to-consumer revenue from Bright increased 169% to $2.4 million with a 55.4% gross margin for the quarter. For the fiscal second quarter, we expect total revenue of $135 million and adjusted to EBITDA loss of $8 million, a meaningful improvement compared to our fiscal first quarter. Therefore, look for us to deliver $135 million in revenue in the second quarter with an $8 million adjusted EBITDA loss and a full year adjusted to EBITDA loss of $33 million now, we look forward to updating you on our progress throughout the year. First quarter revenue was $131.2 million, up roughly 12% year-over-year. Looking at our top line in more detail, direct-to-consumer revenue came in at $118.4 million, up 12% compared to the same period last year. Total G&A was $79.6 million in the first quarter, an increase of roughly $10 million compared to the same period last year and roughly $5 million less than our fiscal fourth quarter of 2022. On an adjusted basis, which excludes stock based compensation, the impact of our outstanding warrants and other one-time items, net loss was $16.4 million in the first quarter compared to an adjusted net loss of $10 million in fiscal 2022. And lastly, our adjusted EBITDA loss was $13 million in the first quarter as compared to a loss of $7.6 million in the same period last year."
