    "content": " Those great moments we created for our customers allowed us to build a category defining brands serving millions of dogs, with a predictable recurring revenue business, and impressive 60% gross margins, due to us exclusively selling our own products. Through the first nine months of fiscal 2022, our top line is up over 42% compared to the same period last year, we added an impressive 371,000 new subscriptions, bringing our total active users to 2.3 million, which is a 30% increase year over year. Overall, we see attractive opportunities to further increase our average order value as we unify the BARK experience and more effectively cross sell products, particularly food and dental to both new and existing customers. Through the first nine months of fiscal 2022, this cross sell and upsell revenue was $23.2 million, an increase of 84% year over year on the back of stronger conversion and engagement by our customers. The 2.3 million active customers on hand $229 million in cash on the balance sheet, robust data on over $6 million in the US, a vertically integrated recurring revenue model where we enjoy high 50% to low 60% gross margins and a fantastic team. Beginning at the top of the P&L, total revenue came in at $140.8 million, a 34% increase compared to the same period last year. The growth in our DTC business was driven by several factors, including a 22% increase in subscription shipments, and a $2.12 increase in average order value compared to the same period last year. Turning to the commerce side of the business, revenue was $22.7 million, a 52% increase compared to last year. We expect total fiscal 2022 revenue to come in around $505 million, which reflects us more formally baking in the 2% revenue risk, which was largely related to the ongoing macro supply chain environment that we articulated on our previous earnings call."
