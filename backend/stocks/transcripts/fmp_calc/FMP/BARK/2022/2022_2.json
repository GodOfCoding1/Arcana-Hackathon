    "content": " Last quarter, our add-to-box feature drove roughly $6 million of DTC revenue, a 75% increase compared to the same period last year. Beginning at the top of the P&L, total revenue came in at $120.2 million, a 39% increase compared to the same period last year. On an adjusted basis net loss, which excludes stock-based compensation, the impact of outstanding warrants and other one-time items was $11 million, compared to adjusted net income of $1.4 million in the second quarter last year. The delta versus our previous guidance of negative $30.5 million is largely the result of increased shipping and fulfillment costs, which include higher shipping rates, demurrage ports fees and our decision to upgrade certain customer shipments to offset potential delays associated with broader shipping congestion."
