    "content": " During fiscal year 2022, total revenue increased 34% to $507 million. Subscriptions shipments increased 28% to 14.9 million, while the average order value per shipment increased year-over-year by $1.32 or nearly 5% without a base price increase. Altogether, we encourage charges of $13 million in the fourth quarter and 16 million for the full year 2022, related to these inventory related adjustments, which adversely impacted our gross margin for the year. Overall for the year, we built on our solid foundation, revamped our supply chain operation to accommodate future growth, rounded out a fantastic team efficiently acquired over 1 million new high value subscribers and ended the year with roughly $200 million in cash on hand, all of which sets us up for a strong future. On the EBITDA front, we expect an adjusted EBITDA loss of $36 million, which represents a 38% improvement compared to last year\u2019s loss of $57.8 million. For the first quarter of fiscal year 2023, we expect an adjusted EBITDA loss of $18 million, or roughly half of the full year loss in the first quarter. Moving on, we added 242,000 new subscriptions last quarter, bringing our total active subscriptions to roughly 2.3 million, a 30% increase year-over-year. Our resulting customer acquisition cost last quarter came in at $44.36, which was $7.11 below the same period in fiscal 2021. advertising and marketing expense was 74.4 million, up roughly 7 million compared to fiscal 2021."
