    "content": " Our proven business strategy emphasizing brand building paid off meaningfully in Q1, and the strong results we\u2019ll discuss in detail are a key factor enabling us to raise our fiscal year guidance. This revenue outlook assumes a few key factors: one, that the travel-impacted portion of our business will continue at the recovered levels for the remainder of the year; two, we still anticipate flat sales to prior year in the cough and cold and head lice areas of our business; and three, the acquisition of the Akorn portfolio discussed today should contribute approximately $40 million to the fiscal year net sales. So I think we\u2019re entering a period that\u2019s going to be tough to understand, but I think the important thing for our outlook in our business is that our base business continues to do very well with strong growth in consumption gains across the portfolio, not just a recovery in some of the COVID disruptive categories. And then, finally, on free cash flow, it seemed like you were kind of stuck at that $200 million level for a couple of years, but you\u2019ve really taken a bump up in terms of your annual free cash flow. So if you go and you look at the share, the consumption level for our brands compared to fiscal \u201819 and \u201820, we\u2019re seeing long-term consistent gains in growth over that period of time. So our business has been killing it really for a long period of time and it\u2019s one of the messages we\u2019re trying to make sure that you folks get today, which is continued solid performance across the portfolio, driven by our long-term brand-building approach."
