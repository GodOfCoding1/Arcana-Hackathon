    "content": " On today's call, we're going to review the results of the third quarter fiscal 2022, provide an updated on our full year outlook and then take questions from analysts. Revenues of $275 million in Q3, grew 15% versus the prior year, a consistent performance with trends experienced year-to-date. Additionally, the quarter experienced sales and consumption rebounds in certain categories that have been impacted by COVID-19, most notably cough and cold.. And our international segment also increased double digits to record quarterly revenues driven by broad-based strength for the segment's flagship brand, Hydralyte. Q3 revenue of $274.5 million, increased 14.9% and 8.8% on an organic basis versus the prior year, the latter excluding the acquisition of Akorn, which added $13.7 million in the quarter. For the first nine months we generated $193.8 million in free cash flow, up about 22% versus the prior year due to the strong operating performance just discussed, as well as lower CapEx in fiscal 2022. Your line is open. Your line is open. But today's comments were meant, want to reinforce how we feel good about the business that our underlying categories excluding the COVID categories that are certainly getting a tailwind this year continue to be positioned well for continued organic growth. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open."
