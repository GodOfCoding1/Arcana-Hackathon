    "content": " On today's call, we'll review the fiscal 2022 results, review the business attributes of Prestige that continue to enable our success, offer full year 2023 outlook, and then take questions from analysts. In the last several years, we've acquired well-positioned brands, such as Summer's Eve and TheraTears, while divesting non-strategic and poorly positioned brands, such as our household cleaning business. As consumers look for alternatives to a doctor's office visit, we invested in our Touch of Science campaign in fiscal 2022, which helps remind consumers of the benefits of treating at home with Compound W. In summary, our company's agility around brand building is a strength that allows each of our brands to succeed in various environments. Starting off from an approximate $400 million revenue base, we've been able to generate over 9% revenue growth and mid-teens earnings and free cash flow growth annually through execution of our strategy and transformation to a pure play consumer healthcare company. And there's a lot of attention around the attributes that we've been talking about for 10 plus years here, whether it's the stability and ability to grow long-term, well-positioned financial profiles of these segments of business."
