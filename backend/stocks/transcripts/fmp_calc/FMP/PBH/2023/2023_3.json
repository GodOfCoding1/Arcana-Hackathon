So make the important note here on the supply chain is that we continue to operate in a challenged environment, we have been trying to add to inventory for a good year now we made some progress in Q4, really as a way to add buffer to the categories that are doing well and get ourselves in a good position to support continued growth next year and improve our service levels. Your line is open. So let me start I guess with a comment on overall momentum of the business like I said on the prepared remarks today, we continue to feel good about the positioning of the business, the consumption trends behind many of our brands, and we feel that we are positioned for continued growth in fiscal 2024 after two record years top and bottom line in a row. I think of, so if I start with about a 56% gross margin as the base, we will continue - excuse me, we will continue to look for opportunities to take pricing actions, that can also come in the form of new product development, as it has historically and which is a big focus for our company, as you know, in addition to continued multiyear cost saving projects that we have going on. I think Ron, Ron is at the start of this year, you think he talked about the possibility of perhaps shipping a bit ahead of consumption in fiscal 2023, as there was still a need to establish a better in stock levels, maybe across certain categories coming out of the pandemic, it kind of feels like, you might be in that same situation right now, as you kind of looked at 2024. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open."
