    "content": " As mentioned last quarter, while the average number of months our new customers are taking to implement the VTEX platform continues to be above the historical average, we see no structural changes in the demand for the VTEX platform. Subscription revenue reached $36.6 million in the second quarter of 2022 from $29.7 million in the same quarter last year, a year-over-year increase of 24% in U.S. dollars, and 17% on FX neutral basis. Our non-GAAP operating income margin from existing stores has ranged between 35% and 15% in 2020 2021, respectively, giving us a clear path to continue executing our growth plans, while also seeing our potential operating margin opportunity. We had a solid performance in Q2, and for the second half of the year, we will continue focusing on helping our customers outperform the market while also improving our gross margin and operating income margins. Therefore, we are currently targeting revenue in the $37.0 million to $38.0 million range for the third quarter of 2022, implying a year-over-year growth of 18% in U.S. dollars and 20% on FX neutral basis in the middle of the range. When I look for the guidance in 2022, if I consider what you already deliver, and $38 million in the third Q the top of the range for the third Q, you'd need to deliver something like $47 million in the fourth Q is like 23% acceleration quarter-over-quarter, which is higher than what happened last year."
