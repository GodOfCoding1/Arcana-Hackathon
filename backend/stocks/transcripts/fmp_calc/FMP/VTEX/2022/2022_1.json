    "content": " Subscription revenue increased to $32.6 million in the first quarter of 2022, from $24.7 million in the first quarter of 2021, a year-over-year increase of 32.1% in U.S. dollars and 27.7% on an FX neutral basis. Therefore, we are currently targeting revenue in the $37.5 million to $38.5 million range for the second quarter of 2022, implying a year-over-year growth of 23% in U.S. dollars and 20% on an FX neutral basis in the middle of the range. For the full year 2022, given the macro conditions and recent volatility as previously mentioned, we expect a FX neutral year-over-year revenue growth of 24% to 27%, implying a range of $160 million to $164 million based on the first quarter average FX rates. Wrapping up today\u2019s call, VTEX had a solid start of the year, with robust top line performance, margins expansion, strong backlog undergoing implementation, and of course many new exciting products and partnerships now available in our platform."
