    "content": " We reported sales of $27.6 million in the second quarter of 2022, an increase of 9% from $25.2 million in the second quarter of 2021. Net income for the second quarter of 2022 was $4.4 million or $0.58 per diluted share, an increase of 41% from earnings of $3.1 million or $0.41 per diluted share in the year earlier quarter. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s our 3D and 2D sensors declined 4% year-over-year to $6.8 million in the second quarter of 2022, reflecting normal fluctuations in demand from OEM customers. Within this category, sales are 3D MRS sensors increased 11% year-over-year to $4.8 million. Sales of inspection and metrology systems rose 6% in the second quarter of 2022 to $13.3 million, up from the robust level of $12.6 million posted in the year earlier period. This growth was driven by record sales of SQ3000 Multi-Function inspection systems, which increased 33% year-over-year to $8.3 million. During this year, second quarter we received $5.4 million of 3D MX orders from recurring customers that are -- that increased our MX backlog to $9.3 million at June 30th. CyberOptics backlog at June 30, 2022, reached a record $55.5 million, up from $47.4 million at the end of this year\u00e2\u0080\u0099s first quarter and $45.3 million at June 30, 2021. We are forecasting sales of $26 million to $29 million for the third quarter of 2022 ending September 30th, compared to the record sales of $27.8 million reported in the third quarter of 2021. Cash and marketable securities totaled $36.8 million at Jun 30, 2022, compared to $38.2 million at the end of this year\u00e2\u0080\u0099s first quarter and $38.3 million at December 31, 2021. But I do think in the back half here, as we start to collect some of these June 30 receivable, as you will see cash grow and certainly expect it to be north of $40 million by -- certainly by the time the year wraps up."
