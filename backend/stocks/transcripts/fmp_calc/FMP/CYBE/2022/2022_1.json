    "content": " Within this category, sales of 3D MRS sensors rose 15% year-over-year to $4.9 million in the year\u2019s first quarter. Sales of semiconductor sensors, principally our WaferSense line of sensors, increased 34% year-over-year to $6.8 million in the first quarter of 2022. Total SQ3000 sales related to mini-LED applications came to $619,000 in this year\u2019s first quarter. CyberOptics backlog at the end of this year\u2019s first quarter totaled $47.4 million, up from $47.3 million at December 31, 2021, and $32.4 million at the end of first quarter of 2021. Cash and marketable securities totaled $38.2 million at the end of this year\u2019s first quarter, down slightly from $38.3 million at December 31, 2021 and up from $32.3 million at the end of the first quarter of 2021. As we get closer to the end of the second quarter, there\u2019s a chance that the $2 million in Q4 could move into Q3, but we\u2019ll know more about that in the next few months. And any guess \u2013 I know it\u2019s truly a guess that you tried how long the valuation will be with that first system I mean obviously, they\u2019ve done a lot of valuations with wafers et cetera, to get to this point to pull the trigger."
