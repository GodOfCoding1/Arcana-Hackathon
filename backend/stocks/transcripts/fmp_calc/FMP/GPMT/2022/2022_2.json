    "content": " Through the first two quarters of 2022, our loan fundings of over $380 million exceeded the $290 million of repayments, resulting in modest growth in portfolio balance. Given the uncertain macroeconomic landscape and broader market trends, during the second quarter, we increased our reserve for credit losses and downgraded one of our office loans to a risk-rating of 5. The repayments year-to-date totaled approximately $450 million and have been spread across various property types, including over $185 million of office loans. Consistent with this approach, given our liquidity position, low leverage and the discounted valuation of our stock, during the second quarter we accretively repurchased in the open market over 1.5 million common shares totaling over $15 million, which benefited our second quarter book value by about $0.17 per share, and helped meaningfully offset the charge related to the repayment of the term loan borrowings. Despite unprecedented interest rate and overall market volatility, our business has delivered solid operating performance led by our well-diversified and resilient portfolio of senior loans, generating good run rate earnings, supporting an attractive dividend. Our repayments and loan paydowns, totaled about $120 million in the second quarter, which were outpaced by loan fundings and resulted in modest portfolio growth. During the quarter, we moved one of our office loans to a risk ranking of five, put the loan on non-accrual status given our expectations for a potential loss, and established a $4.5 million credit reserve. Our year-to-date repayments of about $450 million across various property types, include over $185 million in office loans with the remainder spread across hotels, multifamily and other sectors."
