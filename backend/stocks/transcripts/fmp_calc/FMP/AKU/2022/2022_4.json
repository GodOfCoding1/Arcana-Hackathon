    "content": " And you will see in the chart on the left, Radiology segment contributed $625 million of revenue for the full year 2022, representing approximately 83% of total revenues. Given that the clinical labor issue is showing signs of improvement thus far in 2023, we should begin to see improving volume growth, driving revenue and adjusted EBITDA growth as year progresses as well as improvement in margin considering our significant operating leverage. So we will continue to do what we need to do in terms of sales effectiveness in our fixed sites, and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re confident that we will get back to that mid-single digit growth of those fixed sites again, just like we did in the first half of this year before the second half because the clinical labor short is now behind us, and we start to see signs of that. So, the reason we start to see organic growth again in the business in the beginning of this year is because actually our labor \u00e2\u0080\u0093 our access to labor is much better, meaning what, meaning some of the contracted labor that kind of left the business in the second half of the year and it was referred to as in healthcare as the great resignation is coming back. In 2022, we generated $750 million in revenues and served patients in more than 210 fixed sites of radiology and oncology with more than 4,000 team members across the U.S. Our transformation and growth initiatives are well underway, and we expect 2023 to be a milestone year as we build on this solid foundation."
