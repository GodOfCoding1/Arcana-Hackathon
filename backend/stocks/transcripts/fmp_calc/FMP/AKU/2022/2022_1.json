    "content": " In the bottom right-hand chart Q1, '22 TTM pro forma normalized results assume the Akumin and Alliance businesses were combined for the entire period while adjusting for the divestiture of Alliance's Interventional segments which was completed in the first half of 2021 and Alliance Oncology of Arizona which is divested in Q4 of 2021. We expect consolidated revenues to be in the range of $760 million to $780 million of revenues, which is primarily a result of same-store organic revenue growth across the entire platform, but small contribution as well from business development initiatives in our pipeline. It's \u2013 I think it's going to provide us new opportunities to grow our revenues, because now whether it's in the mobile platform whether it's a specific fixed site we've made that investment and we're incentivized to drive volumes through the sites to leverage our investment in that new asset. That's one of the reasons why we're seeing from our previous guidance, the current guidance, $10 million reduction in our overall CapEx. And the impact of wage inflation throughout -- not only us, but the entire healthcare industry and we're all dealing with that issue and trying to manage that as well as staffing across the entire organization employee retention and attracting some to the organization, because at the end the day we do -- us like any other health care providers we have a high fixed cost."
