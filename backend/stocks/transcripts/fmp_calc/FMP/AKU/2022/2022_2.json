    "content": " The Q2 2022 trailing 12 month pro forma results assume the Akumin and Alliance businesses were combined for the entire period, while we adjusted for the divestitures of Alliance\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Interventional segments, which was completed in the first half of 2021 and Alliance Oncology of Arizona, which is divested in the fourth quarter of 2021. You\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll see the charts on the top left that in Q2, the Radiology segment contributed $160.9 million of revenue, which is approximately 84% of our total revenues with an adjusted EBITDA margin of 22.2% before the allocation of corporate services. We continue to expect consolidated revenues to be in the range of $760 million to $780 million, which is primarily predicated on the same-store organic revenue growth across the platform, and some contribution from business development initiatives in our pipeline. On a pro forma basis in the last 12 months, we generated an excess of $740 million in revenues and serve patients in more than 215 fixed sites of radiology and oncology, with more than 4,000 team members across the U.S. Our integration initiatives are well underway, and we continue to expect 2022 to be a milestone year."
