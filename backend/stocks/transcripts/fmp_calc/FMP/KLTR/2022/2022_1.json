    "content": " We further said that we expect our growth to be refueled: first, by the evolution of our virtual event offering from catering exclusively to large flagship events that typically require significant event services to an event platform that caters to events of all sizes and that is managed by the customers independently, with minimal event services required, if any; second, the launch of additional low-touch and self-serve products and go-to-market vehicles for both EE&T and M&T; and third, by the continued ramp of our sales force."
