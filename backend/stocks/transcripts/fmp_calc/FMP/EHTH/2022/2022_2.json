    "content": " In the second quarter, we recognized a revenue impairment of $8.7 million, caused mostly by lower than expected potential within Medicare cohorts both during the first half of 2021. Moving to second quarter financial results, total revenue was $50.4 million, GAAP net loss was $37.5 million, adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter was a loss of $33.3 million. As I mentioned earlier in the second quarter, we also recorded an $8.7 million negative adjustments in revenue which impacted overall results. This represented a sequential decline from $986 in Q1 of this year, driven by a 25% quarter-over-quarter decline in marketing costs per approved member and reflecting our strategy of a more targeted deployment of the marketing budget and limiting marketing spend within lower ROI channels. The decrease in total OpEx was driven primarily by year-over-year decreases of $12.8 million or 35% in variable marketing expense, and $9.2 million or 24% in CC&E costs. Looking to the upcoming third quarter, we expect revenue to be relatively flat sequentially, while adjusted EBITDA is expected to decline sequentially, reflecting targeted marketing investment and telesales ramp ahead of this year's AEP."
