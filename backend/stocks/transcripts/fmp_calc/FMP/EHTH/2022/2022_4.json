    "content": " Following the AEP's completion, we have received positive preliminary feedback from several of our largest carrier partners with respect to our enrollment quality, including a meaningful reduction in Medicare Complaint Tracking Module, or CTM scores and an improvement in persistency compared to a year ago. Through a combination of strategic and operational initiatives, along with cost transformation measures, we increased fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA by 76% year-over-year, partially driven by our intentionally reduced enrollment volumes and revenue compared to a year ago. Fourth quarter revenue of $196.3 million represented a decrease of 19% year-over-year and drove adjusted EBITDA of $49.5 million, up from $28.2 million in Q4 of '21. While our 2022 results and guidance for this year demonstrate significant progress in improving our operating and financial performance, including key profitability metrics, eHealth's long-term goal is to reach a run rate of profitable growth, coupled with positive cash flow generation. Given that our extensive cost reduction program was not implemented until April of last year, we expect a significant decline in marketing and customer care enrollment expenses in the first quarter of 2023 compared to Q1 of 2022."
