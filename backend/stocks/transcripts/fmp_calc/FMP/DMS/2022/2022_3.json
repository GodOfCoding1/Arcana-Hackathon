    "content": " Our third quarter results are as follows: third quarter net revenue was $90.1 million, which while down 16% year-over-year, beat our guidance of $87 million to $90 million. For the third quarter, gross profit was $24 million, equating to a 26% margin versus a 29% margin in Q3 2021. Our adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $5.1 million, generating a margin of 6%, down $6 million compared to the same quarter last year, driven primarily by lower revenue and mix. So we're generally encouraged by this trend because consumers are price shopping more, and we're hopeful that after the first of the year, the carriers are successfully rerated and feel that loss ratios are under control and that advertising spend can return to more normalized levels, which when that happens, you'll get an inflection point and we'll see a broad-based recovery in property and casualty and automotive insurance."
