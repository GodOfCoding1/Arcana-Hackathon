    "content": " To summarize for 2023, our focus is to drive growth in our business by growing the number of our existing significant enterprise customers along with average spend per customer by helping them acquire, grow and retain their customers, continuing to add SMBs to our platform, investing in our technology, data and media capabilities, managing costs, and finally focusing on the integration of the recently closed acquisition to further diversify our customer base and vertical served while strengthening our Brand Direct and Marketplace solutions. And then specifically to the focus going forward, we touched on it in the earnings call, on the growth initiatives, and if you think about continuing to diversify the customer base, not only with enterprise customers, which with the acquisition enterprise, customers will go up customers spending more than $100,000 annually, the SMBs as well, because they behave differently than the enterprise customers."
