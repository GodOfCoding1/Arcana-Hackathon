    "content": " Based on the strong first quarter earnings of $1.55 per share, driven by outperformance at our non-regulated gas marketing business, we are raising our guidance range for the full year. For our fiscal first quarter, we reported net economic earnings of $85 million, an increase of $22.5 million over last year, driven by strong results in Spire Marketing, which was well positioned this quarter to take advantage of basis differentials to optimize storage and transportation positions. Gas Utility expenses were up, net of pension reclassification by $14.6 million due to: first, roughly $6 million in Missouri overhead costs that were deferred in the prior year, but expensed this year; second, higher bad debt expense by $2.6 million, reflecting higher commodity costs; and lastly, higher non-employee costs, especially third-party contractor expenses as we focus on high customer service levels this winter. Equally though, if you look at the price of natural gas, which traded at the Henry Hub in the mid-$2s yesterday and has been down in that level here for a little while, we haven't seen that level in a long time, it does present a little bit of caution from our standpoint, especially as we exit the heating season and start thinking about what the back half of the year is going to be from two standpoints."
