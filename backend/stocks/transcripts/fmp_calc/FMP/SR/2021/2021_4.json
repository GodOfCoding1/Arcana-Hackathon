    "content": " Grounded in who we are and our commitment to answer challenges, this past year offers several, including the severe weather of Winter Storm Uri, modified operations due to the coronavirus pandemic, challenges to the continued operation of the Spire STL Pipeline and most recently, an unprecedented rate order in our Missouri rate review. Want to echo your acknowledge one of the efforts of our employees who continue their focus on maintaining safe and reliable gas delivery operations and outstanding service to our customers despite challenges, including the current challenge we're facing to ensure the Spire STL Pipeline is available this winter and beyond. As you know, the pipeline has a temporary certificate from FERC to operate through December 13, and the commission is considering our application to extend that while they address the issue on remand in the D.C. At FERC's Open Media on Thursday, the commission issued an order clarifying Spire STL Pipeline's ability to add new shippers consistent with other open access pipelines. Think of it as securitization, but we're not really securitizing it in the pure sense of the word for the excess gas cost in Missouri as we look to recover that through customer rates over the next several years and/or a pending decision from the Missouri Public Service Commission on a few disputes we have with some marketers who didn't perform."
