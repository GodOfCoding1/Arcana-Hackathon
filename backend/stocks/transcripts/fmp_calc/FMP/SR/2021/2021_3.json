    "content": " Circuit Court issued its judgment against FERC, remanding the matter back to the agency for further consideration and at a highly unusual action negatively impacting the Missouri customers and our industry, vacating the FERC's 2018 authorization of the STL Pipeline. That gives the FERC an opportunity to allow the pipeline to continue operating this winter, so that natural gas customers in the St. Louis region would not be left without reliable gas service when they need it the most. Over the last several weeks, I'm pleased to note that many are raising their voices and supporting the pipeline, including the Missouri Governor, bipartisan elected officials, the Missouri Department of Economic Development, commercial and industrial customers, community leaders and even a key interconnecting interstate pipeline, all voicing their concern over the potential loss of this critical infrastructure to meet the energy needs of the homes and businesses we serve. In our request for rehearing, we have updated the record to include the pipeline's strong operating performance over the last 18 months, including during Winter Storm Uri and to outline the dire consequences to customers of the St. Louis region if we lose this critical energy infrastructure. In summary, we remain confident that STL Pipeline is a critical infrastructure that enable Spire Missouri to continue providing reliable and affordable energy for homes and businesses in the St. Louis region. Yes, we've actually -- on a short-term basis, we have customers who are tugging on the pipeline, including Spire marketing, taking some of that volume because they see the opportunity to take the flowing natural gas and create some value with it."
