    "content": " The other parts, I think are interesting, because we are introducing some new programs, again, really focused on what customers want, whether it's around some RNG options, some other types of service technology, so I think this is a \u2013 I would call it a customer first type of case and then that's the reason we're in here. And Julien if I may just want to add on to what Steve think, because I think it's an extremely important point, the marketing \u2013 Spire Marketing has a role and it's predominately serving customers and its industrial customers and governments and those kinds of things, those sort of non-utility firm customers if you will. In this case, we're the ones who can step up on behalf of our customers and say, in this instance we think there's some things that should be adjusted and brought back to really reduce those gas costs. And you can draw a direct line there to really the results from Spire Marketing, which, as we've said in the past, is a low capital intensive business that when we do have these events, once every five years or so, actually it's once every four because it happened in 2017, it does give us the opportunity to take those funds and plow them back in principally into the CapEx in the utility. I think, in this case, what we're looking to do to work with the commission to see if we can spread this out over perhaps two or three years to try to minimize that right impact on the customers from the gas cost perspective."
