    "content": " Our adjusted EBITDA of $63 million came in approximately 74% higher than Q3 of 2021, which represents an adjusted EBITDA margin of 24.1%, an improvement of 480 basis points year-over-year. In the third quarter, revenue of $262.5 million was up 39.8% compared to the prior year quarter and 35.2% on an organic basis, driven once again by solid execution in all three of our sales channels. This represented a 52% free cash flow conversion of net income for the quarter and 71% year-to-date, adding to our multiyear trend of strong conversion of adjusted net income to cash. From a balance sheet perspective, we closed the quarter with $709.6 million of total debt, $55.3 million of cash and equivalents and a net leverage of 3.3 times net debt to adjusted trailing 12 months EBITDA, down from 3.9 times at the end of the second quarter. I'm pleased to announce that based on our solid year-to-date results, continued strong backlog and our current visibility of end markets, we are raising our full year 2022 outlook for revenue and adjusted EBITDA."
