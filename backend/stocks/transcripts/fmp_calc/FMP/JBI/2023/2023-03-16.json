    "content": " And finally, we delivered strong financial results, raising and exceeding financial guidance throughout the year, and delivering full year revenues that was up 36% in just over $1 billion and adjusted EBITDA growing 53% to $227 million. In the fourth quarter, consolidated revenue of $279.7 million was up 18.9% as compared to the fourth quarter of 2021, driven primarily by increased volume as a result of favorable industry dynamics across all of our sales channels, share gains, commercial actions taken to offset inflationary pressures and solid execution. Adjusted EBITDA of $68.3 million was up 57.5% and compared to the fourth quarter of 2021, largely the result of higher revenues and efficiency gains, partially offset by higher cost of sales. Adjusted EBITDA margin for the quarter was 24.4%, which was up 600 basis points from the prior year level, driven primarily by the positive impact of commercial actions and some easing in raw material costs, partially offset by continued inflationary pressures in other areas such as labor and logistics. Today, we have a robust company that delivers strong top-line at over $1 billion annually EBITDA margins rising through the low 20s, a solid balance sheet that is only 2.8x leverage, a track record of solid conversion of adjusted net income to free cash flow.

If you just look at that 75% to 100% of free cash flow conversion, that 2x or 3x leverage target seems conservative unless there's a substantial amount of cash going towards M&A, and it seems like there could be. Please proceed with your question."
