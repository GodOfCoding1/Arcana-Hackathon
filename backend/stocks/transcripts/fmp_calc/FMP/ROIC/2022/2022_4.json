    "content": " And with respect to the company's investment activities, the low-end of our initial guidance assumes that we acquire $100 million while selling $200 million of properties, and effectively utilizing the sale proceeds to fund acquisitions and pay down debt, which if the year plays out that way, we expect that our net debt ratio would drop down to the low-6s. Along we are being very pleased to achieve a new record high lease rate, we are also equally gratified that we have maintained our portfolio lease rate above 96% for 10 consecutive years now, even surpassing our leasing accomplishments, dating back to our time at Pan Pacific. In terms of non-anchor space, we increased our shop space lease rate steadily as we progressed through 2022, ending the year at a new record high of 96%. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. So as we look forward in terms of growing the company, we're much more focused on buying assets probably in the high-5s, low-6s, that's more importantly accretive, not so much on day one, but pretty quickly given our management team's ability to really drive value through an increase in either vacancy or rollover as you might say, that's really how we're going to continue to deliver as we have in the past, a nice punch to NOI in growing the company this year. Your line is open."
