    "content": " Yes, I mean, typically, a typical scenario is someone will come to us, they have a five-year option what that's probably at a fixed rate but they now want to lock in more term and in order to do that we're going to get more rent initially than would have been achieved if they just exercise their option as is and I think this is being driven by tenants understanding that there's been virtually no supply added in these markets and they have a good business on a great location, they really want to secure it for as long as they possibly can, but we take advantage of that as mentioned under prepared remarks by driving the rents higher and also fixing any leakage that might be in the can numbers or whatever else you know restrictions that might be in the lease to allow us more flexibility down the road."
