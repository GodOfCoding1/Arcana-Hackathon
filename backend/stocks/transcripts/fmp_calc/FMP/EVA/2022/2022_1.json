    "content": " And this first large utility customer of ours is one that we\u2019re obviously very, very excited about as an entry point for us, large scale million ton per year plus type contract really gives us a strong foothold and continuing to expand the opportunity to facilitate the energy transition in Germany. And so as you\u2019ve seen in some of our prepared remarks and some of our published materials and our investor decks and the like, we tend to think that there is an opportunity for 20 million to 30 million tons per year at a pricing that continues to match or better than what we have historically seen in the utility segment driven by both scarcity and frankly, the difficulty in mitigating the carbon intensity of some of these industries, there really aren\u2019t any other alternatives. First of all, I noticed in the press release that the S facility you\u2019re talking about approximately $65 million in the adjusted EBITDA once it\u2019s up and running, which seems a little bit higher than the kind of 50 million rate we\u2019ve talked about in the past, and would seem to imply an investment multiple a little bit closer to four times, the five times target."
