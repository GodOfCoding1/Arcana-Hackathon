    "content": " And even with our track record of significantly outperforming benchmark indices like the S&P 500 and the MSCI ESG Index and the Russell 1000 over the past one year and three-year periods there still aren't any companies like us in almost any industry with anything close to our long-term contracted revenue base, our durable cash flow and dividend, our strong growth profile, ESG attributes and margin expansion opportunities across a wide range of economic and business cycles. Second, we reaffirmed our 2022 guidance range and expect to deliver a strong back half of the year, with the fourth quarter projected to be a record in terms of both adjusted EBITDA and adjusted gross margin per metric tons. From there, for Q4, we expect that the benefits of volume produced from Lucedale, as it nears the completion of its ramp, combined with a higher headline pricing that we are beginning to realize, will enable us to post a record quarter both in terms of produced volumes and margin per ton, closing out our year within the expected range for adjusted EBITDA of $230 million to $270 million. The record quarter we're expecting in 2024 -- I'm sorry in Q4 of this year is really going to be a remarkable uplift, again driving out back half of the year 2:1 in terms of the EBITDA generation of the business. And then Q4, we expect it to be kind of like -- as we expected from the beginning of the year, our strongest quarter of the year, as we're getting much more of a volume from the ramp-up of the Lucedale plant as well as getting benefits of the higher prices in our contracts, using the shipping schedule. So, a very large plant, the largest 1.1 million tons and if you do sort of the implied AGM equivalents of $65 million in annualized adjusted EBITDA, you're not going to get the full benefit of that obviously in 2024, but that's a pretty healthy EBITDA per ton perspective."
