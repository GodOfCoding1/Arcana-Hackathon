    "content": " Today, NOI contribution from multifamily sits at 83% on a pro forma basis, up from 39% as of the end of the first quarter of 2021 and approximately 1,900 multifamily units have been added to our portfolio representing growth of over 30% during this time. The operating fundamentals across our 6,691 unit multifamily portfolio remained strong during the quarter, with occupancy at 97.1%, and a blended net rental growth rate of 21%, a figure that was up from 16% in the first quarter and that we continue to maintain at around 20% through July. Well, I think, if you look at \u00e2\u0080\u0093 whether you look at last year or the first quarter or even the second quarter, we've certainly outperformed in terms of the percentage of overall leasing volume that we've attracted to Harborside. And I think the operations, we're seeing three quarters now sector-leading same-store NOI and rental growth in the operations on the multifamily side, which now constitute 83% of the business, primarily in multifamily business, which pivoted in the year, 18 months."
