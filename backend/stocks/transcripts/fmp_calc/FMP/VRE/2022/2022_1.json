    "content": " A portion of the proceeds from our land sales is being reinvested, utilizing a 1031 exchange to acquire The James, a newly built 99.5% leased Class A 240-unit apartment building located in Park Ridge for $130 million or 4% cap rate, and an off-market transaction that is expected to close during the second quarter. Excluding these one-time items, the first quarter of 2022 was lower than the fourth quarter by $0.03 cent as a result of the sale of our Hoboken asset, $0.01 due to the loss of revenue on the space vacated by MUFG, which we expect Collectors Universe to take possession of in June, and a $0.02 reduction in hotel NOI, partially due to reduced bookings related to Omicron, as well as the normal first quarter seasonal variation."
