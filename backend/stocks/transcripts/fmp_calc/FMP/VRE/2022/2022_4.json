    "content": " Look, this is--what you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen is we have a recently reconstituted, independent, transparent board that is highly focused on their fiduciary obligations and on the maximization for value for all shareholders, and in the spirit of that transparency, the board was just making it be known to shareholders that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve had a number of inbounds from credible institutions who have expressed an interest in the multi-family side of the portfolio, given that now we are beginning to hopefully reach the conclusion of the transformation with the sale of the non-strategic assets, which are less interesting to those parties, and that also consistent with best corporate and governance practices, the board as it currently stands would contemplate running some sort of a process in due course at the appropriate time, taking into consideration where we are in the strategic transformation, market conditions, and any other relevant factors to evaluate that interest and ultimately determine whether it would be in the best interests of shareholders to move forward on any path there."
