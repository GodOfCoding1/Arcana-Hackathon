    "content": " Variant generated operating revenue of $87 million in the second quarter net of fuel surcharges, an increase of 4% sequentially compared to the first quarter. Revenue per tractor per week declined sequentially in the second quarter to $3,863 due to a combination of lower utilization within the fleet and a lower rate per mile as a large decline in the spot market portion of our business more than offset a meaningful increase in contracted rates in the quarter. Sequential growth in overall truck count through 2022, primarily driven by Variant fleet growth, we expect to see modest sequential improvement and utilization in the coming quarters as we gain benefits from the additional structure and discipline that have been instituted into our fleet operations during the first half of the year."
