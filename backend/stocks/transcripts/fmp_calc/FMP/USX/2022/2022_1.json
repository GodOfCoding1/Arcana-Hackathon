    "content": " Today, I would like to provide an update on the sequential improvement we saw in Variant in the first quarter, highlight key achievements in the quarter from our other business segments and following Eric Peters\u2019 discussion of our financial results, provide our market outlook for the remainder of 2022. Variant generated operating revenue of $84 million in the first quarter net of fuel, an increase of 17% sequentially compared to the fourth quarter of 2021. Operating expenses and supplies increase $12.3 million due to increased driver acquisition costs combined with increased equipment maintenance expenses, due in part to increase company tractors as compared to the first quarter of 2021. Purchase transportation increased $8.9 million due to increased cost per brokerage load in the quarter, which was partially offset by decrease in independent contractor miles driven compared to the first quarter of 2021. I mean, obviously, we\u2019ve seen weakness in the spot market almost right there to the week of the Ukrainian invasion was when we started seeing a slide and we\u2019ve been sliding almost from week to week, it\u2019s kind of gotten sequentially a little bit worse each week from a pricing perspective and maybe even a volume perspective, just meaning that there\u2019s not as many loads out there available on the spot market as maybe there was previous. I think that fixed cost inflection point, Brian, is where we talked about it before, and I\u2019d like to guide you to Slide 6 in our supplement, where in the fourth quarter we said, our fixed cost as a percentage of revenue were just too high, and that was a 30% number. I think we have a line of sight to maybe being even further improved than what we\u2019re \u2013 maybe what we\u2019re anticipating today, but we\u2019re working through those items and hopefully over the next couple quarters, we can see some significant improvement in that brokerage profitability."
