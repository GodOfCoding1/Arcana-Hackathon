    "content": " In the third quarter, we made progress driving more accountability within our OTR fleet, which included improving overall driver availability, lowering our percentage of empty miles, increasing our service levels for our customers and retaining the higher performing drivers. Partially offsetting these positive contributions were the continued decline of spot market rates, which declined approximately $0.50 from the first to the second quarter and approximately $0.20 from the second to the third quarter for a total of $0.70 per mile. Turning to liquidity, at the end of the third quarter, liquidity, which we define as cash plus availability under the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s revolving credit facility was $131.1 million, and we generated cash flow from operations of $25.4 million for the first nine months of the year. Finally, with respect to cost savings from our realignment plan, we are currently targeting a sequential decline in office wages of approximately $5 million in the fourth quarter as compared to the third quarter. In terms of capacity, we haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t seen evidence in the spot rate, but we continue to expect smaller carriers to exit the market in the coming quarters as spot market opportunities are less profitable, not only as a result of declining rates, but also due to increased delivery related costs, including higher fuel equipment, maintenance and insurance costs. Yes, I would say our run rate, if you were to look back and look at the average, our average depreciation, what we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve had by quarter for a second and third quarter \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and if you look at our CapEx below $100 million, I am going to have inflation on the cap on the tractors coming in versus what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s coming out."
