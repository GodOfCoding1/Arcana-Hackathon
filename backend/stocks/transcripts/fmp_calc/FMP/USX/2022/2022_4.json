    "content": " Based on the growth of Variant to 1,550 tractors in almost 3 years, the immediate progress in restoring operating metrics this past month and the strong cooperation and unified teamwork between Variant and other trucking experts, I believe Variant has progressed better than most efforts and internal disruption. This afternoon, I would like to discuss our performance in the fourth quarter and provide more detail on how our operating model will deliver better operating leverage as we improve the per unit economics of Variant tractors and add more tractors to the Variant fleet. In the fourth quarter, salaries, wages and benefits increased by $30.9 million, driven by a 16.7% increase in driver wages and a 31.9% increase in office wages, primarily due to our digitization efforts in both Variant and Xpress Technologies and to a lesser extent across the entire organization. We believe this infrastructure that we have created can handle an additional 2,400 plus seated tractors, bringing our Truckload fleet to more than 8,000, which would equate to an additional $500 million of Truckload revenues, net of fuel relative to where we are today without adding any meaningful infrastructure costs. But when you think of all the moving pieces and I\u2019m not trying to pin you down, but I guess we're just trying to kind of think about the moving pieces here, the costs that have come out of Variant, revenue per truck per week is improving, but you've got seasonality, that\u2019s not your friend fourth quarter to first quarter."
