    "content": " F1's $500 million revolver is undrawn and Formula One's leverage at the end of the quarter was 3.7 times, meaningfully within our target leverage range of less than 5 times. But I think more importantly, we see the opportunity to be a promoter as a way to expand our understanding the business, understand what -- how to be a -- the best Formula One product on the track for other promoters as well, to look at an opportunity to grow our knowledge and our understanding and potentially promote other races down the road. But for sure, our knowledge of the business and our opportunity to expose with our Live Nation partner, and I think it's the best in order to make sure that in next year in November, we're going to have the race, that event will be spectacular that will be unique as I would say, we can feel here in Miami already."
