    "date": "2022-05-08 09:04:04",
    "content": " Net interest income from loans and securities, including $3.9 million interest income from the increase in the present value of cash flow in excessive modeled and unallocated reserves was approximately $18.6 million in the second quarter. Our gross interest income excluding that $3.9 million from the increase in cash flow to our reserve models was similar to Q4 and Q3 of 2021, but net interest income was $400,000 higher, primarily due to calling our 2019-C securitization and accelerating the amortization of remaining deferred issuance costs and paying double interest on the underlying loans for a period of time in Q4. These patterns along with increases in housing prices and housing demand stability in certain markets that we have concentration in, helps maintain these prepayment and payment patterns and leads to increases in the present value of borrower payments in excess of our modeled expectations and the related income recognition of $3.9 million of unallocated loan purchase discount reserves in the first quarter. As I mentioned earlier in this call, at March 31, we also had more than $300 million face amount of unencumbered securities from our securitizations and joint ventures and unencumbered mortgage loans."
