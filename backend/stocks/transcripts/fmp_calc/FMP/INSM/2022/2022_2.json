    "content": " I will just reiterate that we're focused on the more severe end of the spectrum of CRS without nasal polyps, that several hundred thousand patients on a global basis a year, that's incident population, not prevalence. I can't emphasize how significant that additional population would be and that's one of the reasons why we're really spending a lot of time on the design to make sure that we're looking at different phenotypes of patients coming into the study, which will kick-off in the first half of next year. With respect to script trends in Japan, because of the two-week change, I'd just say ,what that really represents is the opportunity for patients to get a larger prescription amount of drug that were restricted to two weeks as every new drug is, for the first calendar year. I think you're always going to see idiosyncrasies in individual patients, which is why it's hard to draw broad conclusions from a single patient of data. So again the PK/PD study, we're doing is to examine whether cystic fibrosis patients who metabolize drugs slightly differently as a result of complications in the GI track related to their condition, whether those patients will need to be dosed at a higher level to get the same PK/PD profile that we would see in other patients. But I don't expect to see a major distinction between the two and that's one of the points we want to make by completing the study, which is that this would be applicable to all CF patients at the appropriate dose. I mean if we think about what has happened over the last year, last year diagnosis rates for NTM were down 25%, 30% and we maintained a steady revenue performance, which means we were gaining share in the midst of a corrected diagnosis rate due to COVID where patients weren't coming in physicians weren't able to diagnose them."
