    "content": " OPAL Fuels is now one of the largest developers and operators in the renewable bio-gas space, with 38 projects in operation construction or advanced development, aggregating to over 19 million MMBtu of production. Our advanced development pipeline, those we reasonably expect can enter construction in the next 12 to 18 months has grown to 16 projects representing another 7.4 million MMBtu of biogas resource available. The annual earnings power metric helps normalize ramp up periods in partial years of production, smooth out the potential lumpiness of large releases of stored gas after in and LCFS certification, and provide some visibility on the future contribution of RNG projects under construction. In addition, our advanced development pipeline does not include nine renewable power projects, which produce 3.2 million MMBtu of biogas, which we are evaluating for RNG conversions or ERI Pathway. With our portfolio of projects and operation and construction as well as our advanced development pipeline, we continue our focus on executing and driving the annual earnings power of OPAL Fuels while upholding continued operational excellence and remaining good stewards of the capital we employ. To conclude today's prepared remarks, I want to reiterate the sizable earnings power of our existing operating and in construction projects, as well as our robust advanced development pipeline, of projects that we reasonably expect to be in construction in the next 12 to 18 months. And as a reminder, when we talk about advanced development pipeline, these are projects which have been qualified by us and which we feel reasonably likely to enter construction in the next 12 to 18 months, meaning that we see with the third parties that we're dealing with reasonable opportunities to get these into construction."
