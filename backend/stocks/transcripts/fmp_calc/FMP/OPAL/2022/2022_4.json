    "content": " As Adam mentioned, we expect production increases this year from our operating and in construction portfolio that are in line with our prior expectations with the 3.4 million MMBtu midpoint of production guidance being a 57% increase compared to RNG production in 2022. We saw strong topline growth for the fourth quarter with revenue up 42% year-over-year, driven primarily by higher volumes produced and sold in the RNG fuel segment, as well as higher prices for brown gas and higher RINs under forward sales contracts we had entered into earlier in 2022. For the full year 2022, before considering the impacts of preferred dividends, we achieved net income of $32.6 million, reflecting the standalone results for OPAL Fuels LLC and ArcLight Clean Transition Corp. II through the closing of our business combination last July 21st, plus the combined operations since then. As of December 31st, we had $167.8 million of outstanding borrowings, net of deferred financing costs, including $94.3 million of outstanding borrowings under Term Loan A, $28.5 million related to the remaining amount of the convertible note we had issued to Ares for the acquisition of the Imperial and Greentree projects in 2021, $22.1 million of the Sunoma loan and $22.8 million related to our renewable power project financing. As Adam noted earlier, we anticipate our full year 2023 adjusted EBITDA guidance range to be $85 million to $95 million, which is based on our expected range of RNG production in 2023 of $3.2 million to $3.6 million MMBtus. We expect an approximately $8 million change to 2023 adjusted EBITDA for each $0.25 per gallon change in D3 RIN price, a $1.4 million change for every $0.50 per MMBtu change in natural gas price and a $400,000 change for every $10 per metric ton change in LCFS credit price."
