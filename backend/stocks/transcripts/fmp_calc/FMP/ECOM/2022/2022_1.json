    "content": " I\u2019m pleased to report that our results for the first quarter of 2022 came in better than expected with revenue at the high-end of the guidance range, subscription revenue growth of 17%, and adjusted EBITDA that exceeded the high-end of the guidance range. Whether that\u2019s a meaningful impact on discretionary spending, I don\u2019t know, but our view -- the way we look at the rest of the year is that we think first quarter and at least the first part of second quarter are kind of the toughest comps, again, because of stimulus checks a year ago, we had the Child Tax credit that was going out on a monthly basis for a period of time, and that\u2019s going away and you\u2019d have inflation. And it\u2019s not just like, everybody gets the sort of same format, one picture kind of transactional site, because it\u2019s so focused on fashion, it really provides more of a storytelling type of environment and they\u2019ve done a fantastic job rolling out fulfillment services, and continue to establish themselves as -- and one of the things I\u2019ve said in the past is that the way to compete in the space isn\u2019t necessarily to go and be the next big general merchandise marketplace, it\u2019s to go be a winner in a specific category, because every category has different shopping characteristics, if you think about how automotive is right."
