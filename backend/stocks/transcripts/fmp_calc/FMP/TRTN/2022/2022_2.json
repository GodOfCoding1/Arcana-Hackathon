    "content": " We generated $2.92 of adjusted net income per share, an increase of 5.8% from the first quarter and an increase of 36% from the second quarter of last year, and we achieved an annualized return on equity of nearly 30%. We've extended lease durations across our fleet and increased the portion of our containers on life cycle leases to almost 60%, and we have achieved meaningful interest expense savings through aggressive refinancing and locked in these savings by focusing on fixed rate, long duration debt. Freight rates are down from last year's peak as the extreme shortages of vessel and container capacity have eased, but freight rates remain well above pre-pandemic levels, reflecting continued robust trade volumes and the ongoing logistical challenges that continue to disrupt shipping line operations and eat up effective capacity. And I think at the margin, there could be fewer pickups for us and especially maybe a little bit less investment as the bottlenecks ease, but we've been -- tried to be quite clear over the last year or two even that these improvements that we're making in our business, the growth in our leasing margin and so on, we think it's going to be very durable almost regardless of market conditions. We did a lot of good work on our rest of the containers in our portfolio over the last 18 months or two years, renewing expiring leases on to attractive extensions, pushing out the durations of our existing leases, increasing the share of containers on life cycle leases."
