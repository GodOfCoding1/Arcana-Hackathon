    "content": " As we implement our $21.5 billion investment plan, we believe we are very well-positioned to deliver our targeted 6% to 7% compound annual growth in adjusted EPS through 2025 of the midpoint of our 2022 guidance of $2.29 per share. For the full year 2022, our net income was $881 million, an increase of $174 million or 25% compared to 2021, and our adjusted net income was $901 million, an increase of $121 million or 16% compared to 2021. We also provide our expectations of opportunities and risks for the remainder of 2023 versus our outlook expectations, which include Renewables production and pricing, rate cases and other regulatory actions, storms and weather-related events the restart of the NECEC construction, thermal and asset management results, taxes and financial interest, business costs, and uncollectible. You clearly made your consolidated EPS against market expectations mostly through the Renewables business, but Networks looks weak, and you're suggesting that there's basically flat earnings year-over-year roughly for that business in 2023, if I understand correctly because of the timing of rate cases."
