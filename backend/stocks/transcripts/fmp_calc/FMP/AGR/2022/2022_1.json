    "content": " Our first quarter results and outlook for the year are driven by the strong and predictable foundation of our regulated networks business, which in 2021 accounted for approximately 80% of our company's earnings. For the first quarter of 2022 networks, our largest business segment produced adjusted net income of $254 million representing growth of $25 million or 11% compared to the first quarter of 2021. The key driver of the strong networks results was a successful implementation of our rate plans for the New York companies, which increased adjusted net income by $16 million for the first quarter of 2022, compared to the first quarter of 2021. The significant quarter-over-quarter increase in renewables adjusted net income of $88 million to $211 million for the first quarter of 2022, compared to the first quarter of 2021 was largely due to the restructuring of the partnership agreement for our New England offshore wind lease areas, which as we discussed on our February earnings call closed in January of 2022. At the end of the first quarter, we had approximately $650 million of cash, which along with our ongoing cash from operations, debt at the utility level, tax equity financing at renewables and our 2 billion commercial  programs, we will continue to fund investments and dividends to the remainder of the year."
