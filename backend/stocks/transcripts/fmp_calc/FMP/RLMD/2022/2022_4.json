    "content": " We did see in study 301, that it's statistically significantly greater proportion of patients treated with REL-1017 experienced therapeutic response defined as a 50% or more improvement in the MADRS, total score from baseline at day 28, 40% with REL-1017 treatment versus 27% for placebo with a p-value of 0.044. When we exclude the data from these two sites, the population was reduced by only approximately 40 subjects and we saw a 4.1 points placebo adjusted difference at day 28, on the MADRS, total score favoring REL-1017 with a p-value of 0.019. This has been seen by other researchers in the MDD space, we believe that during the pandemic, many patients have situational depression, most likely related to isolation and other pandemic related issues when we cut the data using April 1, 2022 when COVID's restrictions were largely lifted, as the demarcation point, we saw a placebo adjusted difference of 4.1 points favoring REL-1017 on the day 28 MADRS score for the post pandemic subgroup.
