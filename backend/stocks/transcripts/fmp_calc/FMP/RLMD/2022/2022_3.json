    "content": " During today's call, I will provide an update on our ongoing late-stage RELIANCE clinical development program for REL-1017, our lead product candidate that we are currently studying as a novel treatment for patients with major depressive disorder, or MDD. As we approach the topline readout for RELIANCE I expected before year-end, it is important to note that the higher enrolling centers in RELIANCE III also recruited significantly in RELIANCE I. Mitigating that to some degree is the different patient population RELIANCE I, that is patients that enrolled and should already been diagnosed with depression and are not responding adequately to at least one and up to three courses of antidepressant therapy. The one that really matters, the sites that have a high -- they enrolled a lot of patients, the high enrolling sites, and they are the one that have this paradoxical response where placebo outperformed the drug by quite a bit, and it's kind of isolated to a few sites. But in terms of like the percent of patients was between 25% and 30% in monotherapy and it's going to be between, I would say, mid-30s in -- maybe a little bit more than that in the first trigger one -- the first adjunctive trial. And -- but at this point, we don't think there is really any need to meet with the FDA because the changes plan that we are actually implementing in RELIANCE II and most likely in any of the trial, who will do more additional trial in the future, they're not FDA-depending."
