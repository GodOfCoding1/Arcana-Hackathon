    "content": " As shared in today's press release, Ampco-Pittsburgh recorded a net income of $1.6 million in our first quarter of 2022. Ampco's net sales for the first quarter of 2022 were $94.4 million, an increase of approximately 9% compared to net sales for the first quarter of 2021, primarily due to growth of 18% in the Forged and Cast Engineered Products segment. Net sales for the Air and Liquid Processing segment in the first quarter of 2022 were 16% lower than the prior year period, due to supply chain issues impacting the availability of components for production and customer delivery timing. Forged and Cast Engineered Products segment's operating results declined slightly for the first quarter of 2022 compared to prior year, primarily due to a lower volume of mill rolls shipments, though this was partly offset by the favorable impact of the employee benefit change in the current quarter. Air and Liquid Processing segment's operating income improved slightly for the first quarter of 2022 compared to prior year, despite the lower volume of shipments for the reasons Dave described. At the bottom line, the corporation reported net income attributable to Ampco-Pittsburgh of $1.6 million or $0.08 per diluted share for the first quarter of 2022 compared to net income of $0.2 million or $0.01 per diluted share for the first quarter of 2021. Capital expenditures for the first quarter of 2022 were $3.4 million, primarily for the Forged and Cast Engineered Products segment. What we're thinking about is the -- with the confluence of the events here where we have a ramp-up in working capital to meet growing demand for our products and inflation, which is affecting the -- that investment that's required in the growth in working capital and the fact that our CapEx -- our CapEx timing is really -- I mean, if you -- we only spent like $3 million in the first quarter."
