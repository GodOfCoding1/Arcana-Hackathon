    "content": " We believe this stellar performance when compared to the previous record in the first quarter of 2021, which was due to the spike of the COVID-19 pandemic reflects the nature of the entrepreneurial spirit of Carriage and the commitment and passion of our managing partners and their teams to win the trust of their guest families and provide a solution to all their needs, which by product is increased volumes and market share gains. As we review our first quarter results and a great start to our year, I would encourage all current and prospective shareholders to review both the earnings release from yesterday and our recently released 2021 shareholder letter for a much more comprehensive and in-depth look at the transformation that has occurred over the past two years and our vision for the exciting future that we have here at Carriage. Our adjusted free cash flow declined $14.7 million in the first quarter compared to last year, primarily due to a $9 million increase in cash, short-term and long-term incentive payments; a $1.5 million increase in maintenance capital expenditures and a $1 million increase in additional cash taxes paid during the quarter. Adjusted consolidated EBITDA, $128 million to $134 million; adjusted consolidated EBITDA margin, 33.5% to 34.5%; adjusted diluted earnings per share of $3.57 to $3.67; adjusted free cash flow of $82 million to $86 million; and adjusted free cash flow margin of 21.5% to 22.5%."
