    "content": " Regarding our marketing overhead investments made earlier this year, we're seeing significant progress way above our own expectations, after his marketing team have accelerated field marketing adoption, and are now effectively supporting marketing projects for 80% of our businesses. Adjusted free cash flow decline year-over-year due to lower operating results as well as higher cash incentive payments in the first quarter, including approximately $4 million for our five years Good To Great incentive award, which will be a lower amount over the next three to five years due to a lower number of managing partners in each five-year group. And I don't want to say that this will continue, but it's very encouraging what we're seeing in October, means that a lot of the things, all those process things that Carlos is talking about, price increases, more options for cremations and whatever, our people are very tuned in because their incentives are based on being within a range of field EBITDA margins. It's the accretive revenue what we'll gain from providing a solution that families keep going straight into their browser, go to our different businesses' webpage, and from there being able to do many, many selections and things that they want to choose on digitally without having to go to the funeral home, things of that nature. So I'm assuming that between now and the middle of next year, we get to about $30 million, and it will be the same profile of businesses and the high margin potential and revenue growth compounded over years that we did at the end of '19, early '20."
