    "content": " We added 11.6 million in net new ARR during the first quarter to bring our total ARR to $129.3 million, an increase of 55% year-over-year. New, and cross sell logos with ARR greater than a $100,000 represented approximately 50% of the net new ARR underscoring continued momentum with larger commercial, and enterprise customers and we take confidence in the fact that our pipeline continues to be strong. Yeah Martin, the way I would think about gross margins is just sequentially as we talked about it last year was -- I believe that was 82% or so last year, but we've continued to talk about the fact that I think we were pretty much flat sequentially to the quarter. The story of that customer doesn't stop at the outset, whilst you guys will factor that in or we look at the fact that we've landed a customer in that $100 to $1 million sweet spot, that story is just the start of the journey and we continue to see if you look at one of the luxury retail chains that we would have named six months or so ago, they came back to us within six months and they wanted our platform to be implemented to their sister chain. Let's say that -- I'm always happy when a competitor is taken over by a private equity firm, because you know they are very be focusing for one or two years on re-organizing themselves, so from the competitive standpoint I'm very happy that a great competitor like -- great company like them, very efficient, will be the focus for a couple of years doing the private equity game."
