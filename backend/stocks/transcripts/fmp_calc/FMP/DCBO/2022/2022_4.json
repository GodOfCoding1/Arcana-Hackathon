    "content": " In terms of how we construct the guidance, I'll speak to revenue first, when you just think about revenue, it's pretty straightforward in our world, take the ARR for the prior quarter, divide that by 365 -- months -- the number of days in the quarter, it gives you kind of your base for subscription revenue. And Ale, I will add something about this integration ecosystem because OEM partnership product integration, it's all part of a big network of ecosystem, and also adding training capabilities to other software like I have seen that our prototype of Docebo for Microsoft team, these attach the software to the enterprise software stack and enterprise ecosystem where people can add, train inside other software. Agreed on the general sense that it's a mix of a few factors alongside the fact that quarter four usually lands with more enterprise impact, and I'd say also that given the comments made before as our enterprise pipeline continues to grow, we certainly look forward to continue to perform well in terms of ACV averages, as we land more and more enterprise deals in the future. And then you add PS revenue, which I talked about earlier when Rob asked the question, which is a by factor of similar to the last quarter, if that ARR is let's just call it extra $10 million, if you generate X dollars of PS revenue, that's what we take into the quarter, because the PS revenue is split, give or take between three to six months. And Suthan, I'll just quickly add that if you just take a step back, what's important to remember, even when you -- when Alessio talked in his prepared remarks about that deal from Agria, it's a good reminder of the external use case when we talk about the fact that anything that touches beyond the employee, which is what we call external use case, customer education being one example, Agria, as you noted, is trying to train all of that pet insurance customers in Europe, over 8 million using our platform."
