    "content": " The integration of our agent field force and direct-to-consumer distribution continues to open up more opportunities for us to serve our middle income customers and drive growth in our Consumer Division, Sales momentum remained strong in the fourth quarter and capped-off a solid production year. We completed our annual GAAP actuarial assumption review in the fourth quarter, which resulted in no material impact to operating income in total, with about a $1 million favorable impact on annuity margin and about $3 million unfavorable impact to interest sensitive life margin. At quarter end, our invested assets totaled $24 billion, down 16% year-over-year, reflecting declining market values in the quarter driven primarily by higher interest rates. Zach, your line is now open. Number one, the expenses in the quarter and the fourth quarter particularly not allocated to products were a bit below our annualized run rate, but I'd say the full year 2022 expenses were in line with our expectations. Zach, your line is now open."
