    "content": " As expected, variable investment income results were lower in the quarter, which was partially offset by higher net investment income allocated to product, reflecting continued growth in the business and the second consecutive quarter of new money rates above the portfolio yield. Adjusting for the GAAP accounting impacts caused by market volatility on our fixed index annuity margins, COVID impacts across all of our products, the increase in non-deferred advertising expense, and the favorable non-COVID mortality in the prior period as referenced on the slide, total margin was flat reflecting the continued stable underlying dynamics of the business. Turning to Slide 11, investment income allocated to products was up slightly as the new money rates above 5% in the second and third quarter reversed the trend of a declining yield leading to a sequential gain of 4 basis points. Your line is now open. It's been quite healthy and we've got several quarters under our belt now of steady growth there, and we're actually looking forward to seeing some of that in our agent produced businesses. Your line is now open. I've been really pleased with the productivity gains our field organization has been able to show and frankly that really carried us through COVID when it became so much more difficult to recruit for a period of time, being able to continue to drive productivity with annuity sales as an example that we're growing every quarter and so on. Your line is now open. Over the last several quarters, there has been some spread compression and that's really what you're seeing, sort of keeping a lid on that margin growth, but yes, I think at some point it's reasonable to expect and you'd see an upward trend there. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. Your line is now open."
