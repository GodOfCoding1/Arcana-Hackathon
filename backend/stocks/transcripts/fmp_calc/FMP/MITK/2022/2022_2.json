    "content": " I\u2019m happy to report that we again, delivered strong financial results in the quarter with revenue growth of 21% year-over-year, non-GAAP net income up 49% year-over-year, and cashflow from operations of $7.4 million. With this low code, no code offering all financial institutions, the FinTech\u2019s, the Challenger banks, the cryptos, and pretty much anyone else who needs to know their customer will be able to quickly roll out our curated end-to-end platform with all of the best identity signals, workflow, and analytics to address current threat vectors. Services, another revenue, which includes transactional SaaS revenue, maintenance and consulting services was 15.4 million for the quarter down 2% year-over-year, primarily due to the transition of one customer and the completion of the strategic identity verification project in Europe. Total GAAP operating expenses, including cost of revenue were 29.9 million compared to 26.4 million in Q2 of last year, and this increase was due to the investment to grow our identity businesses and the additional costs associated with the acquisition of ID R&D and HooYu."
