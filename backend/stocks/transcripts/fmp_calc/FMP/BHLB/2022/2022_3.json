    "content": " Expenses were up low single-digits on both a quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year basis, and close to the higher end of the $68 million to $70 million quarterly range we've guided to in the past. I'm just kind of looking, obviously, and I think others had asked this question, but linked quarter, your C&I non-performers went from $5 million to $21 million, and your C&I charge-offs in the quarter went from $200,000 last quarter to $4.9 million. But outside of that, I think your end-of-period typically about $1 billion, and the average is $750,000, and that's been consistent over pretty much last eight quarters. And I guess just given those comments around the margin, in the reaffirmation of the overall guidance provided last quarter, I mean, it seems like the NII guide should be moving higher given what you guys have already put up for this year and the 9% to 11% GAAP growth for the year."
