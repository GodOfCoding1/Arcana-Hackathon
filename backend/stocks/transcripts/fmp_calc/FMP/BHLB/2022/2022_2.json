    "content": " Important to note that this is a strategic decision and not related to the performance of the portfolio, which is, in fact, quite strong as nonperforming loans were less than 1% of portfolio balances at the end of second quarter. Net interest income grew 18% quarter-over-quarter, driven by loan balance growth, increased asset yields driven by the rate environment and stable funding costs. I'd have to point out that like many banks in the second quarter, we also recorded a negative bond mark to other comprehensive income in our equity account of about $45 million on an after-tax basis. So in summary, a strong quarter with robust balance sheet net interest income and net interest margin growth, strong capital position, enabling us to continue returning capital to shareholders, ample deposits to fund future growth and strong credit performance and expense management. So in summary, a strong quarter with steady progress on our BEST plan, strong loan growth and net interest income and margin expansion, disciplined expense control, improved financial returns, along with solid progress on our ESG performance. I think what Subhadeep saying is $700 million to $1 billion has been an average on a quarterly basis for the last, let's say, 5 quarters before first quarter. No, I think it's really just the fact that we anticipated to get those volumes through that partnership to about 3% of the total loans, and we feel just given the environment that we are in and all the provisions that we have to build along the way, 2% is the right number to  and we've reached that volume. Chris, this is Subhadeep, again. Chris, this is Subhadeep, again."
