Again, I think we had a, as we indicated in the press release, operating expenses in aggregate of little less than $39 million in the quarter Clearly, that run rate is going to be reduced and have been reduced dramatically, since we are not giving our guidance here, we are just -- we feel comfortable that we can operate comfortably through the end of the year into next year and certainly we will continue to look to opportunities to bring in additional capital moving forward. And in connection with that, correct me if I'm wrong, but if I went back to as recently as September of last year, you were talking about, I believe, the number was $63 million of NRE money, which I assume was especially investments by one or more of the wearable companies in particular, as they pursue commercializing your technology, that clearly from your guidance is not in the '22 number, let alone the 30-plus resin referenced for '23.
