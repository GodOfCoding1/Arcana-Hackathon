    "content": " Our average provisional realized prices in the quarter were $1,718 per ounce of gold compared to $1,779 per ounce in Q3 2021, that's 3% lower and $19.16 per ounce of silver compared to $24.24 in the prior year, that's 21% lower. Back to you, Jorge. But yes, Yaramoko mine third quarter gold production of 27,130 ounces was in line with plan with production for the first nine months of the year totaling 79,918 ounces positioning Yaramoko to achieve midpoint to annual guidance. Increase in silver and gold production was primarily due to higher mill throughput and slightly higher grades in line with the mining sequence and Mineral Reserve estimates, placing the operation in a strong position to achieve the upper range of annual guidance. Back to you, Jorge."
