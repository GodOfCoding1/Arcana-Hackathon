    "content": " Our headline financial numbers were a healthy free cash flow of $22 million, mine operating income of $32.5 million, adjusted EBITDA of $58 million, with an EBITDA margin of 34%, net income of $1.7 million or $0.01 per share and adjusted net income of $2.1 million. Our revenue and earnings this quarter were impacted by the fact that 40% of our revenue comes from concentrate sales, where we were exposed to negative provisional pricing adjustments amounting to $6.6 million due to a steep decline in silver prices and zinc prices from April to June. In the second quarter, the three operating mines in Latin America delivered a strong production of 1.65 million ounces of silver and 37,600 ounces of gold. As Jorge highlighted, for Latin America, production for the first six months in total 3.3 million ounces of silver and a 36,000 ounces of gold, all mines are aligned to achieve annual guidance range. Back to you, Jorge. At the Yaramoko Mine, second quarter gold production of 24,553 ounces was in line with the plan, leaving the operation in a strong position with a year-to-date production of 52,788 ounces on target to meet the upper range of annual guidance. Back to you, Jorge. The higher sales were driven by the contribution of Yaramoko with $45.9 million in the quarter and sales -- have been net of $57.2 million, which were 67% higher than Q1 20 -- Q2 2021 and representing an additional $23 million to our topline. Prices during the quarter, however, experienced, as Jorge mentioned, the steady decline, triggering $6.6 million of negative concentrate sales adjustments, a one-time effect typical experience at points of inflection, metal price trends. EBITDA of $57 million was 5% above Q2 2021, but $23 million below our EBITDA in the prior quarter as a result of lower sales and higher costs. Back to you, Jorge."
