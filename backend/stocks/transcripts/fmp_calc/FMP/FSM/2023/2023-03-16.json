    "content": " Net income, however, was negatively impacted by noncash impairment charges, net of taxes, adding to $164 million coming from Yaramoko, Lindero and San Jose mines. In Mexico, the San Jose Mine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s silver and gold production for 2022 totaled 5.8 million ounces of silver and 34,124 ounces of gold, achieving the upper end and midpoint range of annual guidance, respectively. Back to you, Jorge. Back to you, Jorge. After adjusting for the impairment and a write-down of ore stockpiles at the Lindero mine of $3.8 million, adjusted net income was $7.2 million compared to $29.1 million in Q4 2021. Free cash flow from ongoing operations, that is after CapEx at our operating mines and corporate expenses was $4.4 million compared to $46.8 million in Q4 2021. Outside of the impairment charges, the main items of adjustment to our adjusted net income in the year were $8 million of ore stockpile inventory write-downs and $5.3 million write-offs of mineral properties. During the year, we spent $251 million on additions to mineral properties, plant and equipment after our cash flow statement, which was mostly comprised of $108 million in the S\u00c3\u00a9gu\u00c3\u00a9la project construction, $9.3 million of S\u00c3\u00a9gu\u00c3\u00a9la brownfield exploration, $8.1 million of greenfield exploration and $112 million of capital expenditures, including brownfields at our operating mines. Back to you, Jorge. And in 2022, lower with respect to 2021, but nonetheless, this -- in the current price environment, we're still projecting healthy free cash flow out of San Jose in the range of $25 million to $30 million."
