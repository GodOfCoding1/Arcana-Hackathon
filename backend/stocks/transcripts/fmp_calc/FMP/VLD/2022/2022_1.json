    "content": " In summary, increasing customer adoption of Sapphire XC enabled us to exit the quarter with a record total backlog of $55 million, up 17% sequentially, and more than 80% year-over-year. Year of sale ASP for the quarter was in line with expectations of $1.3 million, as we mentioned last quarter, we expect year of sale ASP to rise in 2022 to between $1.5 million to $1.7 million as the result of increasing Sapphire XC sales, as well as a shift in transaction mix to more printer sales. We ramped up production of Sapphire XC systems in Q1, and as we foreshadow last quarter, Q1 gross margin was therefore impacted by launch customer pricing, higher material costs and higher labor and overhead for these systems. As we continue to ramp production volumes through the year and accumulate experience in building Sapphire XCs, we remain on track with the outlook for gross margin that we gave last quarter and the 30% gross margin target by the fourth quarter of this year. In summary, given our continued sales momentum, growing backlog, strong demand for our Sapphire XC system and solid balance sheet, we are well positioned to capitalize and what we see as significant growth opportunities in the additive manufacturing market in years ahead."
