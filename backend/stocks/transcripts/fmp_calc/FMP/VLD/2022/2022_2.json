    "content": " Given our first half revenue results, strong second quarter bookings and shippable backlog for this year we remain highly confident in achieving our 2022 revenue target of $89 million a year-over-year growth rate of 225%. Finally, we expanded our product leadership during this quarter with the launch of our Sapphire XC 1MZ, we believe this is the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s largest commercially available metal laser powder bed fusion production system with the capability to manufacture parts that are up to 1000 millimeter top and 600 millimeter in diameter at the total product volume of up to 10 cubic feet. In addition, we expect to see ongoing strong demand for both for Sapphire and Sapphire XC systems as customers continue to choose our industry leading technology for the additive manufacturing needs. In conclusion, given our continued sales momentum, growing backlog, strong demand for our Sapphire XC system, and solid balance sheet, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re well-positioned to capitalize on what we see as significant growth opportunities in the additive manufacturing market in the years ahead.
