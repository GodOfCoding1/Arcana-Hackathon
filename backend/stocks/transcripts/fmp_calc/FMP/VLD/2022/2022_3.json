    "content": " Given the impact of our third quarter shipment delays, ongoing supply chain uncertainty and the continued initial run of our Sapphire XC 1MZ system, we are reducing our 2022 revenue guidance to range of $75 million to $80 million. Compared to our expectations, gross margin was impacted by the delay in system shipments to the fourth quarter, and by higher than expect inventory adjustment charges associated with the initial production of our Sapphire XC product. We expect fourth quarter revenue growth of between 25% and 50% to a range of $24 million to $29 million, which is largely supported by our existing backlog, and gross margin of 5% to 10%, excluding non-recurring items and inventory adjustments.

Thank you very much. What I wanted to understand, I know we talked a lot about inventory, but I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m just curious as you look at your inventory, given the growth expectations that you do have, because obviously, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re still a growing company, I guess I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m trying to figure out how we balance what you can draw down near-term with kind of the ongoing inventory levels you may need to have to be able to manage, the revenue growth that at least theoretically should be coming through this industry. Thank you very much."
