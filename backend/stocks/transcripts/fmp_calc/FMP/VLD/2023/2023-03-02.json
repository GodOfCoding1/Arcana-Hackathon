    "content": " Additionally, we continue to have strong visibility going into 2023, given our Q4 bookings of $15 million and backlog of $43 million. In addition, we will see an improvement in working capital as we expect to reduce year-over-year inventory by 10% to 15% in 2023, given improved supply chain planning and material delivery schedules. Compared to Q3, Q4 year of sale revenue rose $10.5 million or 63% due to higher volume and a higher average selling price, which was due to three factors. Recurring in service revenue for the quarter rose $200,000 sequentially to $2.8 million, and reflected the increased number of systems in the field. On a year-over-year basis, year of sale revenue was up 187% from $9.4 million to $27 million, and recurring revenue was up 180% from $1 million to $2.8 million. On a non-GAAP basis, which excludes this gain and stock-based compensation expense, net loss was $16.4 million and adjusted EBITDA for the quarter excluding the same items was a loss of $14.4 million. We expect first quarter 2023 revenue to be in a range of $25 million to $28 million, which is largely supported by our existing backlog, and gross margin to be in the range of 9% to 11%, excluding non-recurring items. For full year 2023, we expect revenue growth of greater than 50% and revenues to be in a range of $120 million to $130 million."
