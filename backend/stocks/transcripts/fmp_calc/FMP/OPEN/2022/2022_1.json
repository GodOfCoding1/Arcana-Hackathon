As we said in our comments, what we're seeing right now or at least what we're managing against is an assumption that the housing market will cool towards the back half of the year, there will be a gradual slowing of HPA in volumes in light of rising interest rates and the pressures we're seeing on affordability. When the market tips and maybe to try to define that term where every single buyer in market is looking, downloading and using our app to shop, we're not certain, but we do see really good correlation with if we increase supply that we have and build a differentiated experience on top of that supply, buyers are actually using Opendoor directly."
