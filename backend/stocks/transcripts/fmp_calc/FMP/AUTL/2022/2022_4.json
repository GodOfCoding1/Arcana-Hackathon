    "content": " This was primarily due to the following: an increase of $11.6 million in clinical cots and manufacturing costs, primarily relating to our obe-cel clinical product candidate; an increase of $0.4 million in legal fees and special consulting fees in relation to our R&D activities; an increase of $0.2 million related to information technology infrastructure and support for information systems related to the conduct of clinical trials and manufacturing operations; an increase of $0.2 million in cell logistics costs; a decrease of $3.7 million in facilities costs related to the termination and closure of our U.S. manufacturing facility in 2021 and shifting our overall manufacturing strategy; a decrease of $0.9 million in depreciation and amortization related to property and equipment and intangible assets; and finally a decrease of $0.6 million in salaries and other employment costs, including share-based compensation expenses, which is mainly due to lower exchange rates used upon consolidation for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the year ended December 31, 2021, and this was offset by an increase in employees engaged in R&D activities. General and administrative expenses remained consistent at $31.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 respectively, primarily due to the following: an increase of $1.4 million in salaries and other employment costs, including share-based compensation expenses mainly driven by an increase in the average number of employees engaged in G&A activities; an increase of $0.3 million primarily related to information technology costs; a net increase of $0.1 million in legal fees and special consulting fees in relation to our G&A activities, which was offset against lower D&O insurance--director and officer insurance; a decrease of $1 million of commercial preparation costs due to the timing of related activities; a decrease of $0.4 million in facilities costs related to the termination of certain lease agreements in the prior year, and a decrease of $0.4 million in depreciation and amortization related to property and equipment and intangible assets."
