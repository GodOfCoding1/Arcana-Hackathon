    "content": " I would now like to turn the conference over to Luis Rojo, Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially, including but not limited to prospects for our foreign operations, global, and regional economic conditions and factors detailed in our Securities and Exchange Commission filings. Whether you are joining us online or over the phone, we encourage you to review the investor slide presentation, which we have made available at www.stepan.com under the Investors section of our website. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Scott Behrens, our President and new Chief Executive Officer. Continued raw material and transportation constraints, cost inflation, and the emergence of a new COVID-19 variant, were all headwinds against the business. However, I am proud about how our team worked through these challenges to deliver solid results for the first quarter. Reported net income was a record $44.8 million or $1.93 per diluted share, while adjusted net income was $40.7 million, or $1.76 per diluted share, representing the third best quarter ever on an adjusted net income basis. Reported Surfactant operating income reached a record of $53.8 million led mainly by better product and customer mix, which offset inflationary cost pressures, challenges imposed by global supply chains, and the 1% decrease in surfactant volume. Our operations team did a good job real establishing production in February, which allowed us to lift the force majeure in early April. On a global basis, Polymer sales volume increased due to strong underlining base business and one extra month of sales from the INVISTA acquisition, which closed at the end of January 2021. Our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend on Stepan's common stock of $0.335 per share, payable on June 15th, 2022. During the first quarter of 2022, the company paid $7.5 million to shareholders in dividends and repurchased $10 million of Stepan's stock. We remain confident in the strength and diversity of our business and its ability to generate cash that will allow us to further invest in our current business, pursue strategic M&A opportunities, and return cash to our shareholders. At this point, I would like Luis to walk through a few more details about our first quarter results. Because adjusted net income is a non-GAAP measure, we provide full reconciliations to a comparable GAAP measure. Specifically, adjusted net income this quarter exclude deferred compensation income of $4.4 million compared to last year expense of $1.7 million. The deferred compensation still represent the net income related to a company's deferred compensation plan, as well as cash settled stock appreciation rights for our employees. Slide 5 shows the total company's net income bridge for the first quarter compared to the same quarter last year, and break down the increase in adjusted net income. Because this is net income, the figures noted here are on after-tax basis, we will cover each segment in more detail. But to summarize, the Polymers business was down, while Surfactants and Specialty Products were offset slightly from the prior-year. Corporate expenses and all others were lower during the quarter, mainly due to lower acquisition-related expense. Surfactant net sales were $468 million, a 26% increase versus the prior-year. This was mostly offset by a strong demand in functional products, institutional cleaning, and personal care end market. This increase was driven by pricing and improved product and customer mix, which fully offset the effects of higher raw material prices and logistics cost, supply chain challenges, and a small volume decline. Net sales were $187 million, up 24% from the prior-year. Finally, volume rose 2% in the quarter driven by 5% growth in global rigid portfolio, which was partially offset by the 8% decline in PA volume following the power outage experienced on the Millsdale plant. Turning to Slide 8, our balance sheet remains strong and we have ample liquidity to invest in the business. During the quarter, we deployed $138 million in cash via CapEx investments, dividend payments, share repurchase and higher working capital requirements due to strong sales growth. As we wrap up the first quarter of 2022 and despite unprecedented inflation and continued supply chain challenges, we managed to deliver a solid quarter. The following two slides capture our strategic priorities and vision for a cleaner, healthier and more energy efficient world with our customers' preferences in mind. Strong first quarter results in Asia are a result of continued growth in the post-patent herbicide market, and high commodity prices are driving increased planted acreage of major crops in Brazil. We continue the integration and supply chain planning of the KMCO oil demulsifier product line, which we plan to relaunch in the second half of 2022. After closing the first full-year of operations in January, we delivered more than $23 million of EBITDA, achieving our third year financial target within the first year of ownership. The acquired INVISTA site in Wilmington, North Carolina, played a key supply continuity role during the first quarter of Millsdale power outage. As discussed previously, we are also increasing North American capability and capacity to produce ether sulfates that meet new regulatory limits on 1,4 Dioxane by the January 2023 deadline. 1,4 Dioxane is a minor byproduct generated in the manufacture of ether sulfate surfactants, which are key cleaning and foaming ingredients used in consumer product formulations. I am also pleased to share that in the first quarter we broke ground on our new Alkoxylation production facility at our site in Pasadena, Texas. It will provide strategically located capacity and capability for long-term specialty alkoxylation growth across our strategic growth end markets, including agriculture, oilfield, construction, and household and institutional cleaning. Full-year capital spending is projected to be between $350 million and $375 million inclusive of the 1,4 Dioxane and alkoxylation investments. Given the strength of our balance sheet, we plan to continually identify and pursue acquisition opportunities that align with our growth and diversification strategy, including the addition of new platform chemistries that can broaden our portfolio of sustainable offerings for our customers. In February, we opened our new fermentation laboratory to support and further accelerate our development efforts for Rhamnolipids, our first anticipated commercial biosurfactant offering. We believe this new bio-based product family has significant opportunities in several important end markets for Stepan including agricultural chemicals, consumer cleaning, personal care, and oilfield. Looking forward, we believe, our surfactant volume and agricultural chemicals and oilfields will remain strong as a result of high energy and crop prices. However, consumer price inflation may negatively impact consumer cleaning and disinfection demand, particularly in the developing economies around the world. We anticipate our Specialty Product business results will improve slightly year-over-year, but will be dependent on continued improvement and the availability of key raw materials. In closing, external supply chain challenges and inflationary pressures remain as headwinds within our business. At this time, we would like to turn the call over for questions to Jennifer. Yes, Mike, I would say, so far we've done a really good job with our pricing to stay on top of the inflationary pressures. And at some point, as we said in our prepared remarks, consumer cleaning demand at some point may get impacted by the elevated pricing specifically in the developing world. But so far, we're doing a really good job in terms of covering that cost inflation. So when you get to Q4, you know that, we have higher fixed costs and lower volumes typically in Q4. So margins by quarter have certain seasonality that you can check by year, and it's kind of the same pattern quarter-after-quarter. And then in terms of the Millsdale outage, it sounds like that's completely resolved when you're back up to full capacity. Let me add Mike, that's why in our prepared remarks, we have been talking in the last few quarters about the investments that we have done in Millsdale both on CapEx and expenses, to ensure that we fix everything that needs to be fixed and now, and we are in pretty good shape. So as we said in the prepared remarks, those investments will continue throughout 2022. So Mike, I would say that the softness that we're seeing in Laundry is multi-factoral in nature. The second element is I do think some of the price inflation is impacting some of the consumers in the developing regions, and having to make tough choices between consumer products and fuel and food. And then in terms of Surfactant inventory levels across the HI&I chain, I do agree with you, Mike, we are seeing what I would call fairly robust demand from our customers. And if you saw in our earnings release, our inventory values on our balance sheet are essentially flat, even though we've had significant cost inflation on raw materials. So inventories I think are well back in balance and from Stepan perspective, not still where we need to get them up to. And then last question for me, you kind of hinted that there could be some investments coming at this Wilmington site that you acquired with the INVISTA deal. So it's more, more around storage tanks and maybe some reactor modifications, but nothing on the scale that you're comparing Pasadena and 1,4 Dioxane projects. Please proceed with your question. And the portfolio complement very well, it's different products with different functionalities, but at the end it's complementing the portfolio that we have and providing our customers with more choices in terms of that portfolio. We have a really engaged and motivated workforce, aligned around our growth strategies and our ambitions. Yes, so Mike it is an affirmation of the future growth of our constellation as a product line. We are typically focused on the specialty and more niche products across more specialty markets than the large commodity, the volume and products that I believe is driving the other investment. Please proceed with your question. I wanted to kind of start up with a follow-up on a prior question on the Millsdale plant work that you're doing there, specific to the power disruption, hardening of the plant, if you will. Can you maybe talk a little bit more about any sort of specifics that you're doing around that, how much of the CapEx spend that you've already outlined is related to that. Look as we have said in the past the drivers of the CapEx investment of this year, the $350 million to $375 million range that we have provided is Pasadena and low 1,4 Dioxane. We continue making investments in our infrastructure in Millsdale and in other sites, but those tend to be significantly lower versus the other projects that we're talking. And then if you can maybe talk a little bit more about your Tier 2 and Tier 3 customers, it sounds like you had some pretty good strengths in the quarter. So once again, I think driven and led by the agricultural and oilfield markets on a global basis was a big component of that 250 new customers acquired in the first quarter. And then you've got the recovery of the HI&I market as economies reopened around the world so that HI&I market can get very fragmented in some of the developing regions, as well as in the developed regions, there's still good customer fragmentation. And then switching here onto the Polymers side, I know you've called out obviously some disruptions in terms of your COVID lockdowns. But I wondered if you can maybe help frame some of your expectations for the cold storage opportunities you're seeing, there here in the kind of the near-term. I would say -- Marco, I would say as it relates to cold storage, a lot of that planned growth is in the China marketplace. And I think that's a little bit uncertain right now with the COVID lockdown, and what China is experiencing with COVID. As it relates to green building, we're comfortable and confident that the infrastructure bill passed here in the U.S. is going to drive additional demand for our rigid insulation materials. I'd say at this point, we don't have a lot of details or specifics from our customers yet in terms of when they see -- when they could expect to see an uptick in those green energy driven infrastructure bill related advancements, maybe a little bit too early to tell. And last quick one if I can squeeze it in here, I know you may have mentioned the fact that you're cognizant, you are watching inflationary pressures and how it relates to impact of consumer demand but I was also kind of wondering given that sort of inflationary pressures that everyone is seeing out there as well as some of the global macro uncertainties that are arising from the Russia Ukraine war, can you maybe talk a little bit, if you are seeing any sort of changes in the competitive dynamics in the Surfactants business? We have not seen any changes to the competitive dynamics, I would say that overall market demand to this point is holding up and with the supply chain constraints that us and lot of our industry is facing, I think that's at the forefront of people's mind."
