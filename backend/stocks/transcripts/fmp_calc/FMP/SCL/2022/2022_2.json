    "content": " Adjusted net income for the second quarter of 2022 was a record $53 million, or $2.30 per diluted share versus $42.2 million or $1.81 per diluted share for the second quarter of 2021. Specifically, adjusted net income for the second quarter exclude deferred compensation expense of $0.6 million compared to last year's income of $1.1 million. Surfactant operating income for the quarter was $48.2 million, which represents a 5% growth versus prior year. Selling prices increased 30% due to the pass-through of higher raw material and logistics costs and recovering our margins Volume increased 2%, driven by a 5% growth in Global Rigid Polyol, which was partially offset by lower demand in PA and lower volumes in the specialty Polyol business due to supply chain challenges. During the quarter, cash from operations was $84 million, and we deployed $123 million against CapEx investments, dividend and debt payments, share repurchases and higher working capital requirements due to the strong sales growth."
