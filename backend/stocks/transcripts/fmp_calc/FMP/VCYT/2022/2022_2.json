    "content": " As you saw in today's earnings release, our strong execution during the quarter resulted in impressive Q2 growth of 32% versus the prior year with revenue equalling $72.9 million. And while the true in call to impact to Afirma is difficult to quantify, we estimate that this situation lowered volume by approximately 4% compared to the prior year and our expectations At this point, the vendor's internal issues are now largely resolved and we are back to a near normal level and timing of shipments from them with our team continuing to supplement as needed. Decipher, we are expecting to -- as Marc mentioned, to have continued strong growth over the course of 2022, and already provided kind of the biopharma and other impact in the second half with regard to Griffin's prior question. I mean, the lessons learned across our entire portfolio go back to our strategy here really and that's always been the same, and it's been done very successfully in a firmer and it's been done very successfully in prostate, and that is you identify a clinical unmet need that fits into the physician's workflow, you generate a lot of evidence, you get KOL support, you get into guidelines, you get reimbursement and you have a very efficient and effective commercial team that drives it, and you can continue to repeat that. And then specific, I would say to prostate, I mean, remember that there have been molecular diagnostics for prostate cancer for quite some time, and Decipher has done a really good job -- the Decipher product and the team has done a really good job of coming into that market where a lot of the groundwork did exist and penetrate that market really, really well and create new groundwork to expand that market beyond where it had currently been penetrated."
