    "content": " Given these factors, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re revising our 2022 revenue outlook to approximately $2 billion and adjusted EPS of $2.60 to $2.75 per share, or growth of 30% to 38%. In addition, the ARPA government support for childcare services that we received on behalf of certain client centers was higher than we anticipated, and reduced the subsidy revenue that was needed from those clients by approximately $6 million in Q2. Adjusted operating income for the full service segment was $22 million, or 6% of revenue, an increase of $18 million over Q2 of 2021. The 50% operating income flow through was driven by the gains and enrollment that I mentioned, as well as an increase of $12 million in our books government funding that we received at our P&L centers. And so, ultimately, as we think about the progress that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re making, obviously, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s really focused on continuing to be able to take full time enrollment in our centers, because that is certainly what families are seeking in terms of care."
