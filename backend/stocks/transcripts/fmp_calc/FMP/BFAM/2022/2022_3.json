    "content": " Our higher ed, healthcare and industrial clients that represent approximately 60% of our clients and portfolio continue to show the highest occupancy levels, while our tech and consumer clients centers experienced the fastest enrollment growth over the prior year. Revenue increased 30% over the prior year to $129 million, outpacing expectations on strong use in the third quarter. Adjusted operating income held steady at $46 million or 8% of revenue, while adjusted EBITDA of $81 million or 15% of revenue increased 2% over the prior year. Revenue gains were driven by increased enrollment in pricing, which contributed approximately 10% to revenue expansion, as well as by the addition of Only About Children, which we acquired effective July 1, and which contributed 37 million in the quarter. As Steven mentioned, we're particularly pleased with the strength of use growth through the quarter and resulting operating performance, which deliver $40 million of operating income or 31% of revenue in the quarter. Please proceed with your question. Please proceed with your question. Please proceed with your question. And so, that's why we cited the again in enrollment is higher in our infant and toddler groups and a little bit lower in the preschool group because that's a net gain in preschoolers is about half 3%, 4% whereas infants and toddler growth is more like 7%, 8% averaging out to around that mid single digit. Please proceed with your question. So certainly, we haven't finalized this, but certainly would be looking to ranges in the mid to higher single digits, so 5% to 7% knowing that we need to remain competitive, and we're in a marketplace that we are certainly aiming to get enrollment back as well as maintain the pricing that we believe are appropriate for the service for delivering. Please proceed with your question. Please proceed with your question."
