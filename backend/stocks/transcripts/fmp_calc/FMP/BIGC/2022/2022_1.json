    "content": " We have invested tremendous time and resources over the last few years towards our transformation into a leading enterprise e-commerce company, and our results clearly reflect the success of that effort, both our financial results and the third-party accolades that our technology platform is receiving from our agency and tech partners as well as the leading industry research analysts where BigCommerce is now recognized as a true enterprise platform leader across B2C and B2B. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. So, I would look at our kind of revenue guide is kind of a nice beat for Q1, took it up a bit and holding kind of our op loss consistent, but also adding about roughly $1 million in the midpoint to invest in BundleB2B because we feel like once we can make those investments, we're going to be able to really go to market the way we want with our B2B offering. Your line is open. But -- so in a situation that a lot of merchants are in now when they're thinking about a multi-year bet around e-commerce, a lot of these enterprise merchants have seen their e-commerce business really grow really nicely over the last two to three years. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open."
