    "content": " Enterprise account ARR was $216.2 million, up 35% year-over-year. Subscription revenue grew 26% year-over-year to $53.2 million, driven by our continued mix shift to enterprise accounts. Our ARR grew to $305 million, up 20% year-over-year driven by continued strength in our enterprise customer base. Enterprise account ARR was $216.2 million, up 35% year-over-year. As we discussed, our prioritization of enterprise by shifting both people costs and variable costs away from non-enterprise to enterprise demand generation activities may create a period of slower bookings and potentially revenue growth in the front half of next year as those resources build an even larger enterprise deal pipeline. And then the non-enterprise business, as you've seen in Q3, we expect that dynamic to play out in Q4 and likely in the front half of next year, which is why we're -- as you think about revisiting 2023 numbers, we want to be very transparent as to how we're thinking about it. As I think about Q4 and the front half of next year, I suspect that the flat to declining trends would continue, but I do expect it to moderate as the non-enterprise sign-ups that we do have likely are going to get past that 12-month mark, and we see great retention once they do that. And then maybe just one for R.A. As you continue to deemphasize small accounts, you have the removal of free trials, you're shifting your sales efforts towards enterprise, is it fair to think that the next several quarters will be a bit of a transitory period, maybe fewer small merchants joining some churn? We want to continue to increase our leadership position across those because that in the end, I think that's how enterprise becomes 80% of our ARR by the end of '24 and likely 90% of our ARR or more over the next 5 years."
