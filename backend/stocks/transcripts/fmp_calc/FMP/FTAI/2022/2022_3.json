    "content": " And next year, 2023, we're very confident in leasing EBITDA of $350 million to $400 million for the year, excluding gains on asset sales. Importantly, 2 of these asset sales involved FTAI retaining the engine services contract on behalf of the buyer which should generate $1 million per annum per aircraft or $10 million total per annum of aerospace EBITDA over the remaining lease term of approximately 8 years. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d be curious, when I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m looking at some of the numbers that you just mapped out around asset sales and redeployment of capital into new assets that are happening during 4Q, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re selling a fair amount more assets than you sold in the last two quarters and you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been able to recognize pretty impressive gains on sale that were even above the range during one of those quarters of the $20 million to $30 million range. On the leasing side, as I indicated, we're very comfortable next year hitting the sort of $90 million to $100 million per quarter. In terms of the leasing EBITDA, I said we're very comfortable with next year being in that $90 million to $100 million per quarter range. When you look at the various asset sales and asset purchases, I think we should end up the year potentially with sort of $50-ish million drawn on the revolver. So mostly the pluses and minuses, we're adding $300 million of assets and effectively cash flows will receive from the operations as well as the asset sales, it's pretty much -- pretty close to a wash. And if you look at our pro forma -- if we do $550 million to $600 million of EBITDA next year, we'll be under 4x."
