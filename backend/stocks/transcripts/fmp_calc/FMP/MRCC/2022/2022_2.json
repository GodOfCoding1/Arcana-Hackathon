    "content": " We also reported NAV of $232.1 million or $10.71 per share as of June 30, 2022, a decrease of $0.59 per share from NAV of $244.9 million or $11.30 per share as of March 31, 2022. MRCC enjoys a strong strategic advantage in being affiliated with a best-in-class middle-market private credit asset management firm, with approximately $14 billion in assets under management and over 175 employees as of June 30, 2022. As of June 30, 2022, our investment portfolio totaled $536 million, down $10 million from $546 million as of March 31, 2022. For the quarter ended June 30, 2022, adjusted net income -- net investment income, a non-GAAP measure, was $5.4 million or $0.25 per share compared to $5.4 million or $0.25 per share in the prior quarter. Total investment income was $13 million during the second quarter, up from $12.5 million in the first quarter, due to higher fee income, partially offset primarily by lower interest income. Total expenses for the quarter increased from $7.1 million in the first quarter to $8 million in the second quarter, primarily driven by higher incentive fees net of associated fee waivers and income taxes, including excise taxes, partially offset by lower interest and debt financing expense as a result of the repayment of our SBA debentures during the first quarter. Net unrealized losses on investments were $13.4 million for the second quarter, primarily driven by the market volatility and spread widening, partially offset by unrealized gains approximating $1 million on foreign currency forward contracts. As of June 30, the SLF had investments in 62 different borrowers, aggregating $195.2 million at fair value with a weighted average interest rate of 7.1%."
