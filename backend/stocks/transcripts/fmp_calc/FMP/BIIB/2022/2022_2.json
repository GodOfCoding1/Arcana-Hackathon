    "content": " The results of this analysis suggest that compared to standard of care alone, individuals treated with lecanemab, in addition to standard of care, may potentially experience slower disease progression to mild, moderate and severe Alzheimer's disease from baseline by 2.51, 3.13 and 2.34 years on average, respectively. These include zuranolone regulatory filings for both MDD and PPD in the U.S., the Phase 3 readout of lecanemab in Alzheimer's disease and the initiation of mid- to late-stage studies in Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and lupus."
