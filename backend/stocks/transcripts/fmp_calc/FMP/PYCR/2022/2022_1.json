    "content": " We delivered strong results for the first quarter of fiscal year '22 with total revenue of $92.7 million, up 17% year over year, and adjusted operating income of $3.4 million. And then when I think about, you know, one of the things that really differentiates Paycor, I think it's the vertical focus in a couple of key verticals, even though you're available broadly. So as we expand sales coverage, the great news is that's why we're seeing continued growth in the broker channel because there are more brokers in Tier 1 markets than there are in Tier 2 and Tier 3. And then just unrelated, but with the U.S. economy now having added back basically all the jobs that were lost during the pandemic as of last week, should we now think of employment gains within your installed base as sort of that modest tailwind that it was pre-COVID, so a small driver to incremental revenue growth as opposed to something that's maybe been a bit larger over the last few quarters?"
