I think from an additional perspective, we're staying with the 20% to 25% headcount target for the year just because it's -- the rate of how you can add people into the system and hiring the right leader, onboarding them, we feel like that's the right number for quality. I think as you think about when it impacts our revenue growth and how it impacts the pace of the revenue, it's really about right now the upfront, right, in the booking as we're being intentional about how we target in these markets and creating products and go-to-market strategy that fits."
