Our average customer size increased to 77 employees in Q4, an increase of 9% year-over-year as we continue to shift away from the Micro segment and accelerate growth among clients with more than 100 employees. For the first quarter, we expect total revenue of between $112 million and $114 million or about 23% growth at the high-end of our range, and adjusted operating income of between $4.5 million and $6 million. For the full year, we expect revenue of between $510 million to $516 million or 20% growth at the top end of our range and we anticipate adjusted operating income of $58 million to $61 million."
