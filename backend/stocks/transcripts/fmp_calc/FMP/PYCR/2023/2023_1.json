    "content": " Modest changes in unemployment or job openings are unlikely to materially impact our business as most of our revenue growth is derived from new logo additions and the market is still very early in adopting modern cloud-based HCM solutions, plus HCM is highly defensible as our value proposition is mission critical to attracting paying and retaining great talent. Total revenue for the quarter was $118 million, increasing 28% year-over-year, our highest and recent record. Based on the continued demand and attractive returns we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re seeing, we continue to invest in our sales expansion strategy and marketing programs to drive new business growth and capture market share, primarily in Tier 1 markets. On a gross basis, we invested $19 million in R&D or 16% of revenue, slightly lower than 17% a year ago and in line with our long-term targets. This quarter, we increased operating income to $10.4 million or an 8.8% profit margin, more than double the 3.7% last year. At today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rates, we anticipate interest income will be in the range of $20 million to $24 million for the full year on average client fund balances of just under $1 billion. For the second quarter, we expect total revenue of between $126 million and $128 million or 24% growth at the high end of the range and adjusted operating income of between $12.5 million and $13.5 million. For the full year, we expect revenue of $528 million to $534 million or 24% growth at the top end of the range, and we anticipate adjusted operating income of $65 million to $68 million. With less than 2% share of our $29 billion total addressable market, we have significant runway for continued growth and remain enthusiastic about the trajectory of the business."
