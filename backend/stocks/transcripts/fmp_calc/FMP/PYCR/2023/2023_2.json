    "content": "  Operator: Hello, and welcome to the Paycor's Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. It's now my pleasure to turn the call over to VP of Investor Relations, Rachel White. Good afternoon, and welcome to Paycor's earnings call for the second quarter of fiscal year 2023, which ended on December 31. On the call with me today are Raul Villar, Jr., Paycor's Chief Executive Officer; and Adam Ante, Paycor's Chief Financial Officer. Today's call is being recorded, and a replay will be available on our website following the conclusion of the call. Statements made on this call include forward-looking statements related to our financial results, products, customer demand, operations, impact of COVID-19 on our business and other matters. These statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions and are based on management's current expectations as of today and may not be updated in the future. Thank you, Rachel, and thank you all for joining us to discuss Paycor's fiscal second quarter results. Revenue grew 29% this quarter, driven by record bookings and ongoing PEPM expansion. Based on these robust results and our optimistic outlook for the remainder of the year, we are once again raising our guidance, which Adam will discuss in more detail. Our go-to-market motion continues to deliver excellent results as we strategically expand sales coverage in Tier 1 markets, leverage influential broker relationships and continue to grow our average deal size. We like our sales staffing level, and we'll continue to evaluate additional hiring in the second half. We offer the only modern cloud platform, empowering frontline leaders to be more effective by providing the insights and tools required to source, attract, develop and retain their employees. This quarter, we introduced the COR Leadership Dashboard that provides actionable information to help transform managers into effective frontline leaders. The COR Leadership Dashboard surfaces real-time employee insights and evaluates leadership effectiveness by gathering feedback on how well they coach, optimize and engage their team. Armed with these insights, companies will understand leader effectiveness and be able to tailor ongoing leadership development. Given the continued tightness in the labor market, our clients' top priority remains finding and retaining talent. This quarter, we closed the Talenya acquisition and began beta testing Paycor Smart Sourcing, which leverages AI to simplify and streamline the sourcing efforts of frontline leaders to find skilled and diverse talent. With the addition of Paycor Smart Sourcing, our full suite of solutions is $44 PEPM and is the most comprehensive HCM offering available in the SMB market. With nearly 90 different public API endpoints available to power integrations, Paycor offers the most modern interoperability solution with a broad array of partners for our clients. The labor market remains tight as nonfarm payrolls continue to increase, job openings are at elevated levels, and workforce participation remains low. Furthermore, HCM is highly defensible as our value proposition is mission-critical to attracting, paying and retaining great talent, while also driving a compelling return on investment for our clients. Lastly, I would like to thank all Paycor associates for their efforts through this calendar year-end, especially our implementation, support and success teams who, during our busiest time of year, provided an amazing year-end experience for our clients. I'll discuss our second quarter results, then share our outlook for the third quarter and fiscal year. We had another strong quarter, delivering total revenues of $133 million, up 29% year-over-year and recurring revenue growth of 22%, marking the fifth consecutive quarter of 20-plus percent revenue growth. 90% of our revenue is derived from companies with between 10 to 2,500 employees, where we continue to see outsized growth. Effective PEPM increased 11% year-over-year, which includes cross-sell as well as pricing initiatives such as the conversion of our clients to our latest product bundles, and it also includes the impact of higher bundle adoption at the point of sale. In addition, we're pleased with the progress we're seeing across our partner program as we continue to expand our interoperability platform. The number of employees on our platform increased to more than 2.3 million, up 9% over the prior year. However, on a sequential basis, organic customer growth has been essentially flat, following strong growth earlier in calendar 2022. As we shift our portfolio upmarket, we continue to see moderation in employee growth in the micro segment, while the number of employees in the mid-market and enterprise segments increased 11% year-over-year, and net retention continues to trend favorably. Adjusted gross profit margin, excluding depreciation and amortization, improved to 77.9%, an increase of about 1.5 points year-over-year as we continue to scale the business. We continue to strategically expand our sales teams and marketing programs, primarily in Tier 1 markets. We like the current level of spend and continue to evaluate investments to ensure that they will deliver an attractive return, but we have the flexibility to quickly pivot if we were to see a change in the demand environment. On a gross basis, we invested $23 million in R&D or 15% of revenue, a similar level to last year and in line with our long-term targets. We continue to focus on efficiently enhancing our modern platform to deliver on our leader strategy, whether it's through organic development, partnerships or acquisitions. G&A expense was $19 million or 14.5% of revenue, down 1.5 points from 16% in the second quarter of 2022. While we continue to focus on building a sustainable 20-plus percent revenue engine, we are also steadily expanding margins as we scale the business. This quarter, adjusted operating income increased to $18 million or a 13% profit margin, up more than 300 basis points from the 10% last year, even while continuing to expand investments in sales and marketing and R&D. This quarter, free cash flow was a $3 million spend compared to a negative $7 million last year. This quarter, we generated just under $8 million of interest income on average client funds of about $1 billion, an effective rate of just over 300 basis points. In terms of our outlook for the second half of the fiscal year, we remain optimistic on the HCM demand environment. Our guidance assumes no material change in the broader demand environment or labor market, which has been fairly consistent and flat organic employee growth among existing customers for the balance of the year. For the third quarter, we expect total revenues of between $155 million and $157 million or 28% growth at the high end of the range and adjusted operating income of between $35 million and $36 million. For the full year, we expect revenues of $539 million to $545 million or 27% growth at the top end of the range, and we anticipate adjusted operating income of $75 million to $78 million. With respect to interest income, we expect our effective rate to increase marginally in the third quarter to about 330 basis points. At today's rate, we expect interest income will be in the range of $28 million to $30 million for the full year on average client fund balances of just over $1 billion. However, we will look to drop any incremental interest income beyond that to the bottom line, which will increase our full year outlook on margin and cash flow. Overall, we're pleased with our strong quarterly performance and ability to raise guidance again. As a mission-critical application, we believe in the durability of the category and our opportunity to continue capturing share with the expanding $32 billion HCM market. Raul, you mentioned all of the ways in which your business continues to perform in this environment. To date, we haven't seen any changes in our overall demand environment. So to this date, we've seen strong demand. Gabriela, the 1 thing I would say is that we've just seen a little bit more softness in that organic customer growth in that sort of micro segment, really small segment under 20 employees. Besides that, there's really nothing else that we're seeing. I mean the way that we think about it is that it's about the broader demand environment, our ability to grow the sales organization at pace and do it well, so that we continue to drive the profitability and the overall return out of that investment across the sales channel. And we feel like there's sort of a natural limit in terms of that 20%, 25% headcount growth, which is what we've been targeting for the last couple of years. And so as we think about our ability to grow faster than that, we just haven't seen -- we've seen that operationally, it's just a little bit more complex, so it becomes a point of diminishing returns. So the way that we talked about it a couple of years ago and over the last 2 years now has really been about being consistent in the sales execution, developing this engine in this flywheel that can continue to grow. And so it's just about continued execution over the next couple of quarters to stay about 20%, I think. The other dynamic, Gabriela, is that we'll continue to add PEPM along the way. So we really think about it as 2 key components to drive consistent, sustainable long-term growth is our ability to continue to add sales headcount and our ability to continue to expand our PEPM and our average deal size. And we're going to continue to execute and focus and obviously, we want to continue to improve our performance over time. Just the effect of PEPM growth of 11% year-over-year, really strong. I mean, what we see is that it's really the combination of 3 key things, like we mentioned, right, the conversion in that subscription bundle, we see higher adoption at the point of sale, and we see pricing initiatives as well that go into that. Each quarter, fluctuates a little bit depending on the initiative that's going in. But broadly, and over the last couple of quarters, it's been fairly consistent, close to 1/3 across each of those items. So there's not 1 item that necessarily sticks out, 1 of the other it's been pretty consistent, and we've seen really good execution across those 3 dynamics. Retention has been excellent, which has really helped us to get into a really solid perspective. And productivity, as we would expect, our new people produce at a lower rate and they slightly drag down the overall productivity based on the outsized hiring. But by and large, our tiers are operating as we would think from a 10-year perspective, our first year bucket or second-year bucket and then beyond 2 years. Congrats on the strong quarter. I would say, again, we had consistent results across all segments. So the product is really shifting, and we're seeing a lot of traction upmarket, which is newer for us than maybe others. From a module perspective, talent continues to fly off the shelf, and we're seeing high attach rates, and we actually charge for it. So it's been a great opportunity for us, and we're really excited about it. It's differentiated, and it's winning in the market. From a marketing perspective, obviously, the sports partnerships have provided some great air cover. We're seeing record impressions, record traffic to paycor.com and record leads. I guess the first question is just, Raul, I think you said in your prepared remarks that it was a record bookings. So we've seen significant growth, over 100% growth in L.A., San Francisco, South Florida, and the D.C. marketplace. And yes, Q1 of last year, while any 1 quarter isn't necessarily a good metric here on that retention. Q1 of '22, actually was rather low for us as we were going in sort of coming -- growing over some of the COVID challenges. So on a year-to-date basis, it's technically up, but it's been really consistent over the last call it, 5 quarters now. We were wondering if we were going to see a little bit of an acceleration, but it's been really consistent with where I would sort of expect it to be from pre-COVID levels. And I think that it's driven more dynamically by overall employee retention, right, for our customers, our customers' employee retention, which has been maybe a little bit more consistent this year and back in line with pre-COVID level. First of all, payroll and HCM in general, at least demand for these solutions kind of on all customer segment level seems to be holding up extremely well today and much better than the other software segments, I think that most of us on this call cover. One is it's like some of your other software, we're not a land and expand. So there's not any requirement or expectation that you're going to add more seats, so to speak. Secondly, I think the category as a whole has changed over the last decade, and it's really added some really powerful modules around recruiting, around attracting, around retaining employees. And so in this hyper tight labor market, I think that's been a big driver of accelerated demand. Secondly, cloud solutions and HCM kind of lag behind the adoption rate of some other solutions that you would cover. So I think the combination of the cloud acceptance in our category, the additional modules that we're adding that are helping other facets of the organization outside of traditional finance or traditional HR have really made the solutions more powerful and more attractive. And again, the 3 modern players in our space combined have somewhere between 8% and 12% share. And then from a follow-up perspective, you mentioned your sales hiring is on track, and you've already achieved the low end of your range. As you look at the placement of those individuals this year, I know Tier 1 cities have been the focus, but these hires, are you looking at putting them in maybe different geographic locations or customer segments than what you are 6 or 9 months ago, just seeing if there's any slight change to your strategy relative to the current demand trends you're seeing? I mean we're still really focused on -- the majority of the people we are hiring are focused on what we would call 50 to 1,000 segment, 50 to 2,500. But ultimately, we're still in the early innings of coverage in the fact that we're still -- while we cover the entire market, we have opportunities to continue to add. And we'll look at different design, Scott, whether it's 50 to 250 or 50 to 2,500 or 250 to 2,500. It's actually a bit of a follow-up to Scott's question, but there's a lot of metrics that you have given in terms of PEPM and growth in bookings and everything else. Brian, yes, I mean, when we look at the pipeline, I'm not sure that it looks any different than what we've seen historically. And I think the big thing, of course, is everybody buys payroll, everybody gets the sort of HCM core platform, that's Table 6 now and part of that bundle adoption at the point of sale that we've been talking about. And we're already seeing interest and really strong demand around that solution, really early days. We continue to see our enterprise segment and the larger end of our customer segment looking for more talent solutions, which continue to drive that ADS up and continue to drive PEPM up where the payroll historically has been a lower part of that rate. So I think that's what we see, the same thing inside of pipeline, excuse me, is that, that continues to grow with more and more customers looking for talent solutions. Congrats on the strong quarter. So when we were going into the year, we were expecting something in that sort of $12 million range, $12 million growing to $24 million. And we were targeting about half, looking to spend about half of that at that $20 million to $24 million range. So we've been targeting about half, meaning that we would be maybe in that $10 million to $12 million range on a full year of investment or reinvestment of those interest income funds. So as we look at the increase to 30% in this case, we're not necessarily looking to -- I mean, we'll look for opportunities to invest it, but I don't think that we're going to see the opportunities that we're looking for. On the cross-selling side, we continue to have strong success with our client sales team selling additional modules into the base. Obviously, they're really focused on talent as a primary driver. And the team continues to play a big contribution to our overall growth, and we're excited about where we are with them. We've released a lot of product and developed a lot of great features that we've released to our customers, as well as invested pretty heavily in our service and support organizations. And of course, we're really intentional with it. And since the portfolio is growing quite nicely with a lot of new customers over the last couple of years, we've been able to revisit those prices pretty regularly. For a little flavor, I would say we had really strong results in professional services, and food and beverage and accommodations this quarter. We continue to invest into product differentiation and tools for implementation for our clients, so we can easily customize the tool for them for their specific industry. So we see -- it's like well less than 1% of our overall revenue for the year, well less than that. Raul, as a follow-up, it caught my attention when you reeled off 3 metro areas that we're doing particularly well. Like taking L.A. as an example, like what would make L.A. a place where you see particular success? I mean I think it's overall business density, obviously, critical. And when you add a really large dense marketplace that's been saturated on legacy solutions that are just looking for something modern as we've entered there, we've seen a lot of strong success. We really started in '21, and this will be our third fiscal year. I mean, so if you think about it, there's -- we really manage the 50 metro markets. And I would say Tier 1, which is the 15th largest which includes L.A. and San Francisco and Miami, I would say we're in the early innings. And when you think about Tier 2 markets, which are the next 15 biggest cities in America, we have, again, tons of opportunity to continue to expand. And so for us, it's a long runway of continuing that headcount, but also seeing that headcount mature through the tenure cohort and continuing to drive productivity. I was wondering, first off, if you can speak to the trend you're seeing with your own real-time pay solution. Mark, while we see good adoption or sort of continuing growth in the adoption, it's still just overall -- I mean, the materiality is -- I mean, it's immaterial in terms of its impact on the revenue. When we see clients adopt it, you usually see a couple of employees in a company using the card and then it takes some time for them to really start to get into actually using it somewhere that drives card economics. So with that in mind, I mean, I just think that it's going to be a long runway to revenue there. That really just continues to give -- it becomes table stakes almost because we put it into that -- the core offering and a lot of the competitors do, too. And then, Raul, regarding the focus that you've had for a long time now on the leaders within an organization, I'm interested in whether that is resonating perhaps in some new and different ways just because of this unique type of environment that we have, where unemployment, I think, is at a 50-year low, wage inflation is so high. I mean companies must have sort of a heightened interest in how they're leading, how they're managing, how they're retaining the workforce. And we continue to invest in opportunities, whether it was goal setting or most recently with smart sourcing to help leaders find and source new employees faster. And recently, with our COR Leadership Dashboard really helps leaders understand where they are, how their employees are viewing them from a coaching perspective, from an optimization perspective, are they making them effective, are they making them better, and then are they engaged, and are they going to stay longer. And so obviously, we believe that leaders drive associate engagement and associate engagement drives overall productivity for our clients. And if we can continue to help deliver that for our clients, they're going to be more successful. Obviously, as we put more focus on those prospects from a sales perspective, we're going to get more of that. The product itself over the last few years has significantly added feature functionality, where we're differentiated from our peers, and we believe we have the most robust solution in HCM. So ultimately, I think it's the feature functionality, the ease of use of the platform and our robust talent tools that are driving success in that that 500-plus market so far. And it essentially -- instead of asking a frontline leader to kind of view through hundreds of LinkedIn profiles or resumes stacked on their desk, we do that work for them through AI and provide them a list that they should start with first. And so it's a home run, and we're really excited about it. On our next call, we're going to be really excited to share the results. I think AI, in general, there is tremendous opportunity across the entire HR platform to leverage the data that we have to provide insights to our customers. And obviously, the team that we acquired with Talenya are experts at this and will help us think through our long-term strategic planning about how to leverage AI across the other modules of our platform. Internally, obviously, there's plenty of opportunities to use that kind of functionality to improve the user experience, whether it be through -- essentially, we already have chat with a person. And so it's not a be-all end-all solution by any means, but I think it's part of a future employee -- user experience that will help separate Paycor from the rest. I think, Adam, you had mentioned that there was no material change in labor or demand environment factored into your guidance. Yes, it's based entirely on where the rate environment is today. So yes, any increase in rates going forward would mean there's additional upside."
