    "content": " We closed fiscal year '23 with operating cash flow reaching $7.1 billion, up 19% year-over-year, the highest cash flow in our company's history and one of the highest cash flows of any enterprise software company our size ever. And for fiscal year '24 revenue, we're guiding to $34.7 billion at the high end of the range, over 10% projected year-over-year growth. And next week, at our TrailheadDX conference in San Francisco on March 7 and 8, you'll see how we're bringing even more innovation through our platform with our new EinsteinGPT technology, the world's first generative AI for CRM, a tremendous complement to our Data Cloud and core Einstein AI platform. Really a great payoff in the investment we've made in the technology there and really having our sales team show up and speaking the customer -- the language of our customers to drive the growth of this business, couple that with the strategies around driving international growth, international expansion of all of our products, along with multi-cloud selling, a great opportunity for us going forward."
