    "content": " For the quarter, consolidated net sales increased 17.7% as a result of strong order backlog, along with improved manufacturing production and efficiency and higher receipt of offshore products. Consolidated gross margin was 60.4% for the first quarter, primarily due to a change in sales mix with our retail segment becoming a larger portion of favorable product mix, previous product pricing actions that are now working their way through delivered sales and higher manufacturing productivity and efficiency partially offset by higher input costs. Retail sales growth of 18.5% increased our retail sales mix from 85% of consolidated sales last year to 85.6% in this year's first quarter, improving our consolidated gross margin. Adjusted operating margin expansion was primarily from higher consolidated net sales, retail and wholesale gross margin expansion and strong cost containment measures, partially offset by higher selling expenses, including increased delivery and freight costs combined with higher marketing spend. Our SG&A expenses when expressed as a percent of net sales decreased from 44.7% last year to 42.9% in this year's first quarter, reflecting our strong operating leverage. This operating margin expansion combined with double-digit delivered sales growth helped generate another quarter of strong profits with diluted EPS of $1.17, up 48.1% to last year. We generated $38.4 million in cash from operating activities during the quarter, an increase from $17 million in the prior year period primarily due to higher net income and an improvement in working capital."
