    "content": " Consolidated gross margin increased 310 basis points to 60.4% primarily due to a change in sales mix, higher manufacturing productivity, previous product pricing actions that are beginning to work their way through our P&L and a favorable product mix partially offset by higher import and raw material cost. Adjusted operating margin was 15.8% of sales, up from 11.1% of sales last year due to fixed cost leverage on the higher of sales volume, strong retail gross margins, and cost containment measures, including lower marketing costs due to a change in marketing initiatives as will be discussed by Mr. Kathwari shortly. I think that if you take a look at our backlog, for instance, compared to -- our retail and wholesale backlog is up in between 22% 23% compared to the previous year, even after very strong deliveries. And if you take a look at it, last year coming into our fourth quarter, our gross margins were at about -- close to, I think, 58.7%, correct Matt?"
