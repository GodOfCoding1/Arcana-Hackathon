    "content": " Consolidated gross margin was 58.2% in the just completed fourth quarter and 59.3% for the full 2022 year, primarily due to strong retail segment sales, previous product pricing actions that are now working their way through our delivered sales and higher manufacturing productivity, partially offset by higher input and freight costs. Increased wholesale contract business shipments lowered our retail sales mix from 84.5% of consolidated sales last year to 82.1% in this year's fourth quarter, reducing our quarterly consolidated gross margin, while helping increase our operating margin. Our SG&A expenses, when expressed as a percentage of sales, decreased from 44.7% last year to 39.8% in this year's fourth quarter, reflecting our strong operating leverage. This operating margin expansion, combined with double-digit delivered sales growth, helped generate record profits as diluted EPS for the fourth quarter was $1.23, up 73.2% to last year. In April, our Board of Directors increased the regular quarterly cash dividend by 10% to $0.32 per share, which is subsequently paid in May, and brought our full-year 2022 year total to $48.3 million."
