    "content": " Our order backlog at December 31, are approximately 50% higher than a year ago, but becoming more current and we expect to get caught up during calendar 2022 Retail net sales were up 24% and wholesale net sales increased 14.2%. Consolidated gross margin increased 210 basis points to 58.8% primarily due to a change in the sales mix, benefits realized from the ongoing manufacturing and logistics optimization project, and a favorable product mix, partially offset by higher import in raw material cost. Adjusted operating expenses were 43% of sales for the quarter, down from 43.8% last year due to our operational leverage, along with reductions in certain selling expenses, including advertising costs. Adjusted operating margin, which excludes restructuring initiatives and other corporate actions, increased from 13.1% last year to 15.7% in the current year, primarily due to the strong gross margins and cost containment measures. Adjusted diluted EPS was $0.95, an increase of 37.7% due to net sales growth, expanded retail, and consolidated gross margins, our ability to minimize operating expense growth and improved production and delivery of products, partially offset by higher raw material and freight costs."
