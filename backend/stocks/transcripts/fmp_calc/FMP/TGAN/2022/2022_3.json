    "content": " First of all, our success in higher power comes from the underlying stability of the TGAN FET architecture that allows it to be offered industry standard, thermally robust packages like the TOs to TO247 which today's e-mode gallium nitride finds it difficult to do because of inherent device weakness, 15:11 Better materials capability for GaN devices which is better and higher power from a smaller or lower current diet versus that of competing and solutions and proven reliability with high yield manufacturing of large area GaN power chips."
