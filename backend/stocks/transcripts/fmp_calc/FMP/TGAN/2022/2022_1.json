    "content": " Another quick recap, TGAN has the capability of complete control and innovation across the value chain with what we call our asset-light vertically-integrated model, we own the key portions of the manufacturing, the core epiwafer technology, which is a must in our opinion, to own and control, the wafer fab in which we are a joint venture partner with a strong new partner now in place package manufacturing through subcontractors, but with the control of IP, for example, how to make high power gallium nitride work in industry standard, thermally robust packages, which others cannot do so, and a strong emphasis on application driven resources, both internally and with quality partners, as you saw in press releases last week for our Qualcomm QC 5 compatible 100 watt adapter solution."
