    "content": " Virtual tour volume was up 27% from the first quarter, And our total leasing pipeline is 4.8 million square feet, broken down between 1.4 million square feet on our operating portfolio, and 3.4 million square feet on our development project. Looking at our capital plan, fairly straightforward until those $200 million, our 2022 CAD payout ratio will continue to be 84% to 95% and likely be at the higher end of that range. And certainly having that building which had been previously vacant, now 85% lease, which is the two top floors to lease, things puts us that -- we think that puts in a very good position to generate that either great NOI stream over the next 11 years or great capital event sometime in 2023. In terms of 3151, the combined pipeline we have for both Schuylkill Yards West and the 3151 start, its very strong, it's very diverse in terms of size and type of sponsorship be that institutional, public company established company, so we take a look at where we -- when we think these timing requirements these prospects are, they're very keen on delivery timeline, which us -- starting the project gives us the ability to meet. I think within 2340, we're definitely saying that is an opportunity to harvest some significant liquidity on a building that it for all intents and purposes, you need to look as almost as the land play right now is really not -- it's actually generating negative net NOI for us  selling that building would actually generate a significant liquidity event for the company."
