    "content": " Adjusted net revenue increased 51% year-over-year, reaching R$576.1 million, followed by an adjusted EBITDA growth of more than 37% year-over-year, reaching R$220.2 million with a margin of 38.2%. Also, we are happy to say that Afya reported great results on the digital health services revenue, which ended the quarter with an increase of almost 50% year-over-year, and more than 20% excluding acquisitions reverting the trend observed in the first quarter. Moving to slide number 5, the conclusion of another medical students\u00e2\u0080\u0099 enrollment cycle ensuring 100% of occupancy for the second half, added to the positive trend on continuing education and the recovery of digital services on this quarter, enabled us to reaffirm our guidance for the entire year of 2022. Adjusted net revenue for the quarter was up 51% year-over-year to R$576 million, reflecting the maturation of medical seats, higher tickets in Medicine courses, the Continuing Education recovery, the Digital Services rebound and the consolidation of acquisitions. Adjusted net income for the second quarter of 2022 was R$119 million, an increase of 83% over the same period of the prior year. On the Digital Services, we still have the impact from Medcel, but combining all the offers, all the pillars that we have, we are seeing the second half are better gross profit, gross margin coming from Digital Services and moving forward, we expect Medcel to start launching the new products and also improving their results when compared to last year after September, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s when we launched the new release, the new version of Medcel products for the following year."
