The Digital Services segment increased 25% year-over-year, a combination of; a great start of the B2B engagements, reaching roughly 100 contracts, including pharma solutions and RX PRO contracts,with 45 different pharmaceutical industry companies; and expansion of the active payers in the B2P, mainly in Whitebook, iClinic and Shosp, partially offset by the lower performance of Medcel, due to a higher competition scenario in the Residency Preparatory market.
