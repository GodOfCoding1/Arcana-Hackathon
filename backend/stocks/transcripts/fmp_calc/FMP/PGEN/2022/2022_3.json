    "content": " Interim data from the Phase I combination arm demonstrated encouraging safety and efficacy with a 40% objective response rate, both complete and partial responses in a patient population that has failed previous checkpoint inhibitor treatment. You may recall that during our second quarter of 2022 call, we announced FDA's clearance to incorporate repeat dosing in this study and we are pleased to report that the first patient has received a repeat dose via IV infusion. But what I can say is we are definitely looking forward to this presentation because we are really excited for this patient population and what PRGN-2012, is currently showing both in regard to the safety and efficacy, and we are pleased that basically our investigators can present this data early in January. We are so thrilled that almost 2.5 years post starting these trials, Phase 1, not only we have shown the capability of this UltraCAR-T to -- actually to manufacture it, but also in patients to be kinetically expanding it and show the preliminary signs of efficacy there."
