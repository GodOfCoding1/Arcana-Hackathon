Excluding development revenues, non-China product revenue for the third quarter of 2022 was $42.8 million, an increase of $2.1 million or 5% compared to the third quarter of the prior year. In Aerospace and Defense, third quarter revenue declined approximately $7.6 million or 27% year-over-year to $20.2 million, representing 34% of sales. Third quarter revenue declined 17% year-over-year to $22.2 million, representing 37% of total sales. Revenue from industrial customers outside of China was $19.8 million, which was approximately flat compared to the third quarter of 2021. Beginning on slide seven, total revenue for the third quarter of 2022 was $60.1 million, a decrease of $12.1 million or 17% compared to the third quarter of the prior year and near the bottom end of our guidance range. Products revenue for the third quarter of 2022 was $48 million, a decrease of $6.4 million or 12% compared to the third quarter of the prior year. Development revenue for the third quarter of 2022 was $12.1 million, a decrease of $5.8 million or 32% compared to the third quarter of the prior year. Turning to slide nine, non-GAAP operating expenses for the third quarter of 2022 were $19.4 million or 32% of revenue, compared to $18.1 million or 25% of revenue for the third quarter of the prior year. Turning to slide 10, non-GAAP net loss for the third quarter of 2022 was $5.1 million or $0.11 per share, compared to non-GAAP net income of $3.9 million or $0.08 per diluted share for the third quarter of the prior year. On a GAAP basis, net loss for the third quarter of 2022 was $13 million or $0.29 per share, compared to $6.9 million or $0.16 per share for the third quarter in the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter of 2022 was a negative $1.4 million, compared with $7.2 million for the third quarter of the prior year. Net cash used by operating activity was $2.8 million for the third quarter of 2022, compared to net cash provided by operating activities of $400,000 for the third quarter of 2021. Our capital expenditures for the third quarter of 2022 were $3.5 million, compared to $5.7 million for the third quarter of the prior year. In light of this weaker demand, during the fourth quarter we will evaluate our cost structure and seek to streamline our business to increase operational effectiveness such that by the first quarter of 2023, we expect to achieve breakeven or better adjusted EBITDA at approximately $55 million to $60 million of revenue. We have seen our China microfab business, right, in a couple of million dollars, $2 million, $3 million of revenue range over the last few quarters."
