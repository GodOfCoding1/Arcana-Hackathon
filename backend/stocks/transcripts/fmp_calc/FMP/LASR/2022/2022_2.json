    "content": " In Q2, revenue from customers outside of China grew 12% year-over-year to $56.2 million or approximately 92% of revenue compared to $50.3 million or 73% in Q2 2021. In Aerospace and Defense, second quarter revenue declined 6% year-over-year to $22.5 million, representing 37% of sales. During the second quarter, we generated product revenue from the sale of laser products to multiple U.S. defense contractors and foreign allies and have engaged in many additional design-in opportunities with foreign allies seeking to deploy land, sea and airbase lasers. Revenue declined 12% year-over-year in the second quarter to $21.9 million, representing 36% of total sales. However, industrial revenue from customers outside of China increased 43% year-over-year to $20.2 million. Total revenue for the second quarter of 2022 was $60.8 million, a decrease of $8.3 million or 12% and compared to the second quarter of the prior year and was within our guidance range. Product revenue for the second quarter of 2022 was $48.2 million, a decrease of $5.4 million or 10% and compared to the second quarter of the prior year. Development revenue for the second quarter of 2022 was $12.6 million, a decrease of $2.9 million or 19% compared to the second quarter of the prior year. Urology is the first application, which is driving demand, and we're seeing significant growth from small numbers this year, but it is a market that is \u00e2\u0080\u0093 certainly has the opportunity to be tens of millions of dollars of revenue for us, and over time, medical can be a more important part of our business. So when you're looking at mix based on power, and you can see if you go back four or five quarters, you'll see that the low power percentage of total fiber laser revenue has continued to increase."
