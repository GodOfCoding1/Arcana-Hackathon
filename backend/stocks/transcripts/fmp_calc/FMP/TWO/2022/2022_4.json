    "content": " To assist our investors and analysts when thinking about our earnings potential, this quarter, we are introducing a new metric called income, excluding market-driven value changes, which will provide more of a market value base view of our quarterly portfolio returns. This new metric is defined as total comprehensive income, excluding market-driven value changes on the aggregate portfolio, income taxes associated with market-driven value changes, non-recurring operating expenses, and the gain and the repurchase and retirement of preferred shares. As you can see in the table on this page, this quarter, our income excluding market-driven value changes was $0.73 per share representing an annualized return of 16.7%. We are introducing this metric to better help our analysts and investors understand the current quarter return contributions excluding market-driven value changes, and we intend this metric to be complimentary to the return potential and outlook slide later in the deck, which reflects management's prospective view on returns. Would it be fair to say that that since the income ex market-driven value changes is as you mentioned backwards looking, that's the static returns would still be a very good way to assess the potential dividend paying capacity or earnings power of new money yields going forward when we're trying to assess the, the dividend capacity there. If you look on Slide 16, right, this is where we show our sensitivity the portfolio sensitivity book value sensitivity to changes in current coupon mortgage spread at the bottom half of the slide, where you see, up or down 6% depending on a 25 basis point move and if you see the components there relative to the two parts of the portfolio themselves."
