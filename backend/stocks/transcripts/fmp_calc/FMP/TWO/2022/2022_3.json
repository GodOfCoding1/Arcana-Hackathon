    "content": " In rough terms, a portfolio of 3.5% through 5% coupon RMBS with 8x leverage we have lost a little over 20% on equity over the last two quarters while our preferred shares had a total return around negative 25%. Indeed in the wake of the Fed's meeting current market pricing implies another 125 basis points of hikes over the next four meetings, which would bring the implied Fed funds rate to north of 5% by mid 2023 before the Fed pauses as seen in figure two."
