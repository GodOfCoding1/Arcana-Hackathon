    "content": " The repricing across the rates complex was historic with current coupon and two-year treasury rates rising by 142 and 160 basis points, respectively, which were the largest quarterly increases in over 30 years, and are shown by the outlined observation on the far right of the histograms. The sharp rise in the current coupon rate translated nearly one for one in primary mortgage rates as the Freddie Mac survey rate rose from 3.11% to 4.67% during the quarter, as shown in figure 3. Secondly, higher rates also increased the spread duration of our unallocated RMBS even as we actively manage the portfolio by selling low coupons and buying higher coupons. Please proceed with your question. Please proceed with your question. I mean, on Page 11 of our presentation, we showed this a little bit where the specified pools and 2.5 through 3.5 underperformed TBAs and 4s and above outperformed TBAs, and I tried to make a comment about that in my prepared remarks, but for the lower coupons, it was a longer spread duration, mostly that was mostly the cause of that or the catalyst for that and then the higher coupons, you have this effect of that's where the production is going to occur and the deliverables are going to be changing there, making the TBA worse than specified pools.
