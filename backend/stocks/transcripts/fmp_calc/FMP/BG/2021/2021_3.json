    "content": " Adjusted core segment earnings before interest and taxes or EBIT were $698 million in the quarter versus $580 million last year, reflecting higher results in Agribusiness and Refined & Specialty Oils. Based on what we can see right now, we would expect EPS to be well above our baseline for the next couple of years, driven by higher than baseline assumptions for Refined & Specialty Oils and softseed crushing. I think what we\u2019ve seen change are the continued strength from the recovery of COVID around Refined & Specialty Oils from the foodservice side, what we\u2019ve seen with the continued demand being added from the renewable diesel sector, what it\u2019s going to take here in multi years to do the work to build some of the supply that\u2019s going to be needed. So, maybe following up on Tom\u2019s question and thinking about how your \u2013 the discrete areas where you\u2019re seeing upside to that baseline framework, I think you called out the softseed side, softseed crush as well."
