    "content": " On a constant currency basis, our revenue in Q3 of 2022 amounted to $65.7 million reflecting organic growth of 10%. Revenue from the rest of world, which includes South Africa and APAC grew 28.6% to $12.6 million in Q3 of 2022 compared to the same quarter of last year. Just to provide a better understanding, USA territory and rest of world were not impacted by the currency headwinds but our European territory lost in a constant currency basis around $27 million in revenue. To summarize, although our operating margin remained at the same level as of last year at 17.6% on a constant currency basis, we are improving our operation margin to a mid-range of 18.9% in 2022, an improvement of 130 basis points."
