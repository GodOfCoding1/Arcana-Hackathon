Our revenue in North America amounted to $48.2 million, 3% higher than Q2 of 2021 and $0.8 million lower compared to Q1 of 2022, mainly due to time to close new logos. On a constant currency base compared to Q2, revenue was higher by $6.7 million, reaching $66.6 million, reflecting a growth rate of 11.5%. Revenue from rest of world which includes South Africa and APAC grew 23.8% to $10.6 million in Q2 of 2022 compared to the same quarter of last year, mainly from P&C deals in South Africa. The lower free cash flow in the quarter is mainly due to the following reasons: low net operating profit, bonus payments with regards to 2021 results and timing of contractual payments milestone as well as deferred payment paid by our customers in previous quarter which were recognized as the revenue this quarter. One, balancing between gross and profit; two, risk mitigation due to numerous geographic operations across the world; three, white core offering and many business applications; four, we have a direct and long-lasting relationship with our customers; five, more than 85% of our business is driven by existing customers; and six, solid and strong balance sheet."
