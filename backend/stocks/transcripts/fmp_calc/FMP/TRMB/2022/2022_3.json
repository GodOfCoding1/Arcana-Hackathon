In fact, the embedded in our guidance as you do the math, you'll see we expect to have very high gross margins in Q4 even higher than Q3 and that's a function of a business mix, which will be more software centric and we'll have more of the net benefit of the prices we've taken and moderating cost inflation.

Your line is open."
