    "content": " Gross margin in the first quarter was 57.9%, down 50 basis points year-over-year, reflecting higher product and freight costs in our supply chain, partially offset by increased pricing and improved software margins. We continue to progress on the conversion of our transportation enterprise software business to recurring revenue models and made good progress on development of a new product in our mobility business, which we believe will improve both margins and competitiveness when it is launched later this year. Driven by improved price realization and revenue mix, we expect gross margins will be approximately 250 basis points higher in the second half of the year compared to the first half, and operating margins will be approximately 200 basis points higher in the second half of 2022 versus the first half. And then in terms of the second quarter guidance, looking at the high end of the potential revenue outlook year-over-year implies sequentially sales performance that's worse than normal seasonality by a few points. You're tracking well ahead of the 55% software recurring revenue target that you outlined, granted the last Investor Day was a number of years ago, but well ahead of that target even with the outside strength that you've had in hardware in the last several years. I mean, certainly, it's our long-term view as you get through model transitions that the nature of the gross margins in the business and a recurring revenue business and software business for that matter are such that we should be able to increase the operating leverage over time."
