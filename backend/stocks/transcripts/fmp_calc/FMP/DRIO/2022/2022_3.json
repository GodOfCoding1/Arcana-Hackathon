    "content": " While we have had off-cycle customers that have launched, especially in behavioral health, the majority of the metabolic and full suite contracts that we have recently announced are expected to launch in the first quarter of 2023, as a result, while our performance is improving each quarter, we expect to see significant growth into 2023. So this trend is going to continue slightly on OpEx, but mainly in terms of top line and also bottom line improving the financial profile, and you want to see the company losing less -- significantly less money into next year. And we believe that towards next year -- mid of next year, we're going to see this line getting back to growth because the more we penetrate, the more we're going to invest into the sales and marketing on the B2B side. So we have the most amount of data on an overall basis in diabetes, but then rapidly moving into the overall suite because we agree with them on this, but their point of view is they're looking at health plans primarily and their point of view is, hey, the people that have the best evidence are going to  which is fully consistent, right, with the way that they look at medications on an overall basis. I think first on the ARR, the $61 million, is it fair to say that given where we are in the calendar year that most of the large employers, the self-insured plans would have kind of made their decision by now and that the incremental growth from here would come from health plans that would probably most likely kind of have some impact next year, just depending on timing in terms of increments above the $61 million."
