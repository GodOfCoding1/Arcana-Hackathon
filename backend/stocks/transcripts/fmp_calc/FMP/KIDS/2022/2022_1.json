    "content": " In the first quarter of 2022, we generated revenues of $23.4 million, representing growth of 9% compared to the first quarter 2021. In the first quarter of 2022, we generated quarterly trauma and deformity revenue of $16.5 million, representing growth of 13% compared to the prior year period. In the first quarter of 2022, we generated scoliosis revenue of $6 million, representing growth 1% compared to the prior year period. That said, we believe the underlying demand for our products remain strong and we expect a more favorable elective procedure environment as we progress through the second quarter and the balance of 2022, which gives us tremendous confidence to deliver mid-20% growth for the full year. In the first quarter of 2022, we generated total international revenue of $5.2 million, representing growth of 13% compared to the prior year period, growth in the quarter was driven primarily by strong agency sales. In the first quarter of 2022, scoliosis revenue of $6 million increased 1% compared to the prior year period. In January, February, we saw pretty low clinic volumes and so we were maybe a little slower in Q1 than we would have liked just because of the impact of the pandemic, but given the kind of interest that we're seeing, the onboarding of new customers, as well as just what we have in the pipeline for Q2 and beyond, we still feel really good about doubling that number in 2022."
