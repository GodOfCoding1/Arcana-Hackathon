    "content": " Second, as we shared last quarter, we are building YallaChat with a unified login system, which allow users to log into any products within the Yalla Group using their YallaChat account. We delivered a strong financial performance in the second quarter of 2022, which group revenues reaching a record of US$76.1 million, up 14.2% year-over-year, accelerating from the first quarter. Our revenues were US$76.1 million in the second quarter of 2022, a 14.2% increase from US$66.6 million in the same period last year. Our cost of revenues was US$29.3 million in the second quarter of 2022, a 23% increase from US$23.8 million in the same period last year, primarily due to an increase in technology service fees resulting from the expansion of our product portfolio and the increase in salaries and benefits resulting from the expansion of operation and maintenance team. Our selling and marketing expenses were US$11.2 million in the second quarter of 2022, a 14.8% increase from US$9.8 million in the same period last year, primarily due to higher advertising and marketing promotion expenses led by our continued user acquisition efforts and expanding product portfolio. Our general and administrative expenses were US$6.9 million in the second quarter of 2022, a 37.4% decrease from US$11.1 million in the same period last year, primarily due to lower share-based compensation expenses recognized during the second quarter of 2022. Our technology and product development expenses were US$7.7 million in the second quarter of 2022, a 144% increase from US$3.2 million in the same period last year."
