We will also work towards the 24% policy goal and keeping full year take rate at a similar level to this quarter, the first quarter 2022, while trying our best to aim for 3%. 30-day collection rate, on the other hand, recorded a modest decline in March and April. Loans priced within 24% APR reached 78% of loan originations in the first quarter, up by 40.5% year-over-year and 18.5% quarter-over-quarter. Sales and marketing expenses rose 4% year-over-year to RMB 360 million, a seasonal trend as we laid out the full year foundation in first quarter. The contribution from noncredit driven services increased by 10% year-over-year to 47.7% of total operating revenue in the first quarter, demonstrating the progress in diversification. For new issue loans, thanks to the strategies introduced in fourth quarter last year, for the 24% pricing policy, early day risk indicators such as FPD30 trended better quarter-over-quarter. 30-day collection rate, on the other hand, recorded a modest decline in March and April."
