    "content": " Private NIM of 111 basis points, originated $420 million of private education loans, reported BPS revenues of $87 million and increased our adjusted tangible equity ratio to 7.5%, while returning $128 million to shareholders through dividends and repurchases. Net interest margin increased 14 basis points from the year ago quarter to 111 basis points leading to an increase in interest income of $5 million compared to the prior year, even as the portfolio declined 11%. As expected, felt delinquency rates increased to 15.9% and forbearance rates declined to 13.1% from the year ago quarter with a charge-off rate at 9 basis points. While the reduced new loan volume results in lower than expected net interest income, this is being partially offset by a slowdown in prepayment speeds of the overall portfolio as higher interest rates provide less of an incentive for existing customers to prepay."
