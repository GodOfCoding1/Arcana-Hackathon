Three, with more than 75% of pet parents away while services being delivered, we found that the ability to access on demand and recurring dog walk, pet sitting, training services and much more across 5300 cities in all 50 states is a way in the door with premium pet parents across the US. Third, we're focused on platform expansion and diversifying the products and services within the platform, including the recent launch of a full suite of dropping products, including 20, 30 and 60 minute options across all markets in the US and multi-day bookings, which enables pet parents to book multiple services for the same day and just drop into visits when a pet parent is away from home for an extended period of time. Our focused on being the number one premium pet services platform to pet parents has allowed us to achieve a record quarter once again, with continued platform diversification and growth in both service and wellness revenue. Many but two reasons for that are, we believe, fundamentally, that we're targeting a premium  people are not really concerned about booking two, three, four, seven services a month, and also bundling that with a premium and with the pet insurance purchased and with a wellness plan and whatever else. Whether it's a dog walk or a sitting or a boarding or training or a pet insurance purchase or a wellness plan, Premium is how we think about this kind of bundling of products and services for unique pet parents."
