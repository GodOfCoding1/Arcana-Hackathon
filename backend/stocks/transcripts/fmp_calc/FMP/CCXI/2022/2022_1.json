    "content": " To drive the increase in new patients, start forms recorded this quarter, our commercial team has focused on the top prescribing physicians responsible for roughly 80% of all ANCA -associated vasculitis prescriptions in the United States, and the majority of TAVNEOS referrals, as referred to on Slide 7.
