We think that partnership opportunities will accelerate because all the questions we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re getting here, many folks who engage in mortgages, one of their business lines will probably decide to move out of that space as we continue forward through the end of this year and into next year, creating opportunity for us to step in and be there, their mortgage partner.
