    "content": " For the quarter ended December 31, we invested $86 million in new and existing portfolio companies at a weighted average yield of 11.2% and at sales and repayments of $31 million. For the investments in new portfolio companies, the weighted average debt-to-EBITDA was 4.3 times the weighted average interest coverage was 2.1 times and the weighted average loan to value was only 24%. We invested over $375 million in equity coinvestments, and have generated an IRR of 27% and a multiple on invested capital of 2.3 times. As of December 31, the weighted average debt to EBITDA on the portfolio was 4.7 times and the average interest coverage ratio, the amount by which cash income exceeds cash interest expense was 3.2 times calculated based upon the last 12 months interest expense. For the quarter ended December 31, net realized and unrealized change on investments and debt, including provision for taxes was a loss of $82.2 million or $1.26 per share. Look, part and parcel of the equity coinvestment business, if you want to call it that is, you're lending money to the company, you're saying, the sponsor we want to ride alongside of you because we're helping to drive the growth, and we want to participate in the upside of the growth and we're also good partners."
