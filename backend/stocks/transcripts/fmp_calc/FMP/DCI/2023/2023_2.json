    "content": " In terms of profit we talked a little bit about gross margins and operating margins and we're a little bit unseasonal I would say this year, and to the future gross margin questions that we're going to get, you know there's really a lot going on in terms of FX, in terms of inflation, in terms of accounting variances and you have some stock moving from quarter-to-quarter to make sure you're matching your variances with the inventory. And when you look at our margins, you really have to look at the first, second and third quarters and put them together, because you've got some stuff moving around and you got a lot of volatility in the income statement, and we would hope as we move to the future, you know that inflation stabilizes, currency stabilizes and we get some more accounting stabilization in our income statement, and that will make our gross margins a little more easy to understand."
