    "content": " Our margins improved, gross margin increased both sequentially and year-over-year and operating margin of 15% reached a six year quarterly high. Sales were up 11% year-over-year, driven by the combination of pricing of 11% and volume growth of 8%, partially offset by a currency translation headwind of approximately 8%. Sales in Off-Road of $108 million were up 15% with growth in all major regions, except APAC and were driven by continued high levels of equipment production and growth in our Exhaust and Emissions business in Europe. On-Road sales of $36 million were up 14% from prior year supported by an increase in medium and heavy duty truck builds, particularly in North America. In Aerospace and Defense, sales of $34 million were up 22% year-over-year, with strength in new equipment and replacement parts as the commercial aerospace industry continues to recover from pandemic related softness. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales were 18.9%, favorable by 80 basis points over prior year driven primarily by leverage on higher sales. Consistent with previous guidance, we expect to deliver an operating margin within a range of 14.5% and 15.1%, up from 13.5% in the prior year due to gross margin expansion and operating expense leverage."
