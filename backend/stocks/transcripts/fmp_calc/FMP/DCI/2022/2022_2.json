    "content": " This quarter our company hit an important milestone as our sales exceeded $800 million, growing 18% over prior year. In Engine after market sales in the second quarter were $398 million, an increase of 21% with growth across all geographies, and most notably in North America, broad market strength across most end markets and our strong production output drove results. Moving to Aerospace and Defense, second quarter sales of $27 million were up 30% year-over-year as we benefited from the strengthening commercial Aerospace industry. Now, turning to the Industrial segment, the Industrial segment had another solid quarter with total sales increasing 15% to $248 million. Second quarter sales of Special Applications were $48 million up 10% with growth across our product portfolio, including double-digit increase. Second quarter operating margin increased 70 basis points to 11.9%, but was down 150 basis points on an adjusted basis reflecting continued gross margin pressure in the quarter. Second quarter operating expense as a percentage of sales was 19.2% favorable like 280 basis points on a GAAP basis, and favorable by 150 basis points on an adjusted basis. However, recent results this quarter were below expectations and as price increases in the second half are only expected partially offset cost inflation, we are reducing our gross margin outlook to be down 100 to 150 basis points versus the 50 to 100 basis points decline previously anticipated. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open."
