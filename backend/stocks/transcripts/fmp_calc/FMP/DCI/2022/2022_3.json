    "content": " Donaldson had another quarter of record sales at $853 million, up 12% year-over-year. To size this, third quarter China sales were about 6% of total company sales and this compares to 8% a year ago. PowerCore sales in aftermarket increased about 35% over prior year, another quarterly record. Third quarter sales of Gas Turbine Systems, or GTS, were approximately $31 million, reflecting a 19% increase due to new equipment sales in Europe and the U.S. In summary, third quarter sales grew 12%, operating income was up 2% and EPS of $0.67 was $0.01 above last year. Operating margin this quarter is up 13%, it was down 130 basis points year-over-year on continued gross margin pressure. Third quarter Engine pretax profit margin was 14.8%, down 110 basis points year-over-year. For Engine, we expect an increase of between 16% and 18%, up from our previous forecast of between 12% to 16%, driven by off-road and aftermarket year-to-date results combined with additional pricing realization expected in the fourth quarter."
