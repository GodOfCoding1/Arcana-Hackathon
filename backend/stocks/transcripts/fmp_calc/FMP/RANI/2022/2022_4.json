    "content": " As we plan for the initiation of our first Phase 2 clinical trial in the second half of 2023, I would like to remind everyone about our recent interactions with the FDA particularly the feedback received during our pre-IND meeting for RT-102. Lastly, before I turn it over to Mir Hashim to cover our preclinical and clinical data in more detail, I would like to remind you of our anticipated near-term milestone, which include initiating a Phase 2 clinical trial with RT-102 in the second half of 2023 and initiating 3 additional Phase 1 studies with pipeline molecules, RT-105 containing an adalimumab biosimilar, RT-110 containing PTH for hyperparathyroidism and RT-111 containing Celltrion's ustekinumab biosimilar. Overall for RT-102, we are enthusiastic about the progress we have made so far and we believe that the safety, reliability and pharmacokinetic data that we collected through both parts of the Phase 1 study support the initiation of a Phase 2 trial of RT-102 in osteoporosis, which we anticipate beginning in the second half of 2023. Excluding non-cash charges, primarily equity based compensation expense, the non-GAAP net loss was $13.3 million for the fourth quarter and $47.8 million for the full year 2022 compared to $10 million and $28.8 million for the same periods in 2021 respectively. We look forward to the initiation of our Phase 2 clinical trial in RT-102 in the second half of 2023, our first Phase 2 trial as well as the initiation of three additional Phase 1 studies with pipeline molecules RT-105, RT-110 and RT-111.
