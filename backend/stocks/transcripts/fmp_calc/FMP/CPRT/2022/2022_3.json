    "content": " Our U.S. non-insurance business grew approximately 3% in unit volume year-over-year, driven in part by growth in our consumer-based Cash For Cars business as well as growth in non-salvaged sources of volumes, such as rental car fleets, corporate fleets and financial institutions. Purchased vehicles continue to comprise a larger percentage of our overall revenue mix, driven by both unprecedented used car values and growth in volumes, particularly in our consumer-facing Cash For Cars business in the United States and from expansion in Germany. Yeah, I mean it's a combination of vehicle prices and also units and as we mentioned, we've seen significant growth in the U.S. in our consumer-facing business, our Cash For Cars business, where we buy lower-value vehicles directly from consumers. I think the good news in our business today is that the auction liquidity is robust enough that there are always a very healthy number of countries looking at and bidding on vehicles certainly many buyers in the U.S., across the U.S. and in Canada, Mexico and Central and South America and alike that are bidding."
