    "content": " Taking these trends in both chronic care and BetterHelp into account, as well as the impact of a stronger dollar on our international revenue, we believe it's more likely that our overall financial performance will be towards the lower end of our consolidated revenue and adjusted EBITDA guidance ranges in the second half. Revenue from BetterHelp, our direct-to-consumer mental health brand grew over 40% as compared to the prior year's quarter or 7% sequentially over the first quarter, representing strong growth albeit towards the lower end of our expectations as we continue to see lower yield on marketing spend as compared to the prior year. This helped to drive new chronic care program enrollment of 92,000 in the quarter, bringing total program enrollment to over one million programs, an increase of 167,000 or 20% over the prior year.
