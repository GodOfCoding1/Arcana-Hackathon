    "content": " In the first half of 2022, we have received orders exceeding $16 million for our CVD Equipment products, as compared to approximately $9.6 million for the same period in 2021. CVD's revenue for the second quarter of 2022 was $5.8 million, as compared to $4 million for the second quarter of 2021, an increase of $1.8 million or 44%. Net loss for the second quarter of 2022 was $0.8 million or $0.12 per diluted share, as compared to net income of $1.5 million or $0.22 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2021. However, that quarter included a $2.4 million gain on debt extinguishment from the forgiveness of CVD's PPP loan. CVD's operating loss for the second quarter of 2022 decreased by $0.2 million to $0.9 million for the second quarter of 2022, as compared to an operating loss of $1.1 million for the second quarter of 2021. This decrease was a result of increased revenue of $1.8 million and the resulting improvement of gross profit margins of $0.4 million, offset by increased operating expenses of $0.2 million. For the 6 months ended June 30, 2022, revenue was $10.5 million, as compared to $7.4 million in the same period in 2021, an increase of $3.1 million or 41.4%. Net loss for the 6 months ended June 30, 2022, was $1.8 million or $0.27 per diluted share, as compared to a net loss of $35,125 or $0.01 per diluted share for the same period in 2021. And again, that small loss of $35,000 in 2021 included a $2.4 million gain on debt extinguishment from the forgiveness of CVD's PPP loan. For the 6 months ended June 30, 2022, CVD's operating loss decreased by $0.8 million to $1.9 million, as compared to an operating loss of $2.7 million for the same period in 2021. Our backlog at June 30, 2022, was $16.7 million, as compared to $10.4 million at December 31, 2021, an increase of $6.3 million or 60.5%. This increase is due to the timing of the receipt of new orders for the 6 months ended June 30, 2022, of $16.7 million reduced by recognized revenue of $10.5 million. Our cash and cash equivalents at June 30, 2022, was $12.2 million, as compared to $16.7 million at December 31, 2021. Our working capital was $15 million at June 30, as compared to $16.7 million at December 31, 2021, a decrease of $1.7 million or 10%. Our return to profitability is dependent upon, among other things: the substantial completion and delivery of existing orders, which include the significant first half of 2022 orders of approximately $16.7 million; the ongoing receipt of new equipment orders and others; the lessening of the ongoing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business and the aerospace market; managing through the supply chain issues discussed; and improvement in operational efficiencies as well as managing planned capital expenditures and operating expenses."
