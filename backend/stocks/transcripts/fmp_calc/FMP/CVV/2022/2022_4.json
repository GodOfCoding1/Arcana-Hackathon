    "content": " During the fourth quarter 2022, we recognized net income of $1.5 million. In the fourth quarter, we were selected and received a system from a major aircraft engine manufacturer, specifically the order was for a production chemical vapor and infiltration system valued at approximately $3.7 million. This increase in our revenue was primarily attributable to our PVT-150 product line which represented approximately $2.2 million or 30% of all revenues in the fourth quarter, as compared to no such revenues in the prior year fourth quarter. As Manny mentioned in the fourth quarter of '22, we completed our analysis of whether the company was entitled to an employee retention credit, and we determined that for two quarters in 2021, we were entitled to a credit of $1.5 million, and that was recorded as a non-operating income item in the fourth quarter. Net income -- our net loss for the fourth quarter '21, I should say was $1.2 million or $0.18 per share. Similar to the fourth quarter, this increase in revenue was attributable to our PVT-150 product line, which represented approximately $7.5 million or 29% of our revenue in 2022."
