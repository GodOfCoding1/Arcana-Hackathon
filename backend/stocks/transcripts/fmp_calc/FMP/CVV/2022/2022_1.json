    "content": " Having spent the majority of 2021 transitioning, reorganizing, refocusing, and realigning the company's resources and strategy towards a path to future profitability and growth, we're beginning to see the result in the form of improved market adoption and orders of our products. In the first 4 months of 2022, we have received orders exceeding 11 million for our CVD Equipment products as compared to approximately 5.5 million for the same four-month period in 2021. Of the 19 system orders, 14 are for our recently announced PBT 150 system addressing silicon carbide growth and processing, while the remainder of the system's orders are for battery nanomaterials, both R&D and production, advanced carbon-based capacitors, and for our legacy advanced R&D first nano system. We believe the orders we received during the first four months of 2022, and the order rate of the prior two quarters continue to validate our strategic focus on growth and use markets such as battery nanomaterials, silicon carbide growth systems, and advanced composite materials for aerospace and other markets. Am I getting over my skis that -- we're at the point where we've got a $15 to $25 million annual run rate, just based on those products for the next one to two years, so that if the aerospace, God willing comes back, that that will be incremental order flow to CVD over and above, the robust product pipeline you're enjoying with battery nano and carbon-based capacitors."
