    "content": " In fact, our strong performance today gives us the confidence to increase guidance for our beer business as we now expect to achieve 9% to 11% net sales growth and 4% to 6% operating income growth for fiscal 2022. First, continued strong demand for our core imported beer brands provides a point of competitive strength versus industry peers led by their number one share gainer in the beer category Modelo Especial which we feel has ample runway for growth well into the future given the steadily increasing household penetration rates among non-Hispanic consumers and continued strong velocity. For full year fiscal 2022, the wine and spirits business continues to expect net sales and operating income to decline 22% to 24% and 23% to 25% respectively. In closing I want to iterate that while we had our fair share of challenges during the first half of our fiscal year resulting in several puts and takes impacting our results, the fundamentals of our business remains strong and consumer demand for our products particularly our imported beer portfolio remains robust providing us with strong momentum as we head into the second half of our fiscal year. You may proceed with your question. You may proceed with your question. For instance, your new guidance implies around 4% to 4.5% beer shipment volume growth, 3% off income growth, and then beer margins of 39% for the second half, and that compares to your beer margins of 40% in the first half, which did include the $80 million obsolescence charge that you pulled out. You may proceed with your question. You may proceed with your question. You may proceed with your question. You may proceed with your question. You may proceed with your question. You may proceed with your question. You may proceed with your question. You may proceed with your question. You may proceed with your question."
