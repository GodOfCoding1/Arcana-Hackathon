    "content": " International markets accounted for 9% of the total net sales in the Wine & Spirits business in the third quarter as our strategically focused approach continued to target select metropolitan markets, including London, Tokyo, Seoul, Sydney, Mexico City, Zurich and Toronto with some of our most renowned premium and fine wine brands like The Prisoner, the Schrader as well as more recently acquired brands like Lingua Franca and My Favorite Neighbor. The incremental upside from our broader existing portfolio and the continued development of our innovation lineup particularly from exciting imminent additions like Modelo Oro and we continue to expect our Wine & Spirits business to make progress on its operating margins supported by continuing to pursue the exciting runway for growth of our higher-end brands and ensuring these brands represent an even greater portion of our mix over time, enhancing the performance of our mainstream portfolio through a greater focus on brands and initiatives with higher returns, including through relevant and innovative products and growing our omni-channel and international leadership particularly as an incremental opportunity for higher-end growth. From a depletions perspective, while the Wine & Spirits business saw a decline of approximately 6% on an organic basis in Q3 as Bill noted earlier, our higher-end brand delivered strong performance with our Aspira portfolio, which includes our fine wine and craft spirits brands, delivering depletion growth of 9%, driven by growth in our Prisoner Wine and High West brands."
