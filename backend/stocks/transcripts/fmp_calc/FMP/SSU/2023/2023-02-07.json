    "content": " Net AOV was broadly stable due to the effects of M&A and the mix effect of the lower fallback contribution in fiscal year 2022, whilst all KPIs declined on a pro forma basis year-over-year active customers, net orders and conversion, grew strongly relative to pre-COVID levels, indicating market growth even against the challenging backdrop. Levels, and obviously managing as much cost out of the business as possible, and we will start to see in a significant benefit in part due to the transaction synergies between Wiggle and our existing bike business in the second half of the year, but really that will really ramp up in fiscal year 2024. And then in terms of our approach towards our overhead, we're being very, very focused in trying to reduce an aggregate cost, and it will probably tread water this year due to the lower sales level and the deleveraging effect, but we anticipate that once the level of demand in a position to pass more of the inflation of cost base to consumers, and we expect that, that will start to pick up materially fiscal year 2024."
