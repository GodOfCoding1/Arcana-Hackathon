    "content": " I would like to remind you that we will make forward-looking statements during this call regarding future events and financial performance, including guidance for the pro forma consolidated full-year 2022, inclusive of the recently closed acquisitions of WiggleCRC Midwest Sports and Tennis Express. As I touched on earlier, the biggest factors affecting our fiscal year 2022 results remain the macro economic environment and inflationary pressures, as well as the supply chain bottlenecks that have already adversely impacted our Q1 results. On the operating level, we took a meaningful step forward when looking at our core KPIs, pro forma for our recently closed transactions as of Q1 fiscal year 2022 on a pro forma basis versus reported Q1 fiscal year 2021, active customers grew 7.4 million, representing an increase of 76% year-over-year, 25% of which was achieved organically within legacy SSU."
