    "content": " Before we turn towards this quarter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s financial performance, I would like to reiterate that despite the temporary shifts in supply and demand patterns and a certain degree of uncertainty around the timing of the following market improvement, we are confident that our current disciplined approach to growth and investments combined with our strategy, meaningful scale and unique position among competitors, are powerful driving forces behind the company's long term profitable growth trajectory. On the operating level, which is a meaningful step forward, thanks to our recently closed transactions, as of Q3, 2022 and under reported basis year-over-year, active customers grew 42% to 7 million visits grew 16% to 84 million and net orders grew 29% to 2.6 million."
