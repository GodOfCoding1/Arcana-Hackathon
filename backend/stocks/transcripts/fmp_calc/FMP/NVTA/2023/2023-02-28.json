    "content": " Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that various remarks that we make on this call that are not historical including those about our vision and business model, the company's strategic business realignment, future financial and operating results; expectations of future growth and reduction in burn rates, expectations regarding the exchange and equitization of existing notes and extension of debt maturity and future products, services and our product pipeline and the timing. In the fourth quarter of 2022, we generated approximately $122 million of revenue and the breakdown was as follows, $76 million from oncology, including hereditary cancer, therapy selection and PCM services offered to pharmaceutical partners, $20 million from our women's health business, including NIPS and carrier testing services, $16 million from rare DX, pharmacogenomics and other testing products, data and patient network revenue was about $11 million. Looking at our cash burn, we now expect full year 2023 to be between $250 million and $275 million, a more than 45% improvement from the $510 million in 2022, driven by our top line growth, improved gross margins, reduced OpEx as well as working capital improvement. Yes, this is Ken. Yes, this is Ken. As it relates to the \u00e2\u0080\u0093 our market presence in oncology, I would describe it as we're going to have \u00e2\u0080\u0093 we believe we're going to have a great product that's going to be technically superior to most and that we will get a representative value in return in terms of revenue for that product and as we built our business case together, it's built \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and consistent with our plan to drive down prices in the marketplace, but it's also built on the foundation of profitable growth."
