Approximately $79 million from oncology, including germline testing, therapy selection and PCM services offered to the pharmaceutical partners representing a 12% growth over the prior year. Approximately, $25 million from our women\u00e2\u0080\u0099s health offerings, including NIPS, Carrier and other reproductive tests, a 19% growth over the prior year, approximately $17 million from a RareDx and other testing products 17% growth over prior year. Our actions, including reduction in headcount, lab and office space, third-party services, as well as exiting certain businesses and geographies resulted in operating expenses reduction of nearly $50 million from the prior quarter. Adjusting for one-time items, including approximately $29 million related to the realignment program and $14 million related to compensation items for past M&A transactions, the cash burn for our ongoing business will be $108 million in Q3, a meaningful reduction from the run-rate at the beginning of 2022."
