    "content": " Our financial results also benefited from ongoing customer growth driven by population migration into our service territories, and our strong generation fleet availability during the quarter supported profitable off-system energy sales that benefited customers and shareholders. Our only currently active rate review is for Arkansas Gas, which we filed last December, we're requesting recovery for more than $220 million of investments and approval for an enhanced safety-focused rider. From a 2005 baseline, we've already achieved a 30% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions intensity at our electric utilities and a 33% reduction in our natural gas utilities, and we're well on track to achieve a cleaner energy profile for the future. We're confident in our customer-focused strategy and the strategic diversity of our electric and gas utilities across our stable and constructive jurisdictions, and we're excited about our growth opportunities, many of which we've already discussed today. I'll also note that we reported $0.04 of EPS in Q1 2022 from mark-to-market accounting on energy contracts, while last year's first quarter had $0.02 of negative EPS related to mark-to-market items."
