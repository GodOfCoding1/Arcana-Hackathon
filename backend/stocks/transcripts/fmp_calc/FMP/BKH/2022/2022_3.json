    "content": " We increased our capital forecast by $250 million to a total of $3.5 billion for 2022 to 2026, and we increased our dividend by 5%, which completes 52 consecutive years of annual increases, On the operation side, I'm once again extremely pleased with what our team has accomplished throughout this year. We're requesting new rates in first quarter of 2023 to recover the $250 million in investments we've made in the Cheyenne region since our last rate review, eight years ago. Also, we've issued $20 million of equity year-to-date through our ATM program and our guidance for 2022 and 2023 assumes a total of $210 million to $250 million additional equity issuance by year-end 2023. Our base plan off of 2022 gets us into the range, perhaps low -- to the lower end of the range, but as we look at our growth initiatives, our hyperscale data centers as examples, the in migration of customer growth, our efforts around cost control, our focus on regulatory relationships, et cetera, I think you're -- you're spot on by indicating that we'll be toward that higher end of that growth rate in those outer years."
