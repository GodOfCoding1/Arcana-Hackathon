You can find our earnings release and materials for our call this morning at our website at www.blackhillscorp.com, under the Investor Relations heading. Leading our quarterly earnings discussion today are Linn Evans, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Rich Kinzley, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. During our earnings discussion today, some of the comments we make may contain forward-looking statements as defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission, and there are a number of uncertainties inherent in such comments. We direct you to our earnings release, Slide two of the investor presentation on our website, and our most recent Form 10-K and Form 10-Q filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission for a list of some of the factors that could cause future results to differ materially from our expectations. During the second quarter, we delivered solid financial results and advanced our strategic initiatives. I especially note our progress with our regulatory initiatives and our electric resource planning and we reaffirmed our 2022 earnings guidance, yesterday. Once again for the 9th consecutive summer, our Wyoming Electric system marked a new all-time demand peak and our South Dakota Electric system also surpassed its all-time peak from last summer, reflecting the ongoing customer growth in our service territories. Our vertically integrated model with nearly 1,500 megawatts of own generation, allows us to serve our customers safely, reliably and cost effectively during these volatile energy markets. We anticipate our customer will begin taking delivery of up to 45 megawatts of energy by year-end, with an option to expand service up to 75 megawatts. The energy for this customer will be sourced through the energy markets and delivered through our reliable infrastructure, which will benefit our other Cheyenne utility customers. On Slides five and six, we've outlined our progress with our regulatory initiatives. I'm pleased that our Arkansas Gas rate review continues to advance on schedule, with a hearing before the Arkansas Commission later this month. Our request seeks to implement new rates in the fourth quarter and implement an enhanced system, safety integrity and reliability rider. On June 1st, we filed a rate review for Wyoming Electric. Thus far, we've recovered more than one quarter of the incremental costs we incurred to serve customers during storm Uri. In June, we received final approval for our recovery plan in Arkansas and we're waiting for a final decision in Wyoming, where we started collecting interim rates last September. Looking forward, we're also preparing to file a rate review later this year for Rocky Mountain Natural Gas, our intrastate natural gas pipeline in Colorado. The last two items to cover on Slide five are related to our long-term transmission and electric resource planning for Colorado, South Dakota and Wyoming. Our theme for 2022 is powering a better duture, a recognition to the ongoing clean energy transition. We're optimistic about our generation and transmission opportunities as part of this transition and our plan to expand our energy delivery systems to meet growing customer demand, while maintaining resiliency and reliability and developing a smarter grid. In total, we plan to add 600 megawatts of renewable resources and battery storage and 260 miles of electric transmission as part of our Ready Wyoming initiative. We expect to initiate the competitive bidding processes by mid-2023 for these new resources, and Colorado legislation provides up to 50% utility ownership of these additions. As the Slide indicates, our proposed plan includes the addition of 100 megawatts of renewable resources and potentially 20 megawatts of battery storage. To-date, we've already reduced our emissions intensity by more than one-third since 2005. Later this month, we will publish our updated sustainability report, which will provide detail on this and many other key ESG factors. We'll also provide key updates for other ESG disclosures, including SASB, the AGA EEI templates and the natural gas sustainability initiative. We're excited about our progress for both our electric and gas businesses and delivering a cleaner, more efficient energy future for our customers and our communities. We're focused on growing long-term value for customers and shareholders through our customer-focused capital investment program, developing incremental capital projects such as those that could result from our electric resource planning and executing on other opportunities to grow our earnings stream. We are also improving our effectiveness and efficiency as a team, as I've described previously on our Energy Forward initiative. I'll start on Slide 13, which shows our second quarter EPS and segment operating income for 2022, compared to 2021. EPS was $0.52, compared to $0.40 in Q1 2021, and year-to-date we delivered $2.33, compared to $1.93 in the first half of 2021, that's an increase of 21%. Slide 14, illustrates the detailed drivers of change in net income year-over-year for the second quarter. For the second quarter in 2021 and 2022, weather provided $0.01 per share benefit versus normal. Year-to-date through June this year, weather benefited earnings by $0.07, compared to normal versus $0.08 of weather benefit in the first half of 2021. We recognized a negative mark-to-market adjustment of $0.03 of EPS in Q2 2022, on energy contracts, which was comparable to the Q2 2021, negative impact of $0.02. Please see Page 31 in the appendix for detail on the quarterly impacts of weather, mark-to-market adjustments and winter storm Uri. For the quarter, O&M was higher mainly due to inflationary impacts, driven by higher outside services, cloud computing costs and vehicle fuel costs. Our debt to total capitalization ratio improved to 60.7%, down from 62% at year-end, thanks to strong cash flows and recovery of storm Uri cost in the first half of 2022. We expect to achieve our target capital structure of mid-50s by late 2023 or early 2024, as our business generates strong cash flows and we recover storm costs, repay debt and execute on our at-the-market equity offering program. Our 2021 dividend represented 51 consecutive years of dividend increases, one of the longest track records in our industry and a record we're quite proud of. Looking forward, we anticipate increasing our dividend by more than 5% annually through 2026, as we maintain our 50% to 60% payout target. To-date, we've been able to largely mitigate the impact of rising interest rates, inflation and supply chain constraints on our financial results. We remain confident in our long-term growth plan, while recognizing that these factors pose a challenge for the second half of this year and 2023. Regarding expectations for our capital plan, we've noted previously that certain investments due mainly to inflation were deferred to maintain our 2022 and 2023 capital investment in the neighborhood of $600 million to enhance our liquidity and balance sheet. As a reminder, we expect to refresh our five-year base capital plan and initiate next year's guidance when we release our third quarter earnings report in early November. So, between Linn and my comments, I think we've covered the information shown on this Slide. Your line is now open. How should we think about that, you call it a one-time winter storm Uri carrying cost true-up. We did contemplate some carrying cost, but this was a true-up based on some outcomes in the different states during the second quarter. This quarter had, well -- our cash tax rate is going to run in that 10% to 12% if you're asking for post 2022. So, I think it's been a little bit lower in the past few years. And as our pre-tax income continues to increase the PTC, unless we add some more renewable projects or some other things, the effective tax rate should increase a bit as we move forward. This is Linn, I'd just add real briefly, just real proud -- how proud we are of the team and the regulatory team and how well they've done with the storm Uri recovery, just outstanding success there and really demonstrating our relationships with our commission. Your line is now open. Linn, feel free to come in on top of me, but what I would say is, we're not guiding towards either end of the range. We got six months to go and weather various other things can impact this, Andrew. So, we're sticking with our range. Got lots of opportunities through the year both pro and con, we'll see how the weather impacts us. We think that's what's best for the customer, rate based assets, where they get the advantage of the depreciation, Andrew. And in my 20-plus years within this business and with this company, I've seen very few PPAs that really worked out well for the customer in the long-term. So we believe, taking the customers' prospective, ownership is the best thing. Now, of course, we'll see how that works with the regulatory environment and the regulatory process -- excuse me, please for Wyoming and South Dakota, very likely to put out RFPs and we will bid into those as aggressively as we can. And as you just mentioned, Andrew, in your question, in Colorado, the legislation in the case we can have up to 50% or own up to 50% of that generation on behalf of our customers, which we think is very positive. If we look at the Inflation Reduction Act, we've had a few days of that now in terms of our review, so we're still learning that leaning on our trade associations and our own team to review that, but that tax credit transfer ability strikes versus being something that could be if the bill passes quite positive, allow us to have a much more competitive position, as we bid into those RFPs going forward. We were always looking at lots of different opportunities, whether they'd be bill transfers, tax equity partnership, so those kinds of things. So we're always being creative in how we look at them and we have a team that's very focused on that, owning as much as we think we can, again primarily because we think that's the right thing to do for customers in the long-term. Well, they are interruptible customers for a couple of different reasons. One, we want to make sure that our current customers are protected in terms of those peak days, et cetera. The arrangements that we have entered into with the blockchain miner is that we go out to the market, obtain that energy for them and then they pay us a fee, if you will, and we have the opportunity on an hour-by-hour day-by-day basis to determine whether they want to take the energy or not. They put the capital upfront, build the necessary infrastructure for us to serve them, they are credit-worthy customers and we're excited to serve them and provides -- this is great upside for the organization through the arrangements that we've put in place with them. The one other thing maybe to add to that is, it also benefits our customers in Wyoming. Your line is now open. Hey, just to clarify the Colorado legislation that allows the utility to own up to 50%. We believe likely yes, we'll probably have to put some kind of bid forward with the understanding that the legislation in the case of the price needs to be comparable to the bids that we will receive. We're excited to be able to have that opportunity, but we'll see how the regulatory environment and the construct evolves over time. Well, our guidance indicates $100 million to $120 million this year. We haven't put specific numbers out for next year, but you probably should think about the same zip code. And then as to your Uri comment, we've been -- that's going along very well. And then you mentioned additional drivers that are helpful, so that will help us shape what our formal 2023 needs are when we come out with third quarter earnings and give our guidance for next year. Your line is now open. In fact, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re continuing to experience strongly in migration both on -- on all three that you mentioned, Northwest Arkansas, Front Range of Colorado and then now the Black Hills has been added to that list over the last couple of years. We're seeing really strong recovery in our commercial and industrial loads, back to more than pre-pandemic levels. Residential, you'll see in our 10-Q, has dropped off just a little bit, but I think that's because people are going back to work, which is good for our local economies. So the answer your question is, very strong growth continuing in our regions, and again, you'll see that in our 10-Q that we put out today. Once again, I thank our team for the great quarter and we're hard at work in this quarter to deliver results on behalf of you our shareholders and deliver great service to our customers.So thank you for joining us."
