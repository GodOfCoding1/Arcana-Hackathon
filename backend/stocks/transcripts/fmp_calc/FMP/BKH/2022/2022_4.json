    "content": " When we issued 2022 earnings guidance two years ago, it was before Winter Storm Uri, inflation was less than 2% and before 425 basis points of interest rate hikes in elevated natural gas prices. Higher margin was driven by $32 million from new rates and investment riders, $3.8 million of increased margin from customer growth and higher usage per customer, especially at our electric utilities, and $5.9 million of wholesale energy sales. During the last three years, we've managed through some extraordinary times, including COVID, Winter Storm Uri and more recently decades high inflation, aggressive monetary policy and geopolitical turmoil, resulting in higher interest rates and volatile energy markets. Andrew, this is Linn again. Andrew, this is Linn again."
