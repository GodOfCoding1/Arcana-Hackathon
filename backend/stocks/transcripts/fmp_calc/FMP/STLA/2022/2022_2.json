    "content": " And as you can see, Jeep is the number 1 selling SUV brand in Brazil, and Fiat is the number 1 selling brand all over the region, so a very strong performance with no less overall than the 23.5% market share in the region. And you can see the volume and market mix was negative for EUR2 billion as a result of the 7% reduction in shipments more than offset by EUR8.8 billion of positive impact from net price and content and vehicle line mix for a total amount of about 12% of revenues, which drove the growth for the half. You can see in large Europe, here, we hit double-digit margins for the half at 10.4%, up 15% despite our shipments being down 18% due to unfilled semiconductor orders, impacting more the European region, and so we were down 300,000 units from last year. We had positive synergies again in SG&A, and overall, a strong performance in terms of shipments, in terms of sales helped us to offset last year's reducing -- reduction in inventory and get us to 10.4% margins for the half. Revenues were up 14%, which was a result of strong pricing on Jeep and mix from higher around 1,500 sales, particularly in India and Asia Pacific, and that allowed us to increase the adjusted operating margin by 40%, with margins reaching 13.4% for the half. And it was driven largely by the very strong operating performance where you can see the -- the EBITDA number was at 17.6% margins, and that was up over 2 points compared to last year."
