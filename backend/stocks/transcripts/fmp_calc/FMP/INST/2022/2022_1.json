    "content": " First quarter GAAP revenue was $113.5 million, up 21% year-over-year, while allocated combined receipts, or ACR, was $114 million, up 15% year-over-year. First quarter adjusted EBITDA grew 34% year-over-year to $43.6 million, a 38% margin as we further demonstrated operating leverage on both the gross margin and adjusted EBITDA lines. As Steve mentioned, we generated first quarter 2022, total GAAP revenue of $113.5 million up 21% year-over-year and ACR of $114 million, up 15% year-over-year. Subscription and support ACR accounted for 91% of our first quarter revenue at $104 million, up 14% year-over-year or 20% normalizing for the Bridge divestiture, primarily as a result of the continued momentum within our core Canvas LMS product both domestically and internationally, in addition to strong upsell and cross sell of our other products, especially assessments. First quarter adjusted EBITDA was $43.6 million representing a 38.3% adjusted EBITDA margin, up from 33% in the first quarter of 2021. Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow statement, we ended the first quarter with $105.3 million in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash, and $493.5 million of long-term debt net of discount resulting in a 2.46 times net debt to trailing 12 months adjusted EBITDA ratio. We expect second quarter adjusted EBITDA in the range of $37 million to $38 million, representing an adjusted EBITDA margin of 33.8% at the midpoint of the range. Your line is open.
