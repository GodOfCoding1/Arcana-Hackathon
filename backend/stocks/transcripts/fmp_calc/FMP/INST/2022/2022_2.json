    "content": " Second quarter adjusted EBITDA grew 28% year-over-year to $39.8 million a 35% margin, as we demonstrated further operating leverage on both gross margin and adjusted EBITDA lines. Subscription and support ACR accounted for 90% of our second quarter revenue at $103.2 million, up 19% year-over-year, primarily as a result of the continued momentum within our core Canvas LMS product, both domestically and internationally, in addition to strong upsell and cross-sell of our other products, especially assessments. Professional services and other ACR accounted for 10% of our second quarter revenue at $11.7 million, up 24% year-over-year, driven by strong implementation and training services delivery in our High-Ed business. Your line is open. Your line is open. You know our \u00e2\u0080\u0093 the institutions that we serve are responding with moves into online, non-traditional, right, so while enrollments may be going down it doesn't necessarily translate to those students that still want to get a credential or they want to get some sort of training, maybe it's not a degree and so we're \u00e2\u0080\u0093 by being in that online non-traditional with our catalog product, with our acquisition of Concentric Sky, we're a little bit, we're hedged against the enrollment declines for traditional four year degree seeking students. Your line is open. And then just to go back, you know bringing up that, I think since the IPO Instructure has exceeded revenue forecast by 3% or 4% on average each quarter, where has some of the best upside been seen just over that stretch of time, and as you look forward, like you mentioned how much of the K-12 stimulus is still left remaining. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open."
