    "content": " Thanks to our focused investment approach, fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA grew 16.7% year-over-year to $48.6 million, a 39% margin. Our new logo win rates increased in the second half of 2022 from an already very healthy rate as higher education in K-12 institutions in the U.S. and across our major international markets, continue to choose Instructure's solutions because they solve real meaningful challenges across the teaching and learning landscape. In higher education, we hold a 40% market segment share and continued to see high competitive win rates during the fourth quarter as we help institutions face a challenging enrollment with students exploring non-traditional learning options. As Steve mentioned, we generated fourth quarter 2022 total GAAP revenue and ACR of $124.7 million, up 12.8% and 11.9% year-over-year, respectively. Subscription and support ACR accounted for 92% of our fourth quarter revenue at $114.6 million, up 12.5% year-over-year, primarily as a result of the continued momentum within our core Canvas LMS products, both domestically and internationally, in addition to the strong up-sell and cross-sell of our other products."
