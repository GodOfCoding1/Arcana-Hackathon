    "content": " Specifically, we have amended the contract to continue with Southern California as we have mutually downsized the contracts by 65% or about $100 million per year to reduce the risk for both of us. Gross profit in 2022 increased 6% to $143.6 million for the year, with gross margin decreasing to 33.5% from 38.4% in 2021, primarily due to the greater mix of construction management business, along with lower software licensing revenue and the ramp-up costs under the California IOU programs."
