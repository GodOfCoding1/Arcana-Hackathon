    "year": 2022,
    "date": "2022-05-07 10:29:02",
    "content": " Gross revenue for the first quarter increased by 16.1% to $91.8 million, while net revenue net of subcontractors, materials and other direct costs increased 4.6% to $50.2 million for the first quarter. Gross profit of $31.4 million for Q1 of 2022 was down slightly from $32.1 million a year ago, primarily due to the lower software revenues and California IOU start-up costs in the current year. Interest expense was $313,000 lower than a year ago due to lower average borrowing levels during the quarter, resulting in a loss before income taxes of $6.2 million in Q1 of 2022 compared to a loss of $5.2 million in Q1 of 2021. Adjusted EBITDA was $2.3 million or 4.7% of net revenue compared to $4.7 million or 9.7% of net revenue a year ago, reflecting the change in the mix of revenues and the start-up costs for the new California IOU programs. In Q4, we will need to resume hiring again for \u2013 to continue the ramp up into 2023 for the California programs as well as some early work that we\u2019re being very successful at in construction management and performance engineering going into 2023, but it should be good for the next six months."
