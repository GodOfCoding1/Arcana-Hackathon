    "content": " Gross revenue for the second quarter increased by 22% over the prior year to $102.6 million, while net revenue, net of subcontractors, materials and other direct costs, increased 11.9% to $52.9 million for the quarter. The lower gross profit margin was primarily due to the higher mix of construction management revenues, lower software revenues and higher ramp-up costs for new programs in the current year quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was $1.2 million for the quarter compared to $3.3 million a year ago, reflecting the change in the mix of revenues combined with higher costs versus revenue recognized related to the new California IOU programs. A lot of this year, the revenue you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll start seeing \u00e2\u0080\u0093 for the first time, actually, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll start seeing that revenue come in the third quarter of this year because, as Tom mentioned in his script, for the first time now at 18 months, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re building projects out and completing them."
