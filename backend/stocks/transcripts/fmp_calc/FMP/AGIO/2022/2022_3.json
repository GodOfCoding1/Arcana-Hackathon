    "content": " Within R&D, the clinical and medical teams have been busy securing a positive CHMP opinion for PYRUKYND in the EU, initiating the AG-946 MDS Phase 2a trial publishing data from our thalassemia and PK deficiency clinical programs in top-tier medical journals, securing an expensive set of data for presentation at ASH in December and making progress on enrollment for our thalassemia and sickle cell disease trials, which Sarah will cover in more detail. As I look to the last few weeks of the year, our priorities, as shown on Slide 6, are very clear: continue to drive enrollment across our thalassemia and sickle cell disease pivotal trials, secure approval of PYRUKYND for PK deficiency in the EU and Great Britain and drive towards continued commercial success for our U.S. launch. As I laid out at the beginning, these learnings, our knowledge base and the connections we are making are setting us up for success as we continue to expand the applicability of PYRUKYND to all eligible patients with PK deficiency as well as longer-term for other genetically defined diseases.
