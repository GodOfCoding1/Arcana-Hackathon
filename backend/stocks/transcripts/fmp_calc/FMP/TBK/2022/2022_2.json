    "content": " When you add the $15 billion that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s in the pipeline, plus what other things we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re working on, the day is going to be here before the end of 2024, when we make far more than 20% of all payments to the factory industry and we can deliver almost that same amount in conforming transactions, at which point, if you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t join the network for conforming transactions. I know you got us on there, if you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t deploy some of that would be kind of what it means for earnings, but just wanted you to talk about your ability to kind of replace those lost assets looks like you were sitting on more than $700 million in cash at the end of the quarter. So that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u0093 that would be where I would see the constraints to show up, which would be adding additional intangibles to the balance sheet if the opportunity presented itself and then ultimately buying back our own shares because we believe in the long-term value of what we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re doing also would given where we trade still create an intangible."
