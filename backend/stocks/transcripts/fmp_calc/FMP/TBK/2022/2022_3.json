    "content": " Where we think that the biggest point of transition for the network is going to be when we can provide factoring companies and carriers at least 15% of their payment volume that they receive and process as conforming transactions, that's really going to be where it moves the needle and allows them to be able to make meaningful changes to their day to day processes and allow them to innovate and create more efficient ways to do business. And just to echo what she said, if you think about it from the perspective of a factoring company who's going to bear the primary cost of that network transaction, we believe, and we can model it internally, that once Triumph Business Capital or any factoring company gets roughly 15% of all of their payment volume coming through as conforming, they can start to reorganize their staffing and enterprise resources models to accept those transactions in an entirely different way and a very profitable way for them."
