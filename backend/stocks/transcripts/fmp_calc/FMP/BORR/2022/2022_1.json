    "content": " We expect revenues, adjusted EBITDA and cash from operations to show solid increases in the next quarters both as a result of these rigs commencing work, in addition to the rollover of contracts at higher day rates. Now based on the development of the day rates we have seen thus far in the year, and our forecast of having our remaining 3 delivered rigs employed by the end of this year, our preliminary outlook for 2023 indicates an approximate doubling of headline revenues year-on-year and adjusted EBITDA to more than double from the 2022 forecast. This was split in $63.3 million of day rate revenues for our rigs on regular contracts and $18.7 million of related partner revenue, which is variable to earnings from a very good quarter with high economic utilization in our Mexico joint ventures. Year-to-date in 2022, the company has been awarded 10 new contracts, extensions, exercise options and LOAs, representing approximately 4,200 days and $487 million of potential revenue, which includes mobilization revenues but excluding options. Recent awards in the market is in the area of $100,000 per day, and it shows a potential cash flow EBITDA generation of around $300 million per year with the 20 rigs that we now have working."
