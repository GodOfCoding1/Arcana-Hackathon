    "content": " The Net income improved to $1.4 million from a net loss just under $0.5 million, in the prior year second quarter. Revenue increased in the quarter, coming in at $105.7 million compared to $101.5 million in last year's second quarter. CFR for the quarter increased 12.9% and to $87.7 million from $77.7 million in the second quarter of 2021, reflecting an increase in project activity to pre-COVID levels. Gross profit improved to $37.4 million and $31.3 million in last year's second quarter, driven by the higher CFR and improved contract margins. SG&A expenses rose 19% to $32.3 million, which is 86.4% of total gross profit from $27.1 million or 86.6% of total gross profit in last year's second quarter. SG&A expenses in last year's second quarter had been reduced by $474,000 from bad debt recoveries on a fully reserved Libyan-based project. As previously discussed, we've reduced the run rate of G&A expenses by approximately $4 million annually from the run rate, the initial impact of which began being realized this quarter. Operating income in the second quarter improved $4.5 million from $2.9 million in last year's second quarter, driven by higher CFR and improved gross profit, partially offset by an increase in foreign exchange currency losses and higher SG&A to support our growth initiatives. On an adjusted basis, adjusted operating profit nearly doubled to $6.3 million from $3.3 million in last year's second quarter. Net income for the quarter improved to $1.4 million or $0.02 per share compared to a net loss of approximately $500,000 or negative $0.01 per share in the year ago period. Adjusted net income improved to $3.2 million from an adjusted net loss of $74,000 in last year's second quarter. Net cash used in operating activities was $400,000, which is a significant improvement from the $3.3 million use of cash in the first quarter of this year."
