    "content": " We remain a market leader in this business and as of June 30th, we are the fifth largest 7(a) lender in the U.S. Moving over to the liability side, total deposits stood at $5.4 billion as of quarter end, down 2.6% on a linked quarter basis, but up 5.8% year-over-year. Revenue for the quarter came in at $75.8 million and was driven by robust net interest income, up 5% from the prior quarter and 6% year-over-year. Charge-off increased from the very low levels experienced last quarter to 24 basis points this quarter and our allowance increase to $62.4 million, largely driven by portfolio growth. Our total loans and leases were $5.2 billion at June 30th, an increase of $357 million or 30% annualized from the end of the prior quarter. We estimate that an instant 100 basis point increase in interest rates will result in additional 7.8% increase in net interest income, which to reiterate guidance provided last quarter, every 25 basis point increase would result in approximately $4 million to $5 million of additional net interest income on an annualized basis. Non-interest income decreased from the prior quarter, primarily due to a negative $4.6 million loan servicing asset revaluation expense, due to higher discount driven by lower premiums on government guaranteed loan sales. Our non-performing assets increased 21 basis points to 54 basis points of total assets in the prior quarter, and net charge offs were $2.9 million in the second quarter. Nathan, your line is now open, please go ahead. Nathan, your line is now open, please go ahead."
