    "content": " Leading into Jeff Lucas' portion of the presentation, I want to emphasize, despite the decline in the price of Bitcoin, we came through the first quarter of 2022 with profitable results with reported net income of 5 million and a healthy balance sheet. During the first quarter of 2022, we've generated quarterly revenues of $40 million, up 42% from the prior year period reflecting largely the year-over-year increase in our hash rate in excess of the increase in network difficulty, even with a decrease in the average Bitcoin price. Turning to a detailed review of our bottom line, our net income of $4.5 million in the first quarter are $0.02 per fully diluted share includes a loss of $3.7 million for the revaluation of our Bitcoin holdings at March 31st, 2022, as a result of the lower Bitcoin price at quarter end. Our order placed in early 2021 for 48,000 miners, which we are taking delivery on an equal monthly basis through 2022, is at a contracted low cost of $38.50 per terahash, well below current spot prices and a fraction of the cost several of our peers committed to in the fall of last year. We continued our strong growth in the first quarter and with a current cash rate of 3.4 exahash per second, Bitfarms now represent about 1.5% of the Bitcoin network."
