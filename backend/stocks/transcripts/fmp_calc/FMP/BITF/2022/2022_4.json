    "content": " We have 188 megawatts in operating capacity, 95% of which is powered by sustainable hydroelectricity, and an additional 40 megawatts of built capacity, in Argentina, is awaiting impending approvals which will allow for substantially and timely expansion, with electricity costs that we fully expect will bring down our overall corporate Bitcoin production costs. Importantly, we continue to generate cash from our operations during the quarter, and achieved adjusted EBITDA of positive $1.1 million even with low average Bitcoin prices, the industry experienced in the fourth quarter 2022. With our existing infrastructure and $22.4 million in available credits for mining purchases, we expect to substantially cover our CapEx requirements to achieve 6 exahash per second by the end of 2023 from our current portfolio of farms. As of February with $22.4 million in available equipment credits and just $23 million in total indebtedness, we have ample flexibility to grow in 2023 organically with little capital outlay we expect to reach 6 exahash per second by year-end from our existing portfolio."
