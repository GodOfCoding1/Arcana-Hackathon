    "content": " Building on our momentum and production, we mined 500 Bitcoin in July, the strong Q2 2022 Production completely offset weaker Bitcoin prices, such that we also grew revenue sequentially to $42 million and still generated cash from mining operations as defined by adjusted EBITDA of $19 million As evidenced by the results of our publicly traded Bitcoin mining peers, these are not just solid but superior operating results. Bitfarms average direct costs of production per Bitcoin in second quarter 2022 was $9,900 among the lowest reported in the industry, this is a 14% increase in production costs from the $8,700 in the first quarter of 2022. And as a matter of fact, at current production levels and BTC prices, our production exceeds our ongoing operating expenses, even a debt service of principal and interest, so we feel very effectively at this point in time that using the Bitcoin that we're producing is one of the lowest means of cost of capital for us to certainly fund our operating and our debt service requirement."
