As a reminder, Camden\u00e2\u0080\u0099s complete second quarter 2022 earnings release is available in the Investors section of our website at camdenliving.com and it includes reconciliations to non-GAAP financial measures, which will be discussed on this call. If we are unable to speak with everyone in the queue today, we would be happy to respond to additional questions by phone or email after the call concludes. A lot has changed in the world since May, which serves as a good reminder that real estate and financial markets will rise and fall, but companies with a great culture will thrive in all conditions."
