    "content": " We are seeing increasing investments by automakers and suppliers in e-mobility worldwide and continue to see strong growth in demand for our high power pulsed lasers, adjustable mode beam lasers and real-time welding monitoring capabilities that together can provide a highly customized and engineered solution to address many challenges in this complex manufacturing process. Revenue in the first quarter was $370 million, up 7% year over year driven by growth in most of our key product lines and geographies, and increased 2% sequentially mainly due to higher revenue in China. First quarter GAAP gross margin was 46.4%, a decrease of 110 basis points year over year, due to increased shipping charges, higher cost of product sold and higher inventory reserves, partially offset by reduced manufacturing expenses as a percent of sales. Pulsed lasers sales increased 21% year-over-year, with continued growth in high power pulsed lasers used in EV battery manufacturing and increased demand in cleaning applications.
