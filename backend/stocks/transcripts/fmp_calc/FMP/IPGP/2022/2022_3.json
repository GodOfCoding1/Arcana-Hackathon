    "content": " Revenue in the third quarter was $349 million, a decline of 8% year-over-year, primarily due to foreign currency headwinds, which accounted for approximately 7% of the decline. Revenue in North America increased 1%, driven by growth in cutting, welding and medical applications was offset by lower sales in non-laser systems as well as the telecom divestiture. Revenue in China decreased 14% year-over-year as growth in welding for EV battery applications and 3D printing applications was offset by COVID-related lockdowns, continued softness in the cutting market and currency headwinds. So -- and then marking engraving, which would be consumer electronics related, was also weaker compared to Q3 last year, actually, marking engraving in I think the second and third quarters last year was actually very strong, even though we compete with local suppliers in China for consumer electronics because of the reliability of our lasers. Quantitatively, Jim, I mean, we're approaching a $10 million a quarter run rate and in revenues growing at sort of 80% year-over-year and sequentially very robustly as well."
