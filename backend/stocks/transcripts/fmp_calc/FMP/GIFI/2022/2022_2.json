    "content": " Our second quarter services revenue more than doubled and EBITDA was up 90% compared to the same period in 2021, driven by continued solid results from the recently acquired DSS business and organic growth in our legacy Services business. Before turning things over to Wes, I want to provide a quick update on the progress we made during the quarter on our strategic transformation strategy, which is now focused on generating stable, profitable growth by pursuing new growth end markets, growing and diversifying our services business, further strengthening our project execution and expanding our skilled labor workforce. In closing, I'm very pleased with our second quarter financial performance, which was highlighted by the strong growth of our expanded services business and the continued progress we achieved on our strategic plan. Consolidated revenue for the second quarter of 2022 was $35.9 million, an increase of 48% from the second quarter of 2021, with the year-over-year increase attributable to our Services division."
