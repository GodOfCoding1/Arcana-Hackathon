    "content": " The improving business momentum we experienced throughout 2022 continued into year-end and as we reported strong fourth quarter results with total revenues increasing nearly 50%, owing to continued strength in our Services Division and small-scale fabrication business. While the labor market is expected to remain competitive in 2023, we still anticipate continued growth in our Services division, driven by the strength of our core Gulf Coast market, increasing cross-selling opportunities amongst our various Services business lines, new strategic partnership opportunities and growth in our new Spark Safety business line. Now moving on to our Fabrication division, where we generated 60% top line growth during the fourth quarter, driven in large part by the continued strength in our small-scale fabrication business. We generated strong growth in our small-scale fab business during 2022, with fourth quarter revenues growing 60% and continued new award momentum. Consolidated revenue for the fourth quarter of 2022 was $38.1 million, a 48% increase from the fourth quarter of 2021, with the year-over-year increase attributable to strong growth in both our Services and Fabrication divisions. Specifically for the Services division, revenue for the fourth quarter 2022 was $21.6 million, an increase of $8.1 million, or 60%, compared to the fourth quarter of 2021. For our Fabrication division, revenue for the fourth quarter of 2022 was $16.4 million, an increase of $6.2 million, or 60%, compared to the fourth quarter of 2021. Operating results for the fourth quarter of 2022 included gains of $3 million from insurance recoveries associated with damage previously caused by Hurricane Ida, while operating results for the fourth quarter of 2021 included charges of $3.1 million associated with Hurricane Ida damage and project improvements of $1.2 million. For our corporate division, general and administrative expense was $2.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2022 compared to $1.7 million for the prior year period, with the increase due to higher incentive plan costs and expenses associated with initiatives to diversify and enhance our business. With respect to our liquidity, we ended the fourth quarter with a cash and investment balance of approximately $45 million, an increase of $7 million from the end of the third quarter due to positive operating results for the quarter as well as expected working capital improvements, offset partially by capital expenditures, primarily associated with investments in our Spark Safety business line."
