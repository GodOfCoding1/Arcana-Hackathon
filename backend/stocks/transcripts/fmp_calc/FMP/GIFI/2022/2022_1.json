    "content": " Overall, the first quarter results were consistent with our expectations as strong revenue and profit growth in our newly formed Services segment and another quarter of strong project execution were offset by continued low volume levels associated with large project fabrication work. Our first quarter Services revenue more than doubled, while EBITDA more than tripled as we generated strong organic growth in our legacy Services business driven by the strength of our end markets and benefited from solid results in our first quarter of contribution from the DSS acquisition. Consolidated revenue for the first quarter 2022 was $28.7 million, an increase of 21% from the first quarter 2021 with the year-over-year increase attributable to our Services Division. Specifically for the Services Division, revenue for the first quarter of 2022 was $20.7 million, an increase of 175% compared to the first quarter 2021. With respect to our liquidity, we ended the quarter with a cash balance of $43 million, which was consistent with our expectations, reflecting the anticipated impact of the post-acquisition working capital increase for the DSS business and partial satisfaction of liabilities associated with our shipyard operations. With respect to our liquidity, we are forecasting to exit the second quarter with a cash balance of approximately $40 million, reflecting the anticipated impact of operating losses for the quarter and the partial satisfaction of the previously referenced liabilities for our shipyard operations, offset partially by anticipated insurance receipts associated with Hurricane Ida claims."
