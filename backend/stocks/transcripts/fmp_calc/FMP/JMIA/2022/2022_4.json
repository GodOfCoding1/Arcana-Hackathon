    "content": " What is visible in the Q4 '22 results is the significant decrease in fulfillment and sales and advertising expenses, which declined by 21% and 41% respectively year-on-year. GMV reached $283 million, down 14% year-on-year and flat on a constant currency basis. FX was a material headwind to GMV performance in Q4 with all local currencies depreciating against the U.S. dollar, in particular the Egyptian Pound, Nigerian Naira, and West African CFA depreciated by respectively 23%, 6% and 12% against the U.S. dollar in '22 compared to '21. So in the context of declining GMV and with the reduction of marketing centers to drive prepayment penetration, JumiaPay TPV posted the decline of 18% year-on-year in Q4 '22. Value-added services also reached record high at $9.5 million, up 11% year-on-year and up 27% in constant currency as a result of a strong increase in warehousing service revenue. Gross profit reached an all-time high of $41 million, up 22% year-on-year and 38% on a constant currency basis. Fulfillment expense reached $24 million down 21% year-on-year and 6% on a constant currency basis, partly as a result of orders declining 12% during this period. The ratio of fulfillment expense per order excluding JumiaPay App orders, which do not incur logistic costs decreased by 17% from 3.24% in Q4 '21 to 2.17% in Q4 '22. Sales and advertising expense reached $18.5 million down 41% year-on-year and 35% on a constant currency basis, as we continue to bring more discipline to our marketing investments. As a percentage of GMV, sales and advertising expense reached 6.5% in Q4 '22, almost three points improvement year-on-year. Cash utilization for the quarter was $58.2 million, which is 6% decline compared to Q3 '22 and 15% reduction compared to Q4 '21."
