    "content": "   These statements include our restructuring initiatives, including efforts to reduce our expenditures and the anticipated results and benefits of these efforts; our plans to subsequently increase marketing spend rate and the impact that is expected to have on in timing of achieving our year-over-year enrollment growth; our plan to maintain an approximately breakeven adjusted EBITDA; the continued strong demand for the MSN-FNP program; our search for candidates for potential AR facility; and the intended use of proceeds from any loan transaction that may result; anticipated future revenue from the teach-out of our pre-licensure campuses; our future growth and growth strategy; our fiscal 2023 guidance and our liquidity. In terms of our future growth plans, with the pending release of the $1.5 million from the insurance company and our expectation that we closed an AR facility during Q4 of fiscal 2023, we intend to return to a marketing spend rate in our fiscal fourth quarter that is anticipated to resume year-over-year enrollment growth by the second half of our upcoming fiscal year 2024."
