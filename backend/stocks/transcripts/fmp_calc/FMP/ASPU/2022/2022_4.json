    "content": " For the fourth quarter, we reduced our marketing spend sequentially by $1 million, primarily to ensure sufficient collateral for surety bond requested by the State of Arizona. To assure that we had sufficient collateral for the bond, we reduced our marketing spend by $1 million for a 22% sequential decrease in our marketing budget which further compressed our fourth quarter enrollments. To provide context for the fourth quarter results, I'd like to remind everyone one that we reduced our marketing spend in the fourth quarter by $1.5 million from our original plan to ensure adequate available funds to collateralize the surety bond requested by the Arizona State Board of Nursing. Total revenue for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 was $19.4 million, an increase of 2% versus $19.1 million in the year ago quarter. Gross profit and gross margin for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 were $10.3 million and 53%, respectively versus $9.9 million and 52%, respectively for the year ago quarter. If marketing spend had not been reduced by $1 million sequentially, gross margin would have been 48% and in line with the prior quarter. For fiscal year 2022, gross profit increased by 7% to $39.6 million or 52% gross margin versus $36.9 million or 54% gross margin in the prior year. If marketing spend had not been reduced by $1 million in the fourth quarter, gross margin would have been 50%. Overall, instructional costs for the quarter were $5.2 million or 27% of revenue, up from $4.6 million or 24% of revenue in the year ago quarter. Marketing and promotional costs for fiscal year 2022 were $15.8 million or 21% of total revenue, up from $14.2 million or 21% in the prior year. For fiscal year 2022, general and administrative costs were $45.5 million or 59% of revenue compared to $41.9 million or 62% of revenue during fiscal year 2021, an increase of $3.6 million or 9%. For fiscal year 2022, total net loss was $9.6 million or net loss per basic share of $0.38 versus a net loss of $10.4 million or $0.44 in the prior year period. From a unit perspective, Aspen University's net income for the quarter was $1.5 million versus $1.4 million in the prior year period. Finally, AGI incurred a net loss of $5 million for the quarter compared to a net loss of $4.7 million in the prior year quarter. For fiscal year 2022, Aspen University generated $6.1 million of net income and USC generated $3.8 million compared to net income of $7.3 million and $2.9 million respectively in the prior year period. Fourth quarter EBITDA period over period for each of the three units was as follows: Aspen University remained flat at $2.2 million; USU was $1.5 million compared to $1.1 million; AGI corporate was a loss of $4.58 million, compared to a loss of $4.7 million. Consolidated EBITDA for fiscal year 2022 was a loss of $5.1 million, as compared to a loss of $6 million in the prior year period. For the full fiscal year 2022, consolidated adjusted EBITDA was a loss of $1 million compared to $1.3 million in the prior year. Cash used in operations for the 12 months ended April 30, 2022 was $11.3 million, approximately $1 million of the cash used in operations is attributed to our adjusted EBITDA loss and the remaining use of operating cash is primarily attributed to our increased working capital to support growth in the monthly payment plans. What I would say is, as it relates to our fourth quarter, we sequentially decreased our marketing spend rate as a company by about $1 million."
