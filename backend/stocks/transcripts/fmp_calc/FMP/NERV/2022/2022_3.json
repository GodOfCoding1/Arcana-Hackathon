    "content": " For the three months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, research and development expense was $2.4 million and $4.5 million respectively, a decrease of approximately $2.1 million. For the three months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, non-cash stock compensation expense included in R&D was $0.5 million in both periods. For the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, R&D expense was $11.5 million and $13.3 million respectively, a decrease of approximately $1.8 million. For the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, non-cash stock compensation expense included in R&D was $1.5 million and $1.8 million respectively. The decrease in R&D expense for both the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2022 versus the comparable prior year periods was primarily due to lower costs for the Phase 3 clinical trial of roluperidone due to the completion of the 40-week open label extension in 2021, partially offset by higher consulting fees in support of the NDA submission in August 2022. For the three months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, general and administrative expense was $2.8 million and $3 million respectively, a decrease of approximately $0.2 million. For the three months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, non-cash stock compensation expense included in G&A was $0.5 million and $0.6 million respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, G&A expense was $8.7 million and $10.7 million respectively, a decrease of approximately $2 million. For the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, non-cash stock compensation expense included in G&A was $1.6 million and $2.2 million respectively. For the three months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, non-cash interest expense for the sale of future royalties was $1.9 million and $1.7 million respectively, an increase of approximately $0.2 million. For the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, non-cash interest expense for the sale of future royalties was $5.5 million and $4.6 million respectively, an increase of approximately $0.9 million. The increase in non-cash interest expense for both the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2022 versus the prior year period was primarily due to interest accruing with effect from January 19, 2021, the date at which the company entered into an agreement to sell our royalty interest in seltorexant to Royalty Pharma, as well as an increase in the underlying balance of the liability, which totaled $71.8 million at September 30, 2022. Net loss was $25.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022, and or net loss per share of $4.75 basic and diluted as compared to net loss of $28.6 million or net loss per share of $5.36 basic and diluted for the nine months ended September 30, 2021."
