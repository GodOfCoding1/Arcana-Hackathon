    "content": " Both studies also provided long-term exposure data regarding the safety and tolerability of roluperidone and efficacy based on blinded doses of roluperidone, specifically intended to demonstrate the maintenance of continuation of improvement in negative symptoms, the stability of positive symptoms and the low rate of relapses of positive symptoms following 24 weeks study MIN-101C03 and 40-week study MIN-101C07 open-label periods. So the first one, we continue to have the dialogue with the FDA, and we are providing them with data showing that basically, I mean, the patients we have included in ex U.S. or outside the U.S. compared to the patients we've included in the U.S. Keep in mind that for the Phase 3, we had patients from the U.S. are extremely similar in terms of baseline, in terms of the effect of our drug on the negative symptoms and of the overall disease. So what we are trying to really bring over as a message to the FDA that the reasons, I mean, I gave you before are no reason to reset high, but our topics, which, first of all, need an in-depth review, an in-depth analysis of our NDA, a dialogue with a sponsor to really go into the details of all the data we have to show that roluperidone is an effective drug for patients suffering from negative symptoms and having a diagnostic of schizophrenia."
