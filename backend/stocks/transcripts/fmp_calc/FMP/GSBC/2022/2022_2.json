    "content": " In the second quarter of '22, we had $2.2 million, I think, in provision expense that was there for almost what it was exclusively for growth in our own side of loan commitments. Average loans were flattish, decreasing about $59 million from the previous year quarter and an average investment securities increased about $281 million compared to the same quarter a year ago. Noninterest income in the second quarter this year compared to a year ago quarter decreased about $266,000 to $9.3 million. Also, the activity on our derivative interest rate products, back-to-back swaps that we have with our loan customers, we recognized $145,000 of income in the second quarter period this year versus recognizing $179,000 loss in the change in fair value on that in the second quarter last year. So for the quarter ended June 30, our non-interest expense total increased $2.8 million to $33.0 million, and that was comparing the $2.8 million increase as compared to the second quarter last year. The efficiency ratio for the second quarter this year was 56.76% compared to 55.63% for the second quarter of 2021, and this a little bit higher efficiency ratio rate primarily to the non-interest expense items that I previously mentioned here. This year second quarter, we had $2.2 million provision expense and that related entirely to the unfunded loan commitment balances that we have at that time. Hi, good afternoon, guys. So I think that we'll be looking at probably a little higher than the $580,000, probably more like $1 million, $1.5 million expense each quarter for the next whether that be four quarters or so. Hi, good afternoon, guys. So it looks like expenses -- again, with that conversion cost around $1 million a quarter, so you're going to be a little bit north of $32 million for the next year, at least."
