    "content": " The total was $43.3 million in this first quarter versus $44.1 million in the first quarter last year and then we also had net interest income of $44.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2021, so you compare those. We did also in the first quarter enter into an interest rate swap agreement and it\u2019s only a two-year agreement, so fairly short, but we receive a fixed rate of about 1.67% and we pay a floating rate of one month LIBOR. And so in the month of March, that was a net increase in interest income of $369,000 for us and we\u2019ll expect to see some increases in the second quarter as well that now is, obviously, if the one month LIBOR exceeds 1.67% then at that point, we would owe settlements and that would be a net offset to the interest income at that point. Last year around -- for this year we had $193,000 negative provision on our unfunded commitments and unfunded portion of loans relate -- and that relates to a $674,000 negative provision in the first quarter last year."
