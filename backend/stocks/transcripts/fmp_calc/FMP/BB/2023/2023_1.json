    "content": " Despite a tough macro environment for auto, we delivered revenue of $51 million, which represents 19% year-over-year growth. Our strength in securing new design wins have driven a year-over-year increase in our royalty revenue backlog, which is now at approximately $560 million, 5-6-0, a 14% increase from a year ago. We continue to expect through fiscal year \u00e2\u0080\u009823 revenue for the IoT business unit to be in the range of $200 million to $210 million, and revenue for the cybersecurity business unit to be broadly in line with the fiscal year \u00e2\u0080\u009822, with about 8% to 12% year-over-year billings growth. We expect the total company revenue, excluding the IVY, to grow with a 5-year CAGR of approximately 13% with revenue of $886 million in FY \u00e2\u0080\u009825 and $1.2 billion in FY \u00e2\u0080\u009827. One, this was a good quarter where we delivered year-over-year revenue growth in both our IoT and Cyber business unit; two, we set another quarterly record for design activities in IoT, offsetting the impact of macro headwinds on auto production; three, on the cyber side, we recorded solid double-digit billings growth and continue to make progress in expanding our market reach. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open."
