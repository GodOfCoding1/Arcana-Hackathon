    "content": " Our time charter equivalent revenues for Q1 of '22, which we define as revenues, net minus voyage-related costs and commissions were $3.8 million, a decrease of 10% from the same period in 2021, primarily due to lower charter rates, especially in the spot market where we incurred higher boards related costs and commissions and more off-hire days associated with our MRs. We incurred a net loss to common shareholders of $3.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022 or $0.09 basic and diluted loss per share based upon $42.5 million weighted average shares outstanding compared to a lower net loss of $2.1 million, or $0.07 basic and diluted loss per share based on $13.2 million shares outstanding."
