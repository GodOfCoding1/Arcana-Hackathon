    "content": " We generated consolidated time charter equivalent revenues TCE of $13.8 million, an increase of $10 million over the same period in 2021 and sequential growth of 16% over the previous calendar quarter. Our time charter equivalent revenues for Q4 of '22, which we define as revenues net minus voyage-related costs and commissions, further accelerated to $13.8 million, an increase of $10 million from the same period in 2021 due to higher charter rates, especially in the spot charter market where we incur higher voyage-related costs and commissions as well as the impact from changes in our fleet. We generated net income to common shareholders of $6.5 million for the 3 months ended December 31, 2022 or $0.61 basic and $0.53 diluted EPS compared to a net loss of $5.6 million or $0.58 basic and diluted loss per share in the same period in 2021. For the 12 months ended December 31, '22, we reported TCE revenues of $41 million, an increase of over $23.2 million, primarily due to significantly higher spot charter rates and greater spot employment."
