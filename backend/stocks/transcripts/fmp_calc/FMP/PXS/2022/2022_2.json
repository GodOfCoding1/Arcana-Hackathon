    "content": " In the second quarter ended June 30, we generated consolidated time charter equivalent revenues - TCE of $11.3 million, 173% higher than the same period in 2021. The ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine has resulted in tightening of product inventories which continued to be below five-year averages, changing trading patterns, expansion of , dislocation to end markets creating arbitrage opportunities, and higher transportation costs; however, as higher inflation unfolded and petroleum product prices, such as gasoline and diesel, hit records, consumption softened as the quarter closed and prices have subsequently declined by a modest percentage. Our time charter equivalent revenues for 2Q22, which we define as revenues net minus voyage-related costs and commissions, accelerated to $11.3 million, an increase of 173% from the same period in 2021 due to higher charter rates, especially in the spot market where we incurred higher voyage-related costs and commissions, as well as the impact from changes to our fleet."
