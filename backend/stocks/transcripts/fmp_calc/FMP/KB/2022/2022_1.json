    "content": " First, Q1 \u201822 net profit based on profit attributable to controlling interest was up 14% year-over-year to KRW 1.45 trillion, outperforming market consensus by 13%. Q1 profit, net of one-off factors on a recurring basis was up 4% year-over-year, which shows KB Financial Group\u2019s robust earnings capacity despite market uncertainties and lower trading and retail commissions income following the rate hike. Despite strong corporate demand and weak capital markets and quarterly dividend payout, 2021 end of Q1 CET1 ratio was 13.4%, on par with year 2021 level, and Tier 1 BIS ratio compared to end of last year was up by 14 to 23 basis points. Fourth, despite group\u2019s investment into digitalization and rise thereof, on the back of corporate-wide cost control efforts and built-up effect of headcount efficiencies, G&A was down 2% on-year with cost-to-income ratio reporting 45.4%, which is down by 4.3 percentage points compared to CIO of 21. Such strong quarterly NIM expansion resulted from not only the effect of the three hikes in the key interest rates since August last year, but also the bank\u2019s asset repricing effect, as the future monetary policy direction was reflected in advance in the market interest rate, as well as our persistent efforts to enhance yields earned from securities assets.
