    "content": " $17 billion of total transaction volume in Q3 generated total revenues of $316 million, down only 9% from Q3 of last year. Our $17 billion of transaction volumes this quarter generated total revenues of $316 million, down 9% from the third quarter of last year, and diluted earnings per share of $1.40, down 37% compared to last year. As a result, our cash revenues expanded and our adjusted EBITDA grew 4% to $75 million, and drove 5% growth in adjusted earnings per share to $1.55 this quarter. On a combined basis, these businesses generated nearly $30 million of primarily cash revenues this quarter, highlighting the benefit of the investments we made in the stable subscription revenues of Zelman, and the assets under management at Alliant. As shown on Slide 7, our Capital Markets segment, which drives transaction volumes, generated revenues of $183 million this quarter, down 27% compared to last year. As shown on Slide 8, revenues for our SAM segment grew 40% this quarter, or $39 million due to increased servicing fees, escrow earnings and revenues from Alliant. As Fed funds has now reached 4%, our escrow earnings will generate between $100 million and $115 million of annualized revenues, more than offsetting increases in floating rate debt expense and providing between $55 million and $70 million of annualized operating income. And while, there's lots of reporting as it relates to rent growth peeling back from the very elevated levels that it was in 2021 and the beginning of 2022, as I tried to underscore in our comments on our servicing portfolio, I had someone call me last week who said, \"Oh my gosh, there's $100 million of multifamily debt that's coming up to be refi every year over the next 10 years."
