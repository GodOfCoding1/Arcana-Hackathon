    "content": "  So first, we have seen in H1 and more in particular in the Q2 a strong improvement of our results on the back of a strong recovery in particular in Continental Europe where for the first time we have reached 2019 figures with 121%, which had led the capability to improve the EBITDA by \u00e2\u0082\u00ac26.2 uh at a level of \u00e2\u0082\u00ac25.8 million for the Q2, i.e., from July to September. As you can see in this slide, the recovery has been stronger and stronger over the months and in particular, if you look to the column October 2022, you can see that overall it's seven point on group reporting SIS, issued SIS with a momentum which continued to be strong in Europe with 102% versus 2019 compared to Q2, which was at 101% and more importantly I would say an increase of the recovery now in APAC, where the recovery level reached 68%, which is an increase of 17 point compared to Q2. Asian countries have also shown in October a very strong momentum compared to Q2, reaching for the first time the level of 2019 and obviously the two, without surprise where we have not seen a recovery in Mainland China, which is still at only 11% of 2019 and Russian and I have a slide for that, which basically is a surprising 27%, but because we include in Continental Europe, Turkey, which is a main benefiting destination of the Russian tourism. If we now turn to the APAC recovery, as I was mentioning in my introduction, October I've seen a sizable increase, thanks to the relaxation of sanitary condition reaching 68% versus Q2 at 51% and on the right of the chart, you can also see that like in Europe, we have an increase or recovery of APAC, which is stronger in terms of spent at 51% compared to a recovery in Q2 in transaction at 20% and in terms of international shoppers at 15%."
