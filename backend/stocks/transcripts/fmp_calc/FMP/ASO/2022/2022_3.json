    "content": " This is a little lower than the first 2 quarters, which were up 36% versus '19, but we're pleased that we continue to hold on to the large majority of the gains from the past couple of years despite a more challenging macroeconomic environment. While running negative comps versus last year, the ammunition business continues to run up triple digits year-to-date versus 2019, and we saw the declines versus 2021 start to lessen as we got deeper into the quarter. Just as we're thinking about puts and takes on the gross margin into next year, how should we think about some of the drivers between mix, supply chain, promotions, and then, Michael, just any updated views on maybe the longer-term gross margin opportunity versus that 32.5% to 33% range you've spoken to previously, just given how well the business has held on to some of its margin gains? And so I think 1 of the things that's happened over the past couple of years is not only for us but for the whole industry, is the promotional landscape has kind of been benign, it's allowed us to kind of clear the decks and it's really allowed us to be thoughtful about where and when and how we're layering in those promotions."
