    "content": " The company\u2019s precious metal interest produced 171,400 gold equivalent ounces in the first quarter of 2022, comprised of 79,100 ounces of gold, 6.2 million ounces of silver, 4,500 ounces of palladium and 234,000 pounds of cobalt. Relative to the first quarter of the prior year, this represented a decrease of 13% in gold equivalent production, partially due to lower production at Voisey\u2019s Bay where the comparable period in the prior year included 676,000 pounds or 12,400 gold equivalent ounces of production from prior periods. Revenue for the first quarter of 2022 amounted to $307 million, representing a 5% decrease relative to Q1 2021, primarily due to a 2% decrease in the average realized gold equivalent price and the lower sales volumes. Gross margin for the first quarter of 2022 increased by 3% to $180 million relative to comparable quarter of the prior year, resulting from sales mix differences. Stock-based compensation amounted to $10 million in the first quarter of 2022, representing an increase of $8 million relative to the comparable quarter of the prior year, primarily due to higher accrued costs associated with the performance share units or PSUs, which in turn was due to a 24% increase in the company\u2019s share price over the quarter. Operating cash flow for the first quarter of 2022 amounted to $211 million or $0.47 per share, compared to $232 million or $0.52 per share in the prior year, representing a 9% decrease on a per share basis."
