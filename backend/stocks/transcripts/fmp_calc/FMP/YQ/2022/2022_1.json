    "content": " Although we recorded a net loss of RMB24.8 million on a GAAP business in the first quarter of 2022, we achieved RMB9.9 million of adjusted net income compared with an adjusted net loss of RMB588.8 million in the first quarter of 2021. On an adjusted basis, our adjusting net income, which excludes share-based compensation expenses was positive on the RMB9.9 million for the first quarter of 2022, compared with an adjusting net loss of RMB659.7 million in the same period of 2021. Cost of revenue for the first quarter of 2022 was RMB91.8 million representing a year-over-year decrease of 51.1% from RMB187.6 million in the first quarter of 2021, which was largely in line with the cessation of our online K-12 tutoring services under the new regulatory and business environment."
