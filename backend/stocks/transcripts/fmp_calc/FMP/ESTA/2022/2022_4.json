    "content": " The increase in SG&A in the fourth quarter resulted from continued normalization of business practices and our investments in new growth initiatives like Mia and preparations for our launch in the U.S. R&D expenses for the fourth quarter increased approximately $400,000 from the same quarter a year ago to $6.5 million. As impactful as each of these initiatives will be, they are all part of a broader strategy we have to: continue to heal the relationship that women have with the legacy breast implant industry by offering innovative and safer options backed by science and supported by clinical data, which could expand the existing market; normalized breast aesthetics with valuable new categories so that new groups of women will be open to our technologies; and finally, and perhaps most importantly, democratize access to breast reconstruction so that the restorative benefits of reconstruction after breast cancer can be available to women globally to at least the level of access that is available in the United States.
