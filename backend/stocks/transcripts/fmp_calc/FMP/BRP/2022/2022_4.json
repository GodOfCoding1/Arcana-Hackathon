    "content": " Westwood, our homeowners focused business embedded in the new homebuilder channel is not yet included in our organic results, but grew revenue over 32% during the fourth quarter and 25% for the full year, showing exceptional durability amid accelerating challenges in the U.S. housing market during the year. For the full year 2023, we expect organic revenue growth at the high end of our 10% to 15% range, which, based on the performance we are seeing across our business year-to-date, includes an expectation for mid-teens organic revenue growth in Q1. And we saw performance everywhere from our MGA of the Future and specialty business that had really exceptional organic growth; our Middle Market Group, where we're seeing the investments we've made in talent and capabilities lead to accelerating client wins, as evidenced in the 17% organic growth rate. And we were able to increase free cash flow 5% year-over-year even with an increase in cash paid for interest of $42 million or 194% and increased partnership integration costs of $15 million or 80%, which was driven mainly by the TSA associated with the Westwood transaction, which was a large public company carve-out and carried larger integration costs as well as integration of the large Q4 '21 partnerships."
