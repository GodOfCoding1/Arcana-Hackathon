    "content": " Statements made during this call, which are not historical, may constitute forward-looking statements. Although we believe the expectations reflected in any forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, we can give no assurance that our expectations will be met. When we get to the question-and-answer portion, we ask that you be respectful of everyone\u00e2\u0080\u0099s time and limit your questions to one plus a follow-up. Thank you, Trent and welcome to UDR\u00e2\u0080\u0099s third quarter 2022 conference call. Presenting on the call with me today are Senior Vice President of Operations, Mike Lacy; and President and Chief Financial Officer, Joe Fisher, who will discuss our results. To begin, we continue to see exceptional results and are in a healthy multifamily operating environment. Highlights of the third quarter include the following: sequential same-store revenue growth of nearly 5%; year-over-year, same-store revenue grew almost 13% and NOI was nearly 16% higher. These results translated into 18% year-over-year growth in FFOA per share and drove our third guidance raise this year, which Mike and Joe will discuss in further detail. Rent-to-income levels of incoming residents, has not deteriorated. These factors, combined with our favorable relative affordable versus alternative housing options and reasonable new supply expectations create a positive near-term outlook for multifamily. All-in, we continue to believe UDR is well equipped to manage whatever macro environment we face based upon what we know right now and what we can control. First, our customer remains financially sound. Second, our jump-off point for 2023 has never been better as our same-store revenue earn-in is roughly 5% is effectively locked in at this point. Third, our continued focus on innovation and culture should continue to enhance our margin growth. Fourth, prior FFOA per share headwinds like development and lease-ups become tailwinds in 2023. And last, our balance sheet remains highly liquid with over $1 billion of capacity. That said, we are fully aware of growing concerns over where the macro environment is trending and the challenges our business could face moving forward. Thus far, we have been able to pass these costs on to our residents in relatively short order given our standard 12-month lease structure. Specific to the third quarter, a portion of our elevated expense growth was anticipated as we continue to push rental rate growth, which resulted in higher turnover and elevated repair and maintenance cost. However, building a better 2023 rent roll at the expense of short-term cost pressures is the value of creating trade for a 70% margin business like ours. As such, we pivoted to a capital-light strategy and pared back opportunistic external growth. Our balance sheet remains fully capable of supporting all planned capital uses and with less than 2% of consolidated debt maturing over the next 3 years, our interest rate risk is minimal. Moving on, we continue to build on our position as a recognized global ESG leader with the publication of our fourth annual ESG report and a 5-star designation from GRESB, the highest ESG rating possible. We have a highly talented experienced team with a track record of performance irrespective of the economic environment, combined with our culture that fosters collaboration and innovation mindsets. To begin, strong sequential same-store revenue growth of 4.7% drove year-over-year same-store revenue and NOI growth of 12.7% and 15.5% on a straight-line basis. Key components of these results and our demand drivers included: first, year-over-year effective blended lease rate growth remained firmly above historical norms at 13.1%. We traded a nominal amount of occupancy to achieve this rental rate growth, but also improved our 2023 rent roll and locked in more of our approximately 5% 2023 earning. Second, our in-place residents are increasingly paying rent on time. Collection rates improved sequentially in the third quarter and the number of long-term delinquent residents in our portfolio continued to decline, which reduced our bad debt reserve and accounts receivable balances. Third, portfolio-wide rent-to-income ratios remain consistent with history in the low 20% range. Fourth, traffic and applications remain above typical seasonal level, allowing us to continue to push rate growth. Fifth, concessions are de minimis across our portfolio, with exceptions being 1 to 2 weeks on average in specific submarkets of San Francisco, Washington, D.C. and Boston. And last, due to rising mortgage rates, renting an apartment is approximately 50% less expensive than owning a home versus 35% less expensive pre-COVID. During the third quarter, only 7% of residents that moved out did so to purchase a home. Moving on to expenses, quarterly same-store expenses rose 7.2% on a year-over-year basis. While this is higher than usual, our margin continues to expand as we operate a 70% plus margin business. We continue to push rent growth, which resulted in 450 more unit turns than a year ago. Positively, we re-leased these homes at 22% higher average effective rate or 900 basis points above our average renewal rate for the quarter. Combined, this negatively impacted R&M and A&M during the quarter by $1.6 million, which should generate approximately $7 million in incremental revenue over the next 12 months. Had we not made these trades, our year-over-year same-store expense growth would have been approximately 5.7%. However, as we are typically reimbursed by residents for approximately 70% of this line item, same-store NOI was not meaningfully impacted. Higher real estate taxes, which comprise 40% of all expenses, grew by over 5%. Pressure points consisted of Texas and Florida where valuations increased and New York City, where the burn-off of our 421 abatement continues. Insurance, which is a relatively small expense for us, also increased dramatically due to higher premiums and claims. Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we saw the return of typical seasonality in market rents after Labor Day. This factor, combined with our pricing strategy to drive rate growth drove a quicker capture of our loss to lease. For October, blended lease rate growth is expected to be roughly 7% to 8%, comprised of new lease rate growth of 4.5% to 5% and renewals of approximately 10%. For the fourth quarter, we expect blended lease rate growth to average 6% to 7% with the sequential deceleration due to toughening year-over-year comps. Taken together, we increased our full year 2022 same-store revenue and NOI guidance ranges for the third time this year in conjunction with our release yesterday. Finally, we are continuing to drive forward on innovation with the intent of further expanding our 325 basis point controllable operating margin advantage versus peers. These include: first, launching building-wide WiFi that allows whole building connectivity, a seamless setup at move-in for new residents and enhanced control over smart hubs to reduce energy consumption and improve Scope 3 emissions. UDR has made a capital investment in equipment, which provides improved economics and more control over the scope of the project versus traditional bulk deals. Second, leveraging advanced resident leads and virtual leasing technology to better generate qualified leads and track prospects, optimize marketing activities, close leases faster and enhance real-time pricing. Third, simplifying our move-in process to reduce vacant days while simultaneously offering a better tool to sell other income initiatives, such as renters insurance, parking and storage thereby increasing our share of wallet. Fourth, improving our dynamic work order scheduling through enhanced vendor management tools, which should reduce vacant days through the turn process, while improving asset management to better assess the repair first replace decision. And fifth, expanding the number of communities we are able to operate without dedicated onsite personnel from 25 today to 35 over the next 12 months. This approach, whereby leasing and resident services activities conducted virtually improves our margin and helps mitigate inflationary costs. Today, we have increased the number of apartment homes managed per associate by 60% versus pre-COVID levels. Last, a special thanks goes out to all our teams for their ongoing dedication, but especially our teams in Tampa and Orlando. And I applaud your round-the-clock efforts to safeguard our communities, protect our residents and return our properties to normal operations. The topics I will cover today include our third quarter results and our updated outlook for full year 2022, a summary of recent transactions in the capital markets activity and a balance sheet and liquidity update. For the fourth quarter, our FFOA per share guidance range is $0.60 to $0.62 or a 2% sequential and a 13% year-over-year increase at the midpoint. This is supported by continued strength in sequential same-store NOI growth, partially offset by increased interest expense given rising rates. We now anticipate full year FFOA per share of $2.32 to $2.34 with the $2.33 midpoint, representing a $0.02 or 1% increase versus our prior full year guidance and a 16% increase versus full year 2021. Next, the transactions and capital markets update. First, in alignment with our shift towards our capital-light strategy earlier in 2022, our third quarter external growth consisted solely of the previously announced $102 million DCP investment into a portfolio of stabilized communities at an 8% return. Because recapitalizations of stabilized assets have lower risk profiles, this is a relatively lower return versus our typical DCP investment. Next, during and subsequent to the quarter, we repurchased a total of 1.2 million common shares at a weighted average price of $41.14 per share for a total consideration of approximately $49 million. These buybacks were executed at an average discount to consensus NAV of 24% and a high 5% implied cap rate, representing a very accretive use of capital. Finally, during the quarter, we entered into an agreement to sell 1 community in Orange County, California for approximately $42 million. Speaking more broadly to the transaction market, pricing on the majority of multifamily transactions suggest cap rates are priced 75 to 100 basis points higher than at the beginning of the year, depending on market and asset quality. All told, the ongoing volatility in the macro environment and an elevated cost of capital relative to earlier in 2022, keep us selective in our capital deployment. Finally, our investment grade balance sheet remains liquid and fully capable of funding our capital needs. Some highlights include: first, we have only $115 million of consolidated debt or approximately 0.5% of enterprise value scheduled to mature through 2024 after excluding amounts on our credit facilities and our commercial paper program. Second, we have $1.1 billion of liquidity as of September 30, which is comprised of approximately $900 million of capacity on our line of credit and nearly $200 million of unsettled forward equity agreements, providing us ample dry powder and strength. Debt to enterprise value was just 29% at quarter end, while net debt-to-EBITDAre was 6x, down more than a full turn from 7.1x a year ago. By year end 2022, both metrics should be approximately 0.5 turn better versus pre-COVID levels. Last, our approximately $370 million of developments in lease-up have been a drag on 2022 earnings, but are expected to benefit future earnings by approximately $0.05 per share based on a 6.5% weighted average stabilized yield. Please proceed with your question. Joe, you talked about the cost of capital changing leverage trending down and the buybacks in the quarter and I guess in October as well. So yes, we did pivot a little bit as we move throughout the year, obviously. And as cost of capital has changed and got price discovery has been occurring, we have pivoted over and shifted some of our development plans back into next year and then obviously shifted to the buyback. So \u00e2\u0080\u0093 at this point in time, I wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t say there is a set dollar target that we are going after. We do really like the economics in terms of discount to NAV, the implied cap up in kind of the high 5s at a pretty compelling IRR on that purchase. But we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to continue to monitor what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going on in the macro environment, what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s taking place with our cost of capital and the price of the stock what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going on with sources and uses. And I would say sources and uses in a pretty phenomenal place at this point, given we still have almost 200 of equity available that issuance in March, plus a disposition that we mentioned here that should close in the fourth quarter. So we will kind of continue to monitor those factors, but no set target today. As it relates to 1532, we think this is unique to our DCP portfolio. We had an early bankruptcy with one of the key subs followed by delays by other subs as well as COVID, which caused a 2-year delay of the delivery of that building. Between the delay and the COVID impacts, it added to the cost of the building and resulted in the senior loan interest in the pref accrual eating through the equity and the economics of the deal for the developer. So when the senior loan finally matured, we were in a situation where the developer was unable to refi due to the lower NOI, which resulted in the default and then we stepped in per the terms of the agreement and bought the loan from the bank. The building leased up during a high, obviously, concessionary environment. Obviously, rents fell a lot in San Francisco. But overall, we feel comfortable with the portfolio that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s very diversified across all our DCP investments. To date, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve done 27 deals over the last 9 years or almost $900 million. Hey, Steve, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a great question. As we move forward, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to see a little bit more of the team increase going on that 9% to 10% range through December at this point. The leverage will be on the market rent side, and we will see where that shakes out. So to your point on kind of those warning signs, I said in my prepared remarks, we see a lot of green lights still today. But again, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re seeing occupancy in that 96.5% to 97% range. And then maybe one for Joe on just thinking about cost of capital changing, obviously, stock prices are down, bond yields are up significantly. Obviously, with price discovery taking place, in the prepared remarks, talked about cap rates being up maybe 75 to 100 basis points up into that plus or minus high 4s range. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s kind of what we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re hearing today, but obviously, transaction volumes are off fairly materially. So I think we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re still going to go through a period of time here, we get price discovery. So at this point, I wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t say we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve pegged a required hurdle for development. What we have done is, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve heard us talk about a $185 million development in Northern Virginia throughout the year. That was supposed to start here in the third quarter, but we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve delayed the start of that pending evaluating cost of capital, price discovery, etcetera. Not as of right now, in those same markets are the ones we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve mentioned previously. And again, occupancy is still in a great place, traffic still coming into those markets. And our blended growth rate, as you see in the supplement, still very high in those markets. And then, Tom, maybe for you, I mean, you referenced a difficult macro backdrop that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re operating in. And you guys have a really diversified portfolio across various regions and price points, submarket locations, etcetera. One, what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s happening on Main Street with our residents. And Mike alluded earlier, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not seeing any cracks. And when you look at Mike\u00e2\u0080\u0099s blends in October, a 10 and a 5 on new and renewal is I would have taken that in my 30-year career, 29 years that would be a great number. So that side of the equation is really strong, and we will see how it really plays out. With respect to the macro environment, the capital markets, obviously, the feds, the banks, everyone is trying to push down inflation with every tool they have got in the box, and they are going to succeed. And they are raising the cost of capital, you see our stock price, you see any other lending situation, all being challenged by that. I think we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve positioned ourselves well there, and it will create opportunities. And so we tend to think of it, what we control what we interact with and what opportunities we can generate. And you see it in our operating numbers, really strong, expect those to continue, and we will wait and see what cracks occur. Please proceed with your question. Obviously, when somebody comes in, we get an idea of where they are coming from, but we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have that in an aggregated level at the market in front of me today. 1,000\n So that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not 10 years ago when we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re running the 25-year olds right out of college, and they are making 60. And still, when you look at banks and the information they are giving about spending, savings, credit, that part of our resident profile looks pretty strong. Hi, Jeff, I think when you think about the price sensitivity, first and foremost, what we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re seeing is seasonality. Sure in some markets, some already have some cracks here and there, and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s where we see some of these concessions popping up. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll tell you kind of fast forward and looking at 4Q versus 3Q, I do see a little bit more of a decel if you will, in the Sunbelt, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just coming off of obviously very high numbers, still going to be very strong. And also right now, loss to lease is a little bit higher. Market rents are a little bit higher, maybe got a tailwind, if you will, going into next year. versus peak pricing, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re probably 10% to 20%. I was just curious, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a little difficult to exactly what the outcome is with that asset. We intend to move forward with the foreclosure process, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s expected in 1Q \u00e2\u0080\u009823. What I would say is that from an economics perspective, when you look at replacement cost for this asset, our basis is probably plus or minus $87 million which equates to about 640 of the door. Replacement costs is well in excess of 100 given development costs today, so up and prior the 800 plus or minus range. So relative to replacement cost, a very good outcome. From a yield perspective, the yield on our cash basis is probably in the mid-4s based off that basis on a fully accrued basis, including the good pref somewhere in the mid-3s. So less supply pressures going forward and then you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re just coming through the lease-up phase, so we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got to burn off a lot of those concessions. And again, this can fluctuate quite a bit over the next couple of months. Obviously, builds our earn-in for next year. I mean, Mike has done a fabulous job with respect to capturing the market rent that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s there. And you can see it in our numbers on a sequential basis with 4% \u00e2\u0080\u0093 almost 5% revenue growth; second, nomination in the occupancy. And when you walk into \u00e2\u0080\u009823 and say, 5% already booked, we feel like we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re in a really good, strong position into that \u00e2\u0080\u009823 window of no issues with the resident choosing the capital markets, yes. Obviously, you guys have had different markets than that peer. So I think to that last question on what are we seeing from blends and loss to lease and our earn-in perspective, I covered part of it. I think what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s important, too, is that decrease in blends is not coming from a decrease in underlying market rents. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen market rents continue to increase on a year-over-year basis, commensurate with historical averages. So recent trends and the strength of the consumer tells us that, that could continue. Now if you go into a recession, maybe you see a lower number. And then in the interim, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to continue to focus on the innovation side. So I think it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s too early to start talking 2023 forecast, but that gives you some of the building blocks that we see today. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s great, really helpful. And just on the occupancy side, I recognize and appreciate kind of the transparency, I think you guys have had in your strategy and kind of talking from me about pulling to sacrifice a lot of the occupancy to kind of maximizing store revenue growth. Look, 30 bps kind of occupancy decline quarter-over-quarter. I think if you look at and you think about the fourth quarter, obviously, we have lower lease expirations. Right now, we have a little bit more ability to push it back up. I think you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll see us hover between that 96.7 to 97 going forward through the fourth quarter, and we will have pricing power with that. Once you start going below 96.5 for us, it may cause a little bit of a pressure point. If we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re a little bit more efficient on how we turn the units and moving people in faster, it shouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really come at a cost on the rent side of the equation. And Mike how much on Iraq  relates to the long-term evictions in that the $700 million going down to... That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a great point, Tom. So we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re about halfway to where we need to be, less than 1%. So we picked that up about 15 basis points relative to prior expectations, continue to trend in the mid-98% collected relative to build revenue. I think realistically, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re looking at maybe half of that as a possibility given some of the rules and regulations that have been put in place by different municipalities, primarily on the coast. John, I think it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s too early to say at this point. And so over the next couple of quarters, we will see how they approach the disposition versus refi process. The way we originally underwrite these, we make sure that we underwrite in a stress scenario in terms of asset value as well as coverage ratios to make sure to account for some variability. Obviously, rates today much higher than where they were at 12 months ago, I think 6 months from now, we could be in a very different environment as well. So all I can kind of speak to today is no issues today, and we will continue to monitor and work with the equity partners. Yes, we are definitely seeing an increase in the number of both developers looking to capitalize their deals as a result of lower proceeds from the bank and as well recapping completed development deals in the market. But right now, with our capital like we are doing a lot of review of those deals, but haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t put out any term sheets, but we continue to be monitoring the market. Mike, just quickly, 3.5% new lease growth in Seattle, anything unusual this quarter, or has that market become a lot softer? John, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a good question. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s become that much softer, but we are also inflated with our exposure there. So, I can tell you John, still feels very strong for us. So, we had a little bit more exposure over the last 30 days to 45 days, and we have since re-priced those. So, I think some of that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just a short-term to long-term lease phenomenon. Yes, we were above 7% here in the quarter. I think when we get into 4Q, we will be back into that 5% plus or minus range. So, you are really looking at about 1%, probably half that being more surprised. So, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been driving up some of our turnover as well as the cost to turn those units. So, a little bit, probably half of that was a surprise. And I would say just to size that, you have about $100 million in the quarter in expenses. So, 1%, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s only $1 million for us. Why, because I am getting 200-plus units that were zero income to me. So, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s $6 million a year. So, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a pleasant surprise for us to spend $1 million, turn the unit and turn them back into $6 million revenue for next year. And I will make that trade every day and have told Mike, just keep pressing, we would like to get that delinquent number down. Yes, we are fighting those, but I think the innovation that we have has a lot of avenues to beat the cost structure and hold it and contain it. Are there any markets that were you more any specific geographies, that would be very helpful. I think as we look out to 2023 and beyond, a couple of comments. I would say, broadly speaking, more concern when you get into the Sunbelt markets. So, Sunbelt, depending on the market you are looking at, you could see growth in supply upwards of 30%-plus. So, somewhere above 3%-plus of stock in a number of those markets, be it the Austin, Nashville, Charlotte, Phoenix, some of those markets. On the West Coast, we do see supply starting to come down. So, some of the markets like Northern California, I think supply comes down quite a bit. On the East Coast, New York seems to be coming down on a forward basis. And so near-term, a little bit of increased supply, although I would say our submarkets generally are about half of the overall market supply expectations, so feeling a little bit better there. I think when you get into the \u00e2\u0080\u009824 and \u00e2\u0080\u009825 picture, we do expect to start to see some of that supply come down. Given the financing market that exists today, the unknowns around where cap rates settle out and of course, cost inflation that we continue to see. So, we would expect over the next 6 months to 12 months to start to see starts come down quite a bit. And so \u00e2\u0080\u009824, \u00e2\u0080\u009825 probably start to get a little bit better story on that front. But what we are seeing with a lot of the tech stocks, a lot of the stock comp is not being where it was supposed to be. Well, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s why I am in the apartment business. So, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t see, and I look at our experience for hiring tech people, they are going to find jobs and be paid very well. I do worry a little bit about the homebuilding aspect, the construction and the financing markets weathering a capital markets-type recession. And we looked through our employment base \u00e2\u0080\u0093 excuse me, our resident base. All we can try to do is set around the room as we do each week and say, where do we think this thing is cracking, do we see anything and to be very, very transparent. And then if we can go back to the DCP, you do have the new arm when you do the recapitalization. So, if one o7f our existing equity partners comes to us and we like the economics and the risk we would absolutely participate on a go-forward basis with a recap either within our existing position or into even more of a senior loan format. So, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s something we would consider, but at this point in time, there is really nothing on the table that \u00e2\u0080\u0093 in terms of the upcoming maturities to speak to. I think Harry and Andrew have been very, very transparent and clear. We have always looked at the asset and said, boy, is it one close to ours, is it an asset that makes sense someday, if it comes to market, we would love to buy it. And we will still continue to do that and believe that, that is the right avenue to think about these. And just more broadly, thinking about some of the literature out there on how strong the housing market has been and the macro factors that have. I think what we are seeing now today, and you definitely see it within our move-out stats. So, we are seeing it in terms of our turnover stats. So, homeownership rate should stay steady and/or come down, which obviously benefits us in terms of more demand from any incremental household formation. And then just coming back to the consumer, I think you are talking about some of the warning signs of things we are looking at. And when we see traffic still up on a 10% on a year-over-year basis, we see cash collections in the month continuing to improve even here in October, and we are not dependent on government assistance on a go-forward basis. So, overall, really not seeing those cracks. And ultimately, I think household formation probably benefits us on the rentership side a little bit more. I would say number one, we aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t necessarily immune to some of those surprises, but the diversification that we have in the portfolio obviously insulates us. So, when you look at some of the expense growth that we have had in our Sunbelt markets that is being driven primarily in Florida and Texas by the real estate taxes increasing as well as seeing higher turnover in those markets. So, we are seeing it this year and still expect to see it next year. I think when we look at preliminary outlook for next year on real estate tax, we are looking at plus or minus 5% overall. When you get down into our Sunbelt markets, I think you are going to be looking at high-single digits to low-double digits for markets like Florida and Texas and Nashville for us. Please proceed with your question. Some of the bad debts taking a bit longer to resolve, but you guys saw an improvement here. So, we do expect improvement over time going from the mid-98% plus or minus collected on billed revenue. I think on the margin, it should because we are having success and whittling down those long-term delinquents. So, we have got a pretty active process on that of that excess kind of long-term delinquent we have today and say 75% of them are somewhere in the eviction process although eviction processes instead of being perhaps a 30 days to 60 days, in some cases, are more like four months to six months. In terms of the bad debt statistics, I would say sequentially within that 4. 7% sequential revenue number, maybe a slight positive, i.e., 10 bp to 20 basis points, but not a big tailwind. So, our collections are getting better in the quarter, in the month, but we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really have that much volatility. I think we talked about it last quarter, the way we approach bad debt reserves. So, we have eliminated a lot of that volatility of when the cash comes in as a surprise or when it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a surprise negative. So, we do have some technology that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going into place here in the very near future. So, we think that we can compress our time that it takes to turn a unit just knowing when they are coming in, how we can schedule a little bit more efficiently, and again, driving down those vacant days. So, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s probably the biggest one aside from that, just given what we have rolled out previously and you have heard us talk about it, we have 25 properties today that are unmanned. First one, Mike, you talked about, I think that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s $40 million by 2025. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a good question, Neil. I think what you are going to see first and foremost, with the gig stream and the fact that we are rolling out the bulk Internet. So, we are currently rolling out about 10,000 apartment homes by the end of this year. We expect another 15,000 by the end of next year and then the rest of the portfolio in 2024. So, it does take a little bit of time to start seeing that revenue roll through. Aside from that, I just spoke a little bit about some of the technology we are putting in place that will help us with the efficiency around turns. We are continuing to find ways to do a better job with our pricing, obviously, going out there and creating more of those buyers or shoppers, if you will. A lot of efforts going in there and then obviously, our customer experience project, we are very excited about that. And then obviously, where that transpires, a lot of that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to come in 2023 on the revenue side, followed up with 2024 with another chunk of that money coming out at us. Of that $40 million associated with those over 60 projects, we have got about $6 million of that in the 2022 number that we have already been able to realize through the initiatives that we started over the last 12 months, 18 months. I think as you fast forward into \u00e2\u0080\u009823, anywhere from $5 million to upwards of $10-plus million depending on some issues with the supply chain around our bulk Internet rollout as well as some other constraints, but we are moving as quickly as we can there. Last one, I guess maybe Tom or really, whoever. A lot of supply coming in the Sunbelt, whatever and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been happening forever, demand killing it. But to that end, because there is a lot of supply that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to be coming and the debt market is uncertain, particularly more onerous terms or permanent financing. One, there is a lot there to assume and adjust for what will stabilize mortgage rates and proceeds stabilize out at. So, I think it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to be continue to monitor, see what comes to the market, how it prices out, but the days of 3.5 caps in the Sunbelt don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t see on the horizon anytime soon. And we will look, and as Joe has articulated many times and very well, we will monitor our cost of capital and look for accretive opportunities. I think Neil, when you look at \u00e2\u0080\u0093 we have talked about predictive analytics in the past, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pretty well diversified in terms of its buy-rated and an sell-rated markets today, meaning there are some Sunbelt markets, some East Coast and West Coast, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s like as well as the inverse. As Tom said, cost of capital today is prohibitive in terms of deploying new. And so as I think about near-term deployment, I would say our top three priorities at this point. So, I think that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the playbook for now to keep focusing on that. And hopefully, at some point, cost of capital comes back, and we can get back to external accretive growth. I would like to hand the call back over to Chairman and CEO, Mr. Toomey, for closing comments. And as you can see, we pivoted our tactics to adjust to it. And that we have adjusted to a capital-light environment and accordingly, our underwriting to present day cost of capital and taking appropriate actions. With that, we do believe we have the right strategy and have a great outlook for the future, and we look forward to seeing many of you at NAREIT in a couple of weeks."
