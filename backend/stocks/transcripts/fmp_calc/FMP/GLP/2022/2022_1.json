Before we begin, let me remind everyone that today\u2019s call will include forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws. These forward-looking statements are based on assumptions regarding market conditions, business cycles, demand for liquid LNG products and convenience store products, the utilization of our assets and facilities, the regulatory and permitting environment the forward looking product, pricing curve and other factors, which could influence our financial results. These statements involve significant risks and uncertainties, some of which are beyond the partnership\u2019s control, including without limitation, the impact and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, and its impact on our counterparties, our customers and our operations. Our recent acquisitions of Consumers Petroleum of Connecticut and Miller\u2019s Neighborhood Market demonstrate our success in identifying, acquiring and integrating additional assets into our portfolio, generating synergies and adding to our scale. Please note that EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA and DCF include a $4.9 million net gain on the sale and disposition of assets for the first quarter of 2022. GDSO product margin, in Q1 2022 was $173 million up $42.6 million from the same period in 2021. NYMEX gasoline prices increased $0.96 per gallon during the three months ended March 31, 2022 versus an increase of $0.54 per gallon during the same period in 2021. Station operations product margin, which includes convenience store and prepared food sales, sundries, and rental income contribute $58.1 million up $7.9 million from the first quarter of 2021 an increased activity at our convenience stores. Looking at the Wholesale segment, first quarter 2022 product margin increased $16.6 million to $47.1 million, primarily reflecting more favorable market conditions in other oils and related products, offset by less favorable market conditions in gasoline and gasoline blendstocks. Product margins from other oils and related products, which include distillates and residual oil, increased $18.6 million to $53.1 million. Gasoline and gasoline blendstock product margin was negative $2.3 million in the first quarter, compared with positive $16.4 million in the same period last year. Product margin from crude oil was negative $3.7 million in the first quarter up 778,000 from a year earlier. We are pleased with the results of the Wholesale segment, which performed to our expectations despite the extreme commodity price volatility experience in the first quarter of 2022. We do expect that the current steep backwardation of the forward product pricing curve will increase the cost of carrying our hedged inventory and future periods, but should also contribute to continued strength and rack margins. Turning to the Commercial segment, product margin increased $3.9 million in the first quarter to $8.1 million led by our bunkering business, which had higher volumes and improved margins. Looking at expenses, operating expenses increased $18.7 million to $99.2 million for the first quarter driven by increases in our GDSO segment. Interest expense for the quarter was $21.5 million up from $20.4 million, partly due to higher average balances on our credit facilities from higher commodity prices and borrowings for our recent acquisitions. CapEx in the first quarter of 2021 was approximately $17.1 million consisting of $7.5 million of maintenance CapEx, and $9.6 million of expansion CapEx, the majority of which relates to our convenience stores. For full year 2022, we continue to expect maintenance CapEx in the range of $45 million to $55 million and expansion CapEx excluding acquisitions in the range of $50 million to $60 million. We continue to manage our balance sheet prudently, leverage which is defined in our credit agreement as funded debt-to-EBITDA was approximately 3.3 times at the end of the first quarter. As of March 31, 2022, total borrowings outstanding under the credit agreement were $606.6 million. We continue to identify new opportunities to further drive value through our integrated network and strategically located assets and enhanced efficiencies, increased returns to unitholders, and deliver an outstanding experience for our customers and guests. Yes, I mean, I think, we as on a whole, we haven\u2019t been materially impacted by inflation as of yet. We\u2019ve seen some obviously wage inflation and you\u2019ll see that in our operating expenses line, that\u2019s somewhat stabilized this quarter. It\u2019s hard to find people in our retail side, our HR team is doing a good job on it, but it still continues to be a tough environment to find people. I mean, what I would say is demand, if we\u2019re talking about gasoline demand is still off from 2019, but it is interesting. I think, this holds true for both topics that you\u2019re identifying. When you look at how many people are going into the office still, it\u2019s not you look at the studies, it\u2019s still 40%, in the markets that we\u2019re in, that\u2019s all publicly available documents that you can see. So driving is different times are different where they\u2019re going, where consumers are driving is different. Good morning Selman, it\u2019s Mark. And that\u2019s the, those are the two key things that are really driving the quarter in other oils. Just a question on the M&A environment, maybe you could talk a little bit about what you\u2019re seeing. Hi Gregg it\u2019s Eric, I do think information and scale is important. And because people were very unsure of volumes in market and what was going to come back, and I just think the opportunity that we\u2019ve identified and that we have historically executed on continues to be available. And I think as a market as \u201csettled down\u201d from COVID certainly there are other issues here today, but I think, those opportunities are just going to present themselves and continue to be there. And just to add to Eric\u2019s comments, I mean, I think what we\u2019ve seen from sort of smaller players in the industry is, as we\u2019ve seen operating expenses increase throughout, from equipment to insurance, to salaries everything, if you don\u2019t have scale, you\u2019re definitely have more effective those operating expense increased on your bottom line. But if you\u2019re a smaller player, it definitely puts pressure on you. I think coming back to the question someone\u2019s asking you about, you see any impact in your business from higher prices and you pointed out that\u2019s, it\u2019s pre-COVID levels. Or just, it\u2019s more on the margin, like obviously prices have been going up since February, I mean down. I think he was talking about fuel volume by and large, but we are also, we are seeing sales are good, margins good in the store. We have, we\u2019ve got a lot of talented resources that help run those stores or do run those stores every day. We\u2019ve become, we\u2019ve got some price optimization tools that are disposal that are helping, make those decisions more efficient and more quickly for us. And then we\u2019ve added some, lines to the business. So, we have a lot of initiatives that are going on, that are contributing to the success that we\u2019re seeing in the stores. And so while yeah, it\u2019s been a tough environment, we\u2019re certainly there are some supply chain issues. We\u2019ve been very diligent around substituting items, when we have manufacture outages. So net-net, I think we\u2019re in a pretty good spot. And then just last one, you touched on the wholesale outperformance and you said there\u2019s good demand in our resilient bunker group. I didn\u2019t hear the tail end of that, Gregg. So is 1Q repeatable for wholesale is really the question based on the dynamics with commodities that are\u2026\n I don\u2019t know we don\u2019t, it\u2019s hard to look at it that way because every day\u2019s a little bit different, certainly every quarter\u2019s a little bit different. These markets are just a little bit different than, what we \u2013 we\u2019ve dealt with backward markets before we\u2019ve dealt with tight markets before. I will say, we\u2019ve not at least in my long time here; we haven\u2019t dealt with this degree of backwardation. But you just manage a business a little bit differently, and I think we\u2019ve done a good job with that. We\u2019re looking at every deal we do, we\u2019re looking to scrutinizing every deal we do. It gets a little painstaking, but that\u2019s how you got to operate in this environment. And if you work hard enough and if you pay close enough attention, you will find opportunities that being said, it\u2019s you have to be able to execute on those. And it\u2019s not automatic, but it is, it does, I think if you have a team that is experienced and is looking at it the right way, you have a shot. And so I\u2019m not sure if we can say, yes, I expect Q2 to look like Q1. I mean, they don\u2019t look, alike anyway in normal time. So, it\u2019s going to be, we\u2019re going to have to just operate a little bit differently for the foreseeable future, whether that\u2019s the balance of the year, if you think about two years ago, or yes two years ago we had super contango. So, we\u2019re always trying to adjust according, based on the conditions. And I think, we\u2019ll just continue to work as hard as we can to grab those opportunities and mitigate the risk. I know it\u2019s a tough one to straight line in any direction, but appreciate it. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today\u2019s teleconference."
