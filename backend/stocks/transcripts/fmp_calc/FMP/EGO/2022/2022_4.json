    "content": " As a result, our full year 2022 cash operating costs and total cash costs were above our consolidated guidance, while our all in sustaining cost was within guidance, driven by our disciplined management of sustaining capital. After adjusting for 1 time non-recurring items, including deferred tax expense related to foreign exchange translation and write down of assets, adjusted net earnings was $26 million or $0.14 per share in the fourth quarter and $10 million or 0.05 per share for the full year. Cash operating costs averaged $741 per ounce sold in the fourth quarter and $788 per ounce sold for the full year, which was 5% above the 2022 guidance range, mainly driven by price increases for commodities and consumables. All in sustaining cost averaged $1,246 per ounce sold in the fourth quarter and $1,276 per ounce sold for the full year, which was in line with the guidance range. In 2023, our consolidated cash operating cost guidance of $760 to $860 per ounce sold and all-in sustaining cost guidance is $1,190 to $1,290 per ounce sold, which reflects ongoing inflationary pressures related to key consumables, such as cyanide, electricity, diesel, explosives, cement and labor. Capital expenditures on a cash basis were $81 million in the fourth quarter and $290 million for the full year, which included continued investment in growth projects at Kisladag and early works at Skouries. Full year 2022 gold production was 453,916 ounces, which was just below the bottom end of guidance range, driven by lower production at Kisladag and Olympias. Looking ahead to 2023, our consolidated gold production guidance is forecasted to be 475,000 to 515,000 ounces, down slightly from our previously published 2023 guidance, which takes into account modifications to the production plan and   turnover expected at Lamaque, as well as an assumed slower ramp up at Kisladag with the commissioning of the final agglomeration drum in the first half of the year. At Kisladag, fourth quarter production was 40,307 ounces and cash operating costs was $709 per ounce sold. At Efem\u00c3\u00a7ukuru, fourth quarter gold production was 21,362 ounces, cash operating costs of $738 per ounce sold. In 2023, Lamaque's production guidance is 170,000 to 180,000 ounces of gold and this is based on mining and processing 860,000 to 870,000 tons of ore at an average gold grade of 6.25 to 6.75 grams per ton. Next year, Olympias production guidance is 60,000 to 75,000 ounces of gold and the site is expected to mine approximately 460,000 to 490,000 tons of ore at an average grade of 7.5 to 8.5 grams per ton."
