    "content": " Yet, total direct operating costs, primarily in mining, processing and related costs, on a U.S. dollar basis, were slightly lower in Q1 2022 compared to the previous quarter, due in part to the weakening Turkish lira, despite higher tons placed on pad at Kisladag in Q1 2022 compared to Q4 2021. Starting in Turkey, Kisladag\u2019s production in the first quarter was 29,779 ounces, and cash operating costs were $861 per ounce sold. But overall, when you look at our spend in Q1 relative to Q4 or last year\u2019s run rate for mining, processing, G&A, we\u2019re not seeing an impact on our costs to-date. So, we haven\u2019t seen -- when you convert it to U.S. dollar operating costs in Turkey for both our operations combined, throughout 2021, Q1 all the way through to Q4, our U.S. dollar operating costs are pretty flat and that continues to be the case for Q1 2022. So, if it\u2019s to $2.5 million to $3 million a quarter on a go forward basis, in Q2, we\u2019ll still have some residual costs in there sort of one time things. So, I think, based on where -- what we had in Q1, I would say probably less than $5 million, but I think it\u2019s probably in that ballpark per quarter. Kerry, this is Joe. Just so I\u2019m clear, that $2.5 million to $3 million run rate is with Skouries, not contributing any care and maintenance costs to that number, right? They seem like they\u2019re going up -- well, they went up a lot at Olympias, based on what I calculated and it seems like Kisladag has gone up a significant amount as well, it was like 14.5 a ton in Q1, and last year was slightly below $11. So, like if I look at your total cost for mining at Olympias from your Q1 in U.S. dollars, the ounces sold, it\u2019s like $350 a ton. Kerry, this is Joe."
