    "content": " Our operational performance recovered in the second quarter, resulting in cash operating costs of $789 per ounce sold, and all-in sustaining costs of $1,270 per ounce sold. However, free cash flow in the second quarter was negative $63 million, mainly due to the lower gold production and sales in the first half of the year, increased metal inventories, annual royalty payments and mine standby costs. As George mentioned earlier, we are revising our 2022 consolidated cost guidance ranges, with cash operating costs expected to be $700 to $750 per ounce sold, total operating costs in the range of $790 to $840 per ounce sold, and all-in sustaining costs between $1,180 to $1,280 per ounce sold. Now moving to operating results, we produced 113,462 ounces of gold in the second quarter, with cash operating costs of $789 per ounce sold. Starting in T\u00c3\u00bcrkiye, Kisladag production in the second quarter was 27,973 ounces and cash operating costs were $798 per ounce sold. At Efemcukuru, second quarter gold production was 22,793 ounces at cash operating costs of $706 per ounce sold. The second quarter gold production at Lamaque was 46,917 ounces and cash operating costs were $657 per ounce sold.
