    "content": " Within our Cable Product Group, progress here is evidenced by our increased cable revenues in Q3 2022 despite continued supply chain challenges, and we expect continued sequential improvement in revenue in Q4 from the shipment of backlog cable orders and new cable deals. In summary, while the progress is not reflected in our top line GAAP revenue results yet, our strategy of investing heavily in R&D and delivering market-leading innovative products for our customers across all of our product groups in order to help our customers expand their networks and maximize their capabilities positions us well for renewed growth in 2023 and beyond. On Cable Product Group, as I mentioned earlier, there was continued pause in cable spend in 2022 as cable MSOs evaluated future product technical directions remote PHY or remote MACPHY as you may have seen in recent press articles, several of the largest MSOs made the technology directions decisions and are moving forward with RFPs and spending plans for 2023 and beyond. Revenues for the quarter came in at $66.9 million, with Q3 revenues impacted by ongoing supply chain issues as well as some delays, not losses in cable deals, which we expect to close in Q4 or early 2023, breaking down the revenue results across product lines. We actually believe this positive cable momentum is going to continue into Q4 and further into 2023 for the reasons Jerry cited, including some recent decisions by some major cable MSOs on their technical direction, which should serve us really well and growth in our sales pipeline for cable deals, the vast majority of which are with our large global cable customer installed base, which are inherently lower risk deals than new logo pipeline opportunities."
