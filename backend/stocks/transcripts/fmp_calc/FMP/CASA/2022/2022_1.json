    "content": " And in terms of financial implication, the deal comes with a multi-year potential, $140 million TCV commercial agreement, which includes $20 million of committed cash payments in 2022 for purchase orders we received last week, which we will be building in Q2, 2022, and we expect that with the continued industry shift to a cloud-based strategy and Verizon's endorsement of our 5G enterprise small cell and security gateway tech through this partnership, we'll not only create additional revenue streams with new and existing customers, but we'll also accelerate Casa's multi-year transformation strategy outlined during Investor Day last November. While we do believe there is an opportunity to achieve our earlier annual revenue guidance, likely at the low end of our previously guided range, there are simply too many uncertainties and elevated risks at this time as we've just outlined for you today; the supply chain impacts, anomalous tax provisions, timing of revenue recognition on other future cloud-native software deals in our pipeline given these have increased complexity within these deals."
