However, excluding Rosneft and our other Russian businesses from both base years and future periods, we continue to expect to sustain EBIDA from resilient hydrocarbons around 2021 levels through 2025, aim to hold around this level through 2030 at constant real price assumptions and expect to deliver a 7% to 9% EBIDA per share CAGR between 2H19/1H20 and 2025 at $50 to $60 per barrel 2020 real. The first place inside the portfolio, you see inflation is generally the lower 48, and that's what BPX is seeing probably around 10% inflation after mitigation on CapEx, somewhere between 5% to 8% inflation across a broad range of services and cost. And we're able to optimize the refining slate and last inside bioenergy, where we've got big plans to expand across five plants around the world, and those are in the engineering design phase, and we're looking forward to our first investment decisions in the next 12 months."
