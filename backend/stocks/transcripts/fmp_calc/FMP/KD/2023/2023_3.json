    "content": " In the quarter, we generated revenue of $4.3 billion, which represents a 2% increase in constant currency from our Pro Forma results a year ago, led by 19% growth in Kyndryl Consult and increased seasonal factors this year, including amounts related to customer contracts with minimum annual revenue commitments and seasonal variances in volumes. As you can tell, I hope from our prepared remarks as well as from the Q&A, we've made an enormous amount of progress in a relatively short period of time, both with the 3A initiative as well as what we've talked about as well in -- for the last year, the plus-plus, which is getting our consulting business to grow much, much faster, which is being successful and focusing, obviously, on expense management as we retool how we do our work and put contemporary systems and contemporary tools in place."
