    "content": " We're also innovating and experimenting together to drive productivity and improve the overall customer experience even further, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re currently testing cross-company BOPUS where purchases made on Sephora's website, sephora.com, can be picked up at Kohl's stores, creating an incredibly seamless and convenient experience for our customers. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. I also think relative to some of the inflationary pressures, one of the things we're seeing broadly about women's is this desire to have more of the basics or staples and things they can get a lot of -- use out of and flexibility as opposed to those fashion pieces. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. We can make those investments and really continue to have an unwavering conviction around our strategy going forward, hence, why we're building out the 850 doors, because yes, Sephora is a cornerstone to that, but it's also about the entire transformation and how we're elevating merchandising and how we're moving things around the store and refreshing the stores. So, I would say we are still planning to open 100 stores over the next several years, but it will be paced and I think more of a ramp-up towards those latter years versus in the beginning part as we kind of learn more on how to merchandise them, putting it to Kohl's store, which is going to look very different than any store that we've opened much more locally relevant. Your line is open. Your line is open."
