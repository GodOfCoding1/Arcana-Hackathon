    "content": " The first 200 stores with Sephora at Kohl\u2019s comped positively overall in Q1, up low single-digits, driven by both Sephora sales as well as incremental basket growth with categories such as women\u2019s, accessories and active. And as we look to the balance of the year, we expect progressive improvement driven by key initiatives, such as the opening of 400 additional Sephora stores and enhancing the Kohl\u2019s Rewards earn rate to 7.5% for Kohl\u2019s cardholders. Your line is now open. And like I said, it\u2019s beauty, but it\u2019s everything Sephora, but it\u2019s everything around that total store where you\u2019re getting the lift to the entire store and it\u2019s worth noting as well that in those stores, we continue to see a lot of new customers, 25% of the customers coming into shops Sephora are new, they are younger, they are more diverse. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. Your line is now open."
