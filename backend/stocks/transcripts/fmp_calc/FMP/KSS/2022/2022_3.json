So you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to see that we move that to the front of the store with Sephora, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to see that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to have a great array of product, but really going to see more on our FLX and Tek Gear because of the value orientation of those products, which are going to be much more important during the holiday season."
