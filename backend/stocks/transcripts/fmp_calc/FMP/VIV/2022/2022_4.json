Looking at the cost of services and good short that represent 35% of our OpEx in the quarter, it grew 11% year-over-year, driven by the ongoing transformation of our business mix as revenues coming from the sale of digital solutions and services, handset, and accessories outlays total topline expansion leading to an improve growth profile.
