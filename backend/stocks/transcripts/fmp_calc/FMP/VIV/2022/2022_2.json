    "content": " As you can see on the left hand side of the slide, the revenues coming from the sale of digital B2B services continue to outperform 36% year-over-year to reach R$2.3 billion over the last 12 months led by hit demand for cloud, cybersecurity, and digital solutions. Nonetheless, given our solid operating results, an increase in financial management, we managed to generate R$4.6 billion of cash in the first six months of 2022 increasing 13.9% year-over-year and reinforcing our ability to convert a standard operating performance into cash. Hi, good morning, everyone. So I think it's still early to say what's going to be the revenue synergies impacting, but of course, customers working in for other operators may see here an opportunity to increase their telco expenses, because our valuable proposition is broader than anyone else in the market. Hi, good morning, everyone. So in the next few quarters, we are going to accelerate immigration so there's going to be 100% working, or operating in Vivo network and they are going to be also with the care that we will do for the customer will be as part of the rest of the case, so we will protect the revenues and even though we continue analyzing the activity of customers, this will not have an impact on revenues, could be even on upside because now we will try to integrate and also to upsell and cross sell those customers. As I said before also, we are taking the opportunity to strength our position as the leading infrastructure provider in Brasil in both mobile and fiber and that we believe, as we believed in the past to engage the results today, that we are going to bring more revenues once we continue to differentiate ourselves as a leading value proposition for connectivity plus digital services in our country."
