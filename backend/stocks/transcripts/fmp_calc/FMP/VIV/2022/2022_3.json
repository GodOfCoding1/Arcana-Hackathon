    "content": " Our total access grew 14.6% year-over-year to 112 million subs, of which 57.5 million users in postpaid and $5.3 million in FTTH, contributing for total revenues to increase 10.6% in the quarter as mobile and fixed expanded to the tune of 14.7% and 2.1%, respectively. This performance is being driven by the service we label as Core that already represent 92% of our top line and grew 13.8% year-over-year as we reduced our exposure to non-Core legacy operations and increase the weight of revenues coming from service that have been proving to be essential with a greater lifetime value, the resilience of our business model can only improve. Our accelerated footprint expansion, coupled with the fully converted Vivo total offer that already accounts for 40% of our gross-adds, led our FTTH customer base to expand 22.1% year-over-year to 5.3 million access. Even though we are investing more to guarantee Vivo's present and future commanding position in Brazil, we continue to see our operating cash flow margin trending above 20% of revenues, a level we see as sustainable going forward. So it's positive, it's controlling also downgrade and so we are very optimistic going forward, our ability to increase our share of the expenditure of our customers in Telco technology because we're also selling a lot of services, the digital service that I mentioned before."
