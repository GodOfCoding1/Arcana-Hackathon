    "content": " However, the first 9 months of 2022 achieved an adjusted EBITDA of $97.1 million, which is well above the 2021 numbers of $75 million for the same time period. Now let's discuss the third quarter performance by business segment, beginning with the Transportation segment, which had adjusted EBITDA of $15.1 million compared to $7.6 million in 2021. Once again, the land transportation group provided strong results with adjusted EBITDA of $12.3 million compared to $7.1 million a year ago. We continue to have year-over-year growth in our margin-based lubricants and specialty businesses, which had adjusted EBITDA of $6.4 million compared to $4.9 million a year ago. Next, let's discuss the natural gas liquids segment, which had a slight EBITDA loss of $0.2 million for the quarter compared with a positive adjusted EBITDA of $1.8 million for the same period last year. Lastly, we'll discuss the Sulfur Services segment, which had negative adjusted EBITDA of $4.2 million this quarter compared to a positive $4.9 million last year. On the pure sulfur side, adjusted EBITDA was a negative $1.4 million compared to a positive $2.7 million a year ago caused largely by the massive Tampa sulfur price decline from $350 per ton in the 3Q to $90 per ton in the 4Q. Our total debt at the end of the quarter was $547 million, an increase of $53 million when compared to last quarter. As a result of the third quarter results, coupled with caution around butane blending pricing fundamentals, we have reduced our full year adjusted EBITDA guidance range from $126 million to $135 million, down to between $116 million and $121 million. So the sulfur business generally, we think about that as a $3 million to $3.5 million EBITDA business per quarter."
