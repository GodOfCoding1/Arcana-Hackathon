    "content": " Overall in the second quarter, as I mentioned earlier, our adjusted EBITDA was $38.3 million, compared to adjusted EBITDA of $22.5 million in the second quarter of 2021. For the second quarter, our largest cash flow contributor was our Transportation segment, which had adjusted EBITDA of $14.6 million, compared to $5 million a year ago. Our second largest cash flow generator was our Sulfur Services segment, which had adjusted EBITDA of $13.9 million in the second quarter compared to $8.9 million a year ago. In this segment, our fertilizer business had adjusted EBITDA of $10 million compared to $6.9 million a year ago. Our pure sulfur side of our Sulfur Services segment had adjusted EBITDA of $3.9 million in the second quarter, compared to $2 million a year ago. Our third largest cashflow contributor in the second quarter was our Terminalling and Storage segment, which had adjusted EBITDA of $12.9 million, compared to $10.6 million a year ago. The growth and cashflow came from our margin base package lubricant and grease business, which had adjusted EBITDA of $6.1 million in the second quarter compared to $3.4 million a year ago. Our final business segment to discuss is our Natural Gas Liquids segment, which had adjusted EBITDA of $1.3 million in the second quarter, compared to $1.7 million a year ago. And while those risks remain, with the strength of our second quarter earnings and robust demand for our transportation services, we are increasing our adjusted EBITDA guidance to between $126 million and $135 million. The increase to adjusted EBITDA guidance, along with no change in our capital expenditure projections, results in a full-year forecast of between $53 million and $62 million in distributable cash flow, and between $44 million and $53 million of adjusted free cash flow."
