Joining me today are Bob Chapek, Disney's Chief Executive Officer; and Christine McCarthy, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. As we begin the final year of The Walt Disney Company's first century, I am pleased to share our results for the first quarter of fiscal 2022, starting with the highlights. And our streaming services ended Q1 with 196.4 million total subscriptions after adding 70.4 million in the quarter, including 11.8 million Disney+ subscribers. But first, I want to talk about this unique moment in the history of The Walt Disney Company. In the midst of a global pandemic, fast-changing consumer expectations and a leadership transition, we reimagined our Parks business, substantially increased our investment in content creation and executed a reorganization that will facilitate our ongoing transformation. We have the world's most creative storytelling engine, an unmatched collection of brands and franchises and an ability to tell stories that form deep emotional connections with audiences. We have diverse revenue streams that span business models and industries, but which all are interconnected to create entertainment's most powerful synergy machine. In short, our collection of assets and platforms, creative capabilities in unique place and the cultural zeitgeist give me great confidence that we will continue to define entertainment for the next 100 years. The quality content from our teams was recognized just yesterday with a fantastic 23 Oscar nominations, including 3 of the 5 best animated feature films: Pixar's Luca; Walt Disney Animation's Raya and the Last Dragon; and our newest franchise, Walt Disney Animation's Encanto, which received 3 nominations. As you may have seen earlier today, we announced West Side Story will debut in most Disney+ markets on March 2 and we can't wait for our subscribers to see this incredible film. In Q1, our studios took us deeper into the Marvel Cinematic Universe with Eternals and the Disney+ original series, Hawkeye. And returned us to that galaxy far, far away with another Disney+ original series of Book of Boba Fett. In fact, last year, our general entertainment team produced nearly 1/4 of the industry's best review shows. That includes Abbott Elementary, the first Freshman Broadcast comedy to earn the 100% certified fresh score since ABC's own Modern Family in 2009. However, it's often lost that the depth, breadth and quality of our general entertainment content is also a driving force behind the success of our streaming services. Going forward, integrating more owned general entertainment into our services, especially Disney+, will be a priority. In fact, just today, we added episodes of Grown-ish, Blackish and the Wonder Years to our domestic Disney+ service. Sporting events continue to be the most powerful draw in television accounting for 95 of the 100 most watched live broadcast in 2021, and ESPN once again set the bar this quarter with live games across each of our 4 major U.S. sports, including the revolutionary Monday Night with Peyton and Eli. And I am pleased to announce that we have expanded our agreement with Peyton Manning and its Omaha Productions Company to extend our relationship through the 2024 NFL season, and we'll add alternative presentations for UFC golf and college football events for each of the next 3 years. While multiplatform television and streaming will continue to be the foundation of sports coverage for the immediate future, we believe the opportunity for The Walt Disney Company goes well beyond these channels. In fact, that's what excites us, the opportunity to build a sports machine akin to our franchise flywheel that enables audiences to experience, connect with and become actively engaged with our favorite sporting events, stories, teams and players. Our success at Disney+ this quarter was not the result of any one item, but instead a combination of organic growth and powerful new content, our strategic decision to include the Disney bundle with all Hulu Live subscriptions and new market launches. The remainder of this fiscal year will feature compelling Disney+ originals from across our brands and franchises, beginning with Pixar's Turning Red and Marvel Studios Moon Night in March. And the back half of FY '22 will feature a truly stunning array of content, including 2 Star Wars series: Andor, and the highly anticipated Obi-Wan Kenobi, which I am excited to announce will premiere on May 25. We'll debut 2 Marvel series, Ms. Marvel and She-Hulk; fresh new shorts from Disney Animation and Pixar, featuring the worlds of Big Hero 6 and Cars; a live-action reimagining of the Disney Classic Pinocchio, starring Tom Hanks as Geppetto; and one of the most anticipated sequels in some time, especially in the Chapek household, Hocus Pocus 2. As I've said before, we continue to manage our services for the long term and maintain confidence in our guidance of 230 million to 260 million total paid Disney+ subscribers globally by the end of fiscal 2024. However, I want to reiterate that we continue to see value in the moviegoing experience, especially for big franchise blockbusters. This quarter, audience has proved us right, as Encanto became a phenomenon within days of its arrival on Disney+ after families continued reluctance to return to theaters resulted in a muted theatrical performance. With outstanding music from Lin-Manuel Miranda, it became the fastest titled across 200 million hours viewed on Disney+ and took social media by storm. The sound track, which debuted at #197 on the Billboard 200 Chart reached #1 shortly after debuting on Disney+ and 8 of the film songs hit the Hot 100 Chart, including We Don't Talk About Bruno, which became the first Disney song to reach #1 since Aladdin\u2019s Whole New World in 1993. At the same time, sales of Encanto merchandise defied traditional post-holiday declines and actually increased following the film's release on Disney+ on Christmas Eve and guests at Disney California Adventure have loved seeing Mirabel in real life. We are more confident than ever in this platform as a content service, a franchise engine and as a venue for the next generation of Disney storytelling. Finally, I could not be more pleased with the performance of our Parks, Experiences and Products segment, which posted its second best quarter of all time. Over the last several years, we've transformed the guest experience by investing in new storytelling and ground-breaking technology and the records at our domestic parks are the direct result of this investment. From new franchise-based lands and attractions to craveable food and beverage offerings, the must-have character merchandise, there is more great Disney storytelling infused into every aspect of a visit to our parks than ever before. While demand was strong throughout the quarter at both domestic sites, our reservation system enabled us to strategically manage attendance. As we return to a more normalized environment, we look forward to more fully capitalizing on the extraordinary demand for our parks along with the already realized yield benefits that took shape this quarter. I am personally looking forward to Star Wars: Galactic Star Cruiser at Walt Disney World, a 2-night adventure into the most immersive Star Wars story ever created. Later this summer, we will debut an innovative new rollercoaster at EPCOT, Guardians of the Galaxy: Cosmic Rewind and Open Avengers Campus at Disneyland Paris, where the iconic Quinjet landed a few weeks ago ahead of the resort's 30th anniversary celebrations. I want to close by thanking our 195,000 employees for bringing Disney magic to audiences and guests around the world, especially in times like these, when the world needs it most. Our company is truly extraordinary, and I am honored to work with the most talented team in the industry to create the next generation of Disney stories and experiences through our focus on storytelling excellence, innovation and our audience. Excluding certain items, diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $1.06, an increase of $0.74 from the prior year quarter. At Parks, Experiences and Products, operating income was up $2.6 billion year-over-year as all of our parks and resorts around the world were open for the entirety of the fiscal first quarter. In the prior year quarter, Walt Disney World Resort and Shanghai Disney Resort were open for the entire quarter, while Hong Kong Disneyland Resort and Disneyland Paris were each open for a limited number of weeks and Disneyland Resort was closed for the entire quarter. At our domestic parks, we were very pleased with the strong levels of demand we saw from both Walt Disney World and Disneyland. Overall, attendance trends at our domestic parks continued to strengthen in the quarter with Walt Disney World and Disneyland\u2019s Q1 attendance up double digits versus Q4, in part reflecting holiday seasonality. Per capita spending at our domestic parks was up more than 40% versus fiscal first quarter 2019 driven by a more favorable guest and ticket mix, higher food, beverage and merchandise spending and contributions from Genie+ and Lightning Light. Putting these factors together, our domestic Parks and Resorts delivered Q1 revenue and operating income exceeding pre-pandemic levels, even as we continue managing attendance to responsibly address ongoing COVID considerations. Looking ahead to Q2, our demand pipeline for domestic guests at Walt Disney World and Disneyland remained strong, benefiting from our 50th anniversary celebration at Walt Disney World and new attractions and experiences at both parks. At International Parks, a profitable first quarter reflected improving trends at Disneyland Paris. At Linear Networks, you may recall that we guided to a decrease in operating income of nearly $500 million for Q1 versus the prior year. Operating income of $1.5 billion came in better than expected, primarily driven by our international channels, which I'll discuss in a minute. At our domestic channels, both Broadcasting and Cable operating income decreased in the first quarter versus the prior year. Lower results at Broadcasting were impacted by an adverse comparison to prior year political advertising revenue at our owned television stations, as we noted in the guidance we gave last quarter. At Cable, the year-over-year decrease in operating income reflected higher programming and production costs and increased marketing spend, partially offset by increases in advertising and affiliate revenue. At Direct-to-Consumer, first quarter operating results decreased by $127 million year-over-year, driven by higher losses at Disney+ and ESPN+ partially offset by improved results at Hulu. I'll note that beginning this quarter, we are providing disclosure on our programming and production expenses by service as well as additional detail for Disney+ in our 10-Q. Operating losses at Disney+ increased versus the prior year as growth in subscription revenue was more than offset by higher programming, technology and marketing costs. We ended the quarter with nearly 130 million global paid Disney+ subscribers, reflecting over 11 million net additions from Q4. We added 4.1 million paid domestic Disney+ subscribers, including a benefit of approximately 2 million incremental subscribers from our strategic decision to include Disney+ and ESPN+ as part of a Hulu Live subscription. In international markets, excluding Disney+ Hotstar, we added 5.1 million paid subscribers, primarily driven by growth in Asia Pacific and European markets. I'll note that growth in Asia included the benefit of new market launches in South Korea, Taiwan and Hong Kong in the quarter. Finally, we were able to resume growth in Disney+ Hotstar markets with 2.6 million paid subscriber additions in the quarter. Overall, we are pleased with Disney+ subscriber growth in the quarter and are looking forward to new market launches and a strong content slate later this year. As I've previously shared, we don't anticipate that subscriber growth will necessarily be linear from quarter-to-quarter, and we continue to expect growth in the back half of the fiscal year to exceed growth in the first half. At ESPN+, we ended the first quarter with over 21 million paid subscribers versus 17 million in Q4. And at Hulu, higher subscription revenues versus the prior year were partially offset by higher programming and production costs driven by increased affiliate fees for live TV. Hulu ended the first quarter with 45.3 million paid subscribers, inclusive of 4.3 million subscribers to our Hulu Live digital MVPD service. Results decreased in the first quarter versus the prior year to an operating loss of $98 million, driven by lower theatrical results and higher film impairments, partially offset by improved TV/SVOD results. As I noted last quarter, while theatres have generally reopened, we are still experiencing a prolonged recovery to the theatrical exhibition, particularly for certain genres of films, including non-branded general entertainment and family-focused animation. This dynamic contributed to increased losses in the quarter as we released more titles in Q1 this year versus the prior year, resulting in lower theatrical results. As we look ahead, we would like to give you some context around 2 items that may impact our second quarter results. First, as we continue to increase our investment in content, we expect programming and production costs at DMED to increase versus the prior year, primarily driven by Direct-to-Consumer and Linear Networks. At Direct-to-Consumer, we expect programming and production expenses to increase by approximately $800 million to $1 billion, including programming fees for Hulu Live. At Linear Networks, we expect programming and production expenses to increase by approximately $500 million, reflecting factors including COVID-related timing shifts. Second, at content sales, licensing and other, a difficult Q2 comparison to prior year TV and SVOD program sales is due in part to our strategic decision to hold more of our owned and produced content for our direct-to-consumer services. As a result, we expect operating income to be adversely impacted by more than $200 million versus the prior year quarter. And it's, I guess, interesting to me because it's a narrower service than the international product, which has the Star tile. Because it deliver on your '24 guidance, that's really probably the biggest key is to get that sub base going. So on the Disney+ U.S. side, you mentioned that we're roughly 1/3 penetrated. And I think you've seen just this quarter, we mentioned that today that we're adding in Grown-ish, Black-ish and a few other titles into our service. I think that will be a trend of us taking more general entertainment and moving it over to Disney+ because, as you know, about 50% -- slightly over 50% of our consumer base on Disney+ do not have kids. It's a very broad general service, of course, driven by the Disney brand and driven by families, but what we've seen time and time again is that the elasticity of Disney and its brand is much greater than we might have given it credit. And I think nowhere does this play out more, now getting into the international side of your question, than we see in Europe with the Star brand tile being the sixth brand tile within the Disney+ offering in Europe. The other thing, though, to your question directly on international that's going to drive the international business is the predominance of local content that we are developing in order to appeal to the unique taste of each of those international markets. And by the way, we just created a new organization within our company to shepherd the development of that content so that we can maximize the chance that we get some global hits, if you will, out of some of that local content. And so we're bullish on the future of Disney+, both domestically and internationally, driven by not only additional prevalence of titles within our major franchises, but also general entertainment and specifically in the international territories local content. That's the slate that comes on, I think, over the next 1.5 years, next 1.5 years to 2 years. But we started this initiative about a year ago, and I must say it's actually extraordinary how how great the content is that's being developed in the international territories. As you know, in Europe, it's not a big component for us, but in Latin America, it actually is. And our -- the way that we've gone to market in each territory, one of the differences between how we go to market in Asia versus how we go to market in Latin America versus how we go to market in Europe is a function of sports. And where you see like in Latin America where we've got a very big percentage of our consumers that are subscribing to our services because of sports, it's a bigger component to that. Hotstar was about 40% of your long-term guide and without cricket, getting to that number seems like a little bit tougher to do, just given the popularity of the sport in the country and also the fact that Hotstar has been in the country for a long time as a localized service. So while the IPL obviously, is an important part of the Disney+ Hotstar content offering, it's really one component of a broader portfolio of entertainment and sports. In addition to, obviously, the original content and the library content from Disney, Pixar, Marvel, Star Wars and Nat Geo, our Disney+ Hotstar offering does have a massive collection of local content, and we add over 18,000 hours of original programming every year. So while certainly it's an important component, that local content that we're developing really will mitigate the impact of us if we were not to win the auction on IPL. So an important component, but it's not like we see that business evaporating if we don't get it. Kannan, on your question on the breakeven guidance and on Disney+ content spend. We're not yet at a steady state of content expense for Disney+, but we expect to have made significant progress by fiscal 2023. And then just maybe some color because international visitors really haven't come back, we know they stay longer and spend more. I would say we've been saying this all along through the pandemic, where we have taken measures to really look at the cost base and how we're doing things. And there's been a fundamental shift in some of the operational processes that the parks had used for many, many years and things like the ability to do mobile dining or not having to check in with the human being at a hotel, those kinds of things are all things that add to upside that we have at the parks. And remember, historically, and we always hit this historical boundary of our band of 18% to 22% of our Walt Disney World guests came from outside of the U.S., and they haven\u2019t even yet started to return. So I think there's a lot of things that are boding well, and we saw the performance this quarter of Genie and at the other things like Lightning Lane, but it's not just that. It's also really compelling offerings in food, beverage, merchandise. And it's really great to see not only creativity in our content business, but creativity at our parks as well. Obviously, the last few years, pretty much the entirety of the launch of Disney+ have been plagued by COVID-related production interruptions. But as we've said over the last few earnings calls, that will rectify itself in the second half of this year, we've already reached 1 of our 2 goals. But it's all about content, content, content and we are bullish about our future content going forward, not only in terms of quality, but also in terms of quantity. The only other thing I would add to that is that we are still only less than 2.5 years into this business, and we're learning a lot about what consumers are watching, consumption patterns, repeatability and all of those things will factor into when we look at the -- as Bob mentioned, the price value equation going forward. Certainly, the fourth quarter was already highlighted as a quarter where we're going to see a lot of fresh original programming. We're actually encouraged by what we see in LatAm, especially given the straight of that Live Sports calendar and a growing pipeline of local original productions. And we're also encouraged that we're seeing a dynamic that we also see in the U.S., which is the vast majority of the sign-ups that came this quarter came from the Combo Plus. When we started off in LatAm, just like we did with Disney+, it was a little bit slower, but they always seem to keep -- kind of a catch-up, if you will. That's an important part, particularly in Latin America, that wholesale footprint and new promotional offers that we are testing in the marketplace. And when you're looking at that $33 billion, I think it's also informative to take into account that about 1/3 of that is for sports rights, including the programming and production, but primarily it's the sports right. So if you want to think about the total $33 billion, take out 1/3 for sports and the remainder is for content. Not all on Disney+, some of that's for Hulu as well. And then second, I just want to follow up on the earlier question about capacity at the parks and whether that has expanded through the cycle. So I'm just trying to think about the runway given how strong the per caps have been and we can kind of do the math on how much attendance went down and how much you've reported, it's come back. First of all, we've got really strong domestic demand, as we've said, mitigated a little bit by a lagged return from the international markets. But in terms of sort of the self-management capacity, one of the last things to come back for us in a post-COVID world -- what we hope is a post-COVID world, is actually live entertainment because much of the live entertainment is close proximity. So I suspect that over time, we'll start to regain some of the capacity drop-off that where it's kind of self-imposing on ourselves. The other thing I should say is that, to a certain extent, because people spend such a long time in our parks and resorts, the food and beverage component is actually a pretty big one of those. But at the same time, the 2 areas that have been difficult is hospitality, and right now, we've got 90% of our hotels at Walt Disney World open and we've got all of our hotels at Disneyland open, but also sort of cooks, I think kind of short order cooks. But the second one is live entertainment, and we're working towards restoring both of those so that we can get up to something that would be more similar to what we've seen in the past in terms of the number of people we put into our parks. And I think guaranteeing our guests that they have a great experience no matter when they come, whether it be the Christmas holiday or whether it be in the middle of the month of September, that's really important to us. But at the same time, we know we firmly got some headroom, whether it's due to international or whether it's due to an expansion and reinstatement of things like live entertainment. And as you think about sports betting and the metaverse, it just seems like strategically, that's going to become potentially a more important piece of your core competency going forward. You want to call it metaverse, you want to call it the blending of the physical and digital experiences, which I think Disney should excel at for all the reasons that you said in your opening. We realize that it's going to be less of a passive type experience where you just have playback whether it's a sporting event or whether it's an entertainment offering and more of an interactive lean forward, actively engaged type experience. Let me also remind you that certain statements on this call, including financial estimates or statements about our plans, expectations, beliefs or business prospects and other statements that are not historical in nature may constitute forward-looking statements under the securities laws. Forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, and actual results may differ materially from the results expressed or implied in light of a variety of factors, including factors contained in our annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and in our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission."
