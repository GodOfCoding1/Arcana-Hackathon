    "content": " The second quarter results that we reported this morning reflect continued improvement we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re making in returning the company to earnings growth, as we see continued acceleration in the recovery at Strayer University, significant demand strength across all of U.S. higher education and continued strong growth within our Education Technology and Services segment. During the second quarter, we had year-over-year improvements in both core success and student retention, and we forecast that Strayer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s total enrollment should be growing on a year-over-year basis by the end of this year, which would be roughly one full year faster than we had originally anticipated. Employer Solutions, which services our nearly 1,000 corporate partnerships in the United States grew total employer-affiliated enrollments by 10%, and the mix of students from employers grew 410 basis points from last year and is approximately 25% of U.S. Higher Education total enrollments. Sophia Learning, our direct-to-consumer platform of ACE recommended high-quality general education courses grew their average total subscribers 50% from last year and their revenues 55%, reflecting the partial benefit of a price increase that was introduced in the quarter. And then the demand environment for U.S. Higher Ed strengthened significantly in the last couple of months relative to maybe the first quarter or later last year, what would you attribute that change to? I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d say the inflection that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re seeing in the demand environment really started to take hold in the mid to late first quarter, continued all the way through the second quarter, and we haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t seen anything that would suggest that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s abating in the second half of the year."
