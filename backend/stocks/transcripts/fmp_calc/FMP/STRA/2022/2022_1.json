    "content": " Our first quarter results, which we reported this morning included year-over-year declines in revenue, operating income and earnings per share, reflecting the impact of nearly 2 years of declining enrollment at Strayer University. Across all of U.S. higher education, we\u2019ve seen a significant increase in demand and interest into our universities, and we now have enough visibility into the second quarter to reiterate our indicative outlook for this year that we expect new student growth in U.S. Higher Ed for the full year \u2013 sorry, new student growth for the full year in U.S. Higher Ed, and that total enrollment will be down in the mid-single digits for 2022. And finally, on U.S. Higher Ed, the current expense run rate is approximately 8% below its pre-pandemic levels, reflecting savings generated over the past 2 years as a result of various technology and productivity investments, which were all designed to improve our ability to effectively teach much larger cohorts of students without having to add substantial levels of expense. Sophia\u2019s revenue grew 73% from the prior year to $6 million, and Sophia\u2019s operating income was $2.4 million, and its operating margin was 45%, which is down slightly from the prior year, reflecting continued higher investments in product development and marketing. And we are obviously on a trajectory this year to do quite well, given as I said that the first quarter U.S. Higher Ed\u2019s enrollment was down almost 13%."
