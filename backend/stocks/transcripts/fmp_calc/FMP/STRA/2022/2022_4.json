    "content": " Total enrollment across SEI was essentially flat at just under 98,000 students and decreased 80 basis points in US higher education, which is our largest segment reflecting the continued new student growth that we've experienced at both Strayer and Capella University. And while we were disappointed by the year-over-year declines in our full year financial results in 2022 which were primarily driven by the enrollment declines that we had in 2020 and 2021, we have been more than pleased with our current operating performance which will inform 2023's financial performance and beyond. The enrollment recovery at Strayer University continued throughout the year and is on track to have total enrollment growth in the first quarter of 2023, which is again about one full year faster than we originally anticipated. Just one other thing on that Karl, the one thing that's kind of an immediate impact though is the lane of the started classes a couple of weeks that -- although, that doesn't change your full year results, it does change your calendarization and move some of the margin -- the revenue growth and the margin expansion for the latter half of the year."
