    "content": " Our strong first quarter 2020 results, including record profitability and improved operating margins across the business, are a testament to the merits of our strategy and to the team's relentless and outstanding execution of it. Our exceptional performance in the first quarter of 2022 and over the last several quarters has enabled us to continually make smart investments back into the business including our people, our solutions and our technology to advance our vision and adapt to the marketplace, while driving revenue growth. However, thanks to our balanced mix, customer-led strategy, people-centric culture and strong yield management and expertise we are uniquely well positioned to successfully navigate unpredictable market conditions as evidenced by our first quarter results. In total first quarter revenue in ArcBest Asset-Light businesses increased 115% versus the prior year period, reflecting strong demand for logistics services the addition of MoLO and higher events and revenue per event in the FleetNet segment."
