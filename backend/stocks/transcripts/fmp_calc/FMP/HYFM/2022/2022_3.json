    "content": " Excluding certain items largely related to our acquisitions, adjusted gross profit was $7.8 or 10.5% of net sales in the third quarter compared to $33 million or 26.6% in net sales last year. Adjusted SG&A expenses, which adjust for these acquisition related expenses, as well as certain other items impacting comparability was $16.8 million or 22.7% of net sales in the quarter versus 16.9% or 13.6% last year. The decrease in adjusted EBITDA was driven primarily by lower net sales, lower adjusted gross profit margin, as well as the $5.5 million in the inventory and accounts receivable reserves and related charges, for which we did not adjust in our EBITDA calculation. As Bill noted earlier, we generated positive free cash flow for the second quarter in a row and now have generated over $8 million in total free cash flow in the year to date period."
