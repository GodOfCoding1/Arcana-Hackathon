    "content": " So liquidity, yes, I think we mentioned roughly $60 million of liquidity at the end of the year, that's $20 million plus on the balance sheet and cash plus $40 million available on the line. And I think I mentioned earlier 10% of our sales in the quarter were roughly in the lighting category that may not sound like a lot, because back when we IPO, it was probably about 20% of our business but it's actually up from Q3."
