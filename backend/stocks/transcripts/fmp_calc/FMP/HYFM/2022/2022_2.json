    "content": " On this basis adjusted gross profit was $9.1 million or 9.3% in net sales in the second quarter, down from $30.2 million or 22.5% net sales last year. Selling, General and Administrative expenses decreased to $26 million in second quarter \u00e2\u0080\u009822 compared to $27.3 million in the year ago period. Adjusted SG&A expenses which just this acquisition related expense as well as certain other items impacting comparability was $15.9 million, or 16.3% of net sales in the quarter versus $14 million or 10.5% last year. The impact of these reductions is most visible in our adjusted SG&A expense, which has come down 17% from $19.2 million in our fiscal first quarter to approximately $15.9 million in Q2. As a result, reported net loss was $203.3 million or $4.53 per diluted share in the second quarter compared to net income of $2.3 million or $0.05 per diluted share last year. Lastly, adjusted EBITDA decreased to a loss of $6.8 million in the second quarter from a $16.2 million profit in the prior year period. At the end of the quarter, we also had approximately $15.3 million in contingent payments composed of an earn-out on the 2021 Aurora acquisition, which was subsequently paid out last month using cash on hand. We expect total company net sales of approximately $330 million to $347 million, which assumes sales levels similar to those experienced from late second quarter through July continue over the remaining months of the year with some further reduction to account for holiday shortened months in the fourth quarter."
