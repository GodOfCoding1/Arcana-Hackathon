    "content": " As our first quarter is ending today, I can confirm that we are happy with unit sales for the quarter and that we are on track to meet our recently announced guidance of $90 million to $95 million, representing growth of approximately 13% to 19% compared to 2022 revenues. The decrease in selling expenses is largely associated to the decision to exit the European market in 2022 and is somewhat offset by a higher spending to support our commercialization efforts in the U.S. G&A expenses amounted to $4 million in Q4 2022, up from $3.5 million in Q4 2021."
