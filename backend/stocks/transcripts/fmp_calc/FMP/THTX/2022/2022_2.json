    "content": " Consolidated revenues for the 3-month period ended May 31 was $19.3 million compared to $17.8 million for the same quarter a year ago, representing a year-over-year increase of 8.3%. For the second quarter of fiscal 2022, net sales of EGRIFTA SV reached $11.4 million compared to $10.3 million in Q2 of the prior year representing an increase of 10.3% over the second quarter of 2021 due to the combined effect of a higher number of units sold and a higher net selling price. In the second quarter of fiscal '22, Trogarzo net sales amounted to $7.9 million compared to $7.4 million for the same quarter last year, representing an increase of 5.5%. The increase in G&A expenses is largely due to increased overall business activities in 2022 compared to 2021, as well as to key hires in North America to support the implementation and management of our internal field force in the U.S. Net finance costs for the 3 months ended May 31 were $1.6 million compared to $1 million for the comparable period in 2021. Given the increase in revenue and the increased expenses, the impairment of the Trogarzo commercialization rights for the European territory as well as other nonrecurring charges explained earlier, net loss for the quarter amounted to $22.7 million compared to $6.4 million for the same period last year. And the rest of the company, we've had a lot of onetime costs in the first half of setting up the commercial operations, the intramuscular study of Trogarzo will also decelerate in spending because enrollment -- full enrollment has been reached, and we're winding that down."
