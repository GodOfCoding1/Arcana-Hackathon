    "content": " For the third quarter of fiscal 2022, net sales of EGRIFTA SV reached 12.9 million, compared to 11.2 million in Q3 of the prior year, representing an increase of close to 50%, due to the combined effect of a higher number of units sold and a higher net selling price.

And as we've discussed or mentioned before, Paul mentioned that at the beginning, once we see signs of efficacy that could be two responses or more in one tumor type, we would be ready to do an amendment and discuss with the FDA to increase the number of patients and to initiate assignment design Phase II assignment design with an additional 25 patient as an example and after that to move into the pivotal trial."
