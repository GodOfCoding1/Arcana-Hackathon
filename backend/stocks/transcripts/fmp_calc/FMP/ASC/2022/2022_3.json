    "content": " So in terms of the format of today's call, I will discuss highlights for the quarter, market outlook and changes to our capital allocation policy, after which Bart will provide an update on fundamentals and financial performance. Product and chemical tanker markets remain at elevated levels, driving Ardmore 's adjusted earnings to $61.9 million or $1.59 per share for the third quarter, which represents an annualized book ROE of 59%. The dividend payment will be 1/3 of adjusted earnings, so that if the fourth quarter continues at similar levels to what we so far achieved, we estimate a dividend payment of $0.50 a share with an annualized dividend yield of about 15% based on our stock price in recent days. So to sum up, product and chemical tanker rates continue at elevated levels, resulting in very strong operating returns in the fourth quarter earnings of $61.6 million and EPS of $1.59 equated to an annualized book are we at 59% and based on our stock price in recent days, an annualized current earnings yield of about 47%. And I'd just say, it's also a natural extension to the fleet today and the fleet that we trade, where we see our chartering team being able to trade the spectrum of refined products through to chemicals, and switch in and out and see that, that does optimize our results and then when the time is right to layer in additional assets from an M&A perspective or the vessel S&P market will follow the strategy Tony outlined."
