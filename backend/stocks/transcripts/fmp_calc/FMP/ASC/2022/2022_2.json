    "content": " Given our operating leverage and spot exposure, this has translated into record earnings of $29 million or $0.82 a share for the second quarter and an estimated $65 million or $1.75 per share for the third quarter if these rates are sustained. Charter-in expense was $2.3 million for the second quarter and will increase to $5 million in the third quarter, reflecting five ships on time charter-in which includes the charter-back with the three recently sold vessels. Fleet average TCE was $27,800 in the second quarter, with MRs earning $30,500 and chemicals earning $22,000 per day on a capital adjusted basis. And for the third quarter, with 45% of the days booked, the fleet average is $43,300 per day, comprising MR TCE of $46,600 per day and chemical tanker rates of $32,900 per day. Based on a fleet average TCE of $27,500 per day which is approximate to what we reported in the second quarter, this translated to annualized net income of $120 million and EPS of $3.25. And using fleet average rates of $42,000 per day for the third quarter based on the bookings to date, this translates to annualized net income of $265 million or $7.15 per share."
