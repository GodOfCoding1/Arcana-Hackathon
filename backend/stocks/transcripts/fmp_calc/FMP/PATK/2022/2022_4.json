    "content": " Our consolidated net sales for the fourth quarter decreased 17% to $952 million, driven by a 39% decrease in RV revenue and partially offset by a 35% increase in Marine revenue. In our housing business, which is comprised of our MH and industrial end markets, our revenue remained flat at $285 million for the fourth quarter and increased 24% to $1.3 billion for the year. Gross margin in the fourth quarter increased 130 basis points from the fourth quarter of 2021 to 21.1% resulting from the realization of our production efficiency initiatives and synergies, the contribution from our acquisitions and the flexibility of our highly variable cost base in response to the planned production reduction in our RV-focused businesses. Adjusting for the impact of the accounting treatment for our convertible notes effective in 2022, our adjusted diluted net income per share was $1.82 for the fourth quarter, representing a 31% decrease from 2021 and $14.64 for the full-year 2022, representing an increase of 52% over 2021. Craig, this is Andy. Craig, this is Andy. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen."
