    "content": " So, we're pretty confident that right now, it's just given the underwriting quality and as Fahmi says, we\u2019re not pricing to the lower loss rates, and all of the other aspects of the P&L that things will be pretty stable once the stimulus comes on. If there's a technology out there that advances some of the things we just talked about, I think that would be interesting to us, and then returning capital to shareholders is going to be a large component of us getting down to 11.5%. As I mentioned, we kind of stick to the underwriting practices we've had, obviously LTV that's coming better as people are putting in on the deals when we talk about that we feel like the credit quality of our new origination have improved. So that really helps a lot, because we prime, sub-prime and relief, and I think, as the market begins to sort of settle, and production comes back, it's nobody's interest right now to see production start panning out and inventory levels being where they are."
