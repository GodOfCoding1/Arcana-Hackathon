    "content": " We ended 2022 with a fourth quarter revenue growth rate of 27%, which is multiples above the digital advertising industry's single-digit growth rate. As a result of increased customer interest in our expanding brand safety coverage, social measurement revenue growth accelerated from 24% year-over-year in the first half of 2022 to 32% in the second half. DV grew trackable revenue from retail media by 115% year-over-year, thanks to our compelling value proposition for advertisers, who want to ensure their spend can be verified consistently across all media environments, including those managed by the world's largest retailers. Nearly 60% of ABS's 2022 revenue growth was driven by new logo wins and upsells to existing customers while approximately 40% was driven by existing ABS customers using the product more, including leveraging ABS in a larger number of international markets. With spend on social platforms expected to comprise approximately 60% of digital ad budget ex-search in 2023, our social measurement revenue continues to have a long runway for growth.
