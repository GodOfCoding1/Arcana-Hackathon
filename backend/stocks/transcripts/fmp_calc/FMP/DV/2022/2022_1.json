    "content": " Building on the solid organic growth we achieved in the full year 2021, we delivered nearly $97 million of revenue in Q1 2022, representing 43% year-over-year growth and the biggest first quarter in the history of the Company. We remain excited about the opportunity to innovate new products on high-growth social platforms like TikTok and to extend our industry-leading Brand Safety and Suitability verification solutions to Meta's feed, which remains one of the largest generators of ad impressions across social media. With regards to social, DV's measurement volume growth was particularly strong in the first quarter of 2021, driven by two of the world's largest CPG advertisers activating and expanding their geographic usage of our social solution."
