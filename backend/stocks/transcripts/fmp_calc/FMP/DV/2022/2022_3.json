    "content": " Our CTV measurement volumes have continued to grow rapidly this year, delivering 53% year-over-year growth through September 30th, and with the rising levels of CTV inventory expected to hit the market over the coming quarters, DV is well positioned to continue to take advantage of this trend. Shifting to our continued growth on retail media networks, in the first 9 months of 2022, we grew revenue from these networks by more than 130% year-over-year, with growth spread across all three of our revenue lines, activation, measurement, and supply-side. Advertiser revenue grew 33% in the third quarter, with volumes or MTMs growing 17% and pricing or MTF growing 10% on a year-over-year basis, excluding revenue contribution from OpenSlate, which continues to perform in-line with expectations of $15 million to $18 million of revenue for full year 2022. Shifting to Activation, revenue growth was led by our premium-priced programmatic products, Authentic Brand Suitability and Custom Contextual, which delivered 46% revenue growth and comprised 55% of programmatic Activation revenue compared with 53% in the prior-year period. Shifting to supply-side, which includes platform and publisher customers, revenue grew 57% largely driven by new revenue from major platforms that embed DV\u00e2\u0080\u0099s solutions including OpenSlate, to provide their customers with inventory that meets a standard level of third-party verification."
