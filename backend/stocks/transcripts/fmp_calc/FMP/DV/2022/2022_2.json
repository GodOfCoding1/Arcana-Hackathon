    "content": " I'd like to take a few minutes to discuss our second quarter growth drivers and catalysts for future momentum within the context of DoubleVerify's 3 key differentiators: our rapidly growing scale, our focus on market-defining innovation and the deep level of trust we have built with our customers as an unbiased and independent partner. On a year-over-year basis, second quarter revenue from our 2 premium activation products, Authentic Brand Suitability and Custom Contextual, grew 52% and over 200%, respectively, and combined represented approximately 52% of our programmatic activation revenue. In the first half of 2022, we grew revenue from retail media networks by 160% year-over-year with the growth spread across all 3 revenue lines: activation, measurement and supply side. With regards to social measurement, DV's volume growth was particularly strong in the first half of 2021, driven by 2 of the world's largest CPG advertisers activating and expanding their geographic usage on our social solutions. And the nice part for us, just to be very direct, is that we've got so much diversification across sectors, across different marketplaces and across platforms that even if there's a pullback in one type of spend, whether it's social or premium CTV, our implementation across ROI-driven platforms like programmatic, like mobile and others, I think, puts us in a good position. And look, I think we've got some really nice momentum in the -- with our new solutions we mentioned in the  and certainly around Custom Contextual's growth year-over-year of about 200% off relatively small base but still the kind of growth that we want to see there."
