It seems like the competitive environment has improved some exactly why it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s difficult to say, but I think likely candidates are increases in interest rates, the choppiness in the capital markets we discussed earlier and potentially operators being concerned about future trends in credit due to things like, inflation and potentially declining used car prices.
