    "content": " Our GAAP and adjusted results for the quarter include unit and dollar volumes grew 29.3% and 32.1%, respectively, as compared to the third quarter of 2021; a decrease in forecasted collection rates for loans originated in 2019 through 2022, which decreased forecasted net cash flows from our loan portfolio by $85 million or 0.9%. I mean since we're recognizing revenue on a level yield basis on our adjusted accounting that if loan performance didn't change after Q3, that lower yield would be realized in Q4 and subsequent quarters."
