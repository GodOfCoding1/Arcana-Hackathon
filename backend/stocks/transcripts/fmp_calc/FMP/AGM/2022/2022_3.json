    "content": " The agricultural finance line of business grew $675 million during the third quarter, which is predominantly comprised of growth in the Farm & Ranch segment across multiple products, including AgVantage securities, loan purchases, and long term standby purchase commitments. The overall growth in the wholesale financing space primarily reflects many of our institutional counterparties leveraging our continued access to low cost of funds as they seek to add longer term AgVantage securities to manage their asset liability maturity profile, given the recent increases in interest rates, and the comparative competitiveness of Farmer Mac AgVantage pricing relative to other market and Federal Reserve derived options. Our Corporate AgFinance segment saw net growth of $67.5 million during the third quarter, primarily due to our continued efforts to support loans to larger and more complex agri businesses focused on businesses span the food supply chain, as we say outside the farm gate. We are extremely proud of our third quarter results and believe our performance drives yet another example of dynamic and enduring nature of Farmer Mac's business model, which continues to be well positioned for earnings growth going forward. And one point I'd like to make just before turning it to Zach, is that over the last year you've seen us be much more deliberate in how we break out our segments of our line of business, within Farmer Mac, how we originate underwrite, administer, how we set up credit policies and credited administration for our different lines of business has really become clarified along those segment lines."
