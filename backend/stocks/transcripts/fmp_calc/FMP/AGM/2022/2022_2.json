    "content": " Our rural infrastructure finance line of business grew $193 million during the second quarter or 3%, and this is primarily due to loan purchase product. Developing this capital flow to agriculture producers really exemplifies Farmer Mac's core mission to lower costs for the end borrower and to improve credit availability to rural America, while creating a well-received new investment opportunity for leading institutional investors. Farmer Mac's $1.3 billion of core capital as of June 30, 2022, exceeded our statutory requirement by $506 million or 67%. It's really based on our solid long-term strategic plan that we're executing on, an outstanding and dedicated team here at Farmer Mac, I'm very proud of them, and a proven track record now of very steady, strong financial results as further evidenced by our core earnings this quarter. And then preferred stock, has been an excellent tool for us, especially over the last two years when one, interest rates were pretty low and Farmer Mac's performance was really good, and it was a sought after instrument."
