    "content": " David will discuss our quarterly results in a greater detail momentarily, but I\u2019m pleased to announce our sales for our first quarter of fiscal 2022 were $14.1 million. We believe our cash position will be stronger at the end of our second fiscal quarter, based on our anticipated $5 million in funds from a private placement in which Shaquille O\u2019Neal and our Chairman personally invested, and funds from the warrants exercised during the second quarter."
