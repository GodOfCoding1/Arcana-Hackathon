I don't think I or Michael would be here if we did not believe there was a tremendous opportunity to continue adding new customers, as we've demonstrated we can do even in the challenging macro environment, we increased customer count to 1,319 and also a tremendous opportunity to expand our relationships with those customers, including by driving multiproduct adoption of newer products like Review, Case Builder, Request, and Hold. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Look, I think there are some challenging headwinds in our business, the principal one being the shortfall in large review matters that began in Q2 and continued in Q3, and it's especially challenging from a comp point of view, given that we have such elevated usage in the form of those large review matters for about a year going into Q1 of this year. On the take side that you have to go to someone else's earlier question, the fact that Michael's equivalent at every business is going around department by department and asking people to limit usage and constrain costs, and discover is not immune from that kind of conversation, although as I said in answer to that earlier question, I think we have some compelling reasons by increasing Disco usage actually is the path to controlling legal costs more generally. Your line is open. So we've -- the core of our model here is that we're really good at building these product experiences that lawyers love and when layers love using the Disco platform, they introduce our sellers to their friends and colleagues, both within the same organization and at other organizations and that sort of leveraging of customer satisfaction, coupled with the usage-based business model to power growth. Your line is open."
