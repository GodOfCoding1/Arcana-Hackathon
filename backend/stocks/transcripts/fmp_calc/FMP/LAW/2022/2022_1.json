    "content": " As we've done in prior earnings calls, we enjoy sharing customer anecdotes that demonstrate how the Disco platform is used by clients, how quickly adoption can ramp, and be expanded across our clients to legal organizations and the benefits that our clients see in using Disco. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. So, if you look at what we've done, historically, we started with Ediscovery going really deep on one of the most expensive and problematic parts of the legal process review of millions, tens of millions or even hundreds of millions of documents that are involved in legal disputes, investigations or other kinds of legal matters. Or a customer might come to us initially with an interest in Disco Review, and then find that it's better to use the platform to manage testimony as well as documents, expand to Case Builder and then find that actually, they should manage their whole litigation portfolio in the platform and implement a solution like Hold or Request as an enterprise-wide solution. Your line is open. First of all, Kiwi, just want to start off with some of the work we've done in the space recently, one of the comments that came up with a law firm was the complexities today are so much more difficult than what they were 10 or 15 years ago in the Ediscovery process because of there's so many more data formats today, whether it's Slack or teams or data that might be in a video call or ancillary application -- applications, trying to digest them is difficult. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open."
