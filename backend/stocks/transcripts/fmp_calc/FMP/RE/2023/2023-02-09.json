    "content": " The combined ratio of 87.8% for the quarter represents 4.1 points of improvement over the prior year's quarter, driven by lower CAT losses as well as a continued improvement in attritional loss experience primarily in reinsurance. Group current year loss ratio was 59.6%, a 90 basis point improvement over the prior year's quarter, led primarily by the reinsurance segment, which I'll discuss in more detail in just a moment. Current year loss ratio improved 1.5 points to 58.2%, as we continue to achieve favorable rate and terms, optimize mix and scale various lines as well as shifting the book towards accounts with better risk-adjusted return potential. I mean if you look at the 20% net income ROE that we generated in the fourth quarter, 19% operating ROE, which, again, it's an excellent result, as I mentioned in my opening remarks, particularly in the market environment that we're in right now. So if in 2023, there's a number of, what we would call, frequency CATS the $1 billion, $2 billion events, our expectation is our participation in those events will be lower than they would have been prior to 1/1 '23 because the average attachment point moved up our cedings are going to be retaining more of those losses net into their portfolio, which is where those losses belong. On the one hand, in our primary reinsurance business, our balance sheet reinsurance business, if you will, we're seeing all the phenomenal results that we've talked about plus 50, U.S. property CAT pricing plus 40 international terms and conditions getting better attachment points rising. But if we have a year where you have a couple of large events, but you also have a frequency of smaller CATS, we think our portfolio will perform better now -- meaningfully better now than it would have a year ago and that's because of all the actions we take in the rate all the improvements we've made."
