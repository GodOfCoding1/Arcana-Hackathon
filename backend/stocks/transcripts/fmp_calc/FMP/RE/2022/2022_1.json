    "content": " The combined ratio was 91.4%, a 6.1 point improvement from last year and includes 110 million of pre-tax catastrophe losses net of reinsurance and reinstatement premiums from Australia floods, European storms, and tornadoes in the U.S. Our attritional combined ratio was 86.2%, including an attritional loss ratio of 58.9%, which is a 60 basis point improvement over last year's first quarter. Included in net income and consistent with the 5% reduction in the S&P 500 during the first quarter, Everest experienced $109 million after-tax unrealized loss on our common equity portfolios. We continue to see improvement in the attritional loss ratio across the Group, along with the lower expected CAT low given our emphasis on volatility reduction, and we reconfirm our assumptions for the Group combined ratio in the range of 91% to 93% for the full-year 2022 as well as for 2023 as noted in our strategic plan. Our first quarter 2022 GAAP combined ratio was 91.6%, which includes 4.1 points of CAT losses and no net prior year development. Our attritional loss ratio of 60% was a 70 basis point improvement over the first quarter of 2021, with improvements in both the reinsurance and insurance segments. And we reiterated on our Investor Day last year, which is our number one priority, really is to privilege our underwriting businesses, as we see accretive growth opportunities and everything that we have been sharing with you this quarter and in past quarters, is that journey that we have to continue to expand margins improve the underlying profitability of this company, and you've seen us do that."
