    "content": " We expect second quarter operating income to be in the range of $125 million to $155 million, which is below last year's second quarter results of $203 million with the high end about flat to last year when adjusted for supply chain costs. So if the first quarter sales trends adjusted for stimulus were to continue for the balance of the year, it could challenge our ability to deliver full year operating income that's in line with last year. I think what we were trying to communicate in our guidance, Lorraine, was that first off, we're not stepping back from our goal from the year, a goal to match last year's operating income. First off, from a margin perspective, we would expect that the back half of the year, the margin rate would be slightly better than the prior year versus spring where it's down for all the freight challenges that we've mentioned. So as we move into the back half of the year, we would expect some relief from a freight perspective, but we're also aware that from a raw materials perspective, and what we're trying to focus on from a sustainability aspect in our product, those are going to put some pressures on the margin. There is a portion of that, that certainly will go to the bottom line, and I think you're seeing that in our results, but I also believe that over time, there's a portion of that, that will be reinvested back into the business. and it's a really good nod to the VS&Co-Lab initiative that we announced last week, where, yes, building on the foundation I just talked about of the 3 reasons for partnering, we would anticipate building a pretty significant business there."
