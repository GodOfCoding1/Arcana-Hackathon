From a margin perspective, as Martin mentioned, it's our intention to be -- to get our fair share across the mall and be appropriately aggressive to make sure we're capturing our fair share of traffic, and we're doing everything we can to try to increase conversion on the traffic that's out there. From a category perspective, I think when you kind of look at our promotions that have transpired over the last few weeks and months, those category promotions tend to be a little more focused on apparel, a little more focused maybe in panties but -- and generally, across the store, we want to make sure that we're being appropriately aggressive on not just categories, but also giftable product this time of year, again, to get that basket started and try to build on conversion. Your line is open. Your line is open. What we're really talking about is how do we use that strength in ticket and strengthen margin profile of the business, and if the net AUR needs to change a little bit here in the fourth quarter, to continue to get the kind of conversion that we want and the kind of basket growth that we would like to see and traffic growth we'd like to see, we want to use that strength. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open."
