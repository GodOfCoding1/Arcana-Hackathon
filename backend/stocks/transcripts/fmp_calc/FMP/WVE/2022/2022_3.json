    "content": " To date, we have delivered the first two clinical data updates, including results from our ongoing C9-ALS FTD study showing potent and durable target engagement with WVE-004 and most recently, the first clinical data from our SELECT-HD trial for Huntington's disease, indicating allele selective target engagement with WVE-003. Your line is now open. Just sort of thinking about conceptually speaking, are there any risks in your mind as to what could derail the thesis into DMD, whether it's biology or otherwise, as we translate from preclinical to clinical, just again, given that we've had target engagement for both FTD ALS and the HD data sets. And one moment for our next question. Your line is now open. And one moment for our next question. Your line is now open. And one moment for our next question. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. And one moment for our next question. Your line is now open."
