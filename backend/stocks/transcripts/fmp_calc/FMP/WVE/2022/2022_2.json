    "content": " Back in April of this year, we announced the first data update from our FOCUS-C9 program which demonstrated robust dose related target engagement, confirming translation of our preclinical work into the clinic. And DMD will give us the first opportunity again, to look at preclinical, the clinical translation, as we shared today, based on tissue concentrations and exposure related to DKL mouse model, where we did see a restoration of phenotype that's going to give us an opportunity in muscle biopsies to look at tissue exposure to target engagement. The robust data set across multiple programs, all related to PN that answer key questions related to target engagement and various tissues to speak, CNS versus muscle, as well as being able to look at individual disease indications for cross silencing and splicing. But ultimately, that is why, Salim\u00e2\u0080\u0099s earlier question I think, why the data for SNP3 is going to be interesting, because one of the things that we tend to do is C9, we're going to be looking is primarily cortex, spinal cord, and whether it relates to HD we know that that's cortex and the gray structures like striatum."
