Salaries and benefits were $1.18 million for the quarter, an increase of $200,000 over the second quarter of 2021, largely as a result of 2022 salary increases and associated taxes for existing employees, new hires within the last year and severance costs.

Our operations and research and development expenditures of $147,000 were incurred during the 3 months ended June 30, 2022 compared to $281,000 in the same period of 2021, $134,000  the decrease is primarily attributable to a decrease in operations costs of $61,000 and a decrease in R&D expenses of $73,000.
