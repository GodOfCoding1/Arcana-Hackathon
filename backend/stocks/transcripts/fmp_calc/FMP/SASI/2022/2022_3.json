And finally, attracting a strategic corporate investment partner with clear product, customer, and financial synergies. Our average deal cycle closure time shows continued reduction at 4.4 months, and we've had partner additions that increase the head of plan, bringing the total to six OEMs and hardware partners, Novanta, Additive Industries, DMG, Aconity, amace and SLM Solutions, and four ISV software partners, Materialise, AMFG, Sentient Science, and most recently Dyndrite. Simplify the quality experience from up to 12 disparate software licenses and multiple manual spreadsheets to a single user experience; building strategic partnerships, expanding our partner ecosystem and best ensuring the success of our current customers as they move into production; offering products that are easier to use, less expensive, both for initial and expansion opportunities. And finally, attracting a strategic corporate investment partner with clear product, customer, and financial synergies."
