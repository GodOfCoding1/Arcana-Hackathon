    "content": " I've been at FactSet for just a few months, but in that short time, it's become clear that the Company has been performing really well from accelerating top line growth and strong free cash flow generation to its long history of consistent and growing shareholder returns. I think that's what we reported at the end of last fiscal year, but it's really nice to see the growth rate of that segment of our business, which has been differentiating for FactSet and should be moving forward. Alex, yes, so I think we have got good pricing power and Linda mentioned that Helen did -- she put in a massive amount of work, frankly, in the last two years to sort of rationalize a lot of the SKUs that we had on FactSet."
