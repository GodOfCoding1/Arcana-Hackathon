    "content": " In the third quarter of fiscal 2022, our net sales were $261.4 million compared to net sales of $286.9 million for the third quarter of last year. Gross profit for the fiscal 2022 third quarter was $86.6 million compared to $108 million in the third quarter the prior year which benefited significantly from extraordinary consumer demand, coupled with constrained supply and which really contrasts with the tough macroeconomic environment that we faced in this year's third quarter. As Steve mentioned, although merchandise margins decreased by 132 basis points for the third quarter of fiscal 2022 versus the prior year's record merchandise margins, when compared to the prepandemic 2019 third quarter, merchandise margins increased approximately 300 basis points, in part reflecting the evolution of our pricing and promotional strategy. Overall selling and administrative expense increased $3.1 million in the fiscal 2022 third quarter versus the prior year period, primarily reflecting higher labor costs and other broad-based inflationary impacts, partially offset by lower performance-based incentive accruals. As a percent of net sales, SG&A expense was 29.9% in the fiscal 2022 third quarter versus 25.9% in the 2021 third quarter, reflecting the deleveraging impact of increased expense on a lower sales base."
