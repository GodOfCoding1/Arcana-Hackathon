    "content": " As previously mentioned, our net sales for the fiscal 2022 first quarter were $242 million versus net sales of $272.8 million for the fiscal 2021 first quarter. Overall, selling and administrative expense increased $5.2 million in the fiscal 2022 first quarter versus the prior year period primarily due to broad-based inflation, which particularly impacted employee labor and benefit related expenses. As a percent of net sales, SG&A was 31.1% in the fiscal 2022 first quarter versus 25.7% in the 2021 first quarter, reflecting a combination of higher expenses and lower sales. Turning to the balance sheet, our merchandise inventory at the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2022 increased 18.2% year-over-year reflecting more normalized inventory levels relative to sales, along with higher carryover of winter-related inventory, following unfavorably warm and dry winter weather in the first quarter."
