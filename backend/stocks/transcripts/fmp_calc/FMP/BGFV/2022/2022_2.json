    "content": " Net sales for the fiscal 2022 second quarter were $253.8 million compared to net sales of $326 million for the second quarter of last year. As we previously mentioned our net sales for the fiscal 2022, second quarter were $253.8 million, which represented our highest second quarter sales in the company's history. Overall selling and administrative expense decreased $1.8 million in the fiscal 2022 second quarter versus the prior year period, primarily due to lower performance-based incentive accruals and credit card fees, partially offset by broad-based inflationary impacts, including increased employee labor and benefit-related expenses year-over-year, and to a lesser degree higher advertising expense due in part to the Easter calendar shift. This compares to record second quarter net income of $36.8 million, or $1.63 per diluted share in the second quarter of fiscal 2021. Adjusted EBITDA continues to be very healthy and totaled $17.7 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2022, compared to $52.9 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2021. In the second quarter of fiscal 2022, we repurchased $2.6 million of common stock under our $25 million share repurchase authorization, bringing our year-to-date repurchases to $4.1 million."
