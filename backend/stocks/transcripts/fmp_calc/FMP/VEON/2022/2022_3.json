Supported by increasing penetration of 4G, our data and digital revenues were up 14.9% year-on-year in local currency terms. Our multiplay subscribers who are users of at least one of our digital services, on top of being a 4G data and voice customer, have increased 25% year-on-year and reached $33 million. Focusing on growth of specific digital services, JazzCash expanded its monthly active user base by 20% year-on-year, reaching 16.7 million. Growth of data and digital revenue was 25.3% for the third quarter, driven by higher use of digital applications, and an increase in the number of multiplay users.

Similar to the nine months results, we saw strong local currency performance in revenues, while Group EBITDA year-on-year performance was impacted by a number of extraordinary non-recurring items in the third quarter this year and the third quarter last year, as noted in the Country Performance section of the trading update."
