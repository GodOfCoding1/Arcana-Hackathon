    "content": " We are thrilled to share that total annual recurring revenue or ARR at the end of the first quarter was $139.7 million, representing 27% growth year-over-year, or 31% growth on a constant currency basis and an acceleration for the third quarter in a row. But the leading indicators pipeline discussions with our largest customers, discussions with prospects and they really appreciate the value proposition of Capella and the ability to get the full power and benefit of Couchbase with a more simplified consumption model and we're going to continue to put a lot of wood behind that area as we go forward. We continue to grow that business, we're excited about the results, as well as the leading indicators, but I think another big part of the Sanjit is, customers thinking about the right time for them to move into Capella and when they're making long-term investments there's not a conversation that we're having that doesn't involve a win around Capella migration and moving new applications into it."
