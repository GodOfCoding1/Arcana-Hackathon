    "content": " In addition to strong Capella traction, the number of non-Capella additions was one of the highest we've had since Q4 of fiscal year 2020 and the number of customers spending more than $1 million in ARR with us increased to 32% from 28% last quarter demonstrating the continued success of our land and expand strategy. Your line is now live. Your line is now live. Your line is now live. Your line is now live. As we think about our objectives, which we've talked about for a couple of quarters now, we're very focused on increasing growth, increasing our Capella mix, which we believe is a significant driver for the company while at the same time, improving go-to-market efficiency and providing long-term leverage in our model. Your line is now live. Your line is now live. Your line is now live. Your line is now live. But we're seeing an acceleration of that dynamic with the Capella service because as companies are making the evaluation of going into an enterprise version, the Capella form factor has even better TCO dynamics where they can have better operational spend, better optimize the underlying infrastructure for the database and free up people that would need to manage the database so they can focus on application development. Your line is now live. I think if anything, we've seen customers knowing how important these applications are committing to growth and in some cases, substantial growth over the next, call it, 12 to 18 months, but maybe instead of going with a 3-year deal, they're opting for one a little bit shorter, just in light of what's going on."
