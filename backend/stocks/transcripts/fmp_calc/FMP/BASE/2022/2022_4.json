The first thing that I will tell you is we are excited about the continued momentum that we've seen across the Board on Capella everything from top of funnel dynamics, an increase in web-based traffic 30%-plus year-over-year, more engagement from developers, continued strength and trials, and an increased number of deals along with pipeline. You may proceed with your question. But I think in terms of unlocking the next phase of growth, we continue to be very aggressive as Greg mentioned, in his remarks on investing in Capella, both from a product perspective, where you're going to see us add additional cloud providers, you're going to see us bring mobile into the fold, you're going to see us continue to make that an even better TCO offering for our customers. You may proceed with your question. You may proceed with your question. What we're going to augment that with is what Matt talked about is having these Capella sellers or these Capella overlay, not only to assist that, but to also assist with our outside reps, our enterprise sales reps, and really helping think about selling into not only the existing customer base that we have, which we do think we'll have some of that transition over to Capella, but also about going and acquiring the new logo activity and Capella that we know is out there and we know we're going to try to go after. You may proceed with your question. You may proceed with your question. You may proceed with your question. So, while there's a little bit more pressure in the market today and so the annual cost of existing employees is going up, I would say the majority is really the new additional resources that we're adding to go from the outside reps, the Capella overlay, and even some of the inside teams to kind of continue to grow the business, that's where the majority of the increase lies."
