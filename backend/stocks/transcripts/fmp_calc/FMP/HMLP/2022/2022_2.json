Thank you, Andrea, and good morning ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the H\u00c3\u00b6egh LNG Partners earnings call for the second quarter of 2022. Turning to page five and the highlights, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m pleased to report that the fleet had 100% availability in the quarter. At this special meeting, the holders of the Partnership's common units will vote on the previously announced proposed merger agreement with H\u00c3\u00b6egh LNG, pursuant to which H\u00c3\u00b6egh LNG will acquire the cash, all of the outstanding publicly held common units of the Partnership at a price of $9.25 per common unit. Turning to page eight, we have the key figures for the quarter showing an operating performance which was weaker than in the same quarter 2021, with a segment EBITDA of $31 million in the quarter compared to $34.2 million in the second quarter of 2021. The Limited partners' interest in the net result was $9.2 million, up from a loss of $1.2 million in the same quarter 2021, which was impacted by negative effects from debt issuance cost and tax provisions. Two quarters have marked negative deviations, the second quarter of 2019 and the second quarter of 2021. The deviation in the second quarter of 2021 was primarily caused by a tax provision for previous periods, following the result of a tax audit which we disagreed to and have disputed. The increase is primarily caused by $1.1 million in modification costs for the H\u00c3\u00b6egh Gallant, of which 50% is expected to be reimbursed by H\u00c3\u00b6egh LNG in the second half of 2022. Equity in earnings of joint ventures for the quarter was $4.5 million, an increase from $3.3 million in the same period of 2021. Excluding these derivative items, the equity and earnings of joint ventures would have been $3.7 million this quarter, an increase from $3.2 million for the same period in 2021. Turning to page 11, the balance sheet does not change much since year end 2021, with total liabilities and equity standing at $1 billion at the end of the quarter. The 85 million revolving credit facility from H\u00c3\u00b6egh LNG, which is currently drawn with $24.5 million is now classified as current debts, as it matures on January 1, 2023. With that, I turn to page 16 for a summary, where I would like to highlight the following: 100% availability of the fleet during the quarter, segment EBITDA of $31 million in the quarter, refinancing on the Cape Ann debt facility closed on June 1, 2022, at a special common unit-holders currently planned to take place on September 20, 2022. The holders of the Partnership's common units will vote on the previously announced proposed merger agreement with H\u00c3\u00b6egh LNG, pursuant to which H\u00c3\u00b6egh LNG will acquire for cash, all of the outstanding publicly held common units of the Partnership at the price of $9.25 per common unit."
