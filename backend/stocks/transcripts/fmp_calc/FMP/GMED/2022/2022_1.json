    "content": " Our Trauma business delivered its strongest quarter to date with 61% annual and 28% sequential growth, driven by sales force expansion, strong uptake of our ANTHEM Mini Frag Plating System and double-digit growth in every product family. Our capital business also experienced softness in Q1, reflective of slow development of our robotics pipeline in the early part of the quarter, with many hospitals limiting access and shifting their focus to managing through the uptick in COVID cases, while also managing staffing shortages. Our Q1 musculoskeletal revenue was $217.4 million, growing 2.3% as compared to the prior year quarter, driven primarily by growth in our US Spine business, which was partially offset by lower Japan sales. First quarter US revenue was $196.4 million, growing 1.6% as compared to the first quarter of 2021, driven by growth within US Spine, partially offset by lower INR revenue related to robotic sale. International revenue for the quarter was $34.1 million, essentially flat to the first quarter of 2021, which was driven by my earlier comments around our Japan sales transition and in line with our expectations. SG&A expenses for the first quarter were $100.7 million, or 43.7% of sales compared to $97.9 million or 43.1% of sales in Q1 of 2021. I'm probably not lining up with your calculations on that, because we see very strong growth, continued growth of our sales are Spine, including new product launches, which are going to be fairly strong this year. Good afternoon, and thanks for taking the questions. Good afternoon, and thanks for taking the questions."
