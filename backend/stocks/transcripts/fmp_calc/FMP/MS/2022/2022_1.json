Excluding the impact related to DCP, revenues increased 6% versus the prior year\u2019s first quarter results. So all of these things are important, I think it\u2019s decades in the making rather than just one quarter, and we are really proud of the way that we thought about the continue -- the continuous velocity of all of our resources to make sure that we can better and more efficiently support client flows."
