    "content": " Net sales of $980.8 million, grew 27% and adjusted operating income improved 28% year-over-year, due to continued strong end market demand and effective management of strategic pricing initiatives. Sales of $680.7 million, grew 24% year-over-year, with double-digit sales growth in nearly all product lines, led by considerably higher pricing and strong underlying demand from continued investments in critical infrastructure globally. First quarter operating income of $99 million or 10.1% of sales, grew 28% year-over-year, driven by substantial pricing across the portfolio, leading to higher gross profit margins and improved fixed cost leverage, including SG&A. Operating income increased to $77.5 million or 11.4% of sales as we realized the benefits of pricing across all product lines, notably in transmission, distribution and substation and lighting and transportation which we will refer to as TD&S and L&T, respectively, in future quarters.
