    "content": " Turning to Slide 4 for a review of our quarterly performance you will see that we delivered solid third quarter results as evidenced by a number of records that included record net revenue and adjusted diluted earnings per share as well as the strongest year-on-year organic pricing growth for aggregates, cement and ready-mix in company history. Cement adjusted EBITDA was up $6.2 million or 15.5% relative to the prior year, fueled by top line growth and greater contribution from Green America recycling. Given the strong supply-demand conditions, sound value pricing will be a critical lever in achieving our 40% or better adjusted EBITDA margin goal for our Cement business. Going from 63% adjusted EBITDA generated from materials in 2020 to 69% in year-to-date 2022 and reflects the deliberate efforts to shed low-margin, low-growth downstream businesses while bolstering our aggregates and cement lines. EBITDA margins, however, were aided by G&A cost controls where expenses were lower year-on-year in the third quarter by $7.4 million or roughly 140 basis points as a percentage of net revenue. Our revised expectations for 2022 incorporate the following assumptions: first, foregone EBITDA from all divestitures completed thus far will have a roughly $13.5 million impact on the fourth quarter and approximately $45 million impact for the full year."
