    "content": " Study sites were eager for the trial to resume, and they expressed enthusiasm for continuing to identify and enroll patients to address the considerable unmet need and provide the first high-quality evidence to guide the treatment of refractory status epilepticus. If we are fortunate to see those things with more than 1 candidate, I think that would really give us the luxury about, as an example, using one of our new ganaxolone formulations in epilepsy and pediatric epilepsy and then potentially using a prodrug as an example, which right now, our early data also has a blunted Cmax  what looks to be a very prolonged half-life in other disease states. It's a possibility, but I think it's much lesser or so, whereas with RSC, that's an easier decision given the incidence population and the monthly enrollment numbers being more similar than different, right, where in a TSC study where you're really dealing with a prevalence population as we get our sites up, the numbers should increase pretty nicely. And I think the last piece on the commercial side is, I think you know better than anyone, the Epidiolex 25% delta is kind of the bar in TSC, but I think we'll continue to show really strong durability data in the CDD population that's clearly very important."
