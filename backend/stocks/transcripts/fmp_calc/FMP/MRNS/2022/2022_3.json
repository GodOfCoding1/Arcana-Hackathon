    "content": " During those first nine weeks of launch, we received over 50 CDD prescription enrollment forms, more than 30 of which were for new commercial patients, not previously treated with the ZTALMY, with the remainder encompassing the transition of all U.S., CDD, OLE, and EAP patients to commercial products. In addition to a strong level of new patient enrollment and prescriber activity, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re also encouraged by the early trends we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re seeing from payers with approximately 40% of CDD patients with completed prescription enrollment forms on reimbursed therapy by the end of the third quarter. These totals include non-cash stock based compensation expense of $3.9 million and $11.1 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 respectively as compared to $2.8 million and $10.9 million for the same periods in the prior year. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open."
