    "content": " With significant gross profit and operating margin expansion, we closed out another quarter of strong financial results that reflect the growth of higher margin business, our disciplined approach to short-term growth investments, as well as our focus on leveraging our scale to deliver cost dilution on COGS, Sales & Marketing and G&A expense lines. One moment for our next question. I think what we see in the third quarter is just the natural evolution of an advertising business where that there is very strong demand for despite the macro backdrop given where we play along the conversion funnel and as we continue to invest resources and roll out the tools that came out towards the end of the quarter but also new tools that we have, we continue to think that there is a lot of upside from our advertising solutions to come in the future. One moment for our next question. Thank you very much. One moment for our next question. Thank you very much. One moment for our next question. Thank you very much. Thank you very much.
