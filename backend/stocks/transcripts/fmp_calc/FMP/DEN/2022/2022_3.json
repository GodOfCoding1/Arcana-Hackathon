So if you were to look at Nik's team, you would even find capture projects that are not -- what you'd think of as being well within the $85 cost to capture, but they are working to be supplemented by DOE grants or loans that help them get the capital in place to execute those projects. But when I go back to that network effect that I talked about Jacob another aspect of that is that when Nik's team build a pipe in Alabama, for example, well that pipe that was not there before gets close to new emissions sources that maybe on their own could not have economically capture their CO2, but now that there's a pipeline in the neighborhood they can."
