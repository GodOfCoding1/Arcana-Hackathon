These forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties, and assumptions, including, among other things, general economic conditions, political, and business conditions in Brazil and in other markets, where the company is present. The words believes, may, will, estimates, continues and participates, intends, expects and similar words are intended to identify forward-looking statements. Embraer undertakes no obligations to update publicly or revise any forward-looking statements because of new information, future events, or other factors. In-light of those risks and uncertainties, the forward-looking events and circumstances discussed on this conference call might not occur. Participants on today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s conference call are Francisco Gomes Neto, President and CEO; Antonio Carlos Garcia, Chief Financial Officer; Leonardo Shinohara, Director of Investor Relations. And in the Q&A session, we will also participate Arjan Meijer, Commercial Aviation, CEO; Michael Amalfitano, Executive Aviation, CEO; and  Service & Support, CEO. 2022 will be remembered for overcoming several challenges worldwide, such as the Ukraine war, the rising of global inflation, in supply chain constraints. Another main factor in succeeding our plan was the continued focus on business efficiency, which demanded several mitigation measures throughout the year. In 2022, aircraft delivery grew 12.7% and reached the mark of 159 commercial and executive aircraft. Adjusted EBIT and EBITDA margins exceeded the guidance given to the market, reaching 6% and 10%. This Active Aviation presented an outstanding performance in 2022, and in Commercial Aviation, we had several campaigns underway. Later on, I will talk more about the 2022 highlights of each business unit. On the next slide, we will see some important steps in our journey towards a more sustainable aviation. Together with Pratt & Whitney, we have successfully tested an E195-E2 using 100% sustainable aviation fuel. As part of the reducing emission goals in our operations, we anticipate the use of 100% renewable energy in Brazil by 2024. In addition, we signed an agreement with Ra\u00c3\u00adzen from the Shell/Cosan Group to assess the production of sustainable aviation fuels in Brazil, which may contribute to lower emissions across the sector. On the next slide, we will see some highlights of last year's business units. In Commercial Aviation, we delivered 57 aircraft, 19% above the previous year. Another important sale was a E2 jets to Azura, a U.S. Leasing Company. In addition, the Chinese Civil Aviation Authority granted certification for our E-190-E2, opening doors for the E2 family in the relevant Chinese market. Business aviation presented excellent results for another year with a 102 aircraft delivery, a strong demand in the entire product portfolio, and a sustainable sales level. In Commercial Aviation, growth was based on pool program contract renewals, as well as new clients, and in Business Aviation, new clients in the Executive Care program. The Service & Support backlog grew 8%, compared to 2021. Finally, in 2022, we took an important step to consolidate our operations in the Urban Air Mobility, a great business opportunity in the coming years. We completed the EVE spin-off by listing the company on the New York Stock Exchange, ending the year with potential orders for over 2,700 vehicles valued at 8.3 billion. As a result, I'm proud to share our 2022 financial results with you today. Deliveries, we increased the number of aircraft delivered by 12.7%, compared with 2021, even with significant supply chain constraints. Embraer delivered 8 jets in the fourth quarter, of which 30 commercial jets and 50 as active jets thereof 33 light jets and 17 mid-sized jets. In 2022, we produced 61 commercial jets, but delivered 57 with 4 jets post January 2023. For Executive Aviation, we delivered 102 jets reaching the guidance. Firm order backlog ended fourth quarter 2022 at $17.5 billion, 500 million more versus Q4 2021. This is one of the highest quarter backlog since the beginning of the pandemic or 800 million more versus Q4 2019, driven by solid sales activities in Executive Aviation and Service & Support. Net revenues reached around   in the quarter, 44% of the whole year revenue, approximately  , compared to Q4 2021, most driven by higher revenues and Commercial Executives and Service & Support, partially offset by lower revenues in Defense & Security. Revenues reached 4.5 billion in the year, approximately 343 million more, compared to 2021 or a growth of 8% delivering the guidance with revenue well-balanced by business unit. Moving to adjusted EBITDA, but before that, I want to report on gross margin. Q4 2022 reported consolidated gross margin of 19.1%, higher than 15% reported in Q4 2021, due to volume and mix 2%, enterprise efficiencies 1.6% and one-time actions 0.4%. In Q4, 2022, adjusted EBIT were 166 million   adjusted EBITDA margin of 8.3% or 400 basis points above Q4 to 2021, even with some negative impacts from provision and SG&A expenses. In Q4 2022, adjusted EBITDA were 228 million, yielding adjusted EBITDA margin of 11.5% or 323 basis points above Q4 2021. For the year, in 2022, reported consolidated gross margin of 20.1%, higher than 15.7 reported in 2021, due to volume increase 1%, enterprise efficiencies 2%, one-time effects 1.4%. In 2022, adjusted EBIT were 270 million, yielding adjusted EBIT margin of 6% or 200 basis points above 2021. In 2022, adjusted EBITDA were 459 million, yielding adjusted EBITDA margin of 10.1% or 147 basis points above 2021, and also surpassing our guidance. SG&A rose 18%, driven by higher sales campaign and market activities compared to 2021  is still impacted by COVID as well commercial concessions and inflation. In 2022, Embraer invested a total of $176 million in product development and research, mainly in product development, for example, E2 family, P2F, Executive Aviation, and turboprop products. Free cash flow without EVE in Q4 2022 was positive in $584 million, due to a strong concentration of delivery during this quarter. Adjusted net results in 2022 was a profit of 39 million or 0.8% of adjusted net profit margin, trading positively from enterprise efficiency and less interest expenses. Liquidity in the top left of the chart, we finished the quarter with a net debt-to-EBIT without EVE of 950 million or $457 million less than 2021 in-line with our liability management strategy. We reduced gross debt around $824 million, compared to 2021, with a significant reduction in net financial expenses on cash flow, 35 million savings in 2022. The company ended 2022, we faced stronger liquidity of 3.1 billion, including revolving credit facility, due to the outstanding free cash flow and the working capital management. On the debt side, we reprofiled 300 million of debt from 2024 to 2027 and the maturities of our debt give us a comfortable situation on amortization until 2024. We continue to work on increasing duration and improving the financial metrics, at the same time monitoring for a market window to reprofile our 2025 and future maturities. It's important to highlight that Moody's affirmed in February 2023, Embraer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rating at Ba2 and raised the outlook for all ratings from negative to stable. For Commercial Aviation, we forecast 65 to 70 aircrafts, is still limited by supply chain constraints, an increase of at least 14% then delivered in 2022. For Executive Aviation, we forecast 120 to 130 jets, an increase of at least 18% more jets than delivery in 2022. For revenues, between 5.2 billion to 5.7 billion, at least 700 million increase or double-digit growth of around 15% compared what was achieved in 2022. In regards to free cash flow, with the   revenue growth, we do have some challenges on working capital. Therefore, free cash flow guidance is 150 million or better. Thank you very much. First of all, the 2022 financial results show that we are making consistent progress in our journey of shifting the company towards a sustainable growth. As we have said, since 2020, the 2021 and 2022 years would be dedicated to the business recovery after two simultaneous crisis, the pandemic and the end of the Boeing deal. The business turnaround was completed in 2022, and we are ready to start a new growth phase, capturing the company's full potential in the coming years. We still face supply chain challenges this year, but we are optimistic about the company's future in terms of revenue growth and profitability. Regarding revenue growth, several ongoing sales campaigns are progressing very well in Commercial, Business Aviation, and Defense area. For this reason, adding our recognized execution capacity to ongoing sales campaigns and innovation projects, we are very confident in Embraer's sustainable growth. And finally, my thanks to the Embraer team, which overcame all of last year's challenges with outstanding commitment and dedication, always focusing on quality and safety. Typically, right, aircraft don't get certified in a market unless deliveries are imminent. We strongly believe that the 190 and the 195 combination in China is a very strong addition to the local portfolio of the ARJ21, which falls slightly below our segment and the 919, which is the narrow-body, the Chinese industry with  will bring to the market. And the 195-E2 obviously, is a great complement to the narrowbody   China. So, we're very busy about the Chinese market, and we're working with airlines and our team. And I think getting an aircraft that is \u00e2\u0080\u0093 that can complement either a MAX or neo and obviously, on the short-term will be more neos. So, we believe that independent of what's happened to Boeing, it is a great addition to that market. I mean the turboprop was halted, if that's right. Yes, that's a great question, Ron. So, that's definitely a product where we believe there could be a market. On the slightly longer-term, the Energia platform is really something that we're spending a lot of time on. So, a lot of focus on the long-term sustainability agenda and the road map I have for Commercial Aviation. The turboprop will still exist in technology, but more efficient than anything out there, more seats and also 100% SAF capable. It's still concepts, but we're looking very closely at that part of the market as well. And maybe using the opportunity, Ron, while I have the microphone, there was a comment on the introduction about 20-aircraft order by  . That deal was announced early 2022, but was part of the 2021 backlog. It did include the 20 quarters, but the 20 aircraft from the lease company were in the 2021 order book, just to be precise. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Maybe just to up on Ron's question, I guess, you mentioned your active campaign. I think you guys are expecting a stronger book-to-bill in 2022 than what you, kind of wound up with. Very quickly, obviously, we can't comment on individual campaigns, but what I can say is that as Francisco noted on his opening speech, is that we see a lot of appetite for the segments. During the crisis, obviously, the market was very slow, but now post crisis, we see a different market ahead. We see a lot of industrial airlines in being risk averse, looking at different ways to do business. So, there's a lot of appetite in the smaller segment. We really see new airlines interested, but we also see a golden moment ahead of us for current E-Jet operators looking replacement aircraft, so bullish about the future, but hopefully, we can share more information later. Market in Executive Aviation is extremely strong, very robust. Most specifically, obviously, with the Phenom300E and the Prater600 capturing significant market share growth as we look ahead into that backlog. The market remains very robust in terms of demand, obviously managing all the characteristics that you heard from Francisco and Antonio regarding our challenges on the supply side, and we're looking forward to maintain pricing, we are looking forward to a continued robust earnings cash generation for the corporation. For commercial aviation, engines are certainly part of the supply chain challenges ahead of us, but it is included in our guide. Louis, on our end, we're facing the same supply challenges that the entire industry is facing across aerospace. But however, we have phenomenal relationships engaged with our supply chain, especially with the chipset providers, so that we don't see any major disruptions for 2023 or beyond as we continue to manage through those relationships. Thank you very much. I'll \u00e2\u0080\u0093 what I'll say about the book-to-bill for 2023 is that on the U.S. markets on the E-Jets 175-E1, we still see some challenges on the pilot shortage. So, I think that market will be less strong than what we've seen in the previous number of years. We're very bullish about the opportunities, and we hope to have a good performance there on 2023. Hopefully, that's where we end up, but it's a bit early to say. As I mentioned, in 2022, our book-to-bill was consistently in excess of 2:1. In 2023, obviously, we'll see some slight reduction as the marketplace continues to calm to more normal levels. I'll try to be short on that answer, but it's a complex area, but what I would say is that, a change in scope has proven to be very difficult over the last couple of years. It will probably take 1 or 2 more years to restabilize, but we do believe that there's a lot of focus on getting that issue resolved. So, we're still in the tunnel when it comes to pilot training, but we do believe that we will come out and come to a more stabilized scenario in the period ahead of us. I would say around, if I take the turboprop and less legal costs, I would say, something like 1% margin comparing to 2022, which is more or less give us some good visibility to more upside than downside trend for  . So, at one point, the issue was a lot of your commercial deliveries were   to major U.S. airlines with very tight pricing. And then in the biz jet in the executive sector, I think everybody has been talking about stronger pricing, but more recently, some of the U.S. producers have been talking about inflation catching up so that pricing just offsets inflation. On the 175-E1, we tried to get \u00e2\u0080\u0093 to keep the pricing discipline over the last couple of years, and I think we've been fairly successful on that. They are still causing some pricing pressure on the 175-E1, but let's not forget that the price increase in the market needs to find its way into the pricing of aircraft as well. I think we're successful there, but also, we are very aware that we need to bring E2 into the market and build our market share. And on the Executive Aviation side of the business, we have raised prices on all four product segments. So, we're going to continue to push price as long as we can continue to maintain market share and growth to service the demand and customer commitments that we have in the industry. At the moment, when the A220 gets certified, for sure, we will compete in maybe a share of the market, but the E2 and the   are slightly different aircraft in the market. And I believe, as I described earlier, with the commission of the  performance of 190, the cost performance of the 195-E2, which is really stellar, but also the gap to the narrowbodies, we see that the 195 respects a bigger gap to the narrowbody segments, which allows the airlines to put the value difference between those aircrafts even more with the E2 family than with the A220 family. We believe for China, it's a very attractive combination of aircraft. But of course, there will always be markets where we will see competition, but we're confident that the E2 has a good place there. Thank you very much. I mean it's tough to predict, but the information we have is that this process can last a couple of years. And yes, we \u00e2\u0080\u0093 as we will need a partnership there for the military aircraft, this might be combined with Commercial. Yes, we see \u00e2\u0080\u0093 well, like China, we see a great application for the 190 to 195 also in India, the previous E-Jet family struggled to get to the right cost level vis-\u00c3\u00a0-vis the much bigger narrowbodies. Thank you very much. You guys have covered a lot of ground, but I had a few additional follow-ups on the commercial side and the demand outlook there. And then just finally, on the E1 side, I know you have that pilot issue in the U.S., but in the past, you've talked about the replacement opportunity being some 500 aircraft in the next 10 years as a function of aircraft aging. We're having a big number of discussions, some are more advanced, some are less advanced, but I think if you add it up, you're talking about several triple-digit number of E2. So, there's a good number of opportunities out there that we're talking about at the moment. On China, it's a little bit early. Let's not forget that the   has only certified at the end of next year, and China is just opening up. So, we hopefully can specify that a little bit but I think it's too early today. On the E1s, that opportunity that we're talking about, about 500 aircraft, we still see that ahead of us. Obviously, the airlines will be a little bit reluctant at moments to add aircraft if they can't bring the pilots in, but we believe as soon as they see that going to a better place, then that opportunity will come back. So, we believe the 175-E1 short-term we'll have to wait for the opportunities, but longer-term, we definitely believe there's a lot of regional capacity to be replaced or added."
