Revenue reached $929 million in the quarter, down $30 million compared with the same period in the third quarter \u00e2\u0080\u009821 mostly driven by lower revenue in defense and security partially offset by the order business unit. If we exclude our extraordinary items, adjusted EBIT margin would have been around 6.8% or $63 million in the third quarter \u00e2\u0080\u009822. Therefore, regarding to the free cash flow, we continue highly focused on the cash flow discipline and we decided to increase our free cash flow guidance from $50 million to $150 million or better in 2022. The company reduced the quarter finished with a total debt of $3.1 billion or $808 million less year-to-date, in line with our liability management strategy to reduce gross debt and interest expenses. To ensure the company liquidity, Embraer October 2022, a revolving credit facility in line RCF in the amount of $650 million and the renewable of the current loans with the National Bank in Brazil with additional 2 years maturity from $300 million. And if you look back at the last 5 years or so, you generate in the fourth quarter, anywhere between $400 million and $700 million of free cash flow. If you complete the guidance what you are seeing today, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s being much higher than the $150 million, but in the order to not, I would say, give a false information, perfecting to say $150 million, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just a matter to get the aircraft out of burden probably is going to be much better, and you are totally right in comparison to the previous year."
