    "content": " Sales of our cutting edge single-family residential products, which represent the 44% of our first quarter revenues continue to drive our top line growth, increasing by 155% year over year. This was achieved through improved operating leverage driven by structural and sustainable improvements we have made to our vertically integrated platform, through strategic growth investments and automation as well as our higher mix of single family revenues, which carry higher margins with no installation. Importantly, our cash flow generation has allowed us to drive additional value in our business, giving us excess cash to reinvest in growth CapEx in anticipation of future demand while also prepaying 15 million of debt during the quarter. Giving continued growth in adjusted EBITDA, our strong cash flow generation, and debt repayments, we were pleased to see our leverage ratio decrease to a very conservative 0.6 times net debt to adjusted EBITDA at quarter end, down sequentially from 0.8 times at the end of 2021. The step change in our gross margins can be attributed to the structural and sustainable operational improvements related to our automation, the shift in our business strategy to penetrate the higher margin, single family residential end market, and significantly better operating leverage on the business. Our strong record of cash flow generation is a direct result of our increased profitability, better working capital management, reduced interest expenses,, and higher mix of single family revenues, which carry a shorter cash cycle profile."
