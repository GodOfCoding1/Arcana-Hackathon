    "content": " As you know, it's been a frustrating year of extended time lines to opening new Shacks and delayed openings have probably been our biggest headwind to overall sales growth. Suburban same-Shack sales grew 2% year-over-year, lapping a positive 17% comp in the third quarter of 2021 even as we realized strong sales growth in our urban Shacks. Other operating expenses were $34 million or 15.5% of total Shack sales, up from 14.2% in the third quarter of 2021 as we are facing inflationary pressures and aspects needed to operate our in-Shack business includes energy repair and maintenance costs and costs to maintain the dining room.
