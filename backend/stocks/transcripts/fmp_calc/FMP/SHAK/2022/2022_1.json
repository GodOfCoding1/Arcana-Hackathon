    "content": " Total revenue grew 31% year-over-year as we generated over $203 million in total revenue and over $309 million in system-wide sales, with average weekly sales improving through the quarter and in April as traffic has rebounded in both urban and suburban markets to more seasonal patterns. Our first quarter total revenue grew 31% year-over-year to $203.4 million, while Shack sales grew 30.6% to $196.8 million. Our New York City teams executed on the largest sales volume since COVID, and we're seeing similar patterns in other heavy hit urban markets like Las Vegas and Washington, D.C., where same-Shack sales grew by more than 20% in the first quarter. Suburban same-Shack sales grew 4% year-over-year, lapping a positive 20% comp in the first quarter of 2021, even as we realized strong recovery in our urban Shacks. Since this time last year, driven by our own digital investments, more than 60% additional guests have made a first-time purchase in our own digital channels, and we're excited about the positive trends that we are seeing with these new guests. In the first quarter, our food and paper costs were $59.9 million or 30.4% of Shack sales, down 60 basis points quarter-over-quarter as our March price increase helped offset some inflationary pressures. Operating expenses were $30.2 million or 15.4% of total Shack sales, up from 14.9% in the fourth quarter of 2021, driven by sales deleverage and higher delivery commissions due to an increase in our delivery mix. For the second quarter, we are guiding total Shack sales of $227 million to $232 million, same Shack sales to grow low to mid-teens percent year-over-year and six new company-operated Shack openings. I think some of the most encouraging things we're seeing is while suburban is kind of holding where it's been, urban continues to grow, Manhattan specifically up 35% in the first quarter."
