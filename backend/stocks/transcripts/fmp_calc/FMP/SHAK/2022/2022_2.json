    "content": " In the second quarter, we held our digital sales even as in-shack traffic grew more than 20% year-over-year and we retain nearly 80% of the digital sales that we generated during the peak pressures on our dining business in January 2021. In the second quarter, our food and paper costs were $66 million or 29.6% of Shack sales, down from 30.3% in the second quarter of 2021 and down 80 basis points quarter-over-quarter as our March price increase and 38 basis points benefit from credits related to our Biannual Leadership Retreat helped us offset a portion of the low double digit higher costs in our basket. I think it's going to open up new real estate opportunities all over the country for us, could increase our longer term, Tam, and we're really excited about it. So as we look at the number for this year, we're still going to open system wide 60 shacks to 70 shacks this year, that's a big number of restaurants for a company that only has 400 in total today."
