    "content": " Our licensed business performed well in the fourth quarter despite pressures from COVID-related disruptions in China and other regions, and some of that volatility in our China Shacks has subsided in January and we're cautiously optimistic that things can begin to level out towards a more normalized sales environment internationally this year. And let's remember that we opened 22 domestic company-operated Shacks in the fourth quarter, so we're still in the midst of a lot of training and moving team members around to support new openings. In the fourth quarter, we  $364.1 million in system-wide sales and for the full year, we exceeded $1.4 billion, with 436 total Shacks, including 69 new Shacks opened in 2022 in the U.S. and abroad. Fourth quarter Shack-level operating profit was $43.2 million or 18.8% of Shack sales, 240 basis points higher versus last year despite inflationary pressures across our Shack P&L. In the fourth quarter, food and paper costs were $67.9 million or 29.5% of Shack sales, down 140 basis points quarter-over-quarter and down 150 basis points year-over-year, with benefits driven by menu price, offset by high single-digit food and paper inflation. For the first quarter, stronger-than-expected January results and what we're seeing so far in February, this is inclusive of the performance from the recently-opened Shacks, gives us confidence to raise our guidance for Shack sales to $232 million to $237 million and same-Shack sales to grow by high single-digit percent year-over-year. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you very much."
