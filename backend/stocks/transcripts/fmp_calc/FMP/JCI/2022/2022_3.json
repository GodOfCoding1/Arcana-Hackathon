    "content": " Segment margin decreased 400 basis points to 10.7%, a direct result of headwinds from projects booked prior to acceleration of cost 12 to 18 months ago as well as the pace and mix of backlog conversion and lower absorption due to supply chain constraints. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. And so as we said last time and it still holds true today that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re working to sustain this elevated level of output, begin to accelerate the turn of the projects that we have in backlog and be able to have in the first half be significant relative to a growth standpoint because of the price that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s in the backlog that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to turn and then the ability to be able to turn our projects faster to be able to get through that backlog. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. And so I think it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s this focus on our strategy and the value proposition, on the returns that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re getting with the additional content that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re putting into the solution set and then ultimately, building an installed base that enables us to go back and not only have that installed base connected, but then build a suite of solutions, our services \u00e2\u0080\u0093 digital services that we apply to that installed base on a go-forward basis, which makes it really sticky. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. Your line is now open."
