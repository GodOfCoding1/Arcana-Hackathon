    "content": " Segment EBITDA increased 13% versus the prior year, with margins expanding 30 basis points to 12.3%, including a 100 basis point margin headwinds from price/cost and significant operational inefficiencies related to ongoing supply chain disruptions and worsening labor constraints. Orders in North America were up 11% versus the prior year, with high-teens growth in commercial applied, including a significant increase in HVAC equipment orders driven by very strong demand in the datacenter and healthcare verticals. APAC orders were up 5% with continued strength in commercial HVAC driven by a strong rebound within the industrial vertical in China as well as the benefit of a large infrastructure development project currently underway in Japan, which will include a significant deployment of OpenBlue and digitally-enabled services. Turning to the second quarter, we expect continued strong performance with high single-digit organic revenue growth, improved segment EBITDA margin expansion and adjusted EPS of $0.62 to $0.64, which represents a year-over-year increase of 19% to 23%. Your line is open.

Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open."
