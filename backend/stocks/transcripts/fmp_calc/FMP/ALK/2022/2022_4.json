    "content": " More impressively, as Ben mentioned, our full year revenues came in at $9.6 billion, and that's up 10% versus 2019 on 9% less capacity. This resulted in industry-leading full year unit revenues, which were up 21% versus 2019, capping off a strong year of outperformance and demonstrating the leverage of our commercial initiatives, power of our network and a constructive pricing environment. If you look at the industry's guide for this year, I think we're all saying unit revenue is about flat. Can you just help us think about some of the moving pieces on the P&L for this year, underlying your full year CASMex guidance I know you mentioned some elevated training in your prepared remarks, Shane, but anything else we should be thinking about that as go-forward might roll off, that's unique to the fleet transition Alaska. So I think the way the unlock is basically going to start in the second quarter and ramp through the rest of the year, and we should be at close to full run rate as we get through the fourth quarter, dependent upon what we do with the A321 transition because we still have pilots, you've got to transition off of that equipment ultimately. But I think if you take a step back and look at our revenue in general, and you even go back to 2019, our unit revenue guide for the first quarter are right in line with the industry's unit guides. So another follow-up on corporate, I'm afraid, I think you said that you were -- the tech customers of yours are giant corporations and they're eventually going to come back, which I guess it's true, but then we can't be 100% sure of that kind of given the way to do business."
