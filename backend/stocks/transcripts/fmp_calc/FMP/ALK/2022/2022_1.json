    "content": " At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Alaska Air Group's 2022 First Quarter Earnings Release Conference Call. I would now like to turn the call over to Alaska Air Group's Vice President of Finance, Emily Halverson. On today's call, you'll hear updates from Ben, Andrew and Shane. This morning, Air Group reported a first quarter GAAP net loss of $143 million. Excluding special items and mark-to-market fuel hedge adjustments, Air Group reported an adjusted net loss of $167 million. As a reminder, our comments today will include forward-looking statements about future performance, which may differ materially from our actual results. We will also refer to certain non-GAAP measures, such as adjusted earnings and unit costs, excluding fuel. And as usual, we've provided a reconciliation between the most directly comparable GAAP and non-GAAP measures in today's earnings release. Despite a slow start to the year in January and February, March results were very strong. In March, we recorded Air Group's highest ever cash sales, 13% above our prior best month. And for the first time since the pandemic began, March revenues exceeded their 2019 comp. This was driven by strength in both leisure and business demand with leisure currently more than 100% recovered, and business demand now at 70% of 2019. As demand strength has carried into the second quarter and throughout the summer, we issued guidance today indicating that we expect to deliver double-digit percentage increases in both unit revenues and yields versus 2019. Given we expect to deliver profits in Q2 and for the remainder of the year, we are reiterating our full year pretax margin guidance of 6% to 9% for 2022, even with the higher fuel prices we are experiencing today. To provide more context about our expectations, I want to speak to you today about 3 topics: what Air Group is doing well, where we are experiencing challenges, and why our team is optimistic about our future. While scaling capacity back rapidly has proved challenging, I'm proud of all the work being done at the company today. Every day, I ask our people to focus on what we can control, and where we need to do better. But I also want to say thank you to every one of our employees, from leaders to our front line. We are also progressing on many aspects of our long-term strategy extremely well, including our oneworld and West Coast International Alliance partnerships that continue to strengthen and provide more value to our guests and to our results. Our new long-term materially enhanced co-brand agreement with our partner, Bank of America, being recognized as one of the 100 Most Influential Companies by Time Magazine for our climate efforts underscored by our commitment to net-zero by 2040. And as we discussed extensively at Investor Day in late March, positioning Alaska to outperform the industry over the next several years given our cost profile and tangible commercial road map to grow revenue by $400 million. We have hired 2,600 employees to date in 2022 with many of our work groups progressing as we expected against staffing plans. However, throughput in our pilot training department fell short of our plan at the end of the quarter, and our teams are now working to accelerate throughput and to get us back on track for the year. For this reason, coupled with our commitment to accelerate the exit of the Airbus 320 fleet, plus persistent high oil prices, we have reduced our planned capacity growth by a modest amount in the short term, and now expect full year capacity to be flat to down 3% versus 2019. Despite these challenges, I have full confidence that we have a phenomenal future ahead of us because of our people, our culture and our business model. We've reshaped our network over the past few years, seizing profitable flying opportunities as the pandemic shifted the competitive landscape. We are deepening the spokes of our network with efficient, low-risk growth primarily in existing markets. Last month, we announced plans to retire our Q400 aircraft and move our regional operation to a single fleet of modern E175 regional jets. We're leveraging our compelling product, brand and powerful loyalty program to strengthen our performance. Finally, we're delivering on our resilient business model supported by our competitive advantages, including a low-cost, high productivity mindset, operational excellence and a remarkable service and culture of care. On top of this, we have restored our balance sheet to pre-pandemic strength, and continue to focus on our commitment to sustainability. Together, our business model and the initiatives we have undertaken will enhance our ability to produce superior results even in volatile times. As we navigate the remainder of the year, I've asked my team to prioritize 3 critical work streams. First, to pursue our transition to a single mainline fleet by no later than early 2023. Second, to deliver on the $400 million in commercial initiatives we outlined at Investor Day. And third, to return Air Group to operational excellence for our people and guests. It is no small feat that we grew our airline 32% over the same period in 2021, and we have the ability to deliver future growth plans with our commitment to excellence. We will adjust our plans where needed to ensure safety, quality and our long-term success, while also meeting our financial commitments in the near term, including our 6% to 9% pretax margin this year. Today, I'll provide a recap of our Q1 results and trends with a specific focus on March, which is indicative of what we see going forward. This marks continued sequential improvement in our revenues, up 5 points from the fourth quarter of last year. That said, the most exciting aspect of Q1 was just how remarkable the return in demand has been from February. We have now settled into booking levels in line with our capacity, but at very strong yields. January's load factor was 69%, February improved to 75% and March came in at over 85%. This positive progression contributed to our March revenues exceeding 2019 levels by 1.5%, even though capacity was down 8% versus 2019. First, the return in corporate demand. We've continued to see strength in leisure demand, but overall demand has also been buoyed by the return of business travel. And today, we are down just 30% in corporate bookings when compared to 2019. In the first quarter, yield was up 3.5% versus 2019, but March was up 9%. We expect to continue to see yields improve through Q2 as spring break travel hits in full, strong summer bookings maintain their trajectory, and corporate travel continues to recover. Q1 was another strong premium product quarter, but March was exceptional. First-class revenues were up 19%, with paid load up 15 points versus 2019. And for the first time ever, our regional fleet fluids paid first-class load factor on par with mainline with a 22-point improvement from 2019. Additionally, premium class revenues across our network were up 8.6% with paid load up 9.7 points. With the continuation of strong bookings, I'm confident in our Q2 capacity setup and planned return to growth in the back half of the year. In Q2, we expect total revenues to be up 5% to 8% on capacity that will be down 6% to 9% versus 2019, resulting, as Ben said, in double-digit yields, double-digit unit revenues and double-digit pretax margins for the quarter. While I've shared our near-term outlook and what sets us up to produce solid financial results this year, more importantly, Air Group is configured to grow profitably over the longer term, driven by revenue initiatives. As outlined at Investor Day, we have identified $400 million in incremental revenue that will build through 2025, driven by 3 categories: product and loyalty, fleet and network. This represents $195 million, driven primarily by our renewed credit card deal with Bank of America. This new agreement offers a powerful source of continued cash flow growth, and I expect it will remain a resilient revenue source as we continue to grow the airline. Second, fleet accounts for about $70 million of the $400 million, representing the revenue opportunity from up-gauging and incremental premium mix. And with our longer average stage length than all of our major competitors, our increasing premium mix will be well suited for our network as well as our financial performance. Our growth will be highly efficient over the next few years, 90%, which will be driven by frequency, gauge and stage length in existing markets. With the Pacific Northwest restored to 2019 levels of flying and California to be restored by year's end, we have the full breadth of our network back in play. We are focused on lower risk growth, competing where we can win and adding value to our network. Building on our own network, our alliance partnerships exponentially expand our reach and enable seamless global travel for our guests, which in turn only further strengthens the value proposition of our loyalty program. As business and international travel return, we are set to leverage our West Coast hubs as gateways to the rest of the world. This global access for our guests only continues to grow as partners add new and returning service off the West Coast, such as Seattle-Helsinki, Portland-London and San Francisco-Madrid. As Seattle continues to grow as a destination and gateway, we're excited to begin the first phase of our terminal transformation this spring. What I hope you take away and what I am most excited about for the future is that the foundation for profitable growth is in place for Alaska, and we are well positioned to capitalize on the return of travel demand. While losses are not ever the goal, the $167 million adjusted net loss for the quarter was a reasonable result given the Omicron backdrop we operated in. We are, of course, encouraged by our financial performance in the month of March where we turn to profit and by the strength of demand we are seeing this spring and summer. As you heard from both Ben and Andrew, we expect Q2 to perform at double-digit pretax margins and have reiterated our full year margin range of 6% to 9% even with higher oil prices. So while we will be focused on restoring operational excellence and ensuring our teams have the resources they need to do so, I remain excited about our position in the industry and about the initiatives we are executing on to set ourselves up for strong performance over the long term. Our teams have done a solid job delivering absolute costs in line with our plans and targets, and our people have been resilient and consistently delivered care to our guests. However, we have been challenged in stepping up capacity as quickly as we would like to. As Ben mentioned, we've reduced our full year capacity by approximately 3.5 points at the midpoint to flat to down 3% versus 2019. This is primarily driven by staffing that is short of our plan, and simply put, we are going to fix that problem before we kick growth into a higher gear. Our CASMex guidance directly reflects this capacity change, and we now expect full year CASMex to be up 6% to 8%. For the second quarter, CASMex is expected to be up 16% to 19% on capacity down 6% to 9% versus 2019. Also, we expect fuel prices for the second quarter to be between $3.25 and $3.30 per gallon, up 40% from the beginning of the year, inclusive of hedge benefits. At current prices, our hedging program is expected to provide a net benefit of approximately $200 million for the full year. Reflecting on Q1, we were profitable in March and produced first quarter results in line with our guidance. Our nonfuel costs totaled $1.5 billion, inclusive of approximately $35 million in lease return costs and $36 million in incentive pay accruals for our employees. Beginning in Q2, lease return costs will be reflected as special as we accelerate our fleet transition. CASMex was up 17% versus first quarter 2019, coming in slightly better than our latest guide. Our balance sheet and liquidity remained healthy, and we ended the quarter with $3.3 billion in total liquidity, inclusive of on-hand cash and undrawn lines of credit. Our Q1 cash flows from operations were approximately $285 million, driven by the strong booking trends that began in February. We continue to feel comfortable with our liquidity position and our ability to generate positive cash flows on a sustained basis as our business returns to normal, which together will support cash payments for the 55 mainline aircraft deliveries we have scheduled through 2023. For the rest of 2022, our contractual debt repayments are roughly $200 million, with $52 million due in the second quarter. During our Investor Day in late March, we guided full year pretax margins to between 6% and 9%. And with oil prices where they are currently, capacity reductions can drive better margins in the near term even though they pressure near-term unit costs. This year, we have returned our performance-based pay program focus back to the achievement of profitability goals, a shift from the focus on cash flow generation in 2021. This year, 70% of our bonus program will be tied to pretax profitability, while 30% remains linked to other important goals, including ESG, safety and unit costs. We've also built-in goals related to outperforming the industry on pretax margin, which is ultimately what we are focused on achieving over the long term. And over the long term, I believe we have the right structure and business model in place. Our network position has improved coming out of the pandemic, and our growth will be primarily focused in geographies of strength. We have a solid $400 million commercial road map that is already in motion with the recently signed co-brand agreement extension and with the fleet up-gauging, which is underway. And with that, let's go to your questions. I'm thinking about the 1,500-hour rule. Maybe making, I don't know, low-cost government loans available for flight school. Jamie, that's a great question. As you know, that's how you first see the fax open up. It's an interesting question and certainly, there's a few issues hitting the entire industry right now more strongly than the pilot situation. That's an important piece at the very beginning of the pipeline and something that will help not only produce a greater supply of pilots, but help with improving the diversity of the pilot workforce as well. Beyond that, it is something that will take a bit of time, but there's really strong training programs in place at Horizon in Alaska, and we feel comfortable about being able to produce pilots over the next several months and several years. Jamie, we have a pilot development program that -- we have 500 pilots in that program right now that have signed up with some financial assistance. We've teamed up with a school in Hillsboro, Oregon, that's going to train 200 pilots a year for Horizon with pathways. And I think as you're seeing is all airlines are taking destiny in their own hands to create a pipeline into their regional and mainline fleets, but you bring up a great point. And second, just on the premium emphasis at Alaska, 1 question I get from clients is whether you're inadvertently creating a vacuum that ultra low-cost carriers can backfill. Jamie, I couldn't quite catch the first word in there that was quite important to your question. It's -- what's interesting about that is, I think, just to be clear, we're seeing -- obviously, the premium cabin has upgrades in it as well. I think as we grow the fleet, we're seeing demand for the premium cabin to be sure with people paying to get in there. And as we shared on Investor Day, we are very focused on having a cabin that is -- works for our premium flyers, our regular flyers and those who want to be discount fliers. So I think as we up-gauge the fleet, as we grow the fleet, we're going to create more seats, more room. So I think it's a great question, but I think that's why I love our fleet strategy and our product strategy. I think the small, medium business is back to full strength, and they have been for a little bit. Some of the big ones have come back at the end of March and early April, where their traffic was down 80-plus percent. Just in the last week, one of the largest high-tech companies was only down 25%. So I think we're going to be a little lagged on Alaska on the West Coast because of the high tech, as you say, but I see that coming in quite strongly. You're talking about having to hire pilots and there's a huge pilot shortage, and we just heard United talk about their forecast for the industry having to hire 13,000 pilots, and our forecast is somewhere between actually 10,000 and 12,000 for the year. Helane, it's a great question. I think this is -- with the pilot supply issue, I think pilots have a choice, and pilots will have a choice on what they want to fly and where they want to fly, so they have a choice. I think for us, we've always had a brand that's been differentiated in the industry, a brand where people come in, it's -- we're a bigger company, but we still have a small tight culture. And we're based on the West Coast, we fly all across the country. So I can tell you to date, our plan is to hire 600 mainline pilots and a couple of hundred regional pilots. We're on track on the regional side, which is fantastic. On the mainline side, we're halfway through. But it's a huge strain on our training systems, which is one of the issues that we're working through is how do we get pilots through the school house in an efficient manner and get them out on the line. Yes, it does imply a pretty significant upturn in capacity and growth above 2019 in the back half of the year. I don't think we have a strong appetite to, as an example, hire a new pilot onto the Airbus aircraft, have them fly it for 1 month and then put them back into training to transition. So as that comes into the window, we're just going to look to optimize the transition of that fleet off the business and over to the MAX. It's hard to predict what's going to happen in Q4 right now, but that's where we stand. Our hedge program is really consistent with the way we've run our company for 90 years, financially conservative, and frankly, it's auto pilot. As we talked about at Investor Day, buying calls 20% out of the money, 18 months in advance, 10% strips and just continuing to layer them on. As Shane mentioned in his script, we value the 2022 remaining order book at $200 million for a hedging benefit. It's basically 50% at $78 for the remainder of the year, 50% at $71 for the quarter. Oftentimes, when we see these things in the industry, there'll be kind of a heavy weighting in the first part of the agreement, maybe the first quarter or 2 and then it tails off. In terms of the cash, I think the cash you're going to see right away, I think that's something that we saw in the first quarter. The recognition is going to be at a slower pace as you know, a good amount of this gets deferred and recognized over time. So I think through the P&L, you'll see this build throughout the rest of this year and even into next year as we get to start to recognize the cash that we're deferring today. And then I guess just going back to your Investor Day, you were one of the first to really tease out this kind of more constructive revenue outlook for the year, certainly relative to where we were and where the Street was at that time. Duane, I think firstly, corporate business travel. So I think since Investor Day, we've just seen a more sustained and, in fact, increasing strength in the demand as we book in now into summer and later spring break. I think a little bit of both, just to be frank, but they certainly knew our agreement with  as well as our joint contracting with American has opened up a lot of doors for us. But I do believe, and just seeing our fair share, our fair market share of corporate travel, just the reports I just was looking at last week, we're actually seeing a positive movement in our share gap. We've been hearing from a few hotel owners that they're seeing sort of a change in the corporate booking curve, it's shortening pretty dramatically. Just curious kind of, Andrew, what you're seeing on the corporate side, I guess, particularly as maybe some more of these tech-heavy corporates come back on the road. The only sort of color I could give you there is that it just feels like there was this pent-up demand and then there's just been this material, as in 50-point change in booking levels for some of these big guys in the last few weeks. And I think over the -- especially on the tech side, and I think over the next month, I'll have a much better feeling about if there's any other changes going on there, but that's what I see today. Andrew, yes, it's a great question. Andrew, you've known us for a long time. And what I can say, and I've been with the operation a long time is, and I look at it closely, the root cause has essentially been staffing. And not staffing because we weren't hiring people, but staffing because we weren't able to produce the people in time to go execute the schedule. So when I look at the core operation, we are still very process-focused, system-focused, metric-focused, but you got to have the people there. And what happened to us early part of the month is pilots were stuck in the school house, and 60 pilots make it out on the line to go execute the schedule. And again, this Airbus transition is a big strain as well as we exit the Airbus. So we're just putting a little more conservatism into the plan and making sure that what we're known for, what we're recognized for, our customers can count on us, our employees can count on us, just making sure that we operate reliably. Ben, I want to go back to Helane's question just on the pilots. Obviously, there's attrition there, but -- and maybe even retirements and whatnot. This is the first time in my career where what we're hearing is that you can move up to a captain seat fairly quickly for a major carrier, much shorter than historically. Yes, Mike, it's a great question. Look, if you look at what happened in the last 2 years, the industry early outed 10,000 pilots. And so as we're trying to all get back to 2019 levels, you got to backfill that 10,000 taken early out and plus growth. So really pilots have a choice on what equipment they want to fly, where they want to live. And I think the acceleration from right seat to left seat is really quick, especially depending on who you're with. So that's why, like I was mentioning to Helane, we're putting a ton of time and a ton of energy to make sure the pipeline is full. And yes, it's not something that we've historically done because there's always a huge resource of pilots, but now you got to take destiny in your own hands and you have to go to high schools and encourage young kids from diverse backgrounds. Through this bad thing with this pilot shortage, I think it might be a good thing because a lot of airlines are really reaching out to communities where this wasn't a viable option. And now with these financial opportunities, we're tapping into a lot of people who're interested. Like I said, we have 500 people in our pilot development program. And a little bit like I said, you got to take destiny in your own hands. Andrew, when I look at some of the markets that you've been paring back and you highlighted earlier with -- to get sort of -- the operation sort of integrity -- the integrity back to sort of what it was. And I've seen other carriers also pull down a decent amount of Hawaii, and some of it may be taking down one of those flights freeze up, maybe an inordinate amount of resources. Or maybe some of it is just these longer-haul flights, especially ones that are predominantly leisure-focused, become more difficult to justify when fuel prices are $350 plus. You've seen us cut back on some of the LA, Konas and La Huis. I think right now, I don't know for whatever reason, Hawaii's lagged a little bit, just to be frank. And so there's just the accommodations, the rental cars. But I think just as we look at the network, we had to make decisions. I think we felt like a few flights coming out of Hawaii and then we cut across sort of day of week, the Tuesdays, the Wednesdays, the Saturdays. And a little bit more where we're doing a little bit more aggressive growth, we sort of pulled it back. So we've tried to spread this across our network and Hawaii, we felt like a couple of flights coming out would be fine. Andrew, do you think that with international long hauls really starting to come back, especially transatlantic, that Hawaii was kind of that go-to exotic destination. Maybe a year ago after they opened, you saw flood of people go there. Is that -- do you think there's some of that where there's just now displacement on the other, call it, exotic destinations that are now international, but because they've lowered their restrictions, it's just easier to get to. I probably don't have first-hand knowledge to that, except to say that you are very correct that the choice of where folks can vacation now has expanded massively. So I think historically, where Hawaii was sort of the go to. Shane, it seems like maybe Ben is giving you a bit more of a stretch goal here, if I'm hearing it correctly. Because I think the single fleet type return was slated for end of 2023, but maybe pulled to kind of early 2023. But just functionally in the operation, we've got to train 600, 700 Airbus pilots over to the Boeing. And we've got to do that in a way that's as ratable, as possible and doesn't sort of impact the network to a large degree. We know it's going to be a little challenging to get through it, and we'll put a good plan together and I'm sure it will shift around a little bit. We're committed to moving beyond those by the end of 2023, and Nat's actively working that. Savi, so in terms of the lease return costs, you got it right that the special items that we'll be taking going forward will include the acceleration of those lease return costs. So we had previously shared with folks that, that was probably going to be in the range of around $250 million. And of course, as we do less flying on those aircraft, that could impact the amount of cash that we actually incur. So hopefully, that's helpful. And Savi, just a little more color on that is like one of the things we have to work through right now that will impact how we think about capacity going forward is. What I've told the teams, I don't want to train a pilot who we spent 90 days in training only to produce them in September and October to transition them in January. So that's something we're still going to work through, and we'll give you guys more color on that soon. And I think this question was asked a little bit earlier, too. I mean I think it's sort of a middle of the road estimate, Savi. I think I'll get these numbers right, there's 10-ish thousand Airbus hours a month that we fly, give or take. I think we fly 80,000-ish, 75,000 to 80,000 total Airbus hours, just to give you some context around how much Airbus flying is of the total. So there's probably -- we'd like to do the 8,000, 9,000, 10,000 Airbus hours and see that meter down towards 0 as we get to the end of the year. Yes, Savi, just on the -- you mentioned the -- there'll be a little cleanup on the schedule here in the next weekend or so, but the summer capacity is -- you're going to see it through the tape and is going to be pretty solid and scheduled there. And to Shane's point, about 4,000 of the 9,000 Airbus hours is actually the 321. And so we're going to really start that transition, to Shane's point, in the fourth quarter, which is why that's probably the softest part of our capacity guide right now. Andrew, I guess, as you guys have expectations coming off the back of that question to really ramp up flying in the second half of the year. It looks like to get to your guidance, we would take RASM down a little bit from maybe where you are in the second quarter. Not -- on the RASM side, I obviously have pretty much no visibility into the fourth quarter there. But my expectation is as we get surgical and sharp and smart about capacity, I think if anything, it's going to boost our ability to maintain good solid unit revenues into the fourth quarter. I mean I can safely say to you right now, you pretty much see what we're going to be flying this year as far as markets. And as I shared on Investor Day, 90% of all of our growth is going to be in existing markets and pretty much what you see already, the Miamis and such are our new markets for this year. But what -- your observations are correct, especially with the snapback looking at March and April. But the California demand is extremely strong, and we are seeing very, very solid unit revenue performance, especially on the yield side out of California in our current bookings. So if anything, just given we have less capacity there than we do in the Pacific Northwest, I think what I'm seeing right now is a very, very solid recovery out of California. And -- so when I -- the one thing that is kind of outstanding is the pilot contract, there's been a lot of discussion on this call about pilots in general. Like I'm not asking you to negotiate right now, but it seems like it would be front and center in terms of priorities for you. It's an absolute priority for us, Conor. We're focused on getting a deal with our pilots, recognizing their contributions. I was wondering, as an operator, an airline, you could comment or weigh in on the benefits and risks of requiring the MAX 10 to include a new flight crew alerting system. And clearly, safety is first in that whole process and why it's so important. But obviously, that assumes a level of pilot commonality that runs through all of the models. But should that not be the case, it's something we would reassess and obviously, the Dash 9 is a great airplane for us. And I would say that generally, there has not been a massive change in terms of the breakage and experience that we've been having. Separately, though, kind of on the guest front, the #1 priority for the company is to make sure that we're meeting guests where they are and making sure that we're honoring the flight that they want to have with us. So I think over time, if we start to see guests come back and look to redeem some of those tickets, we'll be generous in the way that we handle those things. Mostly, you've been focused on wide-bodies, but we've heard more about aircraft constraints again this earnings season. Understanding even your capacity plans for this year, but if you did get bought out, like maybe that changes the cash costs over the life of the lease and potentially the recognition on your P&L over the rest of this year, realizing that's special out of CASM, that was kind of nested question. Catie, it's a great question. And part of it is they're 2 to 4 years old, Airbus is delayed in delivering new ones. And so as we answered earlier in a question, we're focused on that return plan and Emily's run our numbers to focus on that. And so it can be actually a win-win, certainly for us, and it helps us get the airplane out of our fleet more quickly and maybe not have to do all the return conditions for then the lessor to modify the airplane for the new operator. So there's some gains that are potentially there, and we're working those really hard. And in our prepared remarks, you're starting to see that come back. And so I think as we get beyond this summer and going forward, I think more and more there. I think some of our other comments that we shared on Investor Day is really taking a key city from Alaska flying into another key city of American and connecting beyond that, that continues to work. The vast majority, obviously, of our passengers travel across our own network. But as we get into the Q2, Q3, we're going to have much better visibility on that partner traffic as demand fully returns there. Operator, I think we have time for 1 more question. And if you can talk about fair searches on alaska.com, how are they trending versus 2019? We -- one of the beauties, I suppose, of COVID, but every day, we're looking at bookings and searches and all of those. What I will tell you is that the -- even as the yields are going up, the conversion rates are not going down. And as I've shared earlier, we look every day of what was sold in which month at what yield, and we are seeing across the board out at least the next 4 to 5 months, strength across all of it, all the regions at those high percentages every week. I think on the ULCC, irrespective of what happens in the marketplace, we don't -- the ULCC overlap in our markets has not really changed. I think on the premium seats, we've given no color into the specifics in the second or third quarter other than to say is that -- as I said in the first quarter, we saw revenues for first-class up 19%. But I think as business travel continues to come in, I think there's going to be continued strength in the premium, Kevin. Thanks, everyone, for joining us, and we'll talk to you next quarter."
