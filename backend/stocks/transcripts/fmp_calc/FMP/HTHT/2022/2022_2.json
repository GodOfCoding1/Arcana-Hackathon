    "content": " In terms of the business recovery in the second quarter, its blended RevPAR recovered to 93% of 2019 level, mainly driven by roughly 10% increase in ADR and the trend continues in the third quarter. Excluding DH, hotel turnover of Legacy-Huazhu declined by 19% year-on-year to RMB 10.3 billion in this quarter. Total revenue declined by 5.7 percentage year-on-year to RMB 3.4 billion in Q2, mainly dragged by the 26% -- by the almost 27% of Legacy-Huazhu's revenue decline in Q2 to RMB 2.5 billion. Total revenue from Manachised and Franchised hotels declined by 25% to RMB 945 million, mainly dragged by the decline of Legacy-Huazhu's business but offset by the 100% year-on-year growth of Legacy-DH. Excluding DH, the Legacy-Huazhu operating income in Q2 2022 was RMB 21 million compared to positive income RMB 763 million last year and a negative RMB 416 million a quarter ago. The hotel operating cost for 2022 second quarter was RMB 3 billion, increased by 8.5 million -- 8.5% year-on-year. Our preopening cost increased by 93% year-on-year to RMB 31 million in Q2, mainly due to more limited service, leased and owned hotels under construction during this quarter in China. Our SG&A in Q2 declined by 7.8% year-on-year and 12.7% Q-on-Q to RMB 510 million, driven by the decrease in the Legacy-Huazhu but offset by the increase in Legacy-DH."
