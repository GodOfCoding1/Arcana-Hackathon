    "content": " We have 2,544 hotels in pipeline with lower tier cities contributed roughly 57%, which was also increased by one percentage points compared to the last year. However, given that we are no longer doing the economic software brands since last year, therefore, if we exclude the impact of the economics of the brand hotels, we actually signed up 2,123 new hotels in 2022 compared to 2,477 hotels in the last year. Similar to the new hotel signings for the new openings, if we exclude the economics of the brand hotel, we actually opened 1,236 new hotels in year of 2022, slightly lower than 1,293 hotels in 2021. To answer your second questions in terms of the business growth, so yes I think in the first quarter we are seeing a good business recovery and we are seeing the franchises confidence is coming back a bit, and we are also seeing the investments appetite is improving as well especially post the Chinese New Year."
