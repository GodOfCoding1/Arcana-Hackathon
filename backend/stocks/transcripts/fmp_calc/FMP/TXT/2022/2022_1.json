    "content": " At Textron Systems, revenues were $273 million, down $55 million from last year's first quarter due to lower volume of $59 million, primarily reflecting the impact of the U.S. army's withdrawal from Afghanistan on our fee-for-service in aircraft support contracts. 06:08 Industrial revenues were $838 million up $13 million from last year, primarily due to a favorable impact of $46 million from pricing, principally in the Specialized Vehicles product line, partially offset by lower volume and mix of $24 million, largely in the fuel systems and functional components product line due to the impact of global supply chain shortages on our auto OEM customers."
