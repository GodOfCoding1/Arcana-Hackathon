    "content": " Likewise, in the first 9 months of 2022, AFFO included $4.7 million of deferred rent repayments in our accrued rental income adjustment, without which would have produced AFFO of $2.38 per share for the 9 months of 2022 and that represents a 10.2% increase over the similarly adjusted $2.16 results for 2021. Having said that, we are still optimistic that we will be able to continue to grow per share results next year despite the high bar created by the 9% plus growth in our 2022 results as well as the continuing headwind from the reduction in our cash basis tenant deferred rent repayments, which are scheduled to decline from $9.1 million in 2022 to $3.3 million in 2023 as can be seen on the schedule on Page 13 of today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s press release."
