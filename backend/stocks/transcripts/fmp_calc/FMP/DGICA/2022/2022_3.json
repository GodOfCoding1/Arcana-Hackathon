    "content": "  We are pleased with the successful execution of this strategy during the third quarter of 2022, as premiums in states we have identified for profit improvement have, as planned, declined, while premiums in growth-targeted states increased by more than twice our overall average growth rate while generating loss ratios that were well below our average loss ratio. Net premiums written for the third quarter grew by 4.7% to $206 million, with the growth primarily related to strong retention results, premium rate increases that averaged 10.5% for all lines other than workers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 compensation, and new business writings. In fact, we did not incur significant losses from any single catastrophe event during the third quarter, but the accumulation of claims from smaller events resulted in total weather-related losses of $19.4 million, or 9.4 percentage points on the loss ratio, which was in line with our previous five-year average weather loss ratio impact for the third quarter. We experienced an unprecedented quarterly impact from fire losses in the third quarter, totaling $17.4 million, or 8.4 points on the overall loss ratio, compared to $12.7 million, or 6.5 points on the loss ratio for the prior-year quarter. We continued to experience favorable net development of reserves for losses incurred in prior accident years, totaling $6.2 million, or a 3.0-point reduction in the third quarter loss ratio, compared to $4.3 million, or a 2.2-point reduction in the loss ratio, for the prior-year third quarter. Our Personal Lines statutory combined ratio was 107.8% for the third quarter, compared to 105.2% in the same period last year, driven primarily by higher inflationary impacts on the homeowners core loss ratio. Our personal auto core loss ratio improved slightly from the third quarter of 2021, and we expect the core loss ratios in both major personal lines of business will continue to improve as rate revisions are earned through our book. As far as rate adequacy by line of business goes, we expect that the rate increases we've continued to push across all lines other than the workers' compensation will lead to improved indications in some lines, but loss severity and continuing increase in costs will result in deterioration of indications in other lines, especially in our property and auto physical damage lines."
