    "content": " I did want to call out the commercial auto combined ratio, which is unusually favorable at 89.1%, that's reflecting a low incidence of severe losses and the impact of the favorable reserve development that reduced the loss ratio for that line of business by 15 points, followed with the unreasonable to expect to sustain that combined ratio going forward, we do believe our commercial auto performance will continue to reflect the benefits of earned premium rate increases in the various strategic actions we implemented over the past several years to improve the profitability of that line of business."
