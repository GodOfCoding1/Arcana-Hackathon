    "content": " While large fire losses had a relatively low impact to the loss ratio for the first quarter of 2022, we experienced an elevated volume of fire losses in the second quarter, totaling $13.4 million or 6.6 points on the loss ratio. Speaking of rate, we have successfully achieved nearly twice the rate increases that we achieved in the second quarter of 2021 at high single digits to low double digits across all major lines of business and policy size bands with the exception of workers' compensation where we continue to feel downward pressure from the filed bureau loss cost decreases that we are working hard to mitigate where possible based on our own experience. For fire losses, there was a $1.5 million increase in commercial property fires compared to the prior year quarter, with fire losses representing 5.9 percentage points of our commercial lines loss ratio. While the overall dollar impact of homeowners fires was comparable to the prior year quarter, we had 2 large home fires that exceeded $1.5 million in damages and contributed to a total 7.6 percentage point large fire impact on our personal lines loss ratio. And while our new business production is up significantly over recent prior years, it's now only at a level to allow us to stay the shrinking of our book that we've experienced over the past several years and will allow us the moderate single-digit growth that we need from the Personal Lines business segment overall to complement our Commercial Lines of business. Favorable reserve development for the quarter was split among major lines of business with workers' compensation at $3.6 million, commercial auto at $3.5 million and personal auto at $2.7 million, offset partially by commercial multi-peril and other commercial that had, combined, an adverse development of $2.8 million related to a handful of specific case reserves."
