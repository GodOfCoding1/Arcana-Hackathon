    "content": " The third quarter was our first full quarter of commercial sales of our Portable Neuromodulation Stimulator, or PoNS device, which is indicated in the U.S. for short-term treatment of gait deficit due to mild to moderate symptoms of MS and is to be used in conjunction with a supervised therapeutic exercise program. The sales of PoNS in the U.S. and the $18 million financing completed during the quarter, we believe we have the cash reserves to take us through 2023."
