    "content": " PoNS is both safe and effective and the launch is an important development, not only for the company but also for the over 1 million patients in the U.S. fairly in MS. Before we provide more color on the rollout, I wanted to introduce to you, Dr. Antonella Favit-Van Pelt, MD, PhD, a board certified neurologist and Helius Chief Medical Officer who will go into greater detail about PoNS Therapy. As a first step to ensure this messaging is incorporated across all assets, we are in the process of overhauling our landing page in the U.S. to include among other things specific content on mechanism of action and information on clinical data because MS patients are in general, a vocal active group with strong advocacy online, we\u2019ve expanded our social media and digital presence with targeted ads starting this quarter. One final consideration, referring to the data analysis Fred discussed earlier, it was determined that on an average approximately 128,000 patients treated for MS annually in the U.S. would immediately qualify for PoNS treatment."
