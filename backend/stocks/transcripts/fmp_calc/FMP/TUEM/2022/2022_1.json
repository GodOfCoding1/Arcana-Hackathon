    "content": " As Fred mentioned, we are pleased to have exceeded our plan for sales and adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter despite the continued headwinds we face with respect to gross margin due to the ongoing global supply chain disruption. Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure, was negative $5.7 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2022 compared to negative $6 million for the same period of fiscal 2021. I would like to close our prepared remarks by thanking the entire Tuesday Morning team for their hard work in delivering a solid first quarter, for their efforts in embracing the changes that we're putting into place and for showing a tremendous desire to become a world-class off-price retailer."
