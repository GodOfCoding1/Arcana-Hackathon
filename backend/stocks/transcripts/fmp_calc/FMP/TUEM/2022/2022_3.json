    "content": " In addition, based on negotiating favorable financial terms, we reduced our ABL borrowing rate by approximately 100 basis points, reduction of $5 million on our term loan, received forgiveness on accrued interest for that $5 million and extended our ABL at least through September 2024. Gross margin was $38.9 million, compared to $48.2 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2021. Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure was a loss of $11.9 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2022 compared to a loss of $6.9 million for the same period of fiscal 2021. As we look at the first nine months of fiscal 2022, adjusted EBITDA was negative $8.2 million, compared to negative $12.1 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2021. Turning now to the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with an inventory position of $176.6 million, an increase of 29% compared to Q3 2021. As fiscal quarter end, we had $54.1 million in borrowings outstanding and our line of credit compared to zero borrowings at the end of Q3, 2021. Given this lower Q4 guidance, coupled with our lower than expected Q3 sales, as well as the incremental Q4 markdowns, we now expect a full year adjusted EBITDA loss to be between $26 million and $29 million."
