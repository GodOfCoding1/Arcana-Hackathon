    "content": " This quarter, we had strong growth with market share gains, doubled our profit sequentially, accelerated our net addition of clients and generated strong liquidity with improving adjusted net cash. Moving to Slide 9, our banking active client base increased 33% year-over-year, reaching 561 thousand clients, with deposits from MSMBs more than doubling to R$2.7 billion. Cost of services include upfront costs related to acquisition of new clients and despite strong growth in our client base, this line reduced as a percentage of revenues, both year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter. We expect a total revenue and income above R$2.6 billion, representing a year-over-year growth above 38.8% For MSMB TPV, we expect volumes between R$78 billion and R$79 billion, compared with R$74.7 billion in the third quarter. And if we think about the amount of cash balance we had sit on balance sheet was a little over R$6 billion last quarter, and I think that we had, and we saw a space to keep being conservative and high liquidity levels, but also be a little more efficient in the way we fund the prepayment business."
