    "content": " This quarter, we have reached 693,000 merchants actively using our banking solution, a 41% year-over-year increase with client deposits growing 84% in the same period, reaching R$3.6 billion in the fourth quarter of 2022. For MSMB TPV, we expect volumes between R$77 million and R$78 billion in the first quarter compared with R$63.4 billion in the first quarter of 2022, representing a year-over-year growth between 21.5% and 23.1%. I think and when we look at not only pricing right, which mostly drove our 50 bps take rate year-over-year increase, we'll keep optimizing prices, and of course, trying to improve unit economics, but also having the new solutions, especially banking and in the future credit helping us with take rate.. And I think that the nice -- what we observed that we liked was we were able to increase by 50 bps the take rate, while growing faster than the market in the industry. Regarding your first part of the question of TPV, I think you're right, right, when we say the 14% to 18% growth of OpEx, we have mentioned in our last earnings call that MSMB TPV should grow over \u00e2\u0080\u0093 above 18% right this year."
