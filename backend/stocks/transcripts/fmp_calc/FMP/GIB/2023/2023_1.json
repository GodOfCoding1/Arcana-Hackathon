    "content": " Investments we are making to increase business engineering capacity, enhance and modernize our managed services approach, integrate IP and BPS into our managed services offering and broaden the partner ecosystem have strengthened our overall value proposition, enabling CGI to best address clients' cost savings and digitization objectives. Overall, our team's quality of delivery and proven discipline, guided by the best practices and frameworks in CGI's management foundation, continues to result CGI's EBIT margin placing in the top quartile of our IT services peer group. As highlighted today, CGI's many value propositions across our proven end-to-end portfolio of offerings and our consultants collaborate with clients every day to deliver the right balance of services and solutions to meet their objectives. But also that shift to managed services and the shift to intellectual property deals, you saw that in the pipeline, you'll start to see that flow through some as well because, on the IP, it's not a linear revenue to people like it is on the SI&C side, right, because you've got the IP generating revenue for you in a different way."
