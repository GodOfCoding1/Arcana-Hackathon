    "date": "2022-02-02 15:14:09",
    "content": " I would like to call out a few segments with strong bookings in the quarter; Scandinavia at 117%, U.K. and Australia at 122%, and Finland, Poland and Baltics with a book-to-bill of 353% driven by a new eight year managed services contract signed with the Finnish government, whereby CGI will serve as the largest provider of hybrid IP services to dozens of public sector organizations. Looking ahead, and as indicated during our Investor Day this past November, our cash allocation priority remains the same investing in our business, pursuing accretive acquisitions and buying back our stock with a net debt to capitalization ratio of 27.8% at the end of December, as well as $2.7 billion of cash readily available, and access to more if needed, CGI has a strength and capital resources to support our build and buy profitable growth strategy."
