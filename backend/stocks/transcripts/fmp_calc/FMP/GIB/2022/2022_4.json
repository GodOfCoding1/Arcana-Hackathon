    "content": " Today, I'm pleased to share that we delivered on this plan for the fiscal year, with 12.9% year-over-year EPS accretion on an adjusted basis, 10.5% year-over-year revenue growth on a constant currency basis, and $14 billion of bookings with book-to-bill ratios above 100% for all service offerings led by consulting and systems integration at 118%. We close the year with broad base constant currency revenue growth in all geographic segments and industry sectors, including 22.6% in our Western and Southern Europe geographic segment, 21.5% in Asia-Pacific, 14% in U.S. commercial and state government, and 13.7% in the financial services industry sector, 11% in government and also 11% in healthcare. In applying CGI's disciplined evaluation approach in fiscal 2022, we analyzed an increased number of potential merger opportunities, of which more than 40% included IP-based services. Our strong cash generation and capital allocation during the year enabled us to make a number of accretive investments, $374 million back into our business, including in talent, IP offerings, and new managed services contracts; $659 million in acquisitions for an investment of $572 million net of cash acquired; and $913 million to buy back our stock, which remains an accretive and flexible mechanism to return capital to our shareholders."
