While the fee-for-service models have served IPA's traditional wet-lab services very well, the fiscal benefits of using an in silico discovery workflow, asset ownership retention until certain contractual requirements have been met and the potential backend value of the program make for an incredibly attractive business model available to BioStrand\u00e2\u0080\u0099s technology."
