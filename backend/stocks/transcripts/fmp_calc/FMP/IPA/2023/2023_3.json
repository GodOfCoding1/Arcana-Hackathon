    "content": " Regarding our quarterly financials, IPA's overall project revenue increased by 16.7% compared to the prior year, driven primarily by the growth of the company's proprietary B-cell Select platform and protein manufacturing services. This successful service offering not only confirmed the value and output of BioStrand's in silico immunogenicity testing, but also provides a highly scalable rapid turnaround, powerful and high profit service offering that can be integrated into other IPA programs or offered as a standalone service. This collaboration leverages Libera Bio's multifunctional polymeric nanocapsule or MPN technology, BioStrand's LENSai full suite of integrated intelligence technology, and IPA's wet lab capabilities to develop novel antibodies capable of penetrating the cell membrane and tackling elusive cancer targets. I mean as far as evolution of clients and the types of programs that IPA's run, when I first joined IPA around five years ago revenue generation was primarily through protein manufacturing at the Utrecht site and hybrid DOMA anti-recovery services at the Canadian site, and both of those -- well, particularly the Canadian site was supporting the diagnostic and Canadian academic markets. IPA's LENSai specifically aims to develop drugs faster and help partners target difficult-to-treat conditions, offering a unique value proposition for investors by demonstrating innovation, addressing unmet medical needs and reducing time to market."
