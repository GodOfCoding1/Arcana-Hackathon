    "content": " We generated $293 million of operating profit for the quarter, which was down 21% from the prior year and operating margin was 23.6%. First, the US dollar strengthened significantly over the prior year relative to other major currencies and unfavorably impacted second quarter revenue by approximately $57 million. Gross and operating margins were strong at 66% and 40%, respectively resulting in operating income of $154 million. Gross and operating margins were strong at 72% and 30%, respectively, resulting in operating income of $62 million. Gross and operating margins were 57% and 28% respectively, resulting in operating income of $69 million. Accounts receivable increased sequentially to $699 million while the seasonally stronger second quarter declined year-over-year, relatively in line with our sales decline. During the second quarter of 2022, we generated free cash flow of $5 million, a $115 million decrease from prior quarter, primarily due to lower operating income and increased operating capital needs. We expect gross margin to be approximately 56.7%, which is lower than our previous guidance 57.5%, primarily due to the anticipated full year unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates."
