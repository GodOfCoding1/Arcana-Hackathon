    "content": " Starting with fitness, revenue decreased 18% to $280 million, primarily due to lower sales of the advanced wellness wearables and indoor cycling products. Moving to outdoor, revenue increased 5% to $340 million, driven by growth and adventure watches and InReach devices and services, but partially offset by declines and other product lines. Gross and operating margins were strong at 65% and 36% respectively, resulting in operating income of $121 million InReach remote communication devices and Response Coordination services have been a strong product category and unique differentiator for the outdoor segment. Looking next at Aviation, revenue increased 4% $188 million primarily driven by growth in aftermarket product lines. Looking finally at Auto, revenue decreased 2% to $136 million as declines in consumer product lines more than offset growth in OEM programs. Gross margin was 40% and the operating loss driven by investments in auto OEM programs, narrowed significantly from the prior year to $16 million. During the third quarter of 2022, we generated free cash flow of $104 million, $100 million decrease from the prior quarter, primarily due to lower operating income, increased working capital needs. We expect gross margin to be approximately 57.5%, higher than our previous guidance, 56.7%, primarily due to year-to-date performance, including favorable segment mix and lower costs. Also, we now expect the full year 2022 pro forma effective tax rate to be approximately 8% lower than our previous guidance of 8.5% to projected full year income mix for tax rejection, results in pro forma earnings per share of approximately $4.95."
