    "content": " And to an extent, our new mobility customers accelerate the growth of our higher-margin BIT solution sales, as we continue to see positive signs in the marketplace, as our fourth-quarter solution sales grew by 31% compared to our prior-year fourth quarter. Thus, the full amount of BIT solution previously reported to be projected for the year has been delayed by a quarter -- due to reasons outside of TOMI's control and commissioning to the systems are now slightly delayed. For the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to December 31, 2021, our consolidated net revenue was $8,338,000 compared to $7,754,000, representing an increase of $584,000 or 8%. For the three months ended December 31, 2022, compared to December 31, 2021, our consolidated net revenue was $2,812,000 compared to $2,010,000, representing an increase of $802,000 or 40%."
