    "content": " The 9 months ended September 30, 2022, we have received $7.9 million in sales orders, of which revenue recognition will be upon delivery throughout this year and next. And for the 3 months ended September 30, 2022, we received approximately $2.3 million in sales orders and/or winning contract bids, which represent a 5% growth when compared to the same prior year period. Due to the increase in demand for our mobile SteraMist product, TOMI's revenue increased by 20% over what was reported for the second quarter of this year. Our financial results for the 3 months ended September 30 compared to the same prior year period for 3 months ended September 30 compared to September 30, 2021, our consolidated net revenue was $1,760,000 compared to $2,205,000. Our customer sales order received in the current year is up 25% compared to last year, and our customer sales backlog continues to grow as a result of our customers' time lines, which have an impact on our delivery times and corresponding revenue recognition as well as our deferred revenue, which increased $600,000 during the third quarter. The improved cash flow from operations is primarily due to our lower reportable loss for the 9 months ended September 30, 2022, which has declined 22% when compared to the same prior year period as well as the increase in deferred revenue, which is up $1.1 million in our current calendar year. So with these new generation pieces of equipment and the current need of this type of disinfection, decontamination solution, along with our backlog and pipeline, I think that you're going to see that number percentage going up and you can use the 15%."
