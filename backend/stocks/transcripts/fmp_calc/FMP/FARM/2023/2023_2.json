    "content": " Turning to direct ship and DSD, we saw a low double-digit percentage sales growth in our direct ship business on a year-over-year basis as we began to see pricing realization after a lag period that depressed the first quarter of fiscal 2023 performance. Looking ahead, our focus in the coming quarters remains on completing the final elements of our turnaround, driving process improvements that will result in sustainable higher levels of performance and executing on our exciting growth initiatives, including SHOT and Revive that bring more services and products to customers and leverage our national distribution footprint."
