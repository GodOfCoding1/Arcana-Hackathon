    "content": " Our top line sales for the fiscal year 2022 were up 18% to approximately $470 million, primarily driven by the sales growth we experienced in our DSD and Direct Ship channels throughout the fiscal year. Similarly, on a quarter-over-quarter basis, our net sales grew 20% from the prior year period to $123 million in the fiscal fourth quarter. Net sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 were $123 million, an increase of $20.1 million or almost 20% from the prior year period, driven primarily by continued recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. The increase in gross profit in fiscal 2022 was primarily driven by higher net sales on both the DSD and Direct Ship sales channels, partially offset by higher freight costs due to global supply chain challenges and higher product costs, both direct and indirect. For the fiscal 2022 fourth quarter, gross profit was $34.9 million, an increase of $6.5 million or 23% from the prior year period, and gross margin increased to 28.4% from 27.6%. Operating expenses in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 increased $4.7 million or 13.6% to $39.2 million from $34.5 million in the prior year period, but decreased as a percentage of net sales to 31.9% compared to 33.6% of net sales in the prior year period."
