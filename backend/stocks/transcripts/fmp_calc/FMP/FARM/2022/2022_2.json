    "content": " Our second fiscal quarter was highlighted by another period of meaningful sequential improvement amid the continued recovery of the business, with both gross margin and DSD sales volumes improving sequentially for the sixth consecutive quarter. In terms of the topline for the second fiscal quarter, net sales were up about $10 million sequentially and grew nearly $14 million from the prior year period, representing a 13% increase year-over-year. We ended the quarter with average DSD sales volumes down 17% from pre-COVID levels, compared to down 40% in the prior year period, demonstrating that these businesses and consumers are learning to live with COVID. However, due to the significant recovery in our DSD channel throughout fiscal 2021 and in the past two quarters, our average weekly DSD sales compared to pre-COVID levels, improved from down 40% a year ago to down 17% during our Fiscal Second Quarter. Overall, net sales in the second fiscal quarter increased by $13.9 million year-over-year or 13.3% to $118.4 million compared to $104.6 million in the year-ago period. Our gross margin in the second fiscal quarter was 29.5% compared to 25.1% during the prior year period, representing the highest quarterly gross margins since our December 31, 2018 reported quarter, which was well before any impact of the COVID virus. During the second fiscal quarter, our operating expenses increased by $3.2 million compared to the prior year period, which was mainly due to a $3.3 million increase in selling expense and a reduction of $1.3 million in net gains from the sale of a branch, both of which were partially offset by a $1.2 million lower fixed debt set impairment and a $200,000 decrease in general and administrative expenses. This is due to lower investment capital of $4.9 million for several strategic initiatives completed during fiscal 2021, partially offset by higher maintenance capital spend of $1.2 million compared to the prior year period. The change in our cash position was primarily due to higher cost of goods, increased purchases for our peak season during our second fiscal quarter, and funding of incentive payments during the first fiscal quarter, all of which were slightly offset by cash proceeds from the sale of three branch properties during the six months ended December 31st, 2021, and realized hedging gains. Our net debt, which we define as total outstanding borrowings, less cash and cash equivalents, was $87.4 million at the end of our second fiscal quarter, compared to $80.7 million at fiscal year-end 2021, primarily due to investments made in inventory and incentive plan payments."
