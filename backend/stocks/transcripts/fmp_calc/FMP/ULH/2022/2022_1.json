    "content": " In yesterday's release, Universal reported first quarter earnings of $1.56 per share on total operating revenues of $523.9 million. Looking at our segment performance for the first quarter of 2022 in our Contract Logistics segment, which includes our value-add and dedicated transportation businesses, income from operations increased $6.7 million to $23.5 million on $201.6 million of total operating revenues. This compares to operating income of $5.2 million in the first quarter of 2021, operating margins for the quarter were 7.6% versus 5.5% last year. For the full year of 2022, we are expecting capital expenditures to be in the $90 million to $110 million range with interest expense between $15 million and $18 million based on the current operating environment for the second quarter of 2022, we are expecting top line revenues between 525 million and 550 million and operating margins in the 8% to 10% range. None of them had really put anything on the table to talk about 2023 yet, but there's still -- there's still positive forecast in the second half of 2022, some of the guidance we're giving, we feel pretty comfortable, but I would feel it's pretty hard to shape 2023 yet only thing I can tell you it is we've had a favorable six months of some contract negotiation."
