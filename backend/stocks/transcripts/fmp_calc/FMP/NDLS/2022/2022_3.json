    "content": " Our third quarter revenue of $129.4 million was above the high end of our guidance range, reflecting company comparable restaurant sales of 3.4% and nearly 70% growth and company average unit volumes relative to 2019. Even as our in-restaurant dining continues to increase, digital sales still accounted for nearly 50% of revenue during the third quarter and our rewards program saw an increase in membership to 4.4 million members 16% above prior year. Looking ahead, we anticipate total revenue in the fourth quarter range between $133.5 million and $136.5 million driven by high single digit comparable company revenue restaurant sales, low to mid single digit franchise comparable restaurant sales, and the impact of 2022 fiscal year containing 53 weeks. But when we look at our gap relative to the industry from a three year growth, as well as from a same store perspective, we feel very strongly that first our values resonating as you see with the seven for seven offering second our guest engagement just continues to improve from our rewards program to our digital sales continuing to be a 50% and third just our teams are executing well."
