    "content": " We anticipate the earnings growth trend in Q4 to continue throughout 2023 including a significant reduction in our cost of goods sold line, which given our newly contracted cost should yield cause improvement of roughly 200 basis points are in 2023 relative to last year, equating to approximately $10 million of EBITDA expansion for that line item alone. Our fourth quarter revenue increased 18.9% to $136.5 million compared to last year, driven by strong comparable restaurant sales growth and revenue generated from units open since 2022. We're proud of the progress that we've made in the fourth quarter of 2022, including double-digit company comparable sales 280 basis points of margin expansion, and a $5 million increase in EBITDA year-over-year."
