    "content": " While the first two months of Q1 were impacted by both our historical seasonality, as well as temporary closures due to the Omicron COVID variant, the company quickly regain momentum as we entered March, culminating an average unit volumes for the March fiscal period of $1.35 million, $170,000 above pre COVID 2019 levels. Additionally, as we exit the temporary disruption of COVID, we expect nearly 40% of our restaurants to meet our long term target of $1.5 million of AUV during the second quarter. In terms of the financial highlights, total revenue for the first quarter increased 2.7% to $112.6 million compared to last year, comparable restaurant sales increased 6.4% system wide, comprised of a 5.3% increase at company owned restaurants, and an 11.9% increase at Franchise restaurants. Underlying our revenue growth, our average unit volumes were $1.25 million for the quarter, a 6.8% increase from last year, and a 13.3% increase versus pre COVID levels in 2019. We continue to anticipate 35 new restaurants to open system wide for the full year representing 8% unit growth, with approximately 70% of openings to be company owned and 30% as franchise locations. Your line is now open. And what we've seen is just a continued acceleration throughout Q1 from roughly 11% and 12% or so during the first couple of months, up to 15% during March, and then that's accelerated, as Carl mentioned, to about 18% here in April, even within April, we're seeing continued momentum and that accelerate as well. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. Your line is now open."
