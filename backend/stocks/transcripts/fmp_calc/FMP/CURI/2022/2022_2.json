    "content": " Looking ahead to the third quarter, we expect revenue of $21 million to $23 million and an EBITDA loss of $9 million to $11 million as we continue to focus on improving the company's financial profile. In terms of the second part of your question, I mean, if I look at just Q2 versus Q1, we had revenue growth of just a little shy of $5 million, and our cost of revenues grew a little over $1 million, and we had expanding gross margin over the quarter. Really, I think where there is a lot of benefit is the exercise we went through to think through the business model and the evolution of the business model and how we could create value for shareholders by having a more profitable, more predictable business model by making some changes to the way we went about our business and taking a hard look at the cost structure and the strategic investments we needed to make to create value and to create a -- put the company in an even better position than they were 5 years ago. So it's more kind of an intellectual framework rather than a kind of business synergies, if you will, but I think it's still helpful to kind of go through that analysis and look at the business model here and think through cost structure and all of the strategic partnerships and relationships we have to look forward to see where should we be leaning in and where should we maybe be pulling back a little."
