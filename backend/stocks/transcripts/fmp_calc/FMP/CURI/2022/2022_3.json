In addition, last year's fourth quarter revenue included $2.6 million from the distribution agreement that we elected not to renew this quarter. And so we do think as we go forward, that we do have the ability even at a relatively low level compared to what we spent historically to -- as we move into an era where it's all performance-based marketing spend to continue to build the business on a lower overall market spend next year."
