    "content": " Adjusted gross margin for the Crocs brand was 57.5% or 670 basis points lower to prior year, driven by the impact of inflationary cost pressures of approximately 200 basis points and 270 basis points of higher freight and inventory handling costs, of which we estimate 150 basis points to be transitory. After outperforming in Q3, we are raising our full year 2022 revenue guidance for the Crocs brand to be between $2.605 billion and $2.63 billion, representing constant currency growth of approximately 17%. As we close out the year and look forward, we remain incredibly confident in the strength of the Crocs and HEYDUDE brands and our management team that continues to drive strong growth, profitability and cash flow. I'm assuming that there's kind of more of that coming in Q4, which is why the Crocs brand is expected to have a little bit slower growth in Q4 versus the rest of the year. In terms of kind of commented on sell-in and sell-out kind of through the year, I think we're focused on looking forward and making sure that our inventories are right-sized and that we're managing the brand effectively, both in this country but also across the globe."
