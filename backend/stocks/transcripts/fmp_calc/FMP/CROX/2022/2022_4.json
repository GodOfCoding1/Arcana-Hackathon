    "content": " We're incredibly confident in sandal growth in 2023, given planned newness and a significant increase in marketing allocated to sandals and the strong Crocs brand trajectory in important sandal markets such as India and Southeast Asia. We continue to deliver top-tier profitability with adjusted gross margin of 53.3%, adjusted operating margin of 26% and adjusted earnings per share of $2.65, up 23% to fourth quarter of last year. Crocs brand adjusted gross margin was 56.1% or 760 basis points lower than prior year, which was in a typical year as we took price ahead of inflation and had an overall lack of promotions in the industry. The significant decrease in adjusted SG&A rate for the quarter and the full year is due to leverage of shared services across both brands given as we invested over $215 million this year in additional marketing, talent and infrastructure to support future growth. The Crocs brand inventory balance was $303 million, a 42% increase over prior year and continues to decline sequentially, down 7% versus the third quarter. So for full year, as shared, we expect the Crocs brand to go 6% to 8%, which is about 9% to 11% given constant currency and growth is really going to be powered by international, but the US will grow. I think we're currently cautious about the consumer in the US, especially in the back half, but we're still anticipating growth over last year driven and that growth is really going to be driven by sandals and newness."
