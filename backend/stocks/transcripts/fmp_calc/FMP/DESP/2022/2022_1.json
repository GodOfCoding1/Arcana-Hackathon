Excluding Koin, EBITDA rose over $12 million, even though bookings were still way below our first quarter of 2019 levels. As you can see in the graphs on this slide, gross bookings in March and April reached 85% and 102% of first quarter 2019 level, respectively. We delivered the highest gross profit since the third quarter of 2019, at slightly over $74 million, with gross margin recovering to the levels reported in the first quarter of that year. Excluding Koin, our fintech operation, adjusted EBITDA was slightly above $12 million, reaching 82% of first quarter '19 levels, despite gross bookings reaching only 69% of pre-pandemic levels."
