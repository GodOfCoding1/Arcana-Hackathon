    "content": " In addition to strong demand levels that drove gross bookings, we benefited from a higher take rate of just over 13%, benefiting from normal travel conditions driving fewer cancellations on higher rates in Mexico and Argentina, where we focus more on profitability over growth. The operating leverage we have built into the business drove 28% increase in adjusted EBITDA when compared to third quarter 2019, which is also its highest level since then, year-on-year adjusted EBITDA improved by $22.4 million. First, there continue to be a gradual recovery in travel demand in LatAm, generating sustained growth in gross bookings, which finished the quarter just 7% below the third quarter of 2019. The strong growth in bookings and a higher take rate drove revenues 75% higher, and finished the quarter 10% above third quarter 2019."
