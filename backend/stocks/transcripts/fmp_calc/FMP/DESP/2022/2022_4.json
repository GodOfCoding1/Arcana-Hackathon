    "content": " And therefore, we are expecting first quarter revenues to increase around 40% versus last year and almost 20% versus 2019, with adjusted EBITDA in US dollars for the Q1 in the mid-teens area, implying an EBITDA above the 2018 levels. Despite industry in air travel demand being at approximately 80% of fourth quarter 2019 levels, we delivered the same level of revenues, $145 million. As you can see at the top of the table, higher-margin standalone travel packages as a percentage of gross bookings were 31% in the fourth quarter of last year versus 22% in the fourth quarter of 2019. In the middle of the table, you see that our B2B channel, which includes white labeling of our platform, accounted for 12% of our gross bookings in the fourth quarter of last year compared to 5% in the same period of 2019. During the quarter, we maintained our focus on profitable growth, and thanks to still improving revenue mix, we delivered adjusted EBITDA that was 51% above the fourth quarter to 2019 levels, and that was our fifth consecutive positive quarter."
