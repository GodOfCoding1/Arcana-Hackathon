    "content": " We ended the quarter with $177 million of cash and over $300 million of available liquidity, with 0 borrowings under the company's $125 million revolving credit facility and a net leverage ratio of 0.8x. As a result, we have updated our full year 2022 financial outlook, which now consists of revenue between $495 million and $500 million; adjusted EBITDA between $263 million and $268 million; discretionary cash flow between $255 million and $260 million; and capital spending between $130 million and $135 million. As a result, the company is providing a preliminary 2023 financial outlook, which includes a minimum revenue of $525 million and maximum revenue of $710 million with minimum adjusted EBITDA of $365 million. Target anticipates variable service revenue will contribute between $50 million and $185 million of additional 2023 revenue, above the anticipated minimum revenue of $525 million. In addition to broaden the range of potential value-enhancing capital allocation initiatives, Target's Board of Directors has authorized a stock repurchase program for up to $100 million. I mean here's kind of the calculus that one has to think through, right, which is -- this is -- if we look at an expense shift, in this instance, call it -- just call it about $10 million or so, is effectively a onetime mobilization expense impact in Q3. We are proud of the record-setting results, which have more than doubled the size of the business, including increasing adjusted EBITDA by $135 million from our original 2022 outlook."
