    "content": " Coupled with our ongoing business development efforts that have created the strongest project pipeline the company has seen in several years, the company is reiterating its preliminary 2023 financial outlook, which includes revenue of $525 million, maximum revenue of $710 million, with adjusted EBITDA of $365 million. So as we move forward with Title 42 being lifted, with the typical seasonality we would expect from the children's specifically, right, because that's the census population that really impacts us, and then the movement of Fort Bliss this summer and the termination of that, that shifts a lot of things really to the second half. It's hard to say what that quantum is because as you know, migration flows are not clear, albeit we can say and I think we may have touched on this at some point in the past is that over half of the entire touch points on the immigration flows in 2022 alone were rejected specifically due to Title 42 and the rest came in through Title 8, which is the typical asylum claim."
