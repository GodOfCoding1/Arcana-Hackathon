Our Great Park segment reported a loss of $13.8 million for the quarter, which was comprised of 4.5 million and income generated by our management company and an $18.3 million loss from the ventures operations. As a result to the management company, Five Point recognized $12 million and management fee revenues during the quarter, 3 million of which was from monthly base fee payments, and 9 million of which was from non-cash revenue, recognized for changes in estimated incentive compensation payments expected when the venture mixed future distributions. This included 23.9 million of proceeds from the closing of 61 home sites on 2.9 acres at the Great Park neighborhoods, as well as $11.3 million related to changes in estimates of variable consideration, which is mostly comprised of profit participation the venture receives from homebuilders."
