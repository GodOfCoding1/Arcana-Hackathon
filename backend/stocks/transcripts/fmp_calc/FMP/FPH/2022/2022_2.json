    "content": " Although we have not actually closed land sales this quarter and we recorded an overall $11 million loss, we are positioned with near-term residential land closings that will be profitable and will fortify our already strong balance sheet. On top of the ongoing residential opportunities at Great Park, our commercial parcels were offered to the Orange County commercial market, something that has not been available for years, large parcels of entitled land of flexible entitlement, which can offer a multitude of uses, including life sciences, R&D, office and industrial."
