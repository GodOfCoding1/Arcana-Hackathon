    "content": " As previously noted, value-added revenue for our packaging applications was $146 million in the first quarter 2022, increasing $15 million sequentially or 11% compared to the fourth quarter of 2021 on relatively flat shipments, reflecting improvements in pricing to pass through the higher costs. First quarter 2022 adjusted EBITDA of $55 million increased $18 million or approximately 47% compared to the first quarter of 2021, reflecting the higher value-added revenue as discussed and reflecting operating and overhead costs related to the Warrick acquisition."
