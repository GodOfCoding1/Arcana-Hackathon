    "content": " Network contribution, which reflects agilon\u2019s share of medical margin, increased 38% to $42 million during the first quarter. And I\u2019d also say that with the high-end of our guidance at almost $2.6 billion of revenue, 270,000 MA members, the high end of our guidance on medical margin is picking up over $120 million in medical margin year-over-year, and we\u2019re extremely excited, of course, about this being the first year that we\u2019re guiding to and projecting to be EBITDA breakeven for the entire business. And, I think, that\u2019s a good number considering just the second full year of the program where we\u2019re coming off the 2021 first 3 quarters at a loss of about $5 million. When I look at the Direct Contracting MLR, so to speak, this quarter again, taking that medical expense and the revenue this quarter, about 92.8% in the back half of 2021, you\u2019re kind of running 93.5%. Yeah, I mean that\u2019s \u2013 well, if you\u2019re looking at just the fourth quarter, that\u2019s going to be \u2013 or just the third and fourth quarter, that\u2019s going to be even a little bit more negative, because we started to take adjustments for that retro trend adjustment in the third and then even more so in the fourth quarter of last year."
