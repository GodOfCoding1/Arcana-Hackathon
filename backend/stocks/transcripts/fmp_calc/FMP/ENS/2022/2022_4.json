Looking at our quarterly sequential adjusted EPS bridge, Q4 2022 benefited from the net favorable price recapture previously discussed, approximately $0.20 per share of organic volume growth and FX gains and other income and expense from a weaker euro, which were partially offset by higher OpEx, raised our adjusted EPS from $0.19 from $1.01 in Q3 2022 to $1.20 per diluted share in our fourth fiscal quarter."
