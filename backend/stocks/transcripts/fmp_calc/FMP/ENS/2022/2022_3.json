    "content": " Our third quarter net sales increased 12% over the prior year to $844 million, due to a 10% increase from volume and over 3% from price net of mix, partially offset by a 1% decline from foreign exchange. Excluding these charges, our Motive Power business generated operating earnings of $39 million or 11.5% of sales, which was 180 basis points lower than the 13.3% of sales for the third quarter of last year, but slightly better after adjusting for the $6 million benefit from the Richmond Fire recovery received last year as previously mentioned. Energy Systems operating earnings percentage of 2.6% was down from last year, but an improvement from the prior quarter\u2019s 2.3%, a $1 million investment in our fast-charging initiative, combined with higher freight, tariffs and material costs, unfavorable mix from supply shortages and lagging price improvement realization caused the OE erosion versus prior year."
