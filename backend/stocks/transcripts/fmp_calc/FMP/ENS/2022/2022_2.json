    "content": " On a sequential basis, our second quarter operating earnings dollars eroded $14 million from $75 million, while the OE margin decreased 150 basis points to 7.8%, primarily due to the persistent supply chain headwinds and inflation in Energy Systems, which Dave has addressed. Excluding those charges, our Motive Power business generated operating earnings of $41 million or 12.8%, which was 370 basis points higher than the 9.2% in the second quarter of last year due to strong demand and easing of pandemic-related restrictions, favorable mix from maintenance-free growth and ongoing OpEx constraint or restraint."
