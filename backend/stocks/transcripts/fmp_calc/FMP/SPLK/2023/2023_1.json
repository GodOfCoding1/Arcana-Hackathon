    "content": " On today's call, we will be making forward-looking statements, including financial guidance and expectations, including our forecast for our second quarter and full year fiscal 2023 and our expectations of revenues, renewals, operating margin, operating cash flow and rule of 40 scale, as well as trends in our markets and business, our strategies and our expectations regarding our business, products, technology, customers, demand and markets. One of the things that I'm personally encouraged by is that while there's lots of turbulence and a number of factors in the macro environment, the reality is that given the security environment that we're living in with increasing concerns about what might happen relative to Ukraine, the continued concern about ransomware and other issues, Splunk sits right at the center of providing the visibility that security organizations need to understand what's happening. So one is the role that we're playing for these mission-critical customers and the role that Splunk plays, it has -- it puts us in a really unique position where there's tremendous future opportunity. In terms of how fast should Splunk move to cloud versus continue to make this more of a choice for customers, what's the right balance for that when we think about the context of trying to improve operating margin and cash flow, sort of the pace of how this position move to cloud, I'd love to get your initial thoughts on that dimension. And I think what's interesting here and the one thing that does differentiate Splunk is the opportunity to work with those partners where they can deliver services on the back of Splunk in these complex architectures, be it security or broader observability, it really creates a very compelling opportunity for partners. The one thing that I've seen here that I think is really important is in our SIEM world and the broad Splunk platform, we're able to take a vast variety of data to provide end-to-end visibility as to what the heck is happening in these complex environments. I think in the world we're living in relative to the requirements around security, I think Splunk plays a critical role, and we'll continue to run the play of getting customers to adopt us as the core to their overall security strategy. So I think there's obviously lots of noise in the market, but I think we're incredibly well positioned, and I hear it directly from customers."
