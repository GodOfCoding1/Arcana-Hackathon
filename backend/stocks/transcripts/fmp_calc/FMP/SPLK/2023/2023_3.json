    "content": " On today's call, we will be making forward-looking statements, including financial guidance and expectations, including our long-term growth and profitability and expense reduction efforts, forecasts of our fourth quarter and full year fiscal 2023 and our future expectations of revenues, total ARR, cloud ARR, operating margin and free cash flow as well as trends in our markets and our business, our strategies, our expectations regarding our business, acquisitions products, technology, customers and demand. Our top line outperformance was driven by strong term license demand from existing customers, underscoring the value our customers continue to gain from Splunk's mission-critical security and observability solutions powered by our one-of-a-kind data platform. As we shared on last quarter's call, we continue to see a slower pace of cloud migrations and expansions as customers remain cautious with their budgets and reprioritize their investments. During the quarter, we continued to deliver steady cloud gross margin expansion driven by ongoing optimization actions, working with our cloud service provider partners as well as engineering and cloud delivery improvements that allow us to better align infrastructure requirements to our customers' needs."
