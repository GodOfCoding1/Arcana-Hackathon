    "content": " Revenue for the third quarter was $29.5 million, reflecting a CosMx heavy spatial instrument mix, lower GeoMx and kind of consumable sales of our forecast indicated, and about $1 million negative foreign currency impact. For the fourth quarter, we expect to receive orders for over 60 spatial biology systems with an approximately 66%, 33% mix between CosMx and GeoMx, implying a cumulative total of over 200 spatial systems sold in 2022. Spatial biology revenue of $12 million to $13 million we expect will derive from sales of GeoMx systems, the shipment of our first CosMx systems and from consumables. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. We obviously have some transient impacts this year with the inability to recognize revenue on CosMx, and we're still learning the consumable pull-through dynamics on GeoMx, but the secular trend, heavy growth in the spatial biology industry should drive meaningful top line growth for the years ahead. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. I think  in the fourth quarter, as I had mentioned in the prep remarks and in other comments, so we don't put guidance at the bottom-end of the range for consumables, at what the Q3 pull-through was, at the top end of the range, you can assume about a 10% sequential improvement in pull-through, which is typically what we would see on a seasonal basis in a normal year. And so that's where the overall guidance was built for Q4 and we'll give more commentary on next year as we get into the February time frame, but the growth rate ranges that we assumed for the 40% to 50% range assumes the typical flat instrument year-over-year that we typically assume our nCounter guidance and pull-through that was consistent with what we observed this year, so no improvements next year."
