    "content": " Net revenue increased to an all-time high for any quarter of $736 million, up 12% from last year; a record Q4 operating income of $94 million generated in earnings per share of $1.26 or up 30% from last year. These continuing strategic investments, our capital allocations to shareholders and the Tetra Tech's stock price increase, all resulted in a total shareholder return, or TSR, over the last trailing 3 years of 54%, which is almost 3 three higher than a key benchmark of S&P 1000, which had a return of 19% over the same time period."
