    "content": " Now excluding the extraordinary contributions from disaster response work that we had in the quarter, our state and local work still grew at a double-digit rate with continued strength in municipal water business all across the U.S. Our U.S. commercial net revenue was 21% of our business, up 14% from last year, which is about double the 7% growth rate that we saw last quarter. Further, regarding the year-over-year EPS, I would like to note that our tax rate this year of 25.7% is higher than last year\u2019s tax rate of 21.5%, which equates to about a $0.05 headwind in this year\u2019s current quarter. And second of all, the area that we\u2019ve seen most volatility, especially for ourselves coming into slower periods in the past for the commercial industry, were driven by commodity work and particularly oil and gas or mining, where you saw changes in fluctuation in commodity prices move our oil and gas work down 50% back when you saw a downturn of oil from $50, $70 down to 0 or to very low numbers."
