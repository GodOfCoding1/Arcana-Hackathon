    "content": " In 2022, our Canadian product grew by 44% to $272.9 million, driven by one -- by our single wafer cleaning tools and continued penetration of semi-critical ordered range (ph) tools. Your line is open. Actually, we do have -- we're expecting some revenue this year will come from outside Mainland, China, right, and some revenue expected from Korea and some from U.S. And also we're expecting probably not real revenue from there in Taiwan, but they're actually expecting customer probably breakthrough in time of this year, but not revenue. Your line is open. Your line is open. And then I think in a conference call or two ago, you mentioned -- this is my last question, that you would expect sales or shipments, I should say, outside of domestic China in calendar '23, a target of about 10% of those shipments outside of that market. Your line is open. And another question, more on the revenue recognition side, further kind of advanced note restricted by the U.S. regulation -- the U.S. October 7 regulation for any tools, either the repeated tools or the new tools that we ship to any of these fab customers are all those related revenues already booked in the fourth quarter? Your line is open."
