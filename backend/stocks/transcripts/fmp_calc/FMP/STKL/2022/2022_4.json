    "content": " Q4 success was achieved much the same way we have driven the business all year, strong broad-based revenue growth in plant-based from both pricing and real volume growth, fruit snacks continues to experience incredible growth and frozen fruit saw continued improvement in profitability linked to better execution. Plant-based revenues were up 23% in the fourth quarter to $136 million, with growth split approximately 60/40 between pricing and volume with both factors up double digits. Cash used in investing activities was $20 million compared with $23 million in last year's fourth quarter, primarily reflecting investments in capacity expansion projects, partially offset by proceeds from the recent divestiture of the sunflower business. As we think about the business post 2025, we would expect a financial algorithm for the total company of low double-digit revenue growth, high teens gross margins with low teens adjusted EBITDA margins and capital expenditures of mid-single-digits as a percentage of revenue."
