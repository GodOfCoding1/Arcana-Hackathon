    "content": " In our plant-based business unit revenues were up 20% to $138 million in the third quarter, our 16th consecutive quarter of revenue growth and very similar to the plus 22% we delivered in the first half. In the third quarter, fruit based revenues increased 10% to $92 million led by the continued strength of our margin advantaged fruit snacks business as frozen was essentially flat with higher price realizations offsetting anticipated volume declines. In roughly three years we've grown our fruit snacks business, which includes our smoothie bowls, by 125% to around $100 million of annual revenue. As Joe mentioned, third quarter revenues of $230 million were up 15.7% year-over-year, reflecting continued growth in both segments. In fruit based, segment level gross profit rose $6.6 million to $11.3 million and gross margin increased 670 basis points to 12.3% despite an approximately 50 basis point headwind stemming from the impact of pass-through pricing to recover commodity inflation. The year-over-year growth was attributable to higher gross profit, partially offset by a $4.2 million increase in SG&A due to higher employee compensation costs, the majority of which was stock-based compensation, reflecting our strong performance in 2022. Cash used in investing activities of continuing operations was $22 million compared with $17 million in last year's third quarter, primarily reflecting investments in capacity expansion projects, partially offset by proceeds from the recent sales of non-core assets. In the last 12 months, the sunflower business delivered $70 million of revenue with only a 4% gross margin."
