    "content": " Our consolidated year-to-date results have been strong, with revenue up 35.9% to $1.6 billion on essentially flat volume and adjusted EBITDA up to $247 million from $216 million last year. Fourth, this year's cycle for rubber contract negotiations are essentially complete, and we expect 2023 rubber adjusted EBITDA to be on par with last year's total company adjusted EBITDA of $268 million. I would probably use a similar number to get a full year GP per ton - if you recall, our GP per ton in the fourth quarter last year was pretty well so just over $300 GP per ton on a trailing 12-month basis we get to the end of this year, it should be closer to the kind of the 340 range that we're at right now. No, I think if you look at our volume in the third quarter, which had dropped obviously sequentially as well as year-over-year, we would see a little softness beyond that level. When we look at Q2, I think we were looking at - if you looked at where exchange rates were at that point in time, they were \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and if you look at across the month of July and early August, they were around $12 million to $15 million -- and obviously, we're now sitting pretty much in parity. So now when we think about the fourth quarter, and if you listen to some of the comments, the tire manufacturers have made seeing a slowdown in the European, let's say, passenger car market for that area, including replacement tires, then I think we see a weakness in that coupled with potentially people using up or taking their last straw on some Russian carbon black."
