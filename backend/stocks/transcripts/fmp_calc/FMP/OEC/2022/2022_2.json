    "content": " Second quarter adjusted EBITDA was $83.4 million, up 5.8% year-over-year, our second consecutive record for the company as well as for our specialty business. Moving to Slide 9, while specialty volumes decreased year-over-year and from the first quarter, revenue increased to $181.9 million, up 16.4% year-over-year and 2.4% sequentially, reflecting the pass-through of higher oil prices, as well as improved mix. Rubber revenue increased to $359.3 million, up 46.8% year-over-year and 17.1% sequentially, driven by feedstock-related price increases and higher based pricing from the 2022 cycle. Our guidance which Corning will discuss shortly projects a stronger second half, compared with last year's $180 million of EBITDA. With that taken into consideration, we are maintaining our full year adjusted EBITDA guidance range of $310 million to $340 million, reflecting the momentum we achieved in the first half of the year, as well as the impact of current market conditions. Thank you very much, sir. Thank you very much, sir."
