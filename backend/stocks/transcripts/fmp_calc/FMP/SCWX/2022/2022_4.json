    "content": " It's a testament to our team and the value of Taegis that we've historically spent significantly less on sales and marketing and public peers, yet delivered one of the highest growth rates in XDR customers and ARR last year. Looking ahead, we see multiple drivers of long-term organic growth, including a continued shift toward XDR and away from standalone point product-based approaches to security, the upsell of additional solutions, increased demand from targeted marketing investments, the shift of sales talent from re-solutioning existing customers as that work winds down this year, to hunting for new logos, and accelerating sales through our partner program. As a result, we expect $90 million to $100 million of ARR in FY 2023 to be either transitioned to partners, moved in-house with customers or churn. This guidance reflects the following expectations: increased investments in sales and marketing by approximately $30 million, our investment in R&D is expected to increase approximately $20 million this year to maintain our market lead, G&A is expected to grow slightly to $2 million, we estimate there is approximately $30 million of duplicate fixed and transition-related costs that we are incurring with $15 million of cost of revenues and $15 million in OpEx."
