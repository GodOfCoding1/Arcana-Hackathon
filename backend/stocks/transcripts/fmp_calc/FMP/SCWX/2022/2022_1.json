    "content": " And as we\u2019ve talked about before, we really target what we would term sort of mid-market in terms of security program as opposed to necessarily the size of the customer because, clearly, in the financial services sector, for example, highly mature customers who have been dealing with regulatory compliance around security and just frankly, being the target of attacks early, early on that they have advanced much farther than necessarily some other industries. And so what we talk about is really customers who are willing to invest in security, but they might have a very small security team with kind of a road map and a desire to increase their maturity with a partner like us or folks who put together sort of best-in-breed solutions, and they are looking for a platform to basically help them scale across all of their point products in place and drive kind of efficacy and efficiency across their security stack, whether they are assembling those solutions or they are looking for a partner to run security with them, that tends to be our sweet spot of both new customers and customers that are transitioning over. Well, there is certainly some emerging XDR players who may be in the mix or it may simply be a sort of a bake-off of security spend or share of wallet as we introduced capabilities recently around sort of covering many of the SIEM use cases and can help customers reduce their sort of total cost of ownerships with features in our XDR platform that cover use cases for other point products."
