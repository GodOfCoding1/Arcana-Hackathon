    "content": " To reduce their risk, customers need a grid of security controls to protect their data and applications, and they need the technology to enable the prevention, detection and protection capabilities to respond to today's security threats efficiently and effectively across their entire technology environment. Listening to our customers, we developed Taegis, an integrated cloud-native security platform that provides customers with both the security controls and the operational enablement they need to achieve superior threat prevention, vulnerability reduction, rapid detection across the full range of threats, and the fastest time to remediation. The average revenue per Taegis customer was approximately $149,000 versus $102,000 for managed security services customers, showing our transition continues to result in broader customer relationships. R&D increased to 21.5% of revenue, up from 16.6% last year and we capitalized $1.4 million in incremental R&D spend as we accelerate investments in our security platform."
