To start, Taegis ARR continues to grow with over one hundred and twenty three million dollars of ARR at the end of the quarter, up twenty two percent over Q2. 14:01 The result is gross margins expanded three hundred basis points year over year to sixty four percent with non-GAAP subscription gross profit margins up three hundred and seventy basis points, resulting in subscription gross profit up four hundred thousand dollars year over year despite the revenue decline. 15:12 Looking forward to our guidance for FY twenty twenty two, we expect full year total revenue to be five thirty five million dollars to five thirty seven million dollars,   implying fourth quarter revenue of one hundred and twenty eight million dollars to one hundred and thirty million dollars. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. And so that is the majority of the impact as opposed to customers who are in our target for re-solutioning if you will, those customers largely are transitioning to Taegis, but when you look at the mix of the subscription, customer count coming down, what you see is that the average revenue on those customers who are not moving are very small kind of sub twenty thousand per. Your line is open. Your line is open."
