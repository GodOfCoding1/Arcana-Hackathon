    "content": " Because the opportunity for Taegis, a true open XDR platform is tremendous, our open XDR approach as customers choosing Taegis as a way to future-proof their security. And that's reflected in our changes numbers, which continue to demonstrate one of the fastest customer and ARR growth rates in the market, with the addition of 900 customers since Q1 of last year and the addition of over 100 million of Taegis ARR. We've added 900 customers since Q1 of last year, up 180% over the prior year to end the quarter at 1,400 total Taegis customers. As we continue to resolution customers and grow new business on the platform, we ended the first quarter with nearly 50% of total ARR on Taegis . FY '23 continues to be an inflection point in the company's transition as we shed non-strategic services and complete the resolutioning of our base to Taegis, with a significant majority of customers completing that transition by FY '23 year-end. And as you can see, even with the MDR services included in our subscription margins, we are just at 70% gross margin this quarter because we have a purpose architected XDR platform that is very conscious about the types of data that we need quickly, right, real-time search capabilities for security efficacy and those that we can have lower cost storage structures or things that you just want to search over time. So when we think about being able to compete with a very well-regarded incident response program underneath that 40 hours a quarter included in our MDR program, which is a real differentiator from competitors that's truly big R and in the middle there, it's really around the detection, and that's where we win against all players who come from all angles because of the way that we don't just ingest data, which many XDR providers say, oh, we ingest everything."
