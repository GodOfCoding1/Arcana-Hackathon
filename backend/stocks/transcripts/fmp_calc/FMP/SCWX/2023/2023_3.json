    "content": " The launch of Taegis marks the next era for SecureWorks and its customers across the Japan market, bringing access to unified prevention, detection and response in a single, localized and global platform, with an added layer of support available to customers and partners via ManagedXDR. Taegis subscription revenue was $47.9 million for the quarter, up 100% year-over-year, and average revenue per Taegis customer was approximately $139,000, up sequentially from $136,000 in Q2 and remains a premium to our non-Taegis revenue per customer, which averages $77,000 per customer. As we continue to grow our new business and resolution other MSS customers on Taegis, we ended the third quarter with 65% of total ARR on Taegis and now see Taegis expanding to nearly 80% of total ARR by the time we exit this fiscal year as we accelerate the transition from non-strategic services to our Taegis-led business model. As both Wendy and I detailed earlier, we saw healthy growth in our Taegis solutions, which are helping drive better outcomes for customers on their most urgent security challenges and our business model transformation continues to accelerate. And our customers are clear that Taegis XDR is the right answer to address today's security challenges with an open platform approach that evolves seamlessly with their technology transformation, provides superior detection and unmatched response to prevent damaging security breaches, and does at an industry-leading return on investment."
