    "content": " Taegis' ARR and customer count numbers continue to put us among the fastest growth rates in the industry with triple-digit growth in both areas, reflecting the addition of 800 customers since 2Q of last year to a total of 1,500 Taegis customers. And while the endpoint detection and response market is $9 billion and growing, we've heard from prospective customers and we know from our XDR visibility that EDR alone misses much of a threat. Today's markets are turbulent, driven, shaped and reshaped by many forces, but we remain focused on keeping our customers secure, on defining the future of threat detection and analysis and on driving superior long-term and sustainable growth and value creation for investors, as we execute on our strategy and complete our transformation, as an industry-leading XDR provider. We've added 800 customers since Q2 of last year, up 114% over the prior year to end the quarter at 1,500 total Taegis customers. In closing, FY 2023 continues to be an inflection point in the company's transition as we shed non-strategic services and complete the resolution of our base to Taegis with a significant majority of customers completing that transition by FY 2023 year-end. So, as you see Taegis continuing to expand, you start to get squeezed a bit as you come to the tail end of the CTP platform, and then that overhang, clearly, we've talked before about the $30 million, well $15 million in COGS, $15 million in OpEx of sort of fixed costs on CTP that were sort of duplicatively swallowing this year."
