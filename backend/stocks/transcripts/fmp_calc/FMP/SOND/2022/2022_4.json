    "content": " Our fourth quarter results were highlighted by the third quarter in a row of free cash flow improvement to negative $30 million versus negative $39 million in the previous quarter, and negative $62 million in the first quarter of 2022. And cash contribution margin, which is a unit economic metric, we used to measure property level performance was 24% in the fourth quarter compared to 22% last quarter and 10% a year ago. In the fourth quarter, as Francis mentioned, free cash flow before one-time restructuring costs totaled negative $30 million, compared to negative $39 million in the third quarter and negative $53 million in the fourth quarter of 2021. Free cash flow margin also improved, reaching negative 22% compared to negative 31% in the third quarter of 2022 and negative 61% in the fourth quarter of 2021. Just on corporate travel the $70 million, if my math is right, it's around 15% of revenue -- hard to think about like, where that goes longer term, but any reason to believe that corporate travel would be any different than call it more traditional lodging contribution more traditional lodging players out there, or do you think that maybe Sonder might be uniquely positioned just given the portfolio, given the comfort and all the different services that are offered there."
