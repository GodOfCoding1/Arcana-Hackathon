    "content": " We're excited to report strong second quarter results highlighted by improving free cash flow, achieving negative $45 million before one-time restructuring costs compared to free cash flow of negative $62 million last quarter and negative $60 million a year ago. We focused on four key levers for our cash flow positive plan, including cutting cash costs, reducing plan signings space, raising the bar on incremental lease signings and focusing on rapid payback RevPAR initiatives. Separately, we also expect $30 million in annualized cash cost savings from reduced pre-opening costs and net CapEx associated with incremental units going live given our focus on finding a 100% capital light units going forward. I am pleased with a notable improvement in free cash flow in the second quarter, which totaled negative $45 million before one-time restructuring costs compared to negative $62 million in the first quarter and negative $60 million one year ago. Given our strong revenue growth, free cash flow margin also shows significant improvements, reaching negative 37% compared to negative 77% in the first quarter of 2022 and negative 127% in the second quarter of last year. We'll drive these results by pulling the four key levers of our cash flow positive plan, which Frances detailed earlier; cutting cash costs, reducing plan signing space, raising the bar in incremental signings and focusing on rapid payback RevPAR initiatives."
