    "content": " We're excited to report strong third quarter results, highlighted by sequential improvement in free cash flow before onetime restructuring costs to negative $39 million versus negative $45 million for the previous quarter. This also includes $30 million in expected annualized cash cost savings from reduced preopening costs and net CapEx associated with incremental units going live, given our focus on signing 100% capital-light units going forward. In the third quarter, free cash flow before onetime restructuring costs totaled negative $39 million, compared to negative $45 million last quarter and negative $45 million a year ago. Free cash flow margin also improved, reaching negative 31% compared to negative 37% in the second quarter of 2022 and negative 66% in the third quarter of 2021. In the third quarter, cash contribution margins were 22% versus 18% in the second quarter and 5% a year ago, demonstrating Sonder's unit economics equation is strong and improving. Regarding guidance for 2022, we expect revenue of better than $455 million, representing more than 95% year-over-year growth and better than $129 million for the fourth quarter. For the second half of the year, Q3 and Q4 combined, we are reaffirming free cash flow of better than negative $70 million before restructuring costs which implies better than negative $31 million in the fourth quarter."
