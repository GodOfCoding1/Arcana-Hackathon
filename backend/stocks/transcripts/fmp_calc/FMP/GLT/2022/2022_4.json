    "content": " The revenue increase was mainly due to higher selling prices of approximately $19 million as we have successfully converted over half of the segment's revenue base to a floating price mechanism, coupled with multiple pricing actions and energy surcharges taken in 2022 to combat inflation. Continued escalation in the price of energy, key raw materials, and freight lowered earnings by $14.9 million versus the same quarter last year. Operations and other were unfavorable $4.5 million driven by lower production to manage inventory levels, but partially offset by reduced spending and lower depreciation following the Dresden impairment taken in the first quarter of 2022. For the fourth quarter, corporate costs were higher by approximately $2 million versus the same period last year due to the one-time charge of $3.1 million from a customer claim caused by a defective synthetic fiber material. On a full-year basis, our 2022 adjusted free cash flow was lower by approximately $140 million versus 2021, primarily driven by higher working capital usage of $74 million. We expect working capital to improve year-over-year by $20 million on account of lower inflation in raw materials and energy, and continued focus on cash liberation actions. As Thomas mentioned, with the turnaround strategy being a very significant element of our short to medium-term performance, I think having investors understand what that looks like, what that aggregates up to on a year-over-year basis, we think is helpful and that's really I would say what I would add to what prompted us to move from quarterly to annual."
