    "content": " As we headed into Q2, we were focused on a short list of imperatives, critical to improving overall performance and delivering the quarter, which included actions to migrate more Composite Fibers customers to a cost pass-through mechanism to offset raw material and energy inflation, achieve meaningful progress in the integration and financial performance in our new Spunlace segment and execute a complex capital project in the Airlaid segment designed to improve quality and increase throughput. Airlaid Materials results increased earnings by $0.05, primarily due to strong volume recovery in the tabletop and wipes categories, plus from the inclusion of a full quarter of Mount Holly results compared to a partial quarter last year. Fund based results lowered earnings by $0.03, mainly driven by lower volume and unfavorable mix coupled with higher than anticipated raw material and energy costs, which far exceeded recovery through customer price increases. Prices of energy, key raw materials, and freight negatively impacted results by $16.9 million versus the same quarter last year. Selling prices and energy surcharges favorably impacted results by $3.6 million versus the previous quarter, but were more than offset by raw material inflation, particularly fiber purchases, totaling $5.4 million. For the third quarter of 2022, we expect higher selling prices to partially offset raw material and energy inflation resulting in a net unfavorable price cost gap of $3 million. Slide 9 shows our cash flow summary, on a year-to-date basis, our 2022 adjusted free cash flow was lower by approximately $90 million versus the same period last year, mainly driven by a higher working capital usage of $51 million and lower cash earnings and higher capital expenditures also contributed to the shortfall."
