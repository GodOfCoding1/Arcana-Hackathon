    "content": " As we take a look at the details of our performance, memory interface chips led the way, delivering Q4 product revenue of $67 million, up 15% quarter-over-quarter. This brought the full year to $227 million, setting a new annual record for product revenue and significantly outpacing the market with 58% growth year-over-year. Product revenue was $67.2 million, consisting primarily of memory interface chips and for the full year, we delivered $227.1 million, which was a record for the company. Total operating costs, including cost of goods sold for the quarter was towards the high end of our expectations at $85.4 million driven by higher cost of goods sold related to record memory interface chip revenue. Under ASC 606, we recorded $1 million of interest income related to the financing component of fixed fee licensing arrangements, for which we have recognized revenue but not yet received payment. Maybe if you can share with us sort of your view and how this transition may shape up because you're guiding for $60 million in product revenue in the first quarter, which doesn't sound too bad."
