    "content": " Our discussions today will contain forward-looking statements, including our expectations regarding projected financial results, financial prospects, market growth, demand for our solutions, the company's ability to effectively manage any supply chain shortages and the effects of ASC 606 on reported revenue amongst other items. Turning to our detailed results, memory interface chips drove another record quarter of product revenue at $58.6 million, up 10% sequentially and 60% year-over-year. Once again, we delivered a strong quarter with our financial results above the high end of both our revenue and earnings expectations and generated a quarterly record cash from operations of $80 million. Under ASC 606, we recorded $1.2 million of interest income related to the financing component of fixed fee licensing arrangements for which we have recognized revenue but not yet received payment. And adjusting for noncash interest expense on the convertible notes, this resulted in non-GAAP interest and other income for the third quarter of $2.9 million. We ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling $264.8 million down from the previous quarter as record cash from operations of $80 million was offset by the $100 million accelerated share repurchase program we initiated in the quarter and $54 million net payment to repurchase the convertible notes. So as we said, the -- our silicon IP business is now on a stable run rate of $30 million to $35 million a quarter, approximately half of it is interface IP and half of it is security."
