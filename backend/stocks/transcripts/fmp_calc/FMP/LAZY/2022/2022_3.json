    "content": " We've got some stuff that we can't sell because it's under recall and we've got some prior model year stuff we need to continue to work through, but the team is really focused on that and we'll get our arms around it. Certainly, the gross margins came down as a result, both in new and in used, but I think that was all designed to make sure that we were in a really strong position in terms of having a lot of model year 2023 stuff on hand and then the allocated product that we get from certain OEMs is in good shape and we're ready for this winter that's coming. Obviously, there's a cost to that relative to the floor plan, and certainly with rates going up, that's a further burden that we'll have to balance, but I think pretty universally if you talk to our store leaders, they all say they'd rather have a little bit more inventory than they have historically and we're very much of a mindset to let the store leaders have a little bit more autonomy and discretion and how they run their business because ultimately they're the ones that know their customers and their markets the best. I think there's been a lot of people who've tried to prove and correctly prove that you can't do one or the other, they typically work together and you need the durability of the service or the financing business and you need the cyclicality of the sales business to really have a business that produces the right kind of financial outcomes."
