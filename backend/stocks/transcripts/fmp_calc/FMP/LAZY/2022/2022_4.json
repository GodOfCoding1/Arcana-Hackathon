On a same-store basis, total unit -- used unit sales, excluding wholesale units declined 30.8% and gross profit per unit declined 23.6% to $15,840 per unit. Greenfields come with their own set of complexities, the two biggest ones in my mind are, let's call it, an 18-plus month construction lead time, where you're sinking capital in the ground, so to speak, and waiting many, many, many months for a return and while you're avoiding goodwill, the second component of a Greenfield is in the start-up cost and really having to start from scratch, with an entirely new staff of sales and service personnel versus if you're buying an existing location."
