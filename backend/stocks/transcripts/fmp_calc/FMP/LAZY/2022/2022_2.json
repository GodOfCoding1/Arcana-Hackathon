Now it is my pleasure to introduce Bob DeVincenzi, who will provide some opening remarks; before Nick Tomashot shares an overview of the 2022 second quarter financials. In our preliminary second quarter results, which were released on July 20, 2022, we indicated an expectation of reporting revenue of $373.6 million, adjusted EBITDA of $38.4 million and net income of $31.8 million. Total revenues for the second quarter were $373.6 million, up $50.8 million or 15.7% from 2021. Revenue for the quarter from the sale of recreational vehicles, or RVs, was $337.3 million, up $47.1 million or 16.2%. Moving to preowned RV sales, pre-owned revenue for the quarter was $118.1 million, up $29.4 million or 33.1%. Gross margin excluding LIFO adjustments increased between the 2 periods to 27.1% compared to 26.8% in 2021, with the change driven by an increase in average selling price for both new and pre-owned units as well as an increase in the number of pre-owned units sold relative to new units. Including noncash LIFO adjustments, which had a net unfavorable swing between periods of 1.7 million compared to prior year, gross profit for the quarter was $99.3 million, up 13.1 million or 15.2%. As of June 30, 2022, we had $321.7 million in inventory, consisting of $268 million in new vehicles, $58.5 million in pre-owned vehicles, approximately $8 million in parts inventory and LIFO reserves of $12.8 million."
