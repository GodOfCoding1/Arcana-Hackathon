    "content": " Also affecting cash flow this quarter was an increase in working capital, mainly inventory due to higher raw material costs and increased safety stocks to mitigate supply chain related disruptions. The year-over-year operating margin performance was due to higher pricing offset by higher raw material costs and general inflation, higher manufacturing costs including $5 million of temporary supply chain disruptions as well as foreign exchange headwinds. The decrease in margin was due primarily to favorable pricing, higher sales volumes at normal operating leverage and favorable product mix, which were more than offset by higher costs including higher raw material costs, foreign exchange headwinds and temporary supply chain disruptions. Operating margin declined by 340 basis points year-over-year to 10.7% with price and mix plus the normal leverage on volume, partially offsetting increased raw material costs and higher costs including temporary supply chain disruptions in foreign exchange. On a dollar basis, primary working capital increased year-over-year to $664 million reflecting higher raw material costs and additional safety stock associated with extended supply chains. Starting with the second quarter, we expect sales to be between $480 million to $500 million, which on a sequential basis and excluding additional foreign exchange headwinds would be in line with our normal seasonality of 1% to 2%. Sequentially from the first quarter, raw material costs increased by approximately $15 million and then are expected to remain approximately at this level for the balance of the fiscal year. Yes, I would say on the supply chain so for the first half of the year, it's about $10 million subject and it's expected to abate by the end of the year, Julian."
