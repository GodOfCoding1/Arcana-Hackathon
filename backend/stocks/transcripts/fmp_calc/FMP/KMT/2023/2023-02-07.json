    "content": " Beginning on Slide 2 of the presentation, we posted strong year-over-year organic sales growth in the quarter and continued the successful execution of our strategic initiatives despite ongoing macroeconomic headwinds, such as high inflation, foreign exchange and COVID-related disruptions in China. Free cash flow this quarter increased significantly to $44 million from $22 million in the prior year quarter despite a year-over-year increase in primary working capital, driven mainly by higher raw material costs and safety stock. Sales increased by 2% year-over-year with 11% organic growth, offset by headwinds due to foreign currency and workdays of 8% and 1%, respectively. Reported metal cutting sales were flat compared to the second quarter of fiscal '22 with a strong 11% organic growth, offset by a foreign currency headwind of 10% and business days of 1%. Looking at sales by end market, aerospace led again with strong growth at 19% year-over-year as we continue to win new business. On a dollar basis, year-over-year primary working capital increased to $690 million, reflecting mainly higher raw material costs and year-over-year higher safety stock associated with extended supply chains. On a year-over-year basis, the sales range assumes a $20 million currency headwind and pricing actions of approximately 7%. We expect fiscal '23 sales to be between USD2.05 billion and USD2.1 billion, with volume flat to up 2%, price realization of approximately 7% and a headwind from foreign exchange of approximately $100 million."
