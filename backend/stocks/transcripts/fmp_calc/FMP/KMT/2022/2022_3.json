    "content": " On a sequential basis, sales increased by 5%, slightly above the normal Q2 to Q3 seasonal trend despite worsening conditions in China due to COVID-19 lockdowns and the effects on our Shanghai distribution center and customers, as well as in EMEA and the broader effects related to the Ukraine conflict. In dollar terms, primary working capital increased year-over-year and sequentially to $676 million, due mainly to an increase in inventory resulting from higher material costs, the unexpected decline in sales in China, as well as strategic decisions on safety stock due to continuing supply chain issues. We expect sales to be in the range of $510 million to $530 million, which represents a year-over-year growth range of approximately flat to 3%. On a full-year basis, we expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $135 million, increasing around $10 million year-over-year, capital expenditures to be approximately $105 million and primary working capital as a percentage of sales to be approximately 31%. I think, Julian, for us here, if you look in the quarter, our inventory went up just around $30 million from Q2 to Q3 and our working capital as a percentage sales is right around 31%. I think the only other point I would add, Tami, especially in the first half of fiscal 2023 and no different than what we talked about here in Q4 of 2024, is given the positive price versus raws and the very strong operating leverage we saw in the first half of this year, again, when you adjust for those temporary cost actions that were in effect a little bit over a year ago, our leverage in the first half of this year was very strong, which we alluded to being positive price versus raws."
