    "content": " So, when you look at the change in sales versus the change in operating income, adjusting for that $15 million, you see a very strong operating leverage in the quarter, well north of this 50% that we've been talking about as sort of that rule of thumb for the cycle for us, and that's partly or heavily influenced by the timing of the pricing actions that our teams put in place before the raw material costs have really started to flow into our cost of goods sold here in Q1, also some of the carryover simplification/modernization benefits that we saw in the Q1, and those will sort of reduce themselves as we move through the year here in FY '22."
