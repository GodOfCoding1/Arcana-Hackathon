    "content": " And as a reminder, Q2 2021 inventory marked a decade plus low due to freight delays in our exposure to Vietnam production, which was our largest country of origin last year at roughly 40% and experienced significant COVID related factory closures, which had an outsized impact on timing of receipts. Of a 70% increase, in trans inventory was the largest driver, up $140 million or 130% to last year, contributing 30 points of the total increase as we lapped significant product delays. Based on holiday, as we respond to the dynamic environment, we have the balance sheet to protect investments in the key areas that support our always forward plan, and they include: judiciously investing in digital talent and tools to revolutionize how we approach the customer experience, modernizing our core platforms across merchandising and data, and investing in marketing and store openings to drive brand awareness and enhance our ability to drive top line growth in the months and years to come. For the second quarter, we delivered net sales of $805 million, down 7% to last year on a reported basis and down 4% on a constant currency basis. Hollister, which includes Gilly Hicks and Social Tourist, declined 15% or 12% on a constant currency basis, reflecting mounting macro pressures on its core consumer, a shift in shopping behaviors versus last year and lower demand for core back-to-school categories. Zooming into Abercrombie specifically, with the inventory issues we had coming out of Vietnam last year, we had a significant amount of air that we needed to use last Q3, Q4 and that -- those higher rates and that higher usage hit us in Q4 last year and even carried over into Q1 and a little bit into Q2 of 2022."
