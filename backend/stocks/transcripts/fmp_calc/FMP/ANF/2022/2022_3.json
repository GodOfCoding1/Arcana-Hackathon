    "content": " Against the challenging backdrop, our Q2 results beat our expectations on the top and bottom line with Abercrombie's sales up 10% and Hollister showing sequential sales improvement, and adjusted operating margin coming in 200 basis points higher than our expectation. We're excited about our position going into the holiday season, the continued momentum at Abercrombie and inventory is healthy with the year-over-year change cut in half from our peak last quarter. Onto our Q3 results, while global consumer continue to see significant inflation across their day-to-day lives, we were pleased to see our business improve on second quarter, delivering flat sales of 2021 on a constant currency basis. For Abercrombie brands, which includes Kids, we saw third quarter net sales grew 10% or 13% on a constant-currency basis, led by ongoing strength in Abercrombie adults. For the third quarter, we delivered net sales of $880 million, down 3% to last year on a reported basis and flat on a constant currency basis. As we think about bridging the 5% to 7% operating margin, the good thing is as we're getting closer to last year, whenever we really started to see the freight come in, so we'll still be below 2021 levels."
