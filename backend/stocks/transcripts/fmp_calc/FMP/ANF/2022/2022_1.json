    "content": " We exceed our sales plans delivering our best Q1 revenues since 2014 despite several major headwinds, including the lapping of stimulus and a returned in-person learning from much of the U.S. last March, global inflationary pressures, significant COVID restrictions in China, and the conflict in Ukraine. Sales were up 4% to last year, ahead of our expectation coming into the quarter for a low single digit increase, despite an estimated combined 100 basis point adverse impact from foreign currency volatility and the COVID-driven lockdowns in China. Operating expense, excluding other operating income was $460 million, compared to $436 million last year with approximately half of the increase due to lapping COVID-related rent abatements and government assistance recognized in Q1 2021 and the other half related to investments and marketing and higher digital fulfillment expense. While we do not expect to fully offset freight and commodity headwinds real time, we do expect to drive efforts to reduce the impacts on profitability, including but not limited to, managing inventory flows by region, to ensure we maximize top line during our peak selling periods, strategically increasing tickets and reducing the depth and breadth of promotions to drive AUR growth, and prioritizing customer facing spend and strategic long-term investments while reducing non-customer facing expenses."
