    "content": " For the second quarter, operating earnings were $0.89 per diluted common share, benefited from positive underwriting income as we continue to achieve double-digit net earned premium growth in our ongoing business, primarily driven by increased retentions and positive rates continuing to earn through. Turning now to our consolidated operating results, reported gross written and net earned premiums decreased 10.2% and 3.4%, respectively from the prior year's second quarter. Our loss ratio increased 3.1 percentage points to 60.8%, driven primarily by net adverse prior year reserve development of $16.3 million or 3.6 percentage points on the loss ratio. The loss ratio benefited from year-over-year lower CAT losses, which totaled $2.5 million or 60 basis point on the loss ratio in the second quarter of 2022. Our US operations generated underwriting income of $28.2 million, an increase of 13.3% from the prior year second quarter. Net written premiums and net earned premiums in the US ongoing business increased 9.9% and 14.5%, respectively versus the prior year second quarter. While gross written premiums in international ongoing business were broadly in line with the prior year second quarter, earned premiums increased 5.3%, primarily due to Syndicate 1200."
