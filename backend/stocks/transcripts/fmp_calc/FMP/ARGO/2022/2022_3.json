    "content": " Our loss ratio increased 1.7 percentage points to 65.7% in the third quarter driven mainly by net adverse prior year reserve development of $11.9 million or 2.6 percentage points on the loss ratio. However, when you adjust for the reinstatement premiums, the current accident year ex-CAT loss ratio for the third quarter of 2022 was 56.4%, which is in line with the prior year third quarter. The loss ratio also benefited from lower year-over-year CAT losses, which totaled $23.4 million or 5.1 percentage points on the loss ratio in the third quarter of 2022. Adjusting for the reinstatement premiums, the expense ratio for the third quarter of 2022 was 34.4%, an improvement of 3.9 percentage points year-over-year."
