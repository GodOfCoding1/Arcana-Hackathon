    "content": " Turning to Slide 10, net sales for 2022 increased by 4% to $971 million, led by a strong 35% year-over-year growth in the EV markets, good growth in industrial market sales and the Silicone Engineering acquisition. As Colin discussed, we have outlined a number of actions to improve gross margin with a path to 35% in the second half of this year, assuming sales continue at expected Q1, 2023 levels. Our efforts to improve margins and profitability will not stop there and we will outline more about our path to historical levels of profitability at our upcoming Investor Day, In 2022 we achieved EPS of $6.15, which included a one-time benefit from the receipt of the termination fee, partially offset by non-cash impairment charges from additional actions taken to exit Price Road and divestiture of our Griswold rubber product line. Much of the decline occurred in our EMS business unit, where sales were 15.6% lower quarter-over-quarter as anticipated demand for our portable electronics products were much lower due to the impacts of COVID-related disruptions in China. As we execute our recovery plan and growth strategy, we are focused on achieving 34% gross margin in Q2 and making additional improvements in the second half of the year. I think that's the main reason, so we have been working on productivity improvements since probably middle of last year, at least nine months and we're starting to see some real dividends in terms of unlocking free capacity and getting much better throughput in some of our key plants that have been I would say at capacity."
