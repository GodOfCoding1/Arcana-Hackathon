    "content": " The completion of Q2 constituted constituted continued operational momentum for our business as we further accelerated our MaaS platform vision and adoption across the number of key fronts, including new product introduction, indirect channel expansion, digital asset expansion and a more than 282% sequential gain in year-over-year revenue growth, representing a new second quarter record for reported revenues as a public company. In parallel, the conclusion of Q2 subsequently provided even more growth to our business as we further scaled our Lyte by Phunware hardware sales and continued to improve our balance sheet, including a current digital currency balance of more than 653 Bitcoin, 753 Ethereum and D5 positions valued in the aggregate at more than $18 million at today's trading prices. As an extension of our MaaS platform, we are working on regular product updates to our dual token ecosystem, but larger roadmap milestones, include; enhancing the profile experience to give users more control over their information they choose to share; the ability to update and access that information and in an auditable account of their engagement activity; new support functionality that allow users to refer friends, family and colleagues, while being rewarded for the networks they build; and location based marketing that will enable consumers to interact with brands in the real world and be seamlessly rewarded with PhunToken."
