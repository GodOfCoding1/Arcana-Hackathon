    "content": " The completion of Q3 constituted continued operational momentum for our business as we further accelerated our MaaS platform vision and adoption across the number of key firms, including new product introduction, in-direct channel expansion, digital asset expansion, and a more than 120% sequential gain in year-over-year revenue growth. And really biting into those as apples upfront and doing that work and getting it right has been instrumental in what we're seeing going forward because whether the economy is difficult or not, certain customers are saying, hey, if it expands revenue, if it reduces cost, it expands margin where it helps us in any way whether healthcare with patient satisfaction scores, or whether it's hospitality where it's getting more yield per customer per day by having more delightful experiences on-site."
