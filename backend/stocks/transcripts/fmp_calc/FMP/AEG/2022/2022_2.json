    "content": " On your - yes, we're very pleased to see that the strength of our capital positions and the way we run is allowing us to increase our free cash flow outlook and also our operating capital generation outlook for this year. So if you kind of take \u00e2\u0082\u00ac335 million times two quarters for the next two quarters, add that to the year-to-date operating capital generation that we reported of \u00e2\u0082\u00ac776 million, and that gets you to a number that's a little bit north of the \u00e2\u0082\u00ac1.4 billion that we're guiding off. I think, on an IFRS basis, you mentioned \u00e2\u0082\u00ac159 million number, it actually has very little impact on ongoing operating capital generation, very little impact on the solvency ratio for the U.S. business. But otherwise, the big - the rising level of interest rates actually has done a lot to increase the operating capital generation outlook for the Dutch Life going forward."
