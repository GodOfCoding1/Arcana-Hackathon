    "content": "  While Q1 results were generally in line with our previous comments for legacy ICU Medical, our results for Smiths Medical were slightly different than our expectations so we wanted to use the time on the call today to comment on the year-over-year drivers of the three main legacy ICU businesses and reiterate our view of expected growth for the upcoming year, give some sense of the current volatility in inflation in the market and how it may positively or negatively impact the level of legacy ICU profit growth, explain the Smiths Medical revenues we achieved in Q1 and how that compares to historical levels over a long period of time with some color on the variance, provide a status update on the current challenges and opportunities with the Smiths businesses as we see them now with a few more weeks into our ownership and articulate our priorities and criteria for success in the near-term, state again why there's a wide range of outcomes for the first few quarters, and lastly and briefly book in the scenarios we see post deal and recap our views of value creation with just a few words on the medium to long term."
