    "content": " Earlier this morning, we announced initial safety data as well as early clinical activity data from the safety lead-in portion of our ongoing Phase I trial of 5609, which is evaluating our highly selective and potent oral CDK7 inhibitor in combination with chemotherapy, in patients with relapsed/refractory pancreatic cancer. In the cohort evaluating the doublet combination of 5609 and gemcitabine in patients with pancreatic cancer, one of four or 25% of response evaluable patients treated at the four-milligram 5609 dose level, experienced a confirmed partial response or PR with a 98% reduction in the CA 19-9 tumor marker from a baseline of 60.357 units per milliliter to 968 units per milliliter, which is impressive considering this patient was not responsive to prior treatment with frontline FOLFIRINOX. Based on these data and as Nancy mentioned earlier, we plan to continue dose escalation of 5609 to 15 milligrams as a single agent and to 10 milligrams in the gemcitabine combination cohort, in hopes of leveraging the emerging exposure response relationship to enhance clinical activity with higher doses and to better characterize the therapeutic index."
