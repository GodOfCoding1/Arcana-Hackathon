    "content": " Today, we are pleased to report promising preliminary data from our dose confirmation study of SY-2101, which supports advancement of 2101 toward our Phase 3 trial, which is expected to initiate in the second half of 2023. Together, along with the previously announced amendment to our loan agreement with Oxford, we anticipate these transactions will extend our cash runway into 2025, at least one year beyond the expected pivotal data from our ongoing SELECT-MDS-1 Phase 3 trial. Furthermore, across multiple patients treated with 2101 at 10 milligrams or 15 milligrams, which includes those from the original PK study conducted by Orsenix, we continue to be encouraged that we will be able to identify a dose, that can achieve exposures consistent with those of IV ATO for the planned Phase 3 trial. We're continuing to enroll patients in our dose confirmation study and expect to identify the optimal dose to advance into our planned Phase 3 trial, which is expected to initiate in the second half of 2023. The SELECT-AML-1 trial is evaluating the triplet regimen of tamibarotene, venetoclax and azacitidine in RARA-positive patients with AML, and we look forward to providing clinical activity and safety data from the safety lead-in portion of the study in the second half of this year. Following the close of these transactions, we expect to have a cash balance of approximately $240 million and we believe this capital will be sufficient to fund our planned operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements into 2025, which is more than a year past our expected pivotal data readout from our SELECT-MDS-1 trial and also allow us to build out our commercial operations to support the launch of temperate."
