    "content": " Importantly, we believe these proceeds are sufficient to fund our cash requirements past Phase III data from the SELECT-MDS-1 trial and data from the randomized portion of the SELECT-AML-1 trial, while also allowing us to begin investing in pre-commercial activities important in bringing our therapies to market. The randomized portion of the trial is designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of tamibarotene, in combination with ven/aza compared to ven/aza, in approximately 80 newly diagnosed unfit AML patients with RARA overexpression who are randomized 1:1 with composite CR rate as the primary end point. We believe our current cash position will be sufficient to fund our anticipated operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements into the second quarter of 2025 beyond, Phase 3 data from the SELECT-MDS-1 trial and initial data from the randomized portion of the SELECT-AML-1 trial."
