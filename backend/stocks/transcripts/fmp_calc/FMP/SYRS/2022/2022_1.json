    "content": " To start off our SELECT-MDS-1 Phase III clinical trial of tamibarotene and higher-risk MDS continues to be on track, and we look forward to reporting our pivotal data in late 2023 or early 2024, giving us the potential to file a new drug application with the FDA in 2024. We are confident that our clinical pipeline, which is focused on advancing our ongoing Phase II and III trials of tamibarotene for AML and MDS, respectively, our dose confirmation trial of 2101 in APL as well as our 5609 trial in pancreatic cancer will allow us to provide benefit to patients and maximize value for our company and our shareholders. Now just to remind you, and again, just to make sure everyone is familiar enough with the trial design, we had presented at ESMO single-agent data, which showed very clinically important activity in pancreatic cancer patients. And we're going to continue to evaluate the market backdrop and our potential sources of capital to continue to make sure we always have capital available to us, particularly as we head into kind of the end of '23, early '24 trial results for MDS."
