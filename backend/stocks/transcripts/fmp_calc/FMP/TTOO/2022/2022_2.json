    "content": " During the second quarter, our commercial team continued to expand the installed base of T2Dx instruments to increase sepsis test sales, our operations team implemented changes to increase product gross margins, and our R&D team met key development milestones to advance our new product pipeline. I'm pleased to announce that, in July, we received a $600,000 order, the largest sepsis order in company history, which included four T2Dx instruments that are expected to ship in the second half of 2022 and sepsis test panels. Total revenue for the second quarter of 2022 was $5.9 million, a decrease of 12% compared to the prior-year period, driven by decreased COVID-19 test panel sales, offset by increased T2Dx instrument sales and BARDA contract activities. Product costs for the second quarter of 2022 were $5.1 million, an increase of $300,000 compared to the prior-year period, driven by increased T2Dx instrument sales and offset by decreased COVID-19 test panel sales."
