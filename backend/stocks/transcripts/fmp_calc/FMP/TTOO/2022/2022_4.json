    "content": " We're focused on increasing the adoption of our products with emphasis on increasing sales of our Sepsis test panels and expanding the installed base of our T2Dx instruments, while also solidifying commercial plans for our T2Lyme Panel. In 2022, we achieved record full-year Sepsis and related product revenue or non-COVID product revenue of $8.4 million, representing growth of 17% compared to 2021, and we achieved record fourth quarter U.S. Sepsis test revenue. We expect total 2023 Sepsis and related product revenue of $11 million to $13 million, representing growth of 31% to 55% compared to the $8.4 million we achieved in 2022. Product revenue was $2.2 million, a decrease of 45% compared to the prior-year period, driven by the expected 89% decline in COVID-\u00e2\u0081\u00a019 test sales and partially offset by increased Sepsis test sales. Product costs for the fourth quarter of 2022 were $3.8 million, a decrease of 30% compared to the prior-year period driven by decreased COVID-\u00e2\u0081\u00a019 test sales. For guidance, we expect 2023 total Sepsis and related product revenue of $11 million to $13 million, representing growth of 31% to 55% compared to $8.4 million in 2022. In 2022, T2 Biosystems achieved record full-year Sepsis and related product revenue globally, record fourth quarter Sepsis test revenue in the U.S. and record full-year sepsis driven T2Dx instrument contracts. So our revenue, our Sepsis and related product revenue in 2023, we expect to be driven primarily by test cartridges, T2Bacteria, T2Candida, T2Resistance, certainly that will be increased if we're successful in getting T2Resistance in front of and cleared by the FDA."
