    "content": " At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the ARC Document Solutions Quarter Three Earnings Report Conference Call. On the call with me today are Suri Suriyakumar, our CEO and Chairman; our President and Chief Operating Officer, Dilo Wijesuriya; and Jorge Avalos, our Chief Financial Officer. Please note that today's call will contain forward-looking statements and are only predictions based on information as of today, November 2, 2022, and actual results may differ materially as a result of risks and uncertainties that we highlight in our quarterly and annual SEC filings. Today, we are reporting our sixth consecutive quarter of growth in sales, operating income and earnings. The strategy we put in place during 2019 created opportunities for ARC to grow in virtually any environment, primarily because we made diversity and resilience the keys to our success. Today, our customers' desire to communicate is greater than it has ever been. And a few companies offer the kind of visual excitement, creative application and effective branding message that a digital print company like ARC does. While the macro trends can put pressure on any organization, healthy businesses don't communicate less during a downturn. To put our performance in perspective, I'll turn the call over to Dilo and Jorge will follow with a financial review. As we expand our customer base and continue to improve our marketing efforts, we have kept more qualified leads in the hands of our sales force throughout the quarter. Our diversification strategy has many benefits, as demonstrated by the sales growth we have experienced in the past year-and-a-half. Should the country enter a recession, we can shift our target among the wide variety of industry verticals we now address and sell to those customers who need us most. We can also choose among a wide variety of services to find solutions for customers, regardless of their budgets or the nature of their projects. In the third quarter, our sales were up year-over-year in spite of volatile market conditions. Digital printing services, managed print services and document scanning services performed well. Sales from digital printing during the third quarter may appear to be light, but they represent a very successful effort to offset unusually large sales volume from last year. That said, we think it is likely that starting level will remain consistent in the remaining months of the year. As such, printing volume in the fourth quarter will likely remain steady as well. Because we are coming from a small base in this business line, the increase in dollar volume is what excited us most during this period. Many of our jobs require close personal attention by our operations staff, as well as our sales people, and we go out of our way to exceed the increasing expectations of our customers. Finding good people is always a challenge, but we are seeing more and better candidates compared to last year. Getting equipment and supplies has also become easier, though, we are still battling higher pricing for certain materials. I'm also confident we have the people, the services and to demonstrate our value and to keep our customers engaged and interested in working with us. With this as an operational backdrop for the quarter, I'll turn the call over to Jorge for a review of the financials. The sales profit and cash regenerated not only produced healthy performance in the third quarter, but it also helps solidify our capital structure. Gross margins for the period were nearly 34%, representing 110 basis points increase, and $1 million increase in gross profit year-over-year. As a result, our operating income rose more than 16% and our operating margin was up more than 100 basis points and our diluted EPS was $0.01 higher than the prior year. As expected, cash flows from operations accelerated in the third quarter and we remain confident we will meet or exceed last year's cash flows of $36 million. Adjusted EBITDA was affected by higher labor and other inflationary increases, but was still over $11 million and resulted in a healthy margin of 15.3%. Q4 is usually the softest quarter for us, given fewer working days in the period, but we still think sales of $70 million or more are within our reach. As we look at ARC's capital structure, our net debt to EBITDA ratio remains well below 1. Cash on our balance sheet is once again above $50 million, more than offsetting the $42.5 million outstanding on our revolving line of credit. During the quarter, we continue to use available cash to manage our interest expense. As a result, we don't think of ourselves as having any bank debt or exposure to variable interest rates. As projected, finance lease payments for equipment continue to fall as our need for equipment declines. The third quarter finance lease payments of $3.8 million represent a $600,000 or 13.5% decrease from prior year. All of this makes it easy to return shareholder value through our annual dividend of $0.20, which, based on our current stock price, is yielding more than a 7.5% return. Sales continue to grow month over month, quarter over quarter, and our opportunities and pipeline remain strong. ARC and its investors are in a great position as we look forward to the end of the year, and even better one when considering our prospects for 2023. And because we have the locations, we have the equipment, we have the staff, so we don't need another location and another set of equipment and so forth. So, that's our strategy, but we always look for them based on the opportunities that are available in the market. In the last probably three, four years, we've done a good job in modernizing our fleet of hardware in the past. But we always look for newer technology when it is required, but they are all well under control. We're going to see how the market evolves, what the stock price is, and how much cash we have left. Obviously, dividends is one, buying back stock is the second one, and then, of course, reducing the debt. But as Jorge clearly said, there's not a whole lot of debt to be reduced. So, it's a question of opportunistic buying back shares and also dividends. And depending on the conditions and where the stock price is, we will do the needful to make sure we continue to maximize shareholder value. That has been the focus for the last two, three years. As you heard on my script, we have $50 million in cash, we have a very flexible revolver that you can draw on it or pay back at any time, which is at $52 million. So the kind of question of delevering or to paying down debt, from our perspective, we look at it as we don't have bank debt, we kind of offset those two and use available cash to reduce our interest rate or interest expense. We're just wondering, so it looks like you have really strong free cash flow and cash flow from operations. Then the other important fact is that, right now, we're still saddled with capital leases that we had entered into kind of pre-pandemic four years ago, five years ago. As I mentioned in my script, this quarter, we paid $3.7 million or $3.8 million in capital lease payments. Last year, that number was $4.3 million. So you combine those two factors, increasing cash flows with a decrease in cash outflows, that's only going to make your free cash flows become bigger. Kind of like I said before, we don't view ourselves as having any bank debt because the cash we have on hand more than offsets the revolver we have outstanding. So, those will just kind of get paid off as the years progressed. But every year, we're entering into new capital leases to the tune of roughly $8 million a year. So, you will see that number drop, just as we make the required principal payments. You've seen a drop in the last 12 months, probably about $6 million to $8 million. And thanks, everyone, for joining us today."
