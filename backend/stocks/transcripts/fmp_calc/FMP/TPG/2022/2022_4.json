    "content": " Total AUM was $135 billion at year end, a 19% increase year-over-year, driven by strong fund raising and value creation of 8% across our platforms, partially offset by $16 billion of realizations as we selectively monetize investments at attractive valuations. In connection with our fourth quarter results, as Gary mentioned, we announced a quarterly cash dividend of $0.50 per share Class A common stock represent 85% of TPG's after tax distributable earnings. Now turning to fundraising, we raised 3.6 billion of capital in the fourth quarter, primarily focused on new strategies such as TPG Next, and certain areas of our growth platform notably TPG digital media, and T Ted. Against this backdrop, we do expect to continue to gain share this year and it has been helpful that as we entered 2023 LPs can now access the 2023 budgets and across all the flagship funds, we have in the market TPG Capital 9, Healthcare Partners 2, Asia 8 and Rise 3. And then, John mentioned in his comments, the net cost associates carve out from a not for profit and that's, I think indicative of another thing that we're seeing in our pipeline quite a bit, which is the sort of unusual relationships, structured partnerships, our history of being a partner to everyone from Pfizer, Humana, Intel, AT&T, University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, I think that serves us very well when it comes to more problem solving capital. Just given how tapped out LPs were as we entered Q4, and we actually were able to raise, as you saw over 3.5 billion of capital across other businesses, most notably the ones I just mentioned, TTAD Digital Media, there's also some co investment in there on growth and capital as we close those deals and brought in our LPs as co investors, that co investment capital, largely does not pay fees, but it's highly strategic to us."
