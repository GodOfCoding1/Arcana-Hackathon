    "content": " With this backdrop in mind, I'd like to spend a few minutes walking you through some highlights across our business, starting with our largest platform, Capital, which had $57 billion of total AUM at the end of the first quarter. For the quarter, our capital funds generated total realizations of approximately $4 billion, including the $14 billion take-private of McAfee and the recapitalizations of both Novatek Health Holdings, Asia's largest biotech-focused contract research organization; and Greencross, Australia's largest pet care company. During the first quarter, we also returned capital to our Growth fund investors through several transactions, including the full monetization of our stake in Toast, a leading SaaS provider for the restaurant industry, and a partial monetization of our investment in Asia Healthcare Holdings. This platform ended the first quarter with $18 billion of total AUM, which increased more than 40% from the prior quarter, primarily due to raising an additional $4.3 billion of capital for our current opportunistic fund, which now stands at $6.4 billion raised. Finally, I'd like to touch on our Market Solutions platform, which had $10 billion of total AUM at the end of the first quarter across several strategies, including our long, short and long-only public investing funds and Private Market Solutions, which is our secondaries business focused on GP solutions. The drivers of this 26% increase during the last 12 months include $29 billion of value creation from our underlying fund investments and $24 billion from capital raising, partially offset by $29 billion of realizations that were returned to our fund investors during the same period."
