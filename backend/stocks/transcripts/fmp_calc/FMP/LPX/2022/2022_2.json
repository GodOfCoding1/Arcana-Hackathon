    "content": " Siding Solutions grew at 24% year-over-year to hit $356 million in sales, which is another quarterly record. Aside from the EWP divestiture, the short story of the second quarter is that demand for LP's products remain healthy, with the growth of both siding and specialty OSB Structural Solutions, more than offsetting inflationary headwinds. Even though lower OSB prices reduced EBITDA by $195 million the things we can control namely Siding growth and the shift from commodity to specialty OSB, they netted $99 million, just enough to offset raw material inflation, costs for the Houlton and Sagola conversions, and everything else besides. We still expect full year CapEx to be in the $400 million to $430 million range and of the $210 million earmarked for Siding mill conversions, roughly $50 million is for Houlton, the vast majority of which has already been spent and about $130 million is for Sagola, with the bulk of that occurring in the second half of this year. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Obviously the guidance we gave of $200 million -- of about $200 million for the third quarter that includes about the same level of year-over-year raw material inflation that the business experienced in Q2, a very, very, very modest uptick from Q2 to Q3. Your line is open."
