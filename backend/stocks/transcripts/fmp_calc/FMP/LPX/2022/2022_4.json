    "content": " In 2022, LP\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 50th year, we delivered record siding volume and earned $1.4 billion in EBITDA and returned nearly $1 billion to shareholders, including repurchasing 14 million shares. We responded with disciplined management of capacity and exceptional execution by our sales team, which allowed the OSB segment to earn $13 million in EBITDA which is above our algorithmic guidance given how far prices fell. 14% higher prices and 11% volume growth added $212 million of EBITDA, partially offset by $31 million of discretionary investments, meaning no conversion costs in selling and marketing. The volume reduction is caused by market curtailment late in the quarter resulted in $61 million of lower EBITDA in the fourth quarter of 2021, $11 million from commodity OSB and $50 million from higher-priced structural solutions. While the full year waterfall on Page 11 is again dominated by price inflation, I do want to highlight that the $65 million of increased EBITDA from Structural Solutions growth more than offset the $41 million impact from lower commodity volume. The EBITDA story in the right-hand column is similar other than the callout in North America, some of what we can control specifically siding growth, Structural Solutions growth and OSB volume netted a $37 million positive EBITDA contribution.
