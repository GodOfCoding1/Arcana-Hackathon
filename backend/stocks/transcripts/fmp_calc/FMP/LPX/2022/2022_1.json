    "content": " Less obvious is that our record adjusted earnings per share of $5.08 in would have been nearly $1 lower, but for LP's significant share repurchases, which have reduced the share count by more than 20% over the last 12 months. Siding growth of $47 million, Structural Solutions growth of $78 million, offset by a decrease in commodity OSB volume of $12 million, resulted in a net revenue increase of $113 million. Accordingly LP's Board of Directors has approved a further $600 million for share repurchases bringing our total authorization as of yesterday morning to $814 million, which brings me to Page 12 and LP's updated second quarter and full year guidance. Should random length prices remain unchanged from last Friday's levels and assuming no significant worsening of logistics availability, the OSB segment would generate about 7% less revenue in the second quarter than it did in the first quarter. On that basis and assuming no sudden reversals in demand or dramatic increases in costs, LP's consolidated EBITDA for the second quarter of 2022 should be at least $540 million. You may proceed with your question. From an outlook standpoint, I mean it's really a pleasing to have such a good start-up in Houlton, so that we'll have that extra capacity to sell, beginning right now and certainly a growing volume availability as we get confident there making A-grade production throughout the year. You may proceed with your question. You may proceed with your question. You may proceed with your question. You may proceed with your question. You may proceed with your question. You may proceed with your question."
