    "content": " Against this backdrop, we were able to increase our revenue to $155.6 million in 2022, an increase of 31% as compared to 2021, primarily driven by the strength of our performance in Canada and the U.S. which experienced year-over-year revenue growth of 38% and 32%, respectively. Putting this together, as a result, we believe our total SG&A expense could increase by 10% to 12% in 2023 relative to 2022 levels, but that SG&A as a percentage of revenue will continue to decline supporting EBITDA margin expansion. We expect to generate positive free cash flow in 2023 as the cash generated from operations is expected to fund both working capital increases, supporting further revenue growth, and strategic capital investments we will make in our business. Underpinning our revenue growth expectations is anticipated year-over-year average annual industry growth of up to 10% in both Canada and the U.S., though activity in the U.S. is expected to be below the levels reached in the fourth quarter of 2022. But as we turn to 2023, the underlying earnings in the business are higher and the level of growth, the rate of growth, while still good at more than 15% is moderating a bit, which will allow us to convert that sort of operating cash flow before working capital build into true free cash flow for the business this year."
