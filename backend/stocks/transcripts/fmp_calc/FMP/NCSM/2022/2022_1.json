    "content": " Starting with the U.S., our revenue of $9.1 million in the first quarter was at the low end of our guidance of $9 million to $10 million as completions activity started slowly in January before improving during the remainder of the quarter. As reported in yesterday's earnings release, our first quarter revenues were $39.1 million, 37% higher than the prior year's first quarter. Gross profit, defined as total revenue less total cost of sales, excluding depreciation and amortization expense was $14.9 million in the first quarter or 38% of revenue compared to $10.2 million or 36% of revenue in the prior year's first quarter. For a sequential comparison, our gross profit was $15.9 million or 44% of revenue in the fourth quarter of last year. Our selling, general and administrative costs were $16 million in the first quarter, which was $3.2 million higher than the first quarter of last year, primarily driven by increased compensation expense for salary and benefit restorations and salary increases. In the first quarter, our non-recurring litigation expense totaled $2.1 million and our non-cash share-based compensation expense was $0.8 million. Our adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter was $2.3 million, which compares to $100,000 in the prior year's first quarter, an improvement of $2.2 million. Our cash flow from operations for the first quarter was negative $6 million, and our net capital expenditures for the first quarter were approximately $100,000, resulting in free cash flow for the quarter of negative $6.2 million. Within this, we expect U.S. revenue of $11.5 million to $12.5 million; international revenue of $3 million to $4.5 million, recovering from the lower levels in the first quarter, and we expect our Canadian revenue to be between $11.5 million and $12.5 million, reflecting the seasonal impact of spring breakup. We expect our reported SG&A to be between $14.5 million and $15.5 million for the second quarter, including approximately $0.8 million in non-cash share-based compensation and $1.3 million in litigation expenses."
