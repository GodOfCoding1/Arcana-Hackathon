    "content": " In last year's third quarter, sales within the U.S. accounted for 70% of our company's revenue, while the EMEA and the APAC regions were only 18% and 8%, respectively. In addition to continuing to grow our instrument base and overall revenue, I want to again acknowledge our team's successful efforts this quarter and throughout the whole of 2022 in operating in the face of challenging macro conditions and achieved strong results. And on top of that, we reported net income of $1.6 million, and our adjusted EBITDA grew significantly from last year's third quarter. Total revenue for the third quarter of 2022 was $40.5 million, an 18% increase over the third quarter of 2021. Despite our revenue coming in slightly below our expectations as a result of the timing dynamics and FX impact I mentioned, we achieved net income of $1.6 million this quarter compared to $1.4 million for the third quarter of 2021. I'm proud once again of Cytek's achievement this quarter and throughout the duration of 2022, punctuated by our strong gross profit margin, net income and adjusted EBITDA results."
