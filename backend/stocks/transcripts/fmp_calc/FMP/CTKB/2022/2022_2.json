If you haven't received this news release or if you'd like to be added to the company's distribution list, please send an e-mail to investors@cytekbio.com. Joining me today from Cytek are Wenbin Jiang, CEO; and Patrik Jeanmonod, Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that we will make statements during this call that are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including statements regarding Cytek's business plans, strategies, opportunities, and financial projections. Except as required by law, Cytek disclaims any duty to update any forward-looking statements, whether because of new information, future events, or changes in its expectations. This conference call contains time-sensitive information and is accurate only as of the live broadcast, August 10th, 2022. On today's call, I will begin with a recap of our progress this year and discuss how Cytek continues to advance towards our mission and vision. Cytek continues to stand apart in the field as we provide our customers with an end-to-end solution consisting of instruments, reagents, software, and application services. Since our inception, we have continued to develop and launch new products and services which have been validated in the field by our robust customer base. Beyond our original suite of instruments, which continue to see solid demand, we expect our reagents and recently launched cells orders to contribute considerably to our future enterprise revenue growth. We see this further diversification of our revenue stream, including a growing contribution from recurring revenue, lifting of services, and the reagents playing an important role in site exclusion. During the second quarter, we placed for 130 instruments, bringing our total installed base for 1,356 instruments as of the end of Q2. These placements are also aligned with our core strategy and we have continued to achieve solid adoption with high dimensional cell analysis users, while also improve special profiling to entry level users. Since first being introduced in 2017, our cell analysis systems have gained the widespread adoption across the globe with use in more than 40 countries. As Patrik will discuss later, our efforts have once again translated to strong revenue growth this quarter, with revenue increasing 32% over the prior year second quarter. Once again, our team continue to execute well and achieve operational excellence. In all, we continue to be focused on execution and I remain confident in the Cytek team demonstrated the ability to manage the flow this environment and continue to succeed despite the ongoing challenges. At the end of May, we announced that a Series of single-color cFluor reagents and a 6-color TBNK kite have received CE marking under the European Union IVDD 98/79/EC. With this development, clinical flow cytometry laboratories based in the European Union can now purchase Cytek cFluor CE-IVD certified reagents for their use. This exciting achievement makes the cFluor reagent available for clinical diagnostic use in hospitals, laboratories, and clinics across the EU and positions us a path to offering a total sales analysis solution to the European market. At the event, we had the only Cell Sorter that was actually running the show flow, which enabled us to perform live demonstrations showing the power of combining analysis with Cell Sorting. Overall, this year's Cyto Conference was a very successful event for Cytek. In addition to our executive providing a deep dive into flow cytometry, we showcase four key opinion leader users of our products and services, who illustrated the power of our solutions, and the important value we bring to our customers. The KOL who spoke are scientists and physicians in the research and the clinical field, who focus largely on oncology, but also HIV, diabetes, inflammation, aging, and the multiple aspects of the COVID pandemic, demonstrating the breadth of Cytek's technology. These experts spoke to the dramatic expansion in capabilities, sensitivity, and the accuracy they have achieved from Cytek machines, reagents, and the software as well as the consistency of results and the significant cost savings they have obtained. One KOL, who operates the core clinical laboratory said that Cytek's machines saves from 15% to 200% in cost for running samples, which is due to being 300% faster than competing technology. He observed that Cytek's ability to run more samples in fewer tools, produces results in less time, gives faster diagnosis, allows treatments to beginning sooner, allows a more specific therapeutic approach, consumed fewer resources, cost less, and allows hospitals to make patient discharge decisions more quickly, thus saving further costs. Two KOLs said that Cytek's flow cytometers have become the default tool for spectral analysis, simplifying the technical skills needed and unleashing the power that artificial intelligence can offer. As we continue to grow our offerings and the base of instruments, reagents and services, our technology has now been validated by 768 peer reviewed publications as of the end of the quarter. This quarter alone, there were 116 peer reviewed publications mentioning Cytek. A notable publication was on Roswell Park Cancer Center entitled development of a 27-color panel for the detection of measurable residual disease in patients diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia, in which the researcher used only one to reducing costs and improving workflow. In all, I'm pleased with the progress our team has made this quarter and the expect to make throughout the remainder of the year as we continue to establish ourselves as a leading cell analysis solution company. As we continue to push forward a cadence of new products and applications, we remain deeply focused on providing a complete cell analysis solution to our customers. We look forward to continuing to provide our novel  to these customers, as they push the bounds of scientific discoveries and the clinical progress. Total revenue for the second quarter of 2022 was $40.2 million, or 32% increase over the second quarter of 2021. Gross profit was $24.6 million for the second quarter of 2022, an increase of 24% compared to a gross profit of $19.7 million in the second quarter of 2021. Adjusted gross profit margin in the second quarter of 2022 was 64% compared to 65% in the second quarter of 2021 after adjusting for stock-based compensation expense, and amortization of acquisition related intangibles. Operating expenses were $25.5 million for the second quarter of 2022, a 60% increase from $15.9 million in the second quarter of 2021. The increase was primarily due to expense to support continued growth of the business, including further investment in sales and marketing, R&D, and cost related to operating as a public company. General and administrative expenses were $8.6 million for the second quarter of 2022, an increase from $4.2 million in the second quarter of 2021. Turning to our guidance, we continue to expect full year 2022 revenue to be closer to the high end of the range of $160 million to $168 million. While we have seen an increase in foreign currency exchange headwinds, namely, through the euro, the growing momentum in our business gives us the confidence and ability to maintain our full year guidance. I'm pleased to say that our organization is in a strong position financially, continues to see solid demand, and is committed to remain profitable on an EBITDA and net income basis annually and as well as achieving our long-term growth targets and objectives. We will continue to invest in our core business as it relates to new projects and innovation, while remaining opportunistic in the M&A environment and focusing on growth in all key areas. Again, this quarter, Cytek has continued to demonstrate our commitment to developing tools, reagents, and the software to advance the next generation of cell analysis. So, to your first question -- target some near-term, some longer term just for the percentage of total revenues that can be generated from reagents kits a few months ago, and clearly there's a lot of macro factors and other regional dynamics in play, that are impacting both supply and demand are no life science research tools product. So, we had another very solid quarter on the reagent from last year, just because we had a small base from last year. So, we were impacted with -- or I would say we were impacted aggressively with some maybe 3% to 5% on the total revenue. But outside of that, I think it's marching towards our expectation. I would say that we deliver another quarter very solid financials, and I think it's positioned us very well for another great year. And then another insight from the Analyst Day is the evaluation of clinical in a flow cytometry labs, in terms of the performance of instruments that are supporting clinical applications, along with their operational efficiency, turnaround time, et cetera. In fact the CE marking provides us a new opportunity to serve the clinical tenders in Europe, that including our CE certified instrument as well as the originals. So certainly, it's still new to us. Maybe just first, at a -- I guess at a high level because I know you don't necessarily break out the different instruments. It's been a year since you've launched the Cell Sorter and just given the ASP of the Cell Sorter and the potential impact on margins, maybe just kind of give us an update on the progression of each instrument category or maybe just specifically, I'm interested in the cell sorter as well the progress given the time that's elapsed since launch? So, on the cell sorter what I can say that we don't really break out information but we are a record number of sales sort of this quarter. But yes, this quarter, we had a very strong quarter on Cell Sorter. Yes, so the expectation is that the gross profit margin will fail -- will gradually improve over time, especially as we roll out the reagents that typically have a higher gross profit margin. And as we also continue to globalize our processes, we have seen, as I said earlier, a little bit of a headwind on the on the effects position, but I think we've been able to manage that quite well, in this quarter. I want to actually start with probably a question probably more for Patrik, because it's on inventory. We're picking up a lot of -- I mean, you've talked about supply chain on the call. We're picking up from a lot of companies that they're having to be opportunistic with, with supply chain and parts and when things become available, they're, they're kind of just buying right then and buying in big numbers. So, and you'll see that looking at the balance sheet, our inventory level is now at the highest, it's been 45 million, up from 32 million. So, substantially higher, if I look at last year, and I think what we're doing here is we, to your point, I mean, we try to ensure that we have sufficient parts in stock in inventory, so that we can continue to deliver and provide the best service to our customers. So, I think we've done a pretty good job, which has a cost, sadly, which is having slightly higher inventory. So we will probably -- I'm expecting the inventory to continue to build a little bit over time, but it should not be as dramatic that we've seen since December. Yes, in addition to the MRD, which we have talked about, in fact, we have quite a few collaboration partnerships ongoing today, with clinical laboratories in the world across many several countries that includes applications in such as immuno-profiling and other type of research projects as well as the clinical activities. And then just really, for the last one, this one to be nice -- sorry, I cut out. And then just maybe just one last question, if I can. Patrik on the guidance, there was one -- it's still that $162 million to $168 million. It's just the stylistic thing, versus I just was wondering if maybe there is some things that could happen that would still hit the low end of the guidance, for example, maybe supply chain, recession in Europe, again, I'm just trying to get some color, whether that's stylistic, or this is the first time I've worked with you as a CFO. But then all we I think we feel pretty good about the I mean, we reiterate reiterating our guidance, despite the -- some FX headwind, if I can call it this way, and it will be on the higher end, yes. And if you're not any color on that, because we're starting to pick up sort of signs of that happening with some of the other instruments focus life science plays out there. And in Europe, we do see some delayed process, takes longer time to close, but the business is still there. Yes, so, I mean, currently, as I said, I mean, we came with our guidance, we feel a little bit of headwinds, especially coming from Europe on the FX side, I mean, the euro against the dollar has weakened substantially. So, for us, we feel good about the second half to be in that kind of $168 million range, and I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t if that answers your question. And as we touched earlier -- mentioned, we have been building inventory not only on the product side, as well as on the instrument side to make sure we will be able to serve our customers."
