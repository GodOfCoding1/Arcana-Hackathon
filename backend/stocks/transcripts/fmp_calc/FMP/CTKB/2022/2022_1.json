And now I'd like to introduce your host for today's program, Paul Goodson, Investor Relations. Earlier today, Cytek Biosciences released financial results for the quarter ended March 31, 2022. If you haven't received this news release or if you'd like to be added to the company's distribution list, please send an e-mail to investors@cytekbio.com. Joining me today from Cytek are Wenbin Jiang, CEO; and Patrik Jeanmonod, Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that management will make statements during this call that are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including statements regarding Cytek's business plans, strategies, opportunities and financial projections. Except as required by law, Cytek disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether because of new information, future events or otherwise. This conference call contains time-sensitive information and is accurate only as of the live broadcast, May 11, 2022. On today's call, I will begin with a brief overview of our company. Next, I will discuss our recent progress since the end of 2021. For those of you new to the Cytek story, we are a leading cell analysis solutions company advancing the next generation of cell analysis tools by leveraging novel technical approach to create our full special profiling or FSP platform. Our FSP platform includes instruments, reagents, software and application services and utilizes the full spectrum of fluorescent signatures to deliver high resolution, high content and high sensitivity cell analysis. While flow cytometry is a widely used tool for single-cell analysis, conventional flow cytometry and the early approach to special flow cytometry have been challenged as they are able to detect only a few markets in a single tube. Their limited dimensionality, suboptimal resolution, low throughput, high cost for performance and with a significant technical expertise required to operate their systems has limited scientific progress in the advanced cell analysis field. By contrast, Cytek is transforming the full cytometry industry through technology disruption. This novel technological application allows us to address the inherent limitations of other technologies by providing a higher density of information with greater sensitivity, more flexibility and increased efficiency, all at a lower cost for performance. Part of our performance and the cost advantage, which helps our manufacturing consistency and operating gross margin is due to the application of life detection technology adopted from the telecom industry. Meanwhile, this is not the case with conventional flow cytometry, which continues to use expensive backing the detection technology. Our innovative technology has been validated by the 463 peer developed publications as well as over 1,200 instrument placements as of the end of the quarter and a growing number of applications. At Cytek, we provide our customers with an end-to-end solution consisting of instruments, diligence, software and application services. In addition to our robust suite of comprehensive solutions, last year, we began shipping our sales orders, which enable additional downstream genomic and proteomic analysis. Importantly, our sorters allow researchers to isolate living cell populations from higher complexity panels beyond the 40 biomarkers, while our cell analyzers have been strong drivers of our revenue growth to date, we expect that reagents and cell sorters will play an important role in driving our revenue growth over the next 3 to 5 years. In the first quarter, we placed 116 instruments, bringing our total installed base to 1,226 instruments as of the end of Q1. As Patrik will discuss later, we once again achieved a strong revenue growth this quarter with revenue increasing 44% over the prior year. Even in the face of macro pressure, including global supply chain disruptions, our team continued to execute well and achieve operational excellence. While the industry as a whole is experiencing a difficult operating environment and Cytek has not been immune to inflationary pressures, our benefited team is managing through in part by leveraging our global workforce. In all, we continue to be force along execution and I'm confident in our team's total ability to manage through this environment and continue to succeed. We began the year by announcing the opening of our new facility in Fremont, California, which tripled our previous manufacturing capacity to meet growing global demand for cell analysis solutions. In addition to the new Fremont location, we also opened new offices in Seattle, Washington, which are dedicated to key R&D initiatives and the customer application support. Todd's expansive experience, including previous roles at Cardinal Health, CareFusion and most recently at BD Biosciences will bring tremendous value to our organization. Since first being introduced in 2017, our cell analysis systems have gained widespread adoption across the globe with use in more than 40 countries. And now we have seen great traction in diversifying our revenue base through the launch of new products, including recurring sources from reagent sales. While still a smaller part of our overall revenue, demand for our reagents is growing rapidly, and we are excited for the potential of this contribution to our enterprise. As I mentioned earlier, our technology has been renovated by 463 peer-reviewed publications as of the end of the quarter. And this quarter, there were 95 peer-reviewed publications mentioning Cytek the highest figure in any quarter so far since Cytek was founded. During the first quarter of this year, for example, there were 2 particular papers in Nature and in Natural Communications examining issues related to COVID-19. In all, I'm excited by the progress our team has made this quarter and expect to make throughout the course of the year as we continue to establish ourselves as the leading cell analysis solutions company. As we push forward a cadence of new products and applications, we are deeply focused on providing a complete cell analysis solution to our customers. Total revenue for the first quarter of 2022 was $35.1 million, a 44% increase over the first quarter of 2021. We continue to see demand across the entire portfolio of Cytek offerings, including service revenue that has more than doubled from 1 year ago as instruments come off their warranty. Gross profit was $20.2 million for the first quarter of 2022, an increase of 39% compared to a gross profit of $14.5 million in the first quarter of 2021. Operating expenses were $22.5 million for the first quarter of 2022, a 69% increase from $13.4 million in the first quarter of 2021. The increase was primarily due to expenses to support continued growth of the business including further investment in sales and marketing, R&D and costs related to operating as a public company. General and administrative expenses were $7.5 million for the first quarter of 2022, an increase from $4 million for the first quarter of 2021. Adjusted EBITDA in the first quarter of 2022 was $1.9 million compared to $1.1 million in the first quarter of 2021, after adjusting for stock-based compensation expense and foreign currency exchange impact. With our strong performance in Q1, we now expect full year 2022 revenue to be closer to the high end of the range of USD160 million to USD168 million. Before I conclude, I would also like to touch on some assumptions embedded in our 2022 guidance. We remain in a strong position financially, continue to see strong demand for our instruments and remain focused on maintaining our profitability as well as achieving our long-term growth targets and objectives. Because Cytek's goal is to be profitable on a net income and EBITDA basis annually, we do not anticipate the need for future capital raises to meet operating needs. And later that month, we will be hosting our first Analyst Day in New York City. It would just be great to hear what to achieve the high end of that range, what you need to see in terms of regional demand trends, any expectations for some of the COVID lockdowns end up progressing. And then if you could just make any mention of expectations for specific instrument placements, whether you expect strength in certain instrument or another, that would be great. And I can take that first question, Max. So well, we expect to carry the momentum forward based on what we've seen in Q1. We've continued to see very strong demand on the key instruments, the Aurora top of the line, the northern light, and as we roll out the reagent business as well. Actually, this is one of the R&D project currently we studied and by our scientists and together with our partners, but we expect we'll have more data to be shared towards the end of the year. Maybe, Patrik, just first one for you on gross margins. I think Q1 was a little lower than we were expecting, but still high on a relative basis. We're also launching, as you know, the reagent business, that's typically a higher gross profit margin. And then in terms of instrument mix, I know in previous quarters, you've talked about maybe Aurora out-selling Northern Lights. I think in previous quarters, you talked about kind of the flow cytometry instruments providing a good groundwork for selling a cell sorter. First, we have the initial setup plan and work with the customers to help them to start the experiment normally. And for the publications, it takes probably about 12 to 18 months to see something really start to show up. So at this time, we don't have anything we can share publicly, but you should expect to see something you mentioned. So I'm going to continue a little bit with Max's question, but I'm going to ask it differently, and hopefully, maybe you can answer it this way. I think both types of customers exist actually, as you can see from our customer portfolios, more than 50% of our customers,  customers are pharma biotech, right, and the rest are academia. I think currently, it's going very well, as I mentioned. And even though it's still a small portion of our overall revenue, but the growth rate is quite high. I asked this last quarter, and I guess you did see some new competitive launches earlier in the year. As you can see, based on the momentum we have seen, clearly, we can't see any impact to our business. And I know you don't have much of a revenue sort of exposure there to the region, but it's an important sort of clinical priority for you, and you've got supply and manufacturing exposure there. However, we have planned very well, and this is already taken into account in our financial model and also because of the structure we have built into our process as indicated with the inventory with the manufacturing planning, I think all of those have been taken into account. So at least if the market stays as is, our situation stay as is, we don't foresee any real impact to our business for the year. I think, yes, this is -- actually the reagent is a faster-growing sector of our business right now. In the past, you've mentioned the replacement cycle nature of the industry and you sort of punching above your weight in terms of gaining share every time also cytometer comes up for replacement. And I think based on our funnel, definitely it's still within what we think we can do, and there's no real impact to our current forecast right now."
