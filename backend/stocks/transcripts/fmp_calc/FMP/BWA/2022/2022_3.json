    "content": " And that's part of the reason that you see in my remarks, that the net impact that we're now expect on a year from material cost inflation is down from our prior guide, it's $110 million to $120 million, which is a $35 million improvement from what we guided to last quarter. And then at the low end of our guidance range, as you look at Q4, that it's actually not being offset, it's really flowing through that $35 million benefit, which is why we raised the bottom end from 9.8% to 10%. At the upper-end of that range we have -- you see revenue a little bit down, and that's really driven entirely by foreign exchange, it's about a $90 million headwind going sequentially from Q3 to Q4. If you look at the low end of the range, we're still assuming about that $90 million foreign exchange related headwind, but then there's about $280 million sequential headwind in organic growth. And if you look at the low end of our guide, which is around 9.5% or so in Q4, it's really jumping off that adjusted Q3 level, and then recognizing that we have downside conversion on that, roughly, $280 million organic decline sequentially. And we've also been repurchasing stock as well, $100 million in the quarter, which means it's $240 million year-to-date."
