    "content": " As you see the growth that we're generating this year and the incremental margin that we're generating on that revenue growth this year, 2/3 of which comes from our eProduct portfolio you can see that the growth in contribution margin is effectively outpacing the growth in the eProducts related to R&D, which means that 2023, we are seeing improving profitability coming from that portfolio in totality, and continue to believe that we're on track that as we exit 23 and added to the beginning of '24, that portfolio is approaching breakeven."
