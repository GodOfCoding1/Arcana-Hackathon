    "content": " Of this, approximately 40 basis points, or just over $60 million, is the result of higher commodity and other inflationary costs, net of additional pricing recoveries, and about 10 basis points relates to the Santroll acquisition, which is expected to be modestly diluted this year. Your line is open. With the 60 million addition where we're actually at on a full year basis for both elements, the commodity piece and the other inflationary pressures, it's about $130 million to $140 million net. Your line is open. Your line is open. We're very happy with the intensity of discussion with the customers' intensity of quotes and book business, and also very happy with the increase of 130 million to 160 million year-over-year on R&D on E. And we want to maintain that. Your line is open. And then on top of that, we expect that we'll see significant progress even over the next 90 days or so, as we work with our customers on these recovery mechanisms, which should help to further mitigate some of the headwinds that we're expecting to see there as part of that 130 million to 140 million net. It's net of our assumption about pricing recoveries, which is both the normal contractual commodity recoveries which is still working the way they're designed at 50%, but also an assumption that we're going to be continuing to work with our customers to try to recover some of the extra inflationary impacts that we're seeing. But I guess my question is, so at the end of the day you're left by the end of the year with sort of like this headwind to your margin profile of $130 million to $140 million net of recoveries. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open."
