    "content": " Putting a finer point on it, revenues from industry-leading customers in the communications market led the way, driving 13% growth in datacom, thanks to a banner year of market share gains and exciting new product launches that serve the largest hyperscalers. The award-winning Photonic Solutions segment, a business that had less than $100 million in annual sales when we acquired them in 2010, reached a phenomenal $2.2 billion in revenue this year, growing 9% year-over-year. Our purpose-built Steelerton DSP is a key enabler of our industry\u00e2\u0080\u0099s first 100ZR QSFP28 pluggable coherent transceiver for the network edge, a market that analysts estimate to be $750 million by calendar year 2026. Including the former Coherent, the laser segment, using their trailing 12-month revenue, the pro forma annual end-market fiscal year \u00e2\u0080\u009822 breakdown is Industrial, 38%; Communications, 45%; Electronics, 7%; and Instrumentation 10%."
