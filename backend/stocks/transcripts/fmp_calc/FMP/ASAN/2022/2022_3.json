    "content": " As you can see from our results, the momentum at Asana continued into Q3, we\u2019re now at an annualized quarterly revenue run rate of over $400 million. Our larger customers grew even faster, with 96% year-over-year revenue growth from customers spending $5,000 or more and considerable momentum in enterprises with a number of customers spending $50,000 or more accelerating for the third consecutive quarter. And I\u2019ll just add, I think that, part of your question is, is that a harbinger of doom or something like that, and so I\u2019ll just reiterate, we\u2019re really excited about the enterprise momentum and we raised guidance for next quarter by $12 million."
