    "content": " The number of customers spending over $50,000 on an annualized basis grew 111% year-over-year, which reflected an acceleration in our largest enterprise customers and dollar-based net retention rate increased across all of our customer cohorts. As we look forward to the second half of the year and beyond, we\u2019re continuing to focus our business on 3 major growth drivers: acquiring new customers; expanding our existing customer base; and maintaining our enterprise momentum. And a really interesting use case that\u2019s pretty typical, and I think a sweet spot for Asana is creating standard processes for rapidly launching their services into new cities and countries to move faster and sustain their rapid growth. I think we\u2019re really encouraged by the momentum that we\u2019ve seen in the business, kind of the \u2013 both on the top of the funnel, customer growth and seat growth as well as kind of ACV, ASP growth. But it\u2019s really important for us to continue to add new customers and teams of all sizes, because we know once they adopt our net expansion rate, as you have seen that it\u2019s over 118%, as we get more teams adopted, those rates tend to move up as their spend increases."
