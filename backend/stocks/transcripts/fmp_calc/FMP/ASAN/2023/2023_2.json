    "content": " Across our customers spending $100,000 or more, the dollar-based-net retention rate is well over 145%, illustrating that we are not only winning large deals but these large deals have the highest expansion rate among our customer cohorts. This number jumps to over 60% for customers spending more than $100,000, and we see an even higher proportion of this cross-functional collaboration in the features we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve built as we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve moved up market, including Goals & Portfolios. We now have 462 customers spending over $100,000 on an annualized basis, and these larger deals represent our fastest growing customer cohort, up 105% year-over-year. So, as we enter -- something that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re really excited about is as we enter the season where a lot of our customers and prospective customers are doing strategic planning, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re doing Goals planning, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also driving much more interest in Asana."
