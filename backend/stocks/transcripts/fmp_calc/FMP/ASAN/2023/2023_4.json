    "content": " We'll also be elevating our sales playbook to focus primarily on high ROI workflows, quick time-to-value use cases, digital transformation, goals and reporting, and ensuring that customers understand and experience that Asana is a must have. So the rules, the automation, the workflows are really helping to make sure that there's no more siloed work for them that there's improved accountability and it's also providing more time for their teams to focus on innovation and improving customer experience for their millions of global customers. like Asana Intelligence, a different version of AI, but it's also collaborative intelligence because really, everyone is in putting their own view of the work graph, but we're able to provide views and insights that really take all those bits of information and put them into more of a coherent story. And then the higher paying accounts, which are many times are kind of the enterprise customers, where you don't see logo churn and you really see more seat expansion -- so I would say that's an area where we've done a lot of focus and kind of shifted our -- both our marketing spend and our sales capacity and trying to move upmarket."
