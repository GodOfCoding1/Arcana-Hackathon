    "content": " So how do we think about -- I know you're not guiding to it, but at least at a high level, what's the right way to think about cash flow progression this year just given the construct of the balance sheet, you clearly have enough money to go for a long time. I think what we've tended to do with the mid-market and larger accounts is definitely create structures where there's predictable billing for them and total cost of ownership and making sure that from -- as Dustin mentioned earlier, our priority really is on expansion of paid seats in these accounts because we really see that the stronger the adoption and the more employees that are using Asana, the faster that companies are realizing value. So we tend to -- depending on if it's a multiyear deal, we'll structure it primarily to make sure that customers have predictability and budget, but it's really focused on adoption, expansion and growth. I think there's a possible world where the uncertainty itself is sort of looming large at the beginning of the cycle, but even if things trend negatively if there's sort of definitiveness around it and people can sort of make their -- make models that they believe in, then I still think that they can move forward with confidence on software purchases, especially again, if they're going to help improve productivity and help improve efficiency, that's something they may even be more interested in. And I think what you're seeing now is you should expect G&A to moderate, and that we'll see a lot more leverage as we continue to grow the top line, really focus our efforts around building sales capacity, sales enablement, customer-facing teams, and that the infrastructure we put in place now can support a very large business."
