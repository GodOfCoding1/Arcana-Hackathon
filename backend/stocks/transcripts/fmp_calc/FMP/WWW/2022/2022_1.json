    "content": " As a result of this change, combined with the impact of delayed product launches due to supply chain challenges and shifts in consumer sentiment towards experiential spending, ecommerce sales did not meet our expectations during the quarter, including our newly acquired Sweaty Betty business, first quarter direct-to-consumer revenue increased 24%. Excluding Sweaty Betty international revenue grew 10% driven by growth in our third-party distributor business, its recovery seen in our top markets, as well as strong performance in our China joint venture. Despite the ecommerce decline in the first quarter, we expect our direct-to-consumer businesses to approach 30% of global revenue in our international markets to be over 35% of global revenue for the full year. Please go ahead with your question. Please go ahead with your question. Please go ahead with your question. Please go ahead with your question. If we do expect good growth for the full year on ecommerce, but including, when we talk about 30%, direct-to-consumer, that includes Sweaty Betty's store and ecom business as well. Please go ahead with your question. And Julia and her team were here last week, doing a site tour to -- as we've mentioned before, look at opening backup stores in the U.S. And that growth rate is heavily focused in the back half of the year, but also includes the expansion of new stores, both in their home markets in Europe, as well as some new stores here in the U.S. as some of the growth that we'll see comes from that expansion as well as just the heavy weighting that's traditionally part of the Sweaty Betty business in the fourth quarter. Please go ahead with your question. Please go ahead with your question."
