    "content": " But as far as the operating margin performance in the future, especially as we start to think about crystallizing, some of the synergies we have for the business next year, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099d expect Sweaty Betty to contribute at a higher level from a, both a profit and cash flow standpoint as early as next year. And with the lead times that we have right now, frankly coming out of factories and the ability to kind of plan the business even for next year on those core franchises and that core carryover product, I think we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re quite comfortable that, that there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not going to need to be any kind of dramatic liquidation around the core."
