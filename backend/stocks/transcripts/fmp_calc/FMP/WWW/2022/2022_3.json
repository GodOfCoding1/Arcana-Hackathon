    "content": " While we were pleased to deliver third quarter revenue growth of 9%, 12% on a constant currency basis, both revenue and profit came in below our expectations reflecting ongoing supply chain disruptions, heightened promotional activity, deteriorating macro conditions. Merrell delivered a record third quarter with revenue of $199 million, up 39% compared to the prior year on a constant currency basis with strong growth across regions, channels and categories. Moving on to Saucony, third quarter revenue came in below our expectations at $130 million down 1% compared to last year but up 4% in constant currency, primarily due to late deliveries caused by congestion in our warehouse and inland transportation network and weakness in the U.S. wholesale distribution. Adjusted Q3 gross margin of 40.3% was below our outlook mostly due to higher promotions in our D2C channels and lower than expected wholesale revenue for Sperry Ked, Sweaty Betty and Wolverine brand. Adjusted selling, general and administrative expenses of $216.4 million were up $8.7 million or 4.2% compared to the prior year including one additional month of Sweaty Betty expenses this year and higher marketing spend for Merrell and Saucony.
