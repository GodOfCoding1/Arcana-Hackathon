    "content": " Furthermore, we achieved double-digit OIBDA growth in reported terms in Brazil and mid- to high single-digit OIBDA growth in Hispam, Germany and the U.K. As much as 80% of our revenue base has tariff mechanisms that protect us against inflation, including inflation-linked tariffs in most of our LatAm exposure. Revenue grew by 5.2% year-on-year organically in the first quarter, reflecting sustained mobile revenue growth on the back of continued good commercial traction of the O2 brand and some support from the recovery of international roaming. OIBDA posted strong organic growth of plus 7% year-on-year in Q1 '22, with improved operational leverage in both fixed and mobile, reflecting own brand momentum, further efficiency gains as well as some international roaming tailwinds. Looking at the financials, revenue was broadly stable in the first quarter, whilst OIBDA grew by 2.6% on an organic basis due to cost savings following the migration of the Virgin Mobile MVNO base, lower sales and commission costs and the start of the flow-through of cost synergies, which will ramp through the year. During Q1 '22, Telxius Subsea Cable maintained strong commercial momentum, evidenced by the 65% growth in full contract value, which contributed to high single-digit year-on-year OIBDA growth in reported terms.
