    "content": " OIBDA year-on-year improved by 0.6 percentage points sequentially to minus 2.8% year-on-year in Q3 '22 on a lower energy drag, content cost deflation and ongoing efficiencies from the redundancy plan and network transformation. In the third quarter, OIBDA growth accelerated to plus 8.1% year-on-year, which includes a 3.3 percentage point impact of a noncash, nonrecurrent effect and was also supported by the delivery of synergies and continued cost efficiencies. On another front, during the first 9 months of the year, Telxius subsea cable maintained its strong commercial momentum which, together with good cost management, fueled year-on-year OIBDA growth of 13.6% organically and 26.3% on a reported basis."
