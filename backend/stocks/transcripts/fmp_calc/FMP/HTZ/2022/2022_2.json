    "content": " In the quarter, our performance facilitated continued investment in fleet and non-fleet CapEx as well as the repurchase of $890 million of stock through open market purchases, completing our initial $2 billion authorization. Beginning in the second quarter, we challenged ourselves as to the level of fleet we would target for the balance of the year, taking stock of high current residual pricing on used cars and questions about more modest demand late in the year. And where demand materializes higher than seasonal expectations, so higher in the third quarter, then we will in fleet, and we can do that kind of within a 30-day window where we can go out just as we did this summer and buy good quality used cars to sort of meet demand that's there."
