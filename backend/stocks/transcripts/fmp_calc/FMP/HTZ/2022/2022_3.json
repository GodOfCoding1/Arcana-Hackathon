    "content": " Before we begin our earnings discussion, I want to focus for a moment on Hurricane Ian, which brought considerable devastation to Southwest Florida just weeks ago, including to our home town of Estero. Having been in Florida with our employees, customers, local officials and relief organizations, I've been struck by the resilience and perseverance of Hertz employees to be in the service of our neighbors and customers. Our results were the product of strong demand across leisure, corporate and rideshare, high utilization, a stable rate environment and actions intended to further our stated strategy of managing fleet to suit demand. Third quarter revenue was $2.5 billion, up 12% year-over-year, and up 6% quarter-over-quarter. This significant free cash flow generation enabled us to invest across our business, as well as reduce our capital base in the quarter by 7% through share repurchases. The third quarter was characterized by continued strength in rate across all customer segments, with increased contribution of revenue from value added services, and particularly strong pull through of corporate demand. Through the quarter, we experienced better than expected movement in revenue per day, and revenue per unit with each up 3% and 5%, respectively versus Q2. Beyond positive volume trends we also experienced improved operating performance as the quarter progress, including a lower direct operating expense space, fewer out of service vehicles and more active fleet rotation. RPD in Q3 was $68.57 and RPU as a record $1,685. Finally, as strong as our unit revenues were in Q3 RPD as a metric may be less telling, as we grow our TNC or rideshare business where length of rental is longer relative to the conventional RAC business. Lower implied RPD over a multi week rental alongside lower associated transaction transactional expense, produce attractive EBITDA margins being the primary metric to which we manage our business. In Q3, TNC rental volumes more than doubled year-over-year, and our expectation is that this customer segment will continue to grow. With respect to the business overall during the quarter across all geographies, we maintained our focus on customer service us despite the peak summer season limited availability of vehicles, high fleet utilization and elevated pricing we improved our NPS score sequentially from Q1 through Q3. While our Q3 results reflect overall strength in our business and continued demand for our services, there remains opportunity for further growth as we experience a return to volumes achieved prior to the pandemic. In fact, revenue metrics for the month of October, including RPD, and transaction days are up year-over-year. Corporate business reached 75%, the pre pandemic levels in Q3 with forward bookings reflecting a continuance of this trend into Q4. While corporate activity from small and midsized businesses demonstrated considerable growth across the first half of the year and into Q3, larger global accounts accelerated during Q3, as these customers have only begun to increase their travel volume. In Q3, we renewed 100% of contracted corporate accounts open for renewal, and 93% of these renewals contained a price increase. Finally, international inbound activity is showing signs of return, particularly into the year-end holidays and despite a strong U.S. dollar. Before Kenny takes you through the details of our results, I want to address four key areas of focus for our team as we progress Q4 and look toward 2023. They are fleet management, cost structure, strategic priorities and capital deployment. Given market dynamics in Q3 with rental volume remaining elevated and residuals in decline, our fleet strategy had to take account of aggregate fleet size, as well as the composition of the fleet. In managing the fleet we considered embedded equity value across the whole of the fleet, as well as on a vehicle level basis as we size for overall customer demand, and made acquisition and disposition decisions. In Q3, we began with a fleet size of 532,000 and finished the quarter at 512,000, which included a refresh as we bought back approximately 75% of the volume that we sold. The process enabled us to maximize the harvest of embedded equity against a declining residual value market, while at the same time rendering the fleet younger at lower price points and releasing capital to return to shareholders. Should residual price declines persist beyond Q3, we expect to continue monetizing the equity in our fleet and using that equity to subsidize the purchase of vehicles at reduced prices. While residual price decline was anticipated in Q3, the pace proved more accelerated than expected. Beyond broad indices are large use car retail footprint and partnership with Carvana provided us with real time pricing information, enabling us to make swift decisions on vehicles most exposed to potential decline in value. In Q3 however, we came into the quarter with elevated out of service levels, primarily because of higher recalls in the first half of the year, and reduced workforce, particularly among mechanics coming out of reorganization. During the first two months of the quarter with parts procured, we made the intentional decision to carry higher costs in our operations to effectively address the recalls, bringing out of service down and putting vehicles back into the usable fleet. As a result, our DOE in the quarter remained higher than desired, but our cost based in September displayed better operating level than the prior two months, and we are experiencing even lower unit costs in October, as we open Q4. We expect improving operating leverage throughout Q4, and we look to further improvement in 2023. We expect the Q4 cost reduction to be the product of several factors, including most notably a more pronounced reduction in expensive third party labor, and a continued pivot to Hertz badged employees, as well as the completion of our telematics installation across 100% of the Americas fleet. Our telematics investment is already contributing to superior recovery times on missing vehicles, more accurate fuel readings upon return, and timely service alerts bringing real value to the customer experience and efficiencies in the field. Our activity over the quarter reflects the strength of our commitment to the increasing electrification of our fleet, both in terms of growing a more diversified fleet of EVs, and making progress on charging. First, we announced our memorandum of understanding with GM to acquire up to 175,000 electric vehicles over the next five years. The agreement encompasses EV deliveries through 2027 and spans a wide range of vehicle categories, and importantly, across various price points. Of equal importance, we announced an infrastructure agreement with BP, which promises to increase the network of charging stations available to Hertz customers and to improve the charge management of our EV fleet. Likewise, BP Pulse will also customize energy management software for Hertz to ensure our growing fleet of EVs are recharged quickly and in a cost efficient basis in preparation for rental. BP Pulse\u00e2\u0080\u0099s platform will allow us to optimize timing and usage of energy, thereby containing costs and ensuring our customers are provided an EV at an appropriate charge level. The model enables us to harness our data in innovative new ways that will get our customers on the road more quickly, improve our cost structure appropriately calibrate pricing against demand, and reduce the complexities of operating a large, diverse fleet. While early, we believe the rollout across the U.S. will bring significant benefits to our business, both from a revenue and operating costs perspective. Our strategy around capital allocation continues to be one of investing on our business, then using free cash flow to repurchase shares. As I turn the call to Kenny, I want to put our results and our forward view of the business in the context of what others across the travel industry have communicated over the last two weeks. Like the airlines and hotels, we are experiencing undeniably strong demand for our services as we begin Q4. As I noted earlier, demand is up across leisure and corporate, utilization remains elevated and neither is being driven by price concession. It is true that residuals on used cars declined precipitously as Q3 progressed, that I would distinguish supply driven factors that drive use car pricing from demand driven factors that underlie the fundamental expression of activity being shown by our customers. But for now, the nature of demand we are experiencing stands in contrast to the more negative tone underlying the economy, and may well be fueled by changing travel patterns emerging out of the pandemic. Regardless, we remain focused on maintaining the right fleet, the right cost base and the right strategic deployment of capital to generate attractive returns for our shareholders over time. As Stephen mentioned, demand for rentals was strong in the third quarter, and our focus on possibility resulted in a high margin business. Our third quarter adjusted EPS of $1.08, adjusted corporate EBITDA was $680 million, reflecting a margin of 25%. Revenue was $2.5 billion in the quarter, a 12% increase compared to the prior year period, and a 15% increase on a constant currency basis. Revenue and EBITDA were negatively impacted by approximately $70 million and $20 million, respectively due to currency changes. RPD was $68.57 and monthly RPU was a record $1,685 for the third quarter exceeding the second quarter RPD and slightly ahead of the expectation laid out on our previous call. July is typically the strongest month of the year for our business, and we achieve RPU for the company of $1,777. These ancillary customer services provide high-margin revenue and with the international returning, we see room for further growth. Volume in the quarter grew 11% year-over-year, and 5% quarter-over-quarter in line with our expectations. Most of the volume came from leisure rentals, which increase versus the previous quarter. Our corporate and international inbound volumes continue their recovery in the quarter, an increase from Q2 to 75% and 45% of pre-19 levels respectively. As a result, we were able to achieve a September exit rates of 81.4% on utilization, which is an impressive operational achievement. To put this exit rate into perspective, this is a 220 basis point improvement and utilization for the month versus 2021 and a 50 basis point improvement versus 2019. Net DPU for Q3 was $187 which was $22 more than the high end of the range we estimated on our last call, primarily resulting from industry wise declining residual values in August and September. While we anticipated a reduction and used car prices in the second half of the year, as Stephen noted, the decline was steeper than we expected. The excess in the Q3 depreciation expense over our guidance broadly amounts to about $50 million or a reduction of $1,000 per vehicle across 50,000 cars sold during the back half of the quarter. Based on our recent review, we expect DPU in Q4 up $240 to $260 which will result in the full year EPU of $110 to $130. We benefited in Q3 as a seller of cars and likewise benefited due to actions taken earlier in the year, which placed our fleet on the short side of demand. And with the month-over-month declines and residual values, we were able to capture prices that were higher than they are today. And looking forward, it's important to keep in mind our residual values are still up over 30% from 2019 levels. First, we expect to keep the fleet tight so we are not long on cars. While we have a standing preference for acquiring new vehicles, to the extent we need to increase vehicles to meet demand, we can do so at reduced cap costs and through the used car market. Second, we continue to identify vehicles in our fleet with greatest exposure to falling residuals, as well as older vehicles with more trust equity and prioritize those for rotation. First, select the purchases of new vehicles in Q3 at below MSRP provided a fair value cushion almost immediately. Second, the selling of vehicles considered to have elevated exposure to falling residual values based on granular model and trim level data. During the first two months of a quarter, the company ran with intentionally elevated operating costs to address out of service levels, as Stephen mentioned earlier. As a result of these efforts, by the end of the quarter, out of service levels have decreased thereby increasing utilization. Going forward, we are focused on improving our cost base it will closely monitor DOE per transaction date as a metric to evaluate our progress. In Q3, our DOE per transaction day was about $35. Within the quarter, we experienced month-over-month decline as Stephen noted, October is showing further improvement. Additionally, as the TNC business grows, and as we increase the number of EVs in our fleet with the lower maintenance profile, we expect transaction economics to improve will lower cost. Our balance sheet remains healthy, and we ended the quarter with a leverage of 0.7 times. At September 30th, our available liquidity was $2.6 billion comprised of $1 billion and unrestricted cash in the balance available under the revolving credit facility. During the quarter, we increased our RCF capacity by $55 million to almost $2 billion, creating additional financial flexibility and enhancing our corporate liquidity. Adjusted operating cash flow was $572 million for Q3, a 93% conversion from EBITDA. The resulting adjusted free cash flow was a strong $505 million, a conversion of over 80% of EBITDA. During the quarter, we repurchase 27 million shares for $500 million. Overall, we allocated nearly $570 million towards capital investments and share repurchases during the quarter, all funded from operating cash flow. On Demand, as Stephen mentioned, apart from seasonal expected adjustment, we see no lessening of volumes through year-end. In fact, in Q4, we will ordinarily observe about a 15% seasonal volume reduction relative to a summer peak in Q3. Given current trends, we expect our Q4 reduction in transaction days to be closer to 10%. On fleet, we expect it to remain tight and large consistent with our fleet size as we begin the year. Rotation enables us to harvest residual equity, realized in the form of gains on sale while simultaneously reduce the age of our fleet. In the context of that rotation, we now expect net fleet CapEx for the year to be at or about the lower end of the previously discussed range of $750 million and $1 billion. And our rates, Q3 to Q4 typically reflect the seasonal softening of around 8% to 10%. Our Q3 exit rates on utilization, costs, bookings, positions us well for Q4 and will permit us to continue operating with the momentum experienced to date. I think you mentioned in the prepared comments, some distinction between factors that are driving used car pricing and factors that kind of drive demand for rail cars. So as OEMs produce more cars and increase the supply of those cars, that tends to soften demand for used cars and therefore softens pricing. At the moment, the prospect of increased OEM volume may be more than the reality but the prospect of it is influencing used car residuals. And the reality is the demand for used cars falls, as the prospect of a new car becomes more affordable and available. As an aside, I'd point out that rising interest rates also dampened demand for used cars and therefore the residual price, falls and that's obviously the reality of the moment. By contrast, the increased supply of new cars as a driver of used car pricing doesn't dampen demand for rental cars, the demand for our product is driven by a whole range of different factors for leisure travelers, there are post COVID travel patterns appetite for experience over hard assets. But perhaps to answer the more important kind of component to your question, new car supply will not put at risk the pricing of our product, okay, put aside demand. I mean, it is true, if you look at history, the industry historically lacked discipline and around fleet sizing it often found itself in a position where we would size up fleet for a robust travel season, demand would not materialize, that would lead to lower RPDs and lower residuals as rental car companies depleted so you had a kind of a double effect, lower RPD and lower residual. Now, in contrast, we now source cars and grow fleet to sit inside where we perceive demand to sit and because we control the supply of other cars we can meet that demand and safeguard price. And so I think, that's really the differential, if you will, supply side versus demand side on the two sides, if you will, of the equation. One is, we've targeted roughly a quarter of the fleet to be EV by the end of 2024. Over the course of 2023, we will begin to take in GM electric vehicles, which will come in at a very attractive price points and across a range of models. And obviously, the debt rate will fall and go lower as we're buying cars at a lower cap cost. And so I think, the open of that valve if you will, the supply of EVs to add to what we're doing around Tesla, and Polestar, I think will be a positive, both in terms of customer experience and in the overall economic picture around depreciation, for our products set. So let me just add a little bit color to your last part of the question, right. So first and foremost, I'll say we are excited that the EVs are coming in as expected, and it's validating our long term view the economics being accretive to the ICE vehicles and into our business. In terms of the P&L impact itself, on the revenue side, we know we are seeing customers willing to pay a premium for these rentals. As Stephen mentioned, we're seeing NPS scores literally 10 points higher than the average ICE vehicles right now for EVs and the utilization, we are improving each and every single day. Stephen mentioned depreciation and in my prepared remarks EV is a bit more resilient right now, given the changing residual landscape. And right now, the depreciation as a percent of cap cost is between 0.85% and 1%. As you may remember Chris, we usually used up around 1.25%. So right now, all of the, the revenue side depreciation side is coming in to some cases better than how we modeled it. First, I'd say we don't think about depreciation in isolation because, frankly, that's not the way that Steve and I manage the business. So as Steve and I manage the business, revenue, depreciation, EBITDA margin, all of that is directly linked and related. As I just mentioned to Chris about EVs, yes, on face value, as of right now, the EV depreciation is relatively higher than ICE vehicle. Obviously, that may change as we diversify our fleet. If you just look at that metric, it would be misleading because an EV right now has the higher RPD attachment, has a lower maintenance cost profile. Therefore, it's accretive to our business and into our margins. So just to kind of wrap it up from my end, while I cannot tell you exactly what depreciation rate is going to be because it's a function of what vehicles we buy or keep which will inform by what revenue and demand hence margins, we expect to earn those vehicles. Over time, we expect gross and net to converge with a modest spread as we sell a significant numbers of vehicles through our retail channels, including Carvana, which as you know, is agree of the wholesale. And then also, I just wanted to go over the fourth quarter a little bit more. So for third quarter, so let me back up a little bit. Given the dynamics that Stephen mentioned, we saw a strong demand and strong pricing. So quarter-over-quarter, RPD was up 3%. As Stephen mentioned, right now for October, we are seeing that trend tick up even higher on a year-over-year basis. As I noted, we purposely incurred what I would describe as more onetime costs around elevated recalls and the like. And equally, that was in decline, right, sequentially month-to-month within the quarter. And if you think about the revenue that we brought in, excluding that incremental $50 million or $60 million of expenses, we were probably experiencing 70% contribution margin on the incremental revenue. And the point to incurring that expense was really to bring 20,000 cars at a monthly RPU of $1,600 for the balance of the year, so call it, 4 months, that's $130 million top line in exchange for the expense that we were incurring. And so I just want to frame that as you think about to your question of looking forward to the fourth quarter, the pull-through in the business is improving and will improve relative to where we were in a one-time expense incurrence. And then equally, our return to a much more significant sort of contribution margin on incremental revenue as we bring DOE per transaction day down. I think there are a number of unknowns still here, including at least until the treasury issues is clarifying, whether the tax credits will be treated as a credit against tax owed or whether it might instead be treated as a rebate, reducing the price of the vehicle. Like if you received thousands of dollars back against the 100,000 Teslas and the 150,000 GM EVs you plan to buy. So the details around this, obviously, takes effect as of the first of the year and will get treated as a corporate different than individuals. So you're right to say there's a tax credit of up to $7,500 per electric vehicle. But in a positive vein because this legislation removed the pre-existing cap vehicle production cap of 200,000 cars, it now renders Tesla and GM, a particular note to us as being eligible right for this tax credit. At the end of the day, I think this will be a credit that will offset corporate tax or corporate minimum tax; it has a carry forward life of about 20 years. Exactly how you're meant to look at it as an offset to price and the like, hard to know, and the rule making is hard to know, but this is a consequential piece of legislation as it relates to the attractiveness of the economics around the vehicles themselves. And you addressed the decline in used car prices, which while some of precipitous is also maybe not that surprising given how precipitously they rose previously. I wanted to check in on the other big driver of your higher than historical results, which is revenue per day, which has also risen a lot. I had imagined that maybe the semiconductor chip shortage and resulting supply and demand imbalance for rental cars was the biggest driver, along with just the general increase in consumer prices. It sounds like you think ancillary services could keep rising from here, still benefiting RPD. So we're seeing plus 5% rate, plus 5% volume. So both volume and rate, transaction days and rate are showing continued strength and promise, right, in the context of where we are. Now, as I talked about in the prior question, the supply of new vehicles or perhaps the prospect of the supply of new vehicles, I think, was one of several contributing factors to a downdraft in the residual price of used cars. So there will be new cars this year, but not to the extent that I think is being contemplated as it relates or plays into the used car market. The decline in the residual value of used cars plays positively to us as and to the extent that we continue to look at the used car market as an area where we can meet marginal demand beyond that, which we in fleet in terms of new cars. In the context of overall revenue and the strength, obviously, the primary factor is demand. We're seeing equally different travel patterns among our leisure customers right, where people are extending business trips into leisure trips. On the corporate side, we're seeing, as I said, very strong demand among large corporates, and we're also seeing them look to put their employees in EVs to satisfy their own ESG footprint. And then Uber and Lyft drivers are picking up in increasing numbers the available rental cars because it's proving to be more profitable for them, more profitable for Uber and quite profitable for us. And so I'm just pointing out to you kind of the breadth, right, of demand dynamics that are out there, the strength of those dynamics and the fact that even through October, we're seeing strength in rate and volumes not falling off as might otherwise be anticipated. Right now, we are seeing record level of that RPD across my transaction days. And I think that's fairly impressive, given the fact that international inbound, which is usually the biggest buyers of value-added services, has not fully returned. As I mentioned, it's 45% of 2019 in terms of that segment. And historically, that means roughly, call it, 10% to 15% of my business. This is a structural improvement in our VAS structure, as I mentioned earlier in the year in terms of what we did to incentivize our employees with the right comp plans as well as we are embedding VAS into our digital assets as well. TNC may carry a low RPD by nature, right, than a RAC leisure business. However, given the low touch time and the fact that these drivers have them would mean high utilization, margin may be the better metric in RPU for us, which is what we track very closely. Mean I think a combination of lower expense, lower capital costs, okay, are all going to be drivers of a sustainable, if not increasing margin, right, to sort of how we run our business over the longer term. Obviously, rising rates are going to have an impact on all sorts of financing businesses next year. So I think as I mentioned earlier our balance sheet right now is extremely strong from all aspects, liquidity, leverage, the cushion on the ABS. So if you look at our balance sheet, it's very, very strong right now. On your question specifically around our debt profile or debt stack, right, if you take a step back, 70% to 75% of our debt is fixed. If interest rate hikes, if every 1% for our business, the annual impact on our floating debt will be roughly $30 million. In terms of the VFNs, right, they're the folding part of the ABS, so roughly 30%. On the corporate debt side, I think I mentioned on the last call, we have no that maturities until 2026. And Stephen, I want to ask a little bit about the Palantir development in terms of how you're thinking about technology usage across the enterprise. So part of the reason to partner as opposed to build of our own is that it's a much more cost-efficient means of putting this type of technology and engineering talent to work, meaning we don't need to build and, in fact, what Palantir offers by way of a foundry platform enables us to avoid the cost of harmonizing random aspects of data into a single point that can then produce output that guides decisions. So as an example, and this goes to the first part of your question, as we build a pricing tool, okay, a pricing tool can look at anomalous circumstances in a given market and it can help guide price up or down, right, to meet certain circumstances. It takes the whole process of managing the fleet, pricing the fleet, etcetera, to sort of a new level. So the more akin to what you know to be the case for airlines and otherwise, and it elevates a level of sophistication for us that I think has very meaningful consequence just in terms of not just how we run the business but at what price point and what the economics are of how we run the business. They can help us sort of track cars and locations and meet delivery of registration, put it on the car and the like. But over a fleet as large as ours, days and weeks matter and that too will improve the operating efficiency and the return on the asset base that we have. And our time to market, so to speak, on putting this technology in place is much faster, right, when partnering with someone like Palantir than it would be for us. I just want to start by saying that, Stephen; we've heard Hertz sold approximately 17,000 vehicles to enterprise at the end of September. Suffice to say that consistent with the fleet strategy that we have, okay, you can't just look at aggregate fleet number into demand which we do. But in a market that expressed the kind of price volatility on residuals that we saw, we needed to be really fast in our fleet. Our feet  to look at the composition of the fleet itself, which is to say, we looked early on in the quarter at where embedded equity was highest and therefore, most at risk in the context of a decline -- an expected decline in the residual value of used car prices. And in doing that and in identifying that component of the fleet, we engaged in fleet rotation where we sold high and had opportunity later to bring cars back in at lower prices. Whether we sell those cars in the wholesale market, retail to another rental car company or through Carvana, we're just simply looking to optimize the price that we get. And we did it through all channels that we could, obviously, pacing well north of what the wholesale market would avail us. So what we saw through Carvana and retail was plus 5%, 6% what the wholesale market was and any other buyers that were there that wanted to offer premium pricing in the context of the way we run our business. Look, I look at over the industry, Adam, and I'll say to you that across enterprise any of this, the number of markets in which the various rental car companies were out of market, okay, meaning they had rented all vehicles they had, okay, is a pretty important consideration in the context of how I think about what the pricing dynamics look like. But depending upon what return profiles look like in terms of fleet and equally non fleet CapEx, there's an opportunity to take on incremental leverage. I wouldn't say it's designated exclusively for the purpose of share repurchase, but there's modest leverage we could put on this business."
