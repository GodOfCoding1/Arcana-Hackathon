    "content": " And of significance, Hertz operates from a position of financial strength, following its reorganization with impressive cash flow conversion, a renewed focus on returns, low leverage and a disciplined fleet size that is more in balance with demand at better margins than where the industry has been historically. Like most companies in the U.S., and as Stephen mentioned, we also experienced inflationary pressure during the quarter, which impacted us primarily in 3 ways: first, higher vehicle acquisition costs, which increased gross depreciation; second, higher operating costs resulting from labor shortages and increased employee compensation; and third, higher maintenance costs for our vehicles due to increased pricing of parts and service labor. As we have told you in the past, we continue to believe that at prepandemic demand levels and industry-wide depreciation rates, our normalized annual EBITDA generation would be approximately $1.5 billion, excluding initiatives such as the transition towards EVs,  a ridesharing fleets and our Carvana and Amex GBT relationships. I just want to talk a little bit more about the depreciation, in particular, around not just used car sales and pricing outlook, but used car acquisitions as I'm sure you're probably aware there's some well-known used car resellers who were seen by the market in their most recent earnings results for buying used cars earlier in the year or late last year 1 price and then selling them in another. And I think that equally, I'm not standing in a static position, meaning if we start to see the market move, okay, so something happens in the relationship, if you will, between new car prices and where we're taking in expensive vehicles and what we're doing with respect to the residual on the use, my view is that it's unlikely to move at a beta of 1."
