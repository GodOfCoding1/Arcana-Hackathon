    "content": " Total deposits increased $241 million in the quarter, which included an increase in brokered deposits of $929 million and outflows of approximately $700 million of customer deposits. As we said a number of times, it was six basis points in the third quarter, and we've given you, I think, pretty good information on the deposit costs in Q4 and throughout the year as well. So I think, Damon, that's interesting because we looked at -- our view is the loan yields were up 32 basis points when we think about the rate moves in the quarter itself."
