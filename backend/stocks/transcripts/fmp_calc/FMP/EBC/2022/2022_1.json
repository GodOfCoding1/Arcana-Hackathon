    "content": " Although not fully reflected in our first quarter results, we completed the transfer of about $300 million in cannabis and money service business deposits to Needham Bank, on April 1, as previously announced. Net interest income for the period was $130.4 million on a fully tax equivalent basis compared to $124.6 million last quarter, and $101.4 million in Q1 of 2021. So, I think one of the things we've said in the past and would say again is this first year's grant was sort of, not sort of this first year's grant, the goal was to try and recreate the long-term incentive expense that we had as a mutual company, which was approximately $10 million a year. That is about the same, I think one of the things that we said last quarter Laurie in this call was that for every 25 basis points increase in rates, we would have at that time, we said we'd anticipate $8 million of incremental net interest income with some of the balance sheet restructuring, is that down a little bit, but I would say it's $7 million for a 25 basis point increase."
