    "content": " In addition, due to our longstanding discipline with respect to deposit pricing in the face of rising interest rates, our already low cost deposit base of just 6 basis points actually declined by 1 basis point during the quarter, resulting in our net interest margin widening by 20 basis points, our largest single expansion in a quarter since 2018. Net of the transfer of about $300 million in cannabis and money service business deposits in early April, our total deposit balances increased slightly during the quarter and as of quarter end was comprised by almost 60% by checking account balances and 98% by core deposits. Insurance revenues were $24.7 million in the second quarter, up 4% from the prior year quarter and down from $28.7 million in Q1, which is when we receive a higher portion of our revenue sharing payments from insurance carriers. I think, as I mentioned a couple of times and really over a couple of quarters, we have -- the cash flow from the securities portfolio is about $80 million a month. If you look at the results this quarter, the actual allowance for credit losses essentially stayed the same, went down very slightly and we had some loan growth, and that's what resulted in the $1 million provision that we put forth."
