And I think what we're trying to give you transparency too is that the model of the 47% to 53% is just probably not going to be perfect model this year because of not just COVID, but some of the shortages, but as we're working through the shortages and as I think the hospitals are responding, I think we're going to end up getting back to where we were in the good old days and have just an incredible strong second half of the fiscal year. So, we continue to, to look at this as just a broader heart failure population and specifically to COVID, you\u2019ve seen the majority of these patients getting ECMO where they do V-V ECMO, where it\u2019s pure oxygenation, not necessarily heart support, but that\u2019s a great question. Your line is open. So is that a reasonable assessment of what\u2019s kind of going on here and then with this kind of $5 million to $10 million for half of the year impact from a shortage perspective, our hospitals able to adjust here heading into fiscal 2023 to offset what they tend to $20 million headwind on the staffing sort of side. Your line is open. So, I think that what we\u2019re doing is, we\u2019re whittling away at it, and we\u2019re trying to minimize it with exactly what you\u2019re talking about with our bedside support, with our SmartAssist, it makes managing the patient easier with Impella Connect, putting that in the cloud so that our experts, our nurses, our call center, and our local people, as well as the physicians can review that patient without being bedside and then quantitatively put numbers on it and track it. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. So, if you look at our growth in the quarter, I would say, it\u2019s a combination of also opening new sites, but we\u2019re also treating, 27% to 30% more on patients year-over-year."
