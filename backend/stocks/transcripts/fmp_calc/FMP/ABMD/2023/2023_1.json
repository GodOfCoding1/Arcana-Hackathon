    "content": " In the first quarter of fiscal year 2023, Abiomed delivered a company record of $277 million in revenue, up 10% on a reported basis and up 12% in constant currency year-over-year with quarterly records across the U.S., Europe and Japan. In Q1, we delivered record revenue of $277 million, up 10% on a reported basis and 12% in constant currency versus prior year, with strong growth across the U.S., Europe and Japan. I think we're in a great place right now for the appropriate reimbursement because the system set up by CMS and the physician experts has allowed its system of treatment for the sickest patients to be treated with DRG-1, so that's biventricular Impella or a patient that needs oxygenation and hemodynamic support, that's DRG-3, that's ECPELLA, that's around 10% to 14% of our patients every quarter, and that's growing."
