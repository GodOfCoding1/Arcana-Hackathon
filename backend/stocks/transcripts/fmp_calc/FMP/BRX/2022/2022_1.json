    "content": " Speaking of reinvestment's, I'm pleased to report that we delivered another $28 million of accretive reinvestment this quarter at an incremental return of 10%, delivering the same value creation as over a $110 million of ground-up development, before considering the additional value of cap rate compression on the centers impacted as we brought in better tenants at better rents. To date, we've delivered over $720 million of accretive reinvestments impacting over 30% of our portfolio and our pipeline remains strong with an additional $419 million of active reinvestment projects leased and underway at an average incremental return of 9%, as well as the shadow pipeline of nearly $1 billion of opportunities at compelling returns that we'll continue to convert to active over the next several years. Hey, this is Brian. Please proceed with your question. Please proceed with your question. The first versus a couple of weeks, we brought in a large lease that's going to increase the yield there by about a 110 basis points and drive occupancy by about 10%, which we think is a really great return of that asset and we'll see more growth beyond it.
