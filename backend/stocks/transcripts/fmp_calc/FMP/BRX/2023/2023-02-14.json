    "content": " I think just to follow-up on Jim's point, sort of the range for the year given what a significant amount of impact we've embedded within that base rent, expectation of 350 to 450 from bankruptcy activity, the timing of that bankruptcy activity and exactly kind of how that bankruptcy activity plays out over the course of the year is going to matter a lot from a trajectory perspective. And that's really well-suited for this type of environment and I think you can see that some of our past acquisitions like Brea, worry about last year we released about 200% and we've got out parcels and progress or Ravinia, where we moved occupancy from low 80s to the low 90s in our first year of ownership. So there's still additional opportunity there, but most of the growth over-time, over the next call it three, four, five years on the anchor size, going to be from continuing to roll those rents to-market, as we've talked about primarily through reinvestment program and recapture proactive recapture space like we've been talking about today from some of those struggling tenants. So that's still a contributor to growth, but there's no question that the follow-on benefit and the momentum we're seeing in small-shop occupancy and the outsized potential of those rents is going to be a very significant driver of growth over the next several years."
