    "content": " We now have agreements in place for over 1,000 new franchise restaurants, which represents 43% unit growth and will provide us with an estimated $60 million in incremental adjusted EBITDA or approximately 66% adjusted EBITDA growth over the next few years organically. The total revenue during the third quarter increased 247% to $103.2 million, reflecting a full quarter of revenue from Global Franchise Group acquired in July of 2021 and revenue from Twin Peaks, Fazoli's and Native Grill & Wings, all of which were acquired during the fourth quarter of 2021. Costs and expenses increased to $102.2 million in the third quarter compared to $27.4 million in the year ago quarter, primarily due to the 2021 acquisitions. Cost of restaurant and factory revenues increased to $55.3 million in the third quarter of 2022 compared to $7.1 million in the prior year period, primarily related to the 2021 acquisitions, including the operations of the acquired company-owned restaurant locations and our Atlanta-based manufacturing facility. Depreciation and amortization expense increased to $6.9 million in the third quarter from $2.4 million in the year ago quarter, attributable to the 2021 acquisitions, including depreciation of acquired company-owned restaurants and the amortization of acquired intangible assets. And for those that are focused on cash flows, it's worth noting that our $23.4 million net loss for the quarter included $7 million of noncash depreciation and amortization, $2 million of noncash share-based comp, $1 million of noncash lease expense and $6.9 million of nonrecurring litigation expenses."
