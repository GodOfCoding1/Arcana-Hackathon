    "content": " During today's call, management will make forward-looking statements, including statements regarding our financial outlook for the third quarter and full year 2022, the expected performance of our products, our financial goals, our expected quarterly and long-term growth, investments, and our overall future prospects. I think that as we look at the \u00e2\u0080\u0093 turning to guide, I would also call out that we had about 10 million or so in early renewal expansion, which we think are awesome and great because we wanted to make sure a customer that built the need to that. Yes, I think first and foremost, we are always going to be playing offense when it comes to product innovation, whether that's in our core where we do really well in product analytics or whether that's in these new products. And so as I see this space play out for the long-term, there's kind of a suite of products that kind of all end up combining under the same umbrella from a customer side, and we want to make sure to meet the customer needs that we're hearing from there. I think I mentioned earlier, that's one of the product investments in digital product and the infrastructure behind it, is one of the last things that get shut down for a lot of these companies because they understand how important it is for their growth. I think when is potentially a new customer or they're just kind of getting into that first stage of expansion, there's a higher level of scrutiny review around the ROI, the finance. Earlier on the call, you mentioned sort of what you're seeing with Google Analytics and the opportunity to kind of take some customers and transitioning away from that platform and onto Amplitude."
