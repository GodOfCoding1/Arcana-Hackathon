    "content": " Given our year-to-date results and our outlook for the fourth quarter, we now expect to come in, in the higher range of our guidance for revenue and adjusted EBITDA, which are $410 million to $420 million, and $52 million to $55 million, respectively. Jerome discussed earlier our new student start growth trajectory and how we started more high school students in the quarter than historical norms, and also will be more focused on that channel for growth in the near term, given how the current macroeconomic environment is creating some inertia with the adult job changer population. For the third quarter, the shift in start timing for a portion of our high school students along with the launch of Austin and having 2 MIAT starts contributed to our strong new student start growth. We still expect to start the vast majority of high school students in the fourth quarter, and we expect total starts in the fourth quarter to be roughly flat to the prior year, with growth in high school and military offset by a decline in adult. Given the growth trajectory this year, lapping of the MIAT acquisition, timing of our MIAT program expansion efforts, the near-term emphasis on high school growth, much of which will be in the fourth quarter next year, and finally, without any recessionary tailwinds that could materialize primarily in the adult channel. Translating that to 2023 revenue, with start growth being low to mid-single digits for 2022 and the strongest 2023 start growth in the back half of the year, along with revenue per student now more normalized and the lapping of the MIAT acquisition, we should see modest year-over-year growth in the first half of the year and accelerating growth in the back half of the year."
