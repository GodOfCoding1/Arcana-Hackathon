    "content": " Revenue was $102.1 million, which is a 31% growth rate for the quarter compared to the year ago period and adjusted EBITDA of $10.9 million represents a growth rate of approximately 300% versus the comparable period a year ago. Finishing my review of our second quarter financial results, we continued to see measurable growth on our bottom line with $7.4 million of net income and adjusted net income of $6.4 million, both compared to net losses in the prior year, while diluted earnings per share was $0.11 versus a loss per share of $0.09 in the prior year period. In calendar 2021, they delivered approximately $180 million in revenue, representing 5% year-over-year growth, as well as $13 million in adjusted EBITDA. For new student starts, given the first half softness and our continued expectations for strong performance over the remainder of the year, we are adjusting our guidance to 8% to 12% year-over-year growth versus the previous 14% to 19%. From a longer-term strategic road map perspective, assuming the successful close of the Concorde acquisition in the first half of fiscal 2023, we now estimate fiscal 2025 revenue to exceed $700 million with an adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 20%."
