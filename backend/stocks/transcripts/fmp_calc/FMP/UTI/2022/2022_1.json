    "content": " The modest students start rate was not unexpected, as we faced a difficult comparison from last year's first quarter where we saw 21% year-over-year growth, partially driven by the measurable number of students deferring out of the fourth quarter of 2020 due to COVID travel restrictions and challenges. As far as student metrics, as Jerome mentioned, we saw 2.3% growth and total new student starts versus the prior year first quarter. New students starts were down just 34 stars versus the prior year quarter, which was an accomplishment after last year's 21% first quarter year-over-year increase. The year-over-year increase in operating expenses is attributable to education services cost to support higher student counts, the addition of MIAT continued investments in the company's growth and diversification strategy, including our new campus investments, and increased advertising to support our growth objectives. We continue to see robust growth on the bottom-line during the first quarter, with net income of 14.8 million and adjusted net income of 15.4 million, both compared to 1.1 million in the prior year quarter. Cash from operations in the quarter was 2.5 million, a decrease in the prior year quarter mostly resulting from working capital changes associated with continued growth and investment in our business and the income tax refund included in the year ago period. With a positive start in the first quarter and the visibility we have for the remainder of the year, we remain confident on our full year guidance for fiscal 2022 across all metrics, new students starts revenue, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income and adjusted free cash flow. Yes, end of April. Yes, end of April."
