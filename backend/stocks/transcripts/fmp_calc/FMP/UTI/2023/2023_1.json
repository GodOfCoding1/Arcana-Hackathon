    "content": " Our consolidated first quarter revenue was $120 million, adjusted EBITDA of $14.4 million and new student starts were 2,310, all of which were consistent with our expectations for the quarter and our guidance for 2023. Revenue on a consolidated basis increased 14.2% versus the prior year quarter to $120 million, primarily driven by Concorde\u00e2\u0080\u0099s $14.4 million contribution. Consolidated net income during the quarter was $2.6 million, and adjusted net income was $5.3 million, which is down approximately $10 million versus the prior year. Other factors impacting profitability in the quarter included planned increases in expenses for UTI in corporate unallocated associated with the new campuses and programs launched last year, investments in the admissions channels and other areas as part of our growth and diversification strategy, a measurably higher effective tax rate due to the valuation allowance reversal last year and increased net interest expense. As of the end of the quarter, the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s total available liquidity was $162.2 million, operating cash flow of $2.8 million, increased $0.3 million over the prior year and adjusted free cash flow of $2.6 million, improved $6.1 million versus the prior year, driven primarily by lower capital expenditures. So I see the bridge, Troy, and the bridge doesn't give numbers, but I just kind of wanted \u00e2\u0080\u0093 I see that, if the core UTI and MIAT are going to be up 5%, you're saying that despite the unemployment situation staying bad for the adults, you see all these programs it's helping the \u00e2\u0080\u0093 improving the decline on young adults and the balance is all coming from high school and military."
