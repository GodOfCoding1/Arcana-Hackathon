    "content": " Also during this call, management's remarks will include forward-looking statements related to HireRight's market opportunity, customer retention, competitive differentiation, pandemic recovery, strategies, including technology investment to increase revenue and margins, growth potential for specific customers, industry sectors and our international business, future cash flows, operational improvements and guidance for 2022 revenue, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin improvement. Starting with an overview of first quarter results, revenue was up 33% year-over-year, as strength in the hiring market continues and we continue to win new customers while expanding wallet share with existing customers. So you will continue to see us emphasize growth in international markets for all the reasons that we talked about in terms of our strength, but in particular, that single global platform that we have is an appealing message, not just multinationals, but also to large local companies who might have an operation just one other country, right, but don't want to have multiple different types of screening programs because they have to go to another provider that doesn't have a single platform. Yes, so it's interesting because we -- obviously on a continued basis, one of the advantages of our account, strong account management relationships is we have a very continued ongoing dialogue in particular with our top 1,200 enterprise customers."
