    "content": " Also during this call, management's remarks will include forward-looking statements related to HireRight's market opportunities, customer retention, competitive differentiation, growth expectations, operational improvements, strategies to increase revenue and margins, growth prospects for industry sectors and our international business, labor market and economic trends, future cash flows, and financial performance including 2022 guidance. Yes, I mean, as we sit here today, I think it's important to note that there's been nothing - no fundamental change in the current demand levels that we're seeing over the last first seven months of the year. But I can tell you that the first half of the year, our new business adds were very strong as well as were our upsell sell-throughs to our largest clients who, I think we've talked about this quarter-over-quarter. And one thing we're doing to combat that is it's kind of indicative of some of the numbers that Guy quoted in his section is we're diversifying our geographies in terms of - and again, this is a good thing for the overall industry and Guy talked about this a lot about the ability for people to take jobs in different geographies. Part of that is driven by the third-party data costs and things of that nature, but it's also the mix of labor we have and our use of contract labor resources as well as our own labor and really optimizing that mix is what we continue to look at, optimizing that mix between our own labor and contract labor as well as our geographic spread of labor and where we're allocating work."
