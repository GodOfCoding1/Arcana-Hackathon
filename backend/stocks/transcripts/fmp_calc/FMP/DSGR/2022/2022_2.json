    "content": " On a like-for-like basis, with the inclusion of Lawson from a comparative basis, sales increased nearly 34% or $80.6 million over the second quarter of 2021, with $52.3 million coming from acquisitions and organic growth of nearly 12%. The Lawson segment sales grew 13.1% in organic sales over the second quarter of 2021 on an adjusted basis, and 2.3% increase sequentially over the first quarter of 2022. Excluding these items as well as for the previous quarters, Lawson's adjusted EBITDA improved to $9.4 million compared to adjusted EBITDA of $7.8 million a year ago quarter and $8 million in the first quarter of 2022, primarily driven by the sales and gross margin improvements. On an adjusted EBITDA basis, the second quarter ended at 8.8% of sales or $8.6 million, representing an increase of nearly $5 million over a year ago quarter. With this being our initial quarter of reporting our combined results, we are very pleased with our progress and believe that we are on a strong path as exhibited by our sales growth and our adjusted EBITDA of $31.7 million for the quarter or 9.9% of sales. So I would say there's a few items that are driving that confidence, and one is kind of goes back to your earlier question around some of the sales opportunities across all three organizations working that gives us a lot of confidence that the teams are working really well together to identify those opportunities. And we're seeing that margin expansion take place on an individual company basis as well and then factoring in the additional sales and cost opportunities is really, in my mind, what's building our confidence as we move throughout the rest of 2022 and into 2023."
