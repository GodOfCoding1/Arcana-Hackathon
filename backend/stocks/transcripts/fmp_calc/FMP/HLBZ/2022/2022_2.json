    "content": " Our immediate goal is to drive margin expansion, show operating leverage, conserve cash and invest smartly and effectively. In our core mobility segment, cost of revenue declined 70% versus last year. As our core business, mobility saw solid growth in the key measure of quarterly activity platform user and trip. This service enhances our mobility offering to our customer, for example, enable them to utilize Helbiz even in bad weather. In July and August, we complete a $5 million financing that is part of a planned green bond issue that could be up to $50 million. Now let me turn the call over to our CFO, Giulio Profumo, to discuss our financial performance for the second quarter. Keep in mind that all figures given are for the second quarter of 2022 and all comparisons are with the second quarter of 2021, unless I note otherwise. We delivered another strong quarter and a solid financial performance despite continued headwinds from industry, supply chain issues and inflationary cost pressures. Mobility continued to show improvement with strong top line growth, contributing 62% of total revenue, growing 72% sequentially due to the growing fleet size and growing awareness, coupled with the strong utilization due to the seasonal factor of warmer weather. In constant currency, mobility revenue would have been 8% higher in Q2 2022 than what we reported. Across regions, strong mobility revenue was driven by solid performance in the key metrics that measure the usage. Media continues to be an engine of growth, contributing 34% of total revenue. Helbiz Kitchen revenue nearly doubled sequentially as we continue to build awareness of this service in our initial test to market, Milano in Italy. The first area of success is mobility cost of revenue, which decreased by 17%. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re constantly looking for places to automate our operations so that we can increase efficiency, customer service while decreasing costs. Meanwhile, total operating expenses doubled versus last year, reflecting our rapid growth. Overall, cost of revenue was 69% higher mainly due to the content licensing expenses in media, offsetting the improvements in mobility. Going forward, look for much more subdued OpEx growth as we focus on leveraging the infrastructure we have built over the past year. Sales and marketing expenses grew from last year, demonstrating our commitment to advertising, promotional and business development, especially after the launch of media and food delivery offerings. We incurred $1 million in non-cash stock-based compensation expenses, which accounted for almost 5% of the total operating expenses. During Q2, we used cash to invest in growth, in particular the purchase of new electric vehicles to expand the operating fleet in several new cities. We focus on initiative that strengthen our platform, geographic footprint and customer reach, which in turn lowers our customer acquisition costs, increases the lifetime value of our customers. Looking ahead, we expect third quarter revenue to be up sequentially as we benefit from the higher fleet utilization due to the seasonal factor of warmer weather. We intensify our focus on operating profitability, putting every cost under the microscope to ensure that we are driving profitability operation. Revenue grew substantively, and we expanded our operating footprint with more license in the U.S. and our fleet size grew as we deploy new vehicle. We also started licensing our helmet compliance technology, creating a completely new revenue opportunity. Most importantly, we are building the foundation to capture the massive long-term growth opportunity in front of us. We also just announced the Helbiz taxi-hailing service within our app that expand our mobility offering in a high-value, capital-light way."
