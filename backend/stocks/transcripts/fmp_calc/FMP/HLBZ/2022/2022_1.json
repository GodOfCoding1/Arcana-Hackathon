With us today are Founder and Chief Executive Officer, Salvatore Palella; and Chief Financial Officer, Giulio Profumo. We will also discuss certain forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures, which are not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Once again, growth was substantial, revenue tripled with both mobility and media contribution. Across the U.S. Europe and Asia Pacific, we are currently in discussion to bring our mobility service to new communities. At the moment, we are negotiating an M&A transaction with potential partner also operating in the Mobility sector, which could significantly increase our footprint in revenue. Because we're publicly trade, we can pursue opportunity like these using stock, which is often a better option than cash. With a couple of steps, the Google Maps user can found the Helbiz scooter and start the ride. Similarly, we have a deal with  so their user can see Helbiz as a commuting option. They helped so present us as an alternative to other mode of transportation, such our ride share, which is a solid progress toward our goal of fully integration our sales into the way people commute through their city. Now, let me turn the call over to our CFO, Giulio Profumo, to discuss our financial performance for the first quarter. Unless I note otherwise, all figures are for the first quarter of 2022 and all comparisons are with the first quarter of 2021. We continued the expansion into new cities in the U.S. and in Italy, growing our teams in every city and providing enhanced services. Quarterly active platform users were up 66%, and total trips were up at 58%. Our marketing team is working hard to promote Unlimited subscriptions, because it represents a good value bundle for customers. Media has quickly become an engine of growth for us, making up the other half of revenue in the quarter. Most M edia revenue again, came from commercialization of media rights, while Helbiz Live subscriptions were nearly 20% of revenue. Please note that we incurred them $1.3 million in non-cash stock-based compensation expenses, which accounted for almost 6% of the total operating expenses. With increased liquidity, we remain confident with our ability to fund the business and pursue our objectives. want to update you on the financial lease agreement we signed in June 2021, a 12-month lease with a European financial institution for approximately 3,000 e-Scooters. This agreement became effective on March 1st, 2022, following the delivery of the vehicles to our warehouse. We believe we're well-positioned to capitalize on the promise of the industry as the year progresses, with increasing adoption of our environmentally friendly transportation alternatives. Basing on the strong start of the year and the growing confection across all our line of business, we are excited to increase our revenue expansion for 2022. You may now disconnect. You may now disconnect."
