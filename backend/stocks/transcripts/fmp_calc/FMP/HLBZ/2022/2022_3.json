I'd like to introduce your host for today's call, Gary Dvorchak, Managing Director of The Blueshirt Group. With us today are Founder and Chief Executive Officer, Salvatore Palella, Chief Financial Officer, Giulio Profumo; and Chief Operating Officer, Jonathan Hannestad. Then, we will answer some top questions submitted to us via the Robinhood app. In the third quarter, we made significant progress in improving cost efficiency and margins. While Jonathan will elaborate more on this, I will call out that we -- and say operating efficiency in micromobility, cross-functional operating go smoother, and we increased the fleet productivity. Also, externalizing some of our European operations contribute to better mobility cost of revenue. Before we take a deeper review in mobility, I would like to highlight our year-to-date revenue growth of 30%. In mobility, we expanded our operating area in the US. With our commitment to bring everyone modern and sustainability transportation suction we will continue expanding into more cities, allowing more people to benefit from our micro-mobility products and services. With most of our mobility revenue coming from Europe, the decreasing of the euro against the US dollar caused lower revenue. In addition, delayed with deployment affect our mobility revenue. Last quarter, we announced our on-demand taxes available on or our app users. Commitment debt offering last week, we announced a partnership with WeTaxi, a leading ax operator in Italy. Now has this user can book taxi ride, whether individual or shared directly from our app. However, recall that we are launching the media business last August. Additionally, due to the potential cost of revenue associated with media, we achieved the high media revenue by surprising our margin potential. Therefore, we are rethinking how we will operate our media business. In mobility, we extended our cooperation with Moovit and started a partnership with a target based MSSA platform  into go, which improved user trip by offering faster and easy access to vehicle while pursuing a more sustainable lifestyle. This also means having our team on the ground run more efficient routes, prioritized tasks, deploy inventory areas more likely to see ridership, be alerted earlier to vehicles require maintenance, and generally more responsive to needs before they can cost problems. With all this work, we're on track for nearly completely automated operations by next year that will manage all tasks, drivers and operational teams. In terms of safety and compliance, we're able to exceed the regulatory requests and needs of the cities we operate in. With our focus on AI and computer vision, we have been able to launch features such as our technology that certifies parking compliance in real-time and helmet selfie verification AI tech that are flexible to meet the needs of each city, and we're able to quickly adapt to the change in requests of regulators. Since our approach is software based and relies on the existing deployed hardware, it's much quicker and cheaper to deploy solutions that are custom built in each location we operate. Creating a flexible system that is adaptable to each city and the investment in R&D will pay off in the future as we are able to respond quickly, tailor approach to each city and not have to acquire new hardware. Lastly, we're looking at software solution to extend what mobility means to the average user. As we grow in communities, we're able to build a solution that solves many transportation related needs, thus encouraging users to call on us more often. Whether it is connecting to taxes, local transit or insurance, our platform is built to connect easily with third parties to extend our offerings. Now, let me turn the call over to our CFO, Giulio Profumo to discuss our financial performance. We achieved solid top line growth year-to-date through September 30, 2022. Revenue was impacted by headwinds in mobility, primarily due to the unfavorable FX impact. Net loss at the company level narrowed by 13%, primarily due to lower mobility cost of revenue. Mobility revenue declined, because of fewer trips and the euro-US dollar exchange rate impact. Nevertheless, in Q3 2022, it still contributed 67% of total revenue, a decline of 37%. Overall, the strengthening of the US dollar had an unfavorable impact on revenue. In constant currency, mobility revenue would have been at 12% higher in Q3 2022. Looking ahead, we expect that our acquisition of Wheels will create more synergies down the road and improve the operating efficiencies of our fleet and customer management. In Q3 2022, we continue to reduce mobility cost of revenue, which was down by 20%, thanks to better operating efficiency and the externalization of a portion of the European operation. That helped reduce the overall cost of revenue by 15% in the past quarter, in line with our strategic focus on profitability. Media recorded a 42% top line increase during Q3 2022, which was a driver of our total revenue growth. Now that we started in the media business in the middle of Q3 2021, so the comparison is a rough number. When breaking down our total cost of revenue, you will see we accounted for 32% during Q3 and 46% during the first nine months, both higher than the value of revenue process during the same period. As Salvatore mentioned, considering relatively fixed and substantial costs associated with the media, where we're thinking our approach to this business. Now, turning to the other costs and expenses, I want to reiterate that our priority remains to be hitting profitability as quick as possible. We will continue to improve operating efficiency, while cautiously investing in growth in the context of the economic environment. Indeed, we made meaningful progress on cost reductions in Q3. Please note that, the operating expenses were up sequentially due to an impairment of fair value of mobility assets, caused by the economic slowdown. Beginning into operating expenses for the quarter, we made significant costs in sales and marketing expenses, demonstrating our commitment to slimming down costs, while building a higher-quality business. We incurred approximately $800,000 in non-cash equity-based compensation expenses, which accounted for almost 3% of the total operating expenses. Finally, we recently entered into an equity line of credit that provides us with the option, but not the obligation to issue and sell up to $13.9 million in common equity at the time of our choosing during the term of the agreement. Looking ahead, we expect the fourth quarter to be up quarter-by-quarter and full year revenue up year-over-year as we benefit from a balanced since last April that can weather the uncertainties and economic headwinds everyone is faced with. So, Helbiz received questions from our shareholders on the Robinhood app, thanks to the Say Technology Shareholder Q&A platform. We intend to consider available alternatives, including, but not limited, to a reverse stock split, subject to stockholder approval, if necessary, to cure the stock pricing on compliance. The goal with our partnerships is to extend our user base, reach customers in new ways, and to rely on the expertise of our partners. To point to some examples across our business, We Taxi, as we talked about today, allows our mobility offerings to expand and relies on the deep market penetration in Italy. OneFootball provides a new platform for fans to subscribe to Helbiz Live, and Deliveroo greatly expanded our user base of customers ordering from Helbiz Kitchen. We Taxi established a wider mobile -- mobility ecosystem, integrating various service into one app, including our. So, we see this as an addition to our core business of micro-mobility. However, we are confident in our ability to continue navigating macroeconomic headwinds and deliver stronger long-term business results. Working with their people and expanding the B2B and monthly subscription offering, which has seen success in New York City already. As well, we will continue to grow the partner offering around mobility such as taxi and insurance. While the overall microeconomic environment remain uncertain, we are confident and motivate in driving towards financial and operating profitability. Meanwhile, ongoing cost optimization and adding of Wheels are expected to bring our operating efficiency to the next level."
