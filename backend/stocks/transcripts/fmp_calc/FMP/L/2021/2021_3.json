    "content": " This will be Lowes Hotel\u2019s second property in Arlington, following in the strong footsteps of Live by Loews which has had a successful opening in 2019 and whose occupancy rate has generally remained strong throughout the pandemic, a testament to this market's resilience and the team's focus. CNA's performance was driven by strong property casualty underwriting income before catastrophe losses, healthy net investment income, and a net reserve release in the life and group segment. All three of our consolidated subsidiaries CNA, Boardwalk, Loews Hotels recorded materially higher year-over-year net income contributions with CNA leading the charge. CNA's expense ratio was just a few years ago hovered in the mid-30s, came in below 31% down from 31.8% in Q3 2020 and 31.6% last quarter. The parent company's investment portfolio generated a pretax net investment loss of 30 million as compared to income of 23 million last year, the loss stemmed from the performance of the equity portfolio."
