This year's first quarter benefited from dramatically improved investment results at CNA and the parent company, strong P&C underwriting income at CNA, before catastrophe losses and favorable results posted by Boardwalk Pipelines. Net earned premium was up almost 6% year-over-year and the combined ratio, excluding CAT losses, was 91.3%, 1.7 points better than last year's first quarter and 1.1 points better than full year 2020. The low point in Loews Hotels results was last year's second quarter, when GAAP revenue was just $9 million and adjusted EBITDA was a loss of $54 million."
