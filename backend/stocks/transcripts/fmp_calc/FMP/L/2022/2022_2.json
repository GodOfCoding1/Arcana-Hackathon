    "content": " CNA's core income was negatively impacted by low returns on its private equity hedge fund and common stock portfolios, which were down by $171 million pre-tax versus the prior year period. With respect to the rise in interest rates, at the end of the second quarter, CNA's fixed income portfolio had a pre-tax unrealized loss of $1.8 billion. As a result, CNA's book value per share was about $35at the end of the second quarter, compared to about $47 at the end of 2021. Second quarter of 2022, Loews reported net income of $180 million or $0.73 per share compared to net income of $754 million or $2.86 per share in last year's second quarter. The first being the non-recurrence of last year's $438 million after-tax investment gain on the partial sale and deconsolidation of Altium Packaging; and the second being lower investment results at both CNA and Loews, which I'll discuss more in detail later. Book value per share declined from $71.84 at year-end 2021 to $62.90 at the end of the second quarter, due mainly to the effect of higher interest rates, lowering the market value of CNA's fixed income investments. From a cash flow perspective, we received $97 million in dividends from CNA this quarter and $681 million year-to-date, consisting of two regular quarterly dividends of $0.40 per share and a special dividend of $2 per share."
