    "content": " As for Loews Hotels, the company delivered its highest first quarter adjusted EBITDA ever, clocking in at $68 million as pent-up demand for post-COVID leisure travel coinciding with this year\u2019s timing of spring break. This morning, Loews reported first quarter net income of $338 million, a 30% increase from net income of $261 million in last year\u2019s first quarter. While CNA accounted for the bulk of our Q1 net income, the earnings increase was driven by significantly improved results at Loews Hotels as well as by the absence of non-recurring charges related to Altium Packaging that depressed last year\u2019s first quarter results. CNA contributed net income of $281 million, in line with last year\u2019s $279 million. Additionally, net investment gains, which were meaningful in last year\u2019s first quarter, swung to a slight loss this year, driven by the unfavorable change in fair value of non-redeemable preferred stock and lower net investment gains on disposals of fixed income securities. Boardwalk contributed net income of $91 million, up from $85 million in last year\u2019s first quarter. On average, CNA invests between $300 million and $400 million a month in its fixed income portfolio, so higher interest rates will improve that portfolio\u2019s return over time."
