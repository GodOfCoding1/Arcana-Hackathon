The company invested approximately $33.2 million in its bromine business, mainly for bromine wells, aqueducts and the installation of high- and low-voltage lines for bromine wells. In the second quarter of year 2021, the company incurred approximately $2.1 million in  charges for the stock grant to management. For the quarter, the company had a negative foreign translation adjustment of approximately $16.4 million versus a positive adjustment of approximately $5.3 million in the previous year. Firstly, the revenue in bromine segment increased 48 percentage to approximately $22 million.
