    "content": " Thank you, Mr. Liu. Since the year 2017, our company has been forced to deal with new government rules, which involved closing our facilities for environmental planning and protection and rectification permanently closed three bromine factories and relocating our chemical factories. If the direct labor and factory overheads of approximately $2.2 million and with the foreign translation losses of approximately $283,800 are excluded, the first quarter of year 2022 would have been very profitable, even with only 39 days of operations. For the quarter, including its share of costs from closed facilities, corporate overhead, and unrecorded foreign exchange losses, crude salt lost approximately $522,000 versus $1 million. The company ended the quarter with cash of approximately $105.7 million, an increase of approximately $9.9 million from the level in the previous year. Cash flow despite the closure of our facilities for more than half of the quarter, the company generated strong cash flow from operating activities of approximately $8.5 million. Thank you, Mr. Liu. So because, first of all, if we take the company's chemical business segment, which may start commercial production in year 2023, and for the initial year, because it's just data, so in order to experience the business value of this segment, we think a six year would be more valuable to our shareholders. And the similar case to our share \u2013 to our natural gas segments, because we would put like the approval \u2013 need the approval from the government and the company needed to do some more projections on this project as well and in order for our shareholder to see the business value of this project as well."
