    "content": " In Q1, RPO, which tends to be the leading indicator for growth, increased 92% to $810 million and we are tracking well towards achieving the $1 billion RPO milestone later this year. And we will bring that theme to life in several ways, aside from the obvious advantage of being able to assemble in-person again this year, we\u2019ll also be demonstrating the unique advantages that we deliver when we assemble multiple applications at Manhattan Active applications together, a flexible and powerful Manhattan Active architecture empowers our customers and partners to easily unify solutions to take our market leading applications and extend them to do even more and drive positive change for their business and their customers. Our Q1 operating profit totaled $48 million, with adjusted operating margin of 26.9%, up 420 basis points year-over-year. For 2022 total revenue, we now expect a range of $720 million to $727 million, with a $723.5 million midpoint representing 9% year-over-year growth, up from our prior midpoint guidance of $708 million. We are increasing our cloud revenue range to $167 million to $170 million, representing 38% growth at the $168.5 million midpoint. Overall, by end of year 2022, we expect license revenue to be about 2% of total revenue averaging about $3 million in license revenue per quarter for the remainder of the year. Sir, your line is open. Sir, your line is open."
