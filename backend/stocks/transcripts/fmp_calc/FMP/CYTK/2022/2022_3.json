    "content": " For aficamten, we continued conduct of SEQUOIA-HCM, we completed patient screening in Cohort 4 of REDWOOD-HCM and we furthered our start-up activities for the second Phase 3 trial of aficamten as monotherapy, a Phase 3 trial for which we expect to activate sites by year-end and with enrollment to begin next year. Ahead of our late-cycle review meeting with the  anticipated later this quarter, we've continued discussions around dosing of omecamtiv mecarbil, its benefit-risk profile and heart failure patients and through benefit-risk profile and heart failure patients at higher risk for death and heart failure events for which the benefit of adding omecamtiv mecarbil the standard of care appears larger. One moment for our next question. Hi, Robert and team. The other question with regards to Cohort 4 screen failures, we haven't seen screen failure rates to be any meaningfully different, I would say than what we see a little bit higher than the oHCM patients in part because one of the parameters to get into these trials is a blood test.

So, I mean I think the field in general is very excited about cardiac myosin inhibitors for the treatment of this disease and the enrollment of SEQUOIA, I don't think has been significantly impacted, because it's an option that some patients may consider and relatively a good option I think given the accessibility to open-label drug after they complete the clinical trial."
