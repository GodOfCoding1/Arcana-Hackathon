    "content": " Although, the FDA did not provide clearance in March 2022 to increase the duration of use from less than 24 hours to less than 30 days for our Evo sEEG product line, we feel strongly that we met the ISO 10993 standard Part 12 and Part 18 requirements for Biological Evaluation of Medical Devices. We also remain confident that the design and materials used for the electrodes are sufficient, given we have clearances from FDA for both our Evo Cortical line for less than 30 days diagnostic use and an FDA clearance for less than 24-hour use for diagnostic purposes for our Evo sEEG product line."
