    "content": " Before I turn the call over to Mr. Rosa, I'd like to remind you that this conference call will include forward-looking statements within the meaning of U.S. Federal Securities Laws with respect to future operations, financial results, events, trends, and performance, which are based on management's beliefs and assumptions as of today's call or other specified date. During our first fiscal quarter, we achieved one of the most significant milestones in the company's history when we received FDA 510(k) clearance for the Evo sEEG electrode for less than 30 days use. Well, yes I mean, I know historically or at least at points historically, you've mentioned that the product forecast is that Zimmer has given you that - maybe been increasingly favorable or aggressive, I don't know, in the right way to characterize it. So as I said earlier, it's going to be a very controlled methodical launch, where we walk before we run just to make sure everything's performing the way we need it to, and make sure that we have the product supply that we need when there's a full launch, but nothing that I'm aware of yet."
