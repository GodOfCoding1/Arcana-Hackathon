    "content": " Starting with our second quarter financial performance, which delivered above expectations, we achieved revenue of $26.1 million in the second quarter compared to $35 million in the prior year quarter, which included $10.8 million in revenue recognized on the $15 million Abbott milestone payment associated to the successful completion of the TRANSCEND clinical report. Normalizing for this milestone payment, we grew revenue by $1.5 million or 6% year-over-year, driven by solid performance from both our medical device and IVD businesses. The Pounce Thrombectomy system achieved 100% technical process - success in this first  demand series, meaning that in a single treatment session, the device successfully removed clot from the target lesion and restored blood flow to the patient's limb in each of the 20 cases. Revenue for the second quarter of fiscal 2022 declined 25% to $26.1 million, which was favorable to our expectations. As Gary mentioned, the prior year period benefited from $10.8 million of revenue recognized from the $15 million clinical report milestone payment achieved under our SurVeil distribution and development agreement with Abbott. As I noted, the prior year period included $10.8 million in clinical report milestone revenue and excluding revenue related to this milestone, our Medical Device business revenue grew 6% year-over-year. Our second quarter royalty and license fee revenue totaled $9.8 million, down $10.2 million from the same prior year period, primarily as a result of that prior year $10.8 million impact on license fee revenue from the clinical report milestone. In our Medical Device business, product revenue grew 19% or $1 million to $6.4 million on broad-based growth across our medical device products and coating reagents. R&D services revenue of $2.3 million in the second quarter was down 27% or $860,000 compared to the same prior year period, as we faced a headwind associated with the completion of a customer development program in our IVD business. R&D expense, including cost of clinical and regulatory activities, was $13.7 million in the second quarter or 53% of revenue compared to $12.9 million in the year-ago period. Our Medical Device business reported an operating loss of $5.6 million in the second quarter compared to operating income of $8.6 million in the year ago period, which includes the impact of the clinical report milestone payment. And so if you think about the payment, whether it's $30 million or $27 million, both will be recognized as a percentage of completion, meaning the expenses to complete the TRANSCEND clinical study, which we estimate to be about 82% to 84% complete by the end of the fiscal year. Sir, please go ahead. Sir, please go ahead."
