    "content": " DSA segment revenue grew 114.8% in the fiscal 2022 third quarter to $49.2 million from $22.9 million in the fiscal 2021 third quarter, and this was driven by a $20.9 million increase in service revenue from internal growth, which was complemented by $5.4 million of incremental service revenue from the acquisitions that Bob referenced earlier. Operating income in the third quarter of fiscal 2022 was $4.8 million compared to an operating loss of $1.7 million in last year's third quarter, reflecting a significant increase in revenue, partially offset by increased operating expenses to support additional future revenue growth, which included additional headcount, recruiting and relocation expense, higher compensation expense, acquisition and integration costs, primarily related to the acquisitions of Envigo, ILS, the Orient BioResource, Histion and Protypia and an increase in start-up costs for internal investments in new service offerings."
