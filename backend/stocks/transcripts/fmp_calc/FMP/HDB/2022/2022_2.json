    "content": " The retail assets book has exhibited a robust quarterly sequential growth of around 4.5% at September '21 over June '21 and around an 11.5% on a year-on-year basis, September '21 over September '20. The next segment I want to talk about is the commercial and rural business that saw a robust sequential growth of 7.4% quarter-on-quarter, capturing strong underlying economic activity and continued market share gains. Our rural banking business had approximately 12% quarter-on-quarter growth, helped by record disbursements, strong customer acquisition through deeper village penetration in 1 lakh villages where we already operate; secondly, through program expansion in 1 lakh more villages, which we are steering over the next 18 to 24-month period; crop diversification, focus on small and marginal farmer, slightly delayed but strong sowing from June to July with a normal monsoon; and rural infrastructure support initiatives. But all I want to bring to attention is that the 4.5% growth over previous quarter on deposits and 14.4% over the previous year on the deposit side is approximately INR61,000 crores of growth -- the net growth in the quarter on deposits and INR1,77,000 crores growth since last year. And similarly, on the advances, the 4.5% sequential, 15.5% year-on-year growth on advances means it is about INR51,000 crores of net growth in the quarter and INR1,51,000 crores growth since prior year. With increased focus for the disbursements at about INR8,000 crores in the quarter, recorded a 93% growth quarter-on-quarter and 27% growth year-on-year. For this recent quarter, net revenues were INR1,917 crores against INR1,704 crores for the quarter last year, a growth of 12.5%. As of quarter end, growth Stage 3 NPA stood at 6% -- 6.1%, a reduction of over 200 basis points in the quarter over the previous quarter."
