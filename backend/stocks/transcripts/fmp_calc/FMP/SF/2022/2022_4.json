    "content": " Our institutional group has grown from essentially zero, a little less than 20 years ago into a global business that generated average total revenue in the past three years of $1.75 billion. In terms of our overall business outlook, we believe that we will achieve our objective of $1 trillion in assets under management, which coupled with loan growth, would more than double the revenue generated from Wealth Management. Of note, our fourth quarter NII totaled about $300 million, which, of course, annualizes at $1.2 billion for 2023 and does not take into account any increase in net interest margin or interest earning assets. I would note that given the expected increased contribution from NII in 2023 and our revenue guidance, we expect that our compensation ratio will decline to 56% to 58% and that operating non-comp will be in the range of 18% to 19% of net revenue. Stifel generated quarterly net revenue that surpassed $1.12 billion, our second strongest fourth quarter in our history, and our focus on managing expenses resulted in pretax margins of 23% and non-GAAP EPS of $1.58. Global Wealth Management revenue increased 10% to a record $744 million, and our pretax margins were 43%. While market conditions have weighed on this business, our increased scale enabled us to generate $971 million of investment banking revenue in 2022, which was our second strongest year ever. For the full-year, NII guidance mentioned earlier for 2023, I would note that this is based on loan growth of up to $2 billion, a bank NIM of 405 basis points to 425 basis points and a full-cycle deposit beta of 40% to 50%."
