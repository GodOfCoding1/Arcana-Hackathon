To our guests, good morning, and thank you for taking the time to listen to our third quarter results. The first nine months, revenues totaled $3.3 billion, with earnings per share of $4.17, and we are on track to record our second strongest annual revenue and earnings per share. This performance was despite market conditions that included a 25% decline in the S&P 500, nearly nonexistent capital raising activity in subdued trading markets. Revenue totaled nearly $1.05 billion, and earnings per share came in at $1.29. In addition, our return on tangible equity has exceeded 20% in each year since 2017 and is at 21.5% year-to-date on an annualized basis. As we did last quarter, we included a year-on-year revenue bridge to illustrate the changes in revenue in the third quarter of '22 compared to 2021. Simply, our increase in net interest income was more than offset by about $100 million by the absence of underwriting and reduced trading. Global Wealth Management revenue increased 7% to a record $702 million with pretax margins up 40%, an increase of 380 basis points sequentially. As I noted earlier, the increase in net interest income was the primary driver of revenue growth. While Jim will get into the details of our net interest income later in the presentation, I want to highlight that our third quarter NII was up 86% compared to the prior year's quarter, and year-to-date is up 60%. Our advisers are using Wealth Tracker to not only deepen their relationships with existing clients and to review relationships holistically, but also to attract new clients to Stifel. This is a testament not only to our culture, but to the investments we've made into the business. I would also note that these rankings are based on feedback from the advisers themselves but underscores the quality of the culture we've built here at Stifel, which is a vital aspect of our ability to continue recruiting high-quality advisers. I would say that recruiting activity remains strong, but we've seen throughout the year that the pullback in market to slow the actual transition of advisers while also accelerating the retirement of others. Regardless, we ended the quarter with fee-based asset of $136 million and total client assets of $365 billion. Speaking of growth, our net new assets increased 6% in both the third quarter and over the trailing 12-months. As I mentioned earlier, we continue to see the benefits of investing this business through recruiting and bank growth, which has not only led to revenue growth, but also a significant increase in the percentage of recurring revenue. For the quarter and a foundation of our long-term strategy, 16 experienced advisers joined Stifel as their firm of choice, choosing us because of our friendly culture, expansive products, industry-leading yet simple and fair compensation plans and excellent technology. Since the beginning of 2019, we've recruited nearly 500 advisers to our platform, a total trailing 12-month productivity of more than $350 million. One of the many benefits of our increased NII is the increased percentage of recurring revenue, which adds to greater stability and predictability of results. Our recurring revenue reached 75% for the first nine months of the year, which surpassed our previous full year high by 900 basis points. What makes it more impressive is that we do this in light of the fact that our asset management revenues, which accounts for the majority of our recurring revenue, has been impacted by market valuations. We grew our loan portfolio by $1.7 billion during the quarter, up 9% sequentially. Total firm-wide assets on September 30 were $37.6 billion, up $3.6 billion year-to-date. This will include commentary on our business during the month as well as metrics such as total client assets, fee-based assets, client cash balances and total loans. We believe that by updating the Street on a monthly basis, we can have better align expectations with our quarterly results. We built a diversified business that has made us more relevant to our clients, and we are well positioned for future growth when the operating environment stabilizes. As always, we'll also look to continue for additional growth opportunities. In the quarter, revenue was $339 million. Year-to-date, revenue was $1.2 billion, led by record advisory revenue and represented our second strongest first nine months, only trailing last year. However, the 75% decline in capital raising activity across the industry and the reduction of sequential trading volumes have more than offset the strength of our advisory business. Advisory revenue of $167 million, while an acceptable result, was negatively impacted by delays in deal closing. I'd particularly highlight the impact that we've seen in our financials vertical as regulators have slowed approval of bank transactions, including a few of our deals. We had a relatively strong quarter as we saw strength in the U.S. M&A market, particularly in technology, health care, consumer and real estate as well as restructuring. Additionally, we have increased the number of high fee assignments as we continue to deepen our relationships with our clients. Overall, while closings have slowed, we continue to see positive signs in our business as client engagement remains high, and our investment banking pipelines remain solid. On the next slide, we look at the remainder of our institutional business, looking through the lens of equities and fixed income. Our equity business was down 50%, again, due primarily to the industry-wide drop in capital raising. Fixed income transactional revenue totaled $74 million, with lower activity in our rates business. Our bank clients continue to face a lack of liquidity on their balance sheet as they contend with lower deposit levels, which has resulted in lower trading activity in their investment portfolio. The sequential decline was due in part to a slowdown in industry-wide public finance volumes, which, for the record, were down 16%. As interest rates have risen, refunding transactions have essentially ceased, and new money bond volume is still being impacted by the unspent federal ARPA funds. Additionally, we had lower activity in our taxable debt capital markets business. Stifel has increased its market share, which we calculate based on the total number of transactions of approximately 15%, up from 13% in 2021. Equity transactional revenue totaled $46 million, up modestly from the prior quarter. Also, we generated modest trading profits compared to trading losses that we discussed last quarter. In terms of equity underwriting, Stifel's activity is really no different than what's happening industry-wide. However, I do believe that this business will rebound as many transactions are delayed as opposed to being canceled, and we have seen some green shoots from the technology and health care verticals. As such, we project net interest income in the fourth quarter in a range of $290 million to $300 million and a bank NIM of 375 to 385 basis points. Based on our fourth quarter NII guidance, we expect our full year NII to be between $885 million and $895 million. Year-to-date, we've increased our average interest-earning assets by nearly $6 billion, which is at the high end of our full year guidance. As such, we expect limited balance sheet growth in the fourth quarter. But as I said last quarter, we anticipate exiting 2022 with a full year NII run rate of $1.2 billion. Thus far, through the current interest rate cycle, we've experienced a 38% deposit beta, which is consistent with our original guidance range of 25% to 50%. We ended the quarter with total of $21 billion, which was up approximately $1.7 billion from the prior quarter. Our commercial portfolio increased by $1.4 billion, with particular strength in the fund banking and industrial sectors. On the consumer side, our mortgage portfolio increased by $400 million, while our securities-based loan portfolio fell by $200 million. Total investment book value decreased by approximately $40 million sequentially, most of which was driven by portfolio amortization and maturities. And given their lower expected loss levels, our allowance to total loans ratio declined to 70 basis points. Our nonperforming assets as a percentage of total assets were four basis points, while our nonperforming loans were five basis points. Our risk-based and leverage capital ratios remained strong at 17% and 11.1%, respectively. Our funding base increased modestly in the third quarter, and PCG client cash, which consists of sweep deposits and smart rate deposits, were essentially flat at $26 billion, and I would note, have increased since quarter end. Specifically, our smart rate program is approximately $4.7 billion in deposits, up from approximately $1.5 billion as of the time of our last earnings call. As I stated earlier, we'll likely see limited balance sheet growth in the fourth quarter. As we think about future growth, much of that will be driven by growth in assets from adviser recruiting, and we can potentially tap into some of the $6 billion in additional money market fund balances. Non-compensation operating expenses, excluding the credit loss provision and expenses related to investment banking transactions, totaled approximately $209 million, which is flat sequentially. While the absolute amount of our non-comp operating expenses was in line with our expectations, it came in above our guidance as a percentage of revenue due to lower-than-expected revenue. The effective tax rate during the quarter came in at 26.5%, which was above our guidance due to our forward operations. Absent any assumption for additional share repurchases and assuming a stable stock price, we'd expect the fourth quarter fully diluted share count to be116.8 million shares. Before I turn the presentation back to Ron, I wanted to give some additional color on our expectations for the fourth quarter and the full year. And as a result, we now forecast net revenue to come in at the low end of last quarter's guidance for 2022 despite continued strength in our net interest income. Our non-comp expenses have essentially been in line with our initial forecast, but due to lower revenues, we've increased our expectations for operating non-compensation ratio to 18% to 20%. Look, it's been a tough year as financial conditions have tightened significantly, and market returns have been dismal pretty much regardless of asset class. We have built a strong and balanced business, which remains well positioned to gain market share and deliver for our shareholders and associates alike. Let's not lose sight of the fact that Stifel is having its second-best year, with operating margins and return on tangible common equity both exceeding 20% and very strong credit and capital metrics. As Jim detailed, we anticipate net interest income back to 2022 with a run rate of $1.2 billion, assuming -- and assuming -- that assumes no growth in interest-earning assets. Everyone is concerned about the state of the institutional business, and I see this as a business that will continue with strong growth, and we will look back at 2022 as a difficult, yet temporary operating environment. As we have often stated, our strategy is to use our excess capital in a variety of ways to benefit our shareholders. At different moments in the cycle in order to effectively deploy capital, we may elect organic growth, acquisitions, increased dividends or share repurchase. At this point, it is our expectation given the economic outlook that our asset-light growth is likely to slow. So given our high level of profitability, the fact that our capital ratios are well above our target levels and the fact that we will slow our balance sheet growth, it is likely that our capital deployment will focus more on dividend increases and share repurchases and, if appropriate, acquisitions. So we talked about smart rate program at the end of the quarter had $4.7 billion, and it's increased some since then. And when we think about the total deposit beta here and the asset yields, we're getting, we're able to generate a return that it makes sense to continue to capture those deposits. We ended the quarter with -- if you look at, like I said, in the end-of-period book yield on our bonds and our loan portfolio, it was north of 475 basis points. And inherent, what we talked about a 38% deposit beta through the end of the period, so ignore the lag, you're at about 114 basis point cost of funds. And as we look forward, we've tried to illustrate some of the impact of that on the 2023 results. And I think without growth and the ability to retain those deposits, it's pretty impactful. And then I would just add from a client behavior perspective, I think we've always said we've been consistent that we felt in this cycle that cash sorting would ultimately be greater than what we've seen in the past. I guess pivoting to the institutional side, I just wanted to dig into the FIC business a little bit more. Understanding that business is different from the bulge bracket in terms of mix, a bit surprised to see fees in that business come down on a year-over-year basis following that Vining Sparks deal that you guys completed. And maybe you could just speak to some of the drivers of that decline in a little bit greater detail, that would be great. Well, the fixed income, there's -- you could think of it as really three of the business that we do. Frankly, taxable underwriting like equity underwriting has been very slow in terms of debt activity with corporations not really engaging that much in the capital raising side. I don't see that turning on a dime, but I think we're near the lows of that activity. And then, of course, the credit business has been impacted just as credit wide have really spread, especially what's going on in the high-yield market. So for us, that business -- I think the results have been pretty good. And there's been a lot of activity and a lot of volatility that has driven those results, which we don't do. And I think you look at both the loan and the bond portfolio, there's opportunities in both. I think where it's going to be limited due is more so of how we're generating deposits to support that, but there's a number of different lending verticals across fund banking, various different C&I channels that offer pretty attractive yields today. And you think about on the bond side as well, CLOs are being priced anywhere from, it so offers to plus 2.10 to 3.50. There is some fund placement business that goes on through that transactional line that has been slowed as well, and that's impacted the results from retail transactional results. And Devin, I want to go back a little bit to your question about growth in the balance sheet. We've grown loans through nine months, 25%. Our belief is that with the cash that we're generating, which is substantial cash, the math has changed on whether or not that cash is better deployed back to shareholders, especially our stock prices relative to growth and in the current environment. So that's really the message, is that it's an opportunity to remix the balance sheet, but it's also where is the best investment for the substantial amount of cash that we're generating, frankly, on a daily basis. No, really appreciate that and makes sense, and I think people will like to see buybacks here. So if you look at the loan mix, Stifel has a fairly outsized balance with PE and venture capital commitments -- capital commitment lines. And maybe as a follow-up to that, obviously, the yield curve is flat, but the absolute level of yield is reasonably attractive, especially if, I guess, if you believe the forward curve and that we'll get rate cuts at some point of time in the next 12 to 18 months. Well, the first question, there's two questions there. And look, I think it's a good question as to the growth in that business considering capital raises, that's all tied together. Those loans come off of PE firms actually raising our capital and then taking those commitments and prefunding them sort of with the banks, that's what we and other banks do. If that prepayment would occur, we would be remixing our balance sheet and our loan portfolio and with equally quality assets. I think it makes some sense to extend some duration here, but -- and we saw with our friends over in Britain, if you do everything all at once, that doesn't always end very well. And obviously, it sounds like there's an appetite for a bigger buyback. Well, I think that we're allocating certainly, and it's an efficient capital allocation model, but we're allocating to recruiting. A number of the things that we have done have made that a very attractive area for us to put investment, and you're going to see us really focusing on building wealth management through recruiting. On the other acquisition front, we've been focusing on advisory type businesses. So capital-light type businesses, and that would certainly be on the advisory front on the institutional side. That said, there's always a lot of opportunities that present themselves in markets like this. What I would say on balance is that if you think about it, we grew our assets so far about $4 billion. As we slow that, that's capital that can be used for deployment back to shareholders. And on top of that, you have about $400 million in excess of, like, a Tier 1 leverage target. And we've been growing, Alex, and we've been deploying our capital, as I said, $4 billion of growth. We look forward to reporting on our fourth quarter late January, and we'll give everyone a look forward into 2023."
