    "content": " Revenues grew 28% local currency, increasing $3 billion over Q2 last year and nearly $300 million above the top end of our guided range, driven by broad-based over-delivery across all markets, services and industries with all 13 industries growing double digits. New bookings were a record at $19.6 billion for the quarter, representing growth of 22% in USD over a very strong Q2 last year, with an overall book-to-bill of 1.3. Stepping back, when you think about the extraordinary growth we are experiencing and how we navigated the pandemic, we believe our commitment to create 360-degree value for all our stakeholders and our unmatched diversity of people, services, industries, functions, markets, ecosystem partners and investments, together with our leadership and technology, have made us both relevant to the world's largest companies and resilient. And so for inflation, depending on the industry, like, for example, consumer goods, there's been a lot of focus on growth and cost, right, with cost being even higher up because you're seeing that you can't push through all of the -- and price increases, all of the increases in input."
