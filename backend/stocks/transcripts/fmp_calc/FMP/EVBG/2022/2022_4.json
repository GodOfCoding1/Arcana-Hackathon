    "content": " For the fourth quarter we achieved revenue of $117.1 million, an increase of 14% year-over-year; adjusted EBITDA of $19.6 million, an increase of $19 million from $572,000 a year ago; and annual recurring revenue of $384 million, which is up $14 million or 4% quarter-over-quarter, our largest quarter-over-quarter increase of the year. Revenue grew 14% year-over-year to $117.1 million reflecting our growth in ARR as well as record deliveries of one-time licenses and services of over $16 million and a modest stub of inorganic contribution from the Anvil acquisition, which was completed in November, 2021. Adjusted EBITDA was $19.6 million or 17% of revenue, which is a little higher than the mid-teens adjusted EBITDA that we guided to at the outset of 2022 and is an early reflection of the streamlined cost structure with which we enter fiscal year 2023. Putting new wins, growth deals, and retentions together, our ARR in Q4 reached $384 million, up $14 million sequentially, positioning us well for 2023. You may now go ahead. You may now go ahead. You may now go ahead. You may now go ahead. You may now go ahead. You may now go ahead. You may now go ahead. You may now go ahead. You may now go ahead. But the real opportunity here in the first half is, arresting the departures and improving rep retention, which, whatever we are now six weeks into the quarter as well as from beginning July last year, we're making really good progress on that rep retention, that's thing one to address."
