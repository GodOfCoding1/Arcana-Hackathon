    "content": " Total deferred revenue was $233 million, up from $214 million at September 30, 2021, and flat sequentially reflecting a higher mix of perpetual license deals than we had seen in recent quarters and timing of invoicing in our SaaS business. For the fourth quarter, we anticipate revenue of between $116 million and $116.4 million, representing year-over-year growth of 13%. As discussed earlier, FX will pose roughly $2 million of headwind to fourth quarter revenue relative to currencies on January 1, 2022, and roughly $0.5 million of headwind relative to the rates that were reflected in the guidance, which we provided 3 months ago. Taking all this into consideration, we expect 2023 baseline revenue growth of 6% to 7% with a clear line of sight to 2023 adjusted EBITDA of $85 million. Yeah, thanks for bringing that up. That has to do, as Patrick said, first with an alignment across the organization that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re driving a recurring revenue growth, in particularly to SaaS software recurring revenue growth, that also reflects the fact that there have been other acquisitions over time, and those cohorts of customers, in some cases aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t growing and retaining as well as our core CEMP. Yeah, thanks for bringing that up. The other area where X matters is playing a really key role, as I alluded to in a prior Q&A, when we talk to our customers, this idea of enterprise workflow and having one central way does one platform approach and extensible approach to managing risks across the enterprise that CIO and our CISO, along with the CSO controlled in most organizations 80% of the risk events, and bringing that together in a common look of dealing workflow is one of the really great strategic areas we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to be leaning into."
