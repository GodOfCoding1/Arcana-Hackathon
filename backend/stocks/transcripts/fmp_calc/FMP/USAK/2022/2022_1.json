    "content": " Consolidated adjusted operating ratio for the quarter was 89.2%, down from 95.6% in the prior year, primarily driven by improvements in base revenue per mile in our trucking segment as a direct result of our continued network optimization efforts and market uplift. But frankly, kind of as L.A. goes, everybody else goes, I tend to joke at least mathematically, there's really only one head haul market in America in terms of the math and it's L.A. And so there's no doubt that when and if that freight backlog gets this large, it's inevitable, but that's going to have an impact on us."
