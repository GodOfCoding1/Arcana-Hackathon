    "content": " As far as earnings, we achieved adjusted EBITDA near the high end of our guidance range, ending the year with higher adjusted EBITDA than 2021 when excluding a nonrecurring $13 million property insurance gain. We also expect to continue pursuing opportunities to invest in the growth of the business and return capital to shareholders, such as the $10 million we used in 2022 to repurchase 3.1 million shares of Class A common stock, which was more than 5% of our outstanding shares. After excluding the 2021 Quad Express divestiture, net sales increased 11% in 2022 compared to 2021 due to sales growth in all of our offerings, including pricing increases to partially offset inflationary costs, print segment share gains and sales growth in our integrated solutions offerings as well as in our international locations. Adjusted EBITDA increased sequentially each quarter in 2022 as we expected, culminating with $79 million of adjusted EBITDA in the fourth quarter, which represents a $19 million or 32% increase in adjusted EBITDA compared to $16 million in the fourth quarter of 2021. When excluding the 2021 property insurance gain, adjusted EBITDA increased $5 million in 2022 compared to 2021 due to net sales growth. Adjusted EBITDA margin decreased 1 point from 2021, primarily due to cost inflation, investments made in hiring and training labor in the first half of 2022, the negative impact of supply chain disruptions and the 2021 nonrecurring property insurance gain, partially offset by increased earnings from net sales growth. At our year-end pro forma blended interest rate of 6.2%, we are expecting an increase of approximately $20 million in interest payments in 2023 compared to 2022 despite our lower debt balance. Over the past 3 years, we have reduced net debt by $489 million or 47%, despite challenges from the COVID-19 pandemic, inflationary costs, supply chain disruption, rising interest rates and ongoing economic uncertainty. Full year 2023 adjusted EBITDA is expected to be between $210 million and $250 million, with $230 million at the midpoint of that range, representing a $22 million decline from 2022 adjusted EBITDA due to lower net sales, and an $11 million decrease of noncash income from our pension plans."
