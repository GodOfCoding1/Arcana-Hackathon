    "content": " I'm pleased to report that in the third quarter, we delivered better-than-expected net sales of $830 million, an 18% increase. Net sales were $830 million in the third quarter, up 18% from 2021. The adjusted EBITDA increase of over 25% was driven by continued sales growth and proactive investments made in labor, inventory and equipment during the first half of 2022, to increase production efficiency in the second half of 2022 during our seasonally higher production period. The decline in the year-to-date period was primarily due to cost inflation, investments made in hiring and training labor in the first half of the year, the negative impact of supply chain disruptions on our productivity and a $13 million gain from a property insurance claim in 2021, which were partially offset by increased earnings from net sales growth. Adjusted diluted earnings per share was $0.32 in the third quarter of 2022, a 78% increase compared to $0.18 in the third quarter of 2021. Free cash flow decreased $60 million to negative $80 million for the first 9 months of 2022, primarily due to higher working capital driven by inflationary cost increases, supply chain disruption and higher net sales. Our financial objectives include accelerating our business as a marketing experience company to fuel net sales growth, driving profitability through sales growth, effective cost management and productivity improvements, maintaining a strong balance sheet with a primary focus on reducing debt through the generation of strong free cash flow as well as a balanced approach to capital allocation, including pursuing opportunities to return capital to shareholders through stock buybacks or dividends."
