    "content": " Net sales were $744 million in the first quarter, up 5% from 2021, excluding the June 2021 divestiture of Quad express a third-party logistics company that was a small part of our overall logistics business, net sales increased 9% from 2021. The decline in adjusted EBITDA during the quarter was primarily driven by supply chain disruptions, investments in hiring and training labor in advance of peak production season in the second half of the year and cost inflation, partially offset by net sales growth. As a reminder to what I told investors during last quarter's call, adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow will be lower in the first half of 2022, compared to the previous year as we make strategic investments to expand our offerings and to drive higher revenue, profitability and cash in the second half of 2022 during our seasonal peak. We've also done a lot on the labor side too -- with a best-in-class workforce that is additional $50 million in investment over the past 12-months, that includes higher wages for -- when we start people and in our experience folks, sign on bonuses, referral programs, training investment in those people all to be able to service our clients well during now and the upcoming peak season."
