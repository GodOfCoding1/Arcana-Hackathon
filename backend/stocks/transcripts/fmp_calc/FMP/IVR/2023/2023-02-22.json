    "content": " The period end weighted average yield on our Agency RMBS investments improved from 4.65% at the end of the third quarter to 5.26% at the end of the fourth, capturing a significant improvement in available returns given more attractive valuations and higher coupons as the inverted yield curve and elevated front-end interest rate volatility provides higher yields for shorter duration investments. Although we continue to anticipate elevated front-end interest rate volatility as monetary policy evolves, we believe current valuations on production coupon Agency RMBS represent attractive investment opportunities with current ROEs in the mid-teens."
