    "content": " Elevated interest rate volatility and the potential for mortgage sales from the Fed remain headwinds, but we expect the environment for mortgages to improve given wider spreads on higher coupon mortgages, attractive funding and reduced supply resulting from lower origination volume. As shown in the lower right-hand chart, US commercial banks slowed their purchases of agency mortgages during the second quarter concurrent with the end of net asset purchases by the Federal Reserve, resulting in significantly lower demand for the sector during the quarter. The period end weighted average yield on our Agency RMBS investments improved from 2.54% at the end of the first quarter to 4.07% at the end of the second quarter, capturing a significant improvement in available returns given wider spreads and higher interest rates during the quarter. To conclude our prepared remarks, although the tone and Agency RMBS has improved since the end of the second quarter, challenges remain in the sector as volatility remains elevated and the sharp reduction in demand from commercial banks and the Federal Reserve reduces the number of potential buyers."
