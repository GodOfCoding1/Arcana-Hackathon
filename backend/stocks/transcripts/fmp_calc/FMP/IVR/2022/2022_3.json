    "content": " On a positive note, earnings available for distribution for the third quarter remained strong at $1.39 per common share given our rotation into higher-yielding agency mortgages, along with favorable funding and a relatively low-cost legacy swap portfolio. During the third quarter, persistently elevated inflation and the acceleration of monetary policy tightening by the Federal Reserve continued to pressure interest rates higher, leading to another bear flattening move, a consistent theme over the past year. As shown in the lower right-hand chart, U.S. commercial banks reduced their holdings of agency mortgages during the third quarter, concurrent with the end of net asset purchases by the Federal Reserve, resulting in significantly lower demand for the sector during the quarter. With paydowns on the agency mortgage portion of the Fed's balance sheet approximately $20 billion to $25 billion per month in the third quarter, it is unlikely the $35 billion cap will be restrictive absent a significant drop in mortgage rates and resulting increase in refinancing and housing activity. The period end weighted average yield on our Agency RMBS investments improved from 4.07% at the end of the second quarter to 4.65% at the end of the third quarter, capturing a significant improvement in available returns given wider spreads and higher interest rates during the quarter. In addition, the Agency RMBS market should benefit from both and anticipated reduction in volatility as the Federal Reserve near the conclusion of the monetary policy tightening cycle and improving technicals given the impact of higher mortgage rates on supply."
