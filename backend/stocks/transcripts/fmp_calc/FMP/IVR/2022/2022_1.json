    "content": " Furthermore, market concerns on the potential for sales from the Fed's balance sheet sparked additional deterioration in the Agency MBS valuations and by the end of April, the asset class had experienced its most significant cheapening since the financial crisis with 30-year current coupon nominal spread to treasuries increasing over 100 basis points since May of 2021, shown in the bottom left chart. We significantly reduced our allocation to Agency MBS through outright sales of lower coupon securities and pay downs on the total portfolio, given the continued challenges in the sector, while the earnings capacity of the company remained robust through attractive funding rates and relatively slow prepayment speeds. In addition to the reduction in the overall allocation, we have diversified the coupon distribution substantially as the rise in mortgage rates since year-end provided an opportunity to invest proceeds of sales in lower coupons into more attractive options higher in the coupon stack, given new production in those coupons."
