    "content": "  As a reminder, various remarks made during this call contain certain forward-looking statements relating to our business prospects and the development and commercialization of pelareorep, including statements regarding the company\u2019s focus, strategy and objectives, company\u2019s belief as to the potential and mode of action of pelareorep as a cancer therapeutic, design, aims and anticipated benefits of our current and pending clinical trials, and anticipated timing of the release of the additional data. We believe this strategy nicely aligns with pelareorep\u2019s pharmacological profile, as its clinically demonstrated ability to stimulate anti-cancer immunity and weaken tumor defense mechanisms, positions it as an attractive immuno-oncology product in its own right, as well as the ideal combination partner for a wide array of therapeutic classes. Also included in the ESMA poster, where data is showing statistically significant post treatment increases in markers of tumor cell death, and T-cell active patient which further define the molecular mechanisms by which pelareorep delivers the exciting prognostic results I just mentioned, as well as the clinical benefits we observed in earlier breast cancer studies. When viewed alongside the previously reported results from the very successful AWARE-1 study, these latest data add to a clear and compelling picture of pelareorep multifaceted mechanism of action that explained its ability to offer clinical benefit in multiple indications and in combination with a wide variety of therapeutic partners."
