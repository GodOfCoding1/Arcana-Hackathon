    "content": "  As a reminder, various remarks made during this call contain certain Forward-Looking Statements relating to our business prospects and the development and commercialization of pelareorep, including statements regarding the Company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s focus, strategy and objectives, Company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s belief as to the potential and mode of action of pelareorep as a cancer therapeutic, design, aims and anticipated benefits of our current and pending clinical trials and anticipated timing of the release of the additional data. This belief is supported by data from multiple clinical studies such as IND-213, which showed a statistically significant near doubling of overall survival and HR positive HER2 negative breast cancer patients when pela was added on top of chemotherapy. We were thus highly encouraged when GOBLET\u00e2\u0080\u0099s initial readout showed treatment with the combination of pela, atezolizumab and standard of care chemotherapy led to dramatic tumor shrinkage and partial responses per resist criteria in all patients in the pancreatic cancer cohort. These data, which were presented at the ESMO Breast Cancer Meeting in May focused on how pela when added to the standard of care therapy Letrozole with or without the checkpoint inhibitor atezolizumab modified the tumor micro environment in HR positive, HER2 negative breast cancer patients. So CAR T-cell therapies generate billions of dollars in annual sales and have produce groundbreaking clinical data shown long-term cures and hematologic cancers, efforts to extend their benefits to patients to solid tumors have thus far been unsuccessful."
