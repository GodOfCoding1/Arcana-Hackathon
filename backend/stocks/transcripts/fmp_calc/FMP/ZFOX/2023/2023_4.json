    "content": " I'm really excited to speak with you today about our strong close to the fiscal year, the continued significant growth opportunity we see in external cybersecurity and our focus for the upcoming year on taking a balanced approach between capitalizing on growth and progressing on our path to profitability. We saw continued success winning larger deals as well, ending the year with 147 subscription customers with ARR greater than $100,000, an increase 25% year-over-year. I mean I think typical for the ZeroFox in our history, I know it's a short history for you guys but Q1 has always been our most challenged quarter from a cash flow standpoint and wouldn't expect that this year would be different but just like the expense flow, cash flow tends to perform throughout the year and getting better each quarter and we would expect that to happen again this year."
