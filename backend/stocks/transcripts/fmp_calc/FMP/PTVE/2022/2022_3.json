    "content": " Adjusted EBITDA improved by $68 million to $187 million due primarily to favorable pricing net of material costs pass-through and the benefit of the Fabri-Kal acquisition, offsetting higher manufacturing and employee-related costs as well as lower volumes. The $68 million of year-over-year adjusted EBITDA improvement was due to a $236 million benefit from price/mix and $23 million due to Fabri-Kal acquisition and the divestiture of our Asia business, partially offset by a negative impact of $126 million from material costs and $42 million due to higher SG&A and other costs, driven primarily by employee-related costs and $23 million from lower volumes. Adjusted EBITDA for the segment was up $49 million or 77% versus the same period last year, primarily due to favorable pricing net of material costs pass-through and the impact from the acquisition of Fabri-Kal, partially offset by higher manufacturing costs, lower sales volume and higher employee-related costs."
