    "content": " Fourth quarter net revenues were $1.5 billion, down 8% versus the prior quarter, largely on declining sales volume across all segments from slowing consumer spend, seasonality and the sale of the Beverage Merchandising Asia business, partially offset by price mix in our food merchandising and beverage merchandising segments due to material cost, pass-throughs and other price actions. Quarter-over-quarter, net revenues were down $83 million, or 11%, due to lower sales volume and unfavorable price mix of 2% amid shifting consumer and seasonal trends and ongoing inflationary pressures driving an overall slowing of consumer spend, particularly in the QSR channel. Quarter-over-quarter, net revenues were down slightly by $8 million, or 2%, as a decline in sales volume of 6% from seasonal trends combined with the slowing of consumer spend was mostly offset by a 4% favorable price mix from higher material costs pass-through to customers and other pricing actions. Quarter-over-quarter, net revenues were down $37 million, or 9%, primarily due to 8% lower sales volume on softening demand, primarily from uncoated freesheet and liquid packaging board and a 3% lower volume due to the sale of the Asia operations in Q3, partially offset by 2% favorable price mix due to contractual cost pass-throughs."
