    "content": " We declared total first quarter dividends of $0.44, consisting of our new base dividend of $0.37, which we have increased for the third consecutive period plus a $0.07 supplemental. Our net asset value decreased by 1% in the fourth quarter to $16.99 per share, primarily due to the impact of widening market yields. Total investment income for the fourth quarter was $56 million, the prior quarter after taking into account the onetime impact of direct travel in Q3. Total expenses increased in the quarter from $29 million to $31 million, primarily due to higher interest expense from rising base rates on our financing facilities. The result was total net investment income for the fourth quarter of $25 million or $0.48 per share, up 9% versus $0.44 per share of core earnings in Q3."
