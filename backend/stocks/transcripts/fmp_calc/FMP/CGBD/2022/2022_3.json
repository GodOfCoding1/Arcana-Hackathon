    "content": " And so certainly as rates go from up to north of 4%, we're going to see that interest coverage ratio across the portfolio go down across the broad portfolio, it's just 2x now it's going to be less than 2x, but we're really focused -- keenly focused on is individual credits there's a gamut in terms of, if we have a strong performing credit, maybe day one we started higher leverage. I think it's going to be credit-by-credit but we're certainly very focused on interest coverage ratios and then more importantly just overall free cash flow looking at working capital, taxes, interest and LTM basis but really more importantly go forward because company may have generated cash in the last 12 months, but certainly their interest burden is going to go up dramatically in the next 12 months."
