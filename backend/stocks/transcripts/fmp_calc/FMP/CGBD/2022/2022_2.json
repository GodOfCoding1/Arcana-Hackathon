    "content": " In terms of the forward outlook for earnings, based on the combination of lower non-accruals, attractive economics on new investments and higher benchmark rates, we see a near-term path to materially grow earnings in coming quarters. All told, we see NII for the second half of the year in the $0.43 to $0.44 per share range, with a number of potential factors that would generate further upside, to remain highly confident in our ability to comfortably meet and exceed the new $0.34 base dividend and continue to pay out sizable supplemental dividends each quarter. In fact, our two watchlist investments experienced a net positive of $7 million for the quarter, and our June 30 NAV remains 1.5% above the December 2019 level. With the combination of lowered net non-accruals, a favorable investment environment and earnings upside from rising base rates, we expect to meaningfully grow our earnings and dividends over the coming quarters. Now as we look at our forward earnings, really three drivers that we feel quite comfortable that we're going to be able to exceed that $0.38 to $0.40, number one, non-accruals; number two, more favorable spreads in the investment environment; and then number three, out of our control but we don't want to put too much stock in but rising benchmark rates."
