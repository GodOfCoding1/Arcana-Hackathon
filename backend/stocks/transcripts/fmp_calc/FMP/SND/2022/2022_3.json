    "content": " In the third quarter, Smart Sand delivered sales volumes of 1.1 million tons, $17.8 million in contribution margin and $11 million in adjusted EBITDA. Total revenues were higher in the third quarter primarily to continued improvement in average sales prices of our sand, increased utilization of our SmartSystems fleet and $2.7 million in contractual shortfall revenue. Our cost of sales for the quarter were $60.2 million compared to $59.7 million last quarter, remaining relatively consistent period-over-period with nothing significant to call out. Net income was $2.7 million for the third quarter or $0.06 per basic and diluted share compared to a net loss of $90,000 or $0.00 per basic and diluted share for the second quarter 2022. For the third quarter 2022, contribution margin was $17.8 million and adjusted EBITDA was $11.3 million compared to second quarter contribution margin of $15.3 million and adjusted EBITDA of $9.2 million. For the third quarter of 2022, we generated $10.8 million in net cash provided by operating activities, leading to $6.4 million in free cash flow after we spent $4.4 million on capital expenditures. So the combination of having consistent volumes in the fourth quarter versus more of a drop-off than we've seen in the last couple of years, coupled with a good pricing environment, I think this leaves us to feel confident that we'll be in contribution margin per ton levels that you saw in the second quarter and the third quarter even backing out the shortfall revenue for the third quarter number."
