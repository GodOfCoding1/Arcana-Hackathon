    "content": " For the second quarter of 2022, the company had a net loss of $90,000 or $0.00 per basic and diluted share, compared to a net loss of $5.9 million or a negative $0.14 per basic and diluted share for the first quarter of 2022. For the second quarter of 2022, contribution margin was $15.3 million and adjusted EBITDA was $9.2 million compared to first quarter contribution margin of $4.3 million and negative adjusted EBITDA of $1.9 million. For the second quarter, contribution margin per ton was $12.75 per ton compared to $4.99 per ton last quarter. For the second quarter of 2022, we had negative $3.7 million in free cash flow due to a negative $2.3 million in operating cash flows and $1.4 million of capital expenditures. As a result of the working capital timing issues mentioned previously, we drew on our revolver in the second quarter and ended second quarter 2022 with $3 million outstanding on our facility. Since the end of the second quarter, we have drawn an additional $3 million on our facility and today, we have availability under the revolver of approximately $13 million. We currently expect capital expenditures for the year to be in the $20 million to $25 million range, excluding any additional acquisitions, but the additional capital over the remainder of 2022 currently planned to be spent on planned efficiency projects at Oakdale and Utica and investments to support our growing IPS business."
