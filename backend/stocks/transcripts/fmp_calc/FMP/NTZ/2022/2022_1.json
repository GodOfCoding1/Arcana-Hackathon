Once again, that\u2019s (+1) 412-717-9633, then passcode 39252103# in addition to the link provided to join via video. Following the introduction, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, instructions will be given at that time. Joining us today from Natuzzi is Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Antonio Achille; the Executive Chairman, Mr. Pasquale Natuzzi; then Mr. Jason Camp, President of Natuzzi Americas; and Piero Direnzo, Investor Relations. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. Thank you, Kevin and good day to everyone. Before proceeding, we would like to advise our listeners that our discussion today could contain certain statements that constitute forward-looking statements under the United States securities laws. Obviously, actual results may differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements because of risks and uncertainties that can affect our results of operations and financial condition. And now, I would like to turn the call over to the company's Chief Executive Officer. In terms of order flow, roughly 90% of order flow come from brands which is 4, 5 percentage points above the respective period of 2021 and 2020. North America is growing 32% in revenue, Southwest Europe 19% and China 14%. We added 19 freestanding store in the quarter, all in franchising, 16 of which are in China, where you know we are already a critical mass of both 380 stores, 2 are in U.S. and 1 in Italy. In North America, like-for-like is above 50% versus 2021. So again, a strong sign that our retail formula start working. As a result, the weight of retail, directly operated store and franchising on total revenue grew to 52% compared to 49% in quarter '21. As you will -- as you have read from our press release, Gilles Bonan which is a senior executive which cover several positions, including the one of CEO of Roche Bobois, joined our Board as independent and also the Board approved the stock option plan which should become effective in the next few months. We wish this to be a phenomenon that stayed in the COVID but clearly, this inflation is continuing beyond COVID. As you have seen in total transparency, we also mentioned that in China, we are dealing with the restriction imposed by the local authority which are affecting our factory in the Shanghai area is an important factory. We're now dealing also with other additional element which is the continued inflation, the COVID restriction in China and clearly, the war in the euro zone. In the press release, you said that they'll start to take effect during Q2. Given the price increases and -- excuse me, given the price increases that you're passing and then also, you've alluded to modernization investments or capital expenditures at the factory level to improve efficiency. So if I -- Dave, thank you very much for your question. If I take literally your question, the short answer is yes, in the sense that if we are not to assume any further inflation pressure, the answer is yes. Reality, we keep reporting strong inflation. European Union just reported today an inflation for the month of May of 8.1% which is the highest since the creation of European Union, 1999. So every year, at the beginning -- at the end of the year and we take decision at the beginning of the year, we look at what we expect the dynamics for raw material and cost of different form plus transportation. What we've been dealing is a situation where we, in certain months of the year, reported an inflation which has been higher than what normally we report in 1 year. We also reported, for instance, when it comes to metal like energy, given the war in Ukraine, a complete surge of cost overnight of fuel and other energetic cost. So we keep reviewing the pricing list, maybe not just one but multiple time during the year to make sure that we can protect the marginality we want. This, of course, cannot be done every day because dealing with partner and client, you cannot change the condition every day. You also need to recognize that given our model, whatever decision we take today, it will be effective in terms of revenue 2, 3 months afterward. Because the fulfillment timing between the order taking and the order recognition, the revenue recognition is 3 months. And if inflation should stay reasonable, stable, this should be more than enough to protect our marginality. Reality, these dynamics has been particularly crazy over the last few months. And then -- yes, I'm sorry, I'm assuming you're going to touch on... So given a certain price list, typically, the industry invest in selling discounts. This historically is significant for the industry and has been very significant for Natuzzi which is another way to protect marginality of course, acting on this. So while pricing is, as you can imagine, more an immediate decision, capturing the benefit require 2 elements, 1 investment in the factories and also training of our team to work in a different way -- of our workers doing in a different way. We started this pilot call 4.0, basically at December 2021. So we are like 5 months, is progressing extremely well. Second is managing them through our Lean process, so kind of continuous flow. The pilot is progressing well, is delivering results above our internal expectation. This is becoming the new blueprint, a new standard for the new factory will develop and for the investment we are doing to modernize the existing factory. Starting from the second part of this year, we'll be start acting on our Italian factory where the cost of labor is higher and where the benefit of this new technology are expected to be higher. We expect this to be a way to contribute to better quality for our clients and to reduce quite importantly, the cost of production. So I would say, significant, of course, for an industry like our industrial margins are not, let's say, infinite. In terms of timing of investment will be between second part of this year and next year, the bulk of the investment in the Italian plants. In terms of ROI, I would say we look at that is attractive compared to the use of capital we want to do. So it's higher than the current, let's say, average return on capital. In the past, you've talked about the expansion of your North American footprint, direct operated stores with a goal of opening up approximately 10 per year. As an investor, that was one of the reasons why we like the story is because there would be that pivot to much higher-margin branded product north of 70%. And then also if there's an opportunity in Western Europe and elsewhere, if you can touch on that as well. So, I would say there's definitely an opportunity to increase DOS and FOS in U.K. which is a market where we already have a good established operational base in terms of store and brand awareness. There is clearly an opportunity in Spain, where we have team and we have 11 stores and a good brand awareness. And also here, we used to be quite significant in terms of distribution. And here, we're also exploring a way to come back. So definitely, there are opportunity beyond the U.S., beyond U.K. and Spain but we need to be very focused. Because my view is that, especially when it comes to retail, you need to be strong locally to be strong globally. What I don't suggest the company will not lead the company to do it to be scattered and to be -- to have one store here and one store there because then it's very difficult to manage them, to attract talent, to kind of have a pay back on marketing. We just opened a new fantastic store in Vienna, in the real center of Vienna is a franchising with a partner which is willing to open 10, 15 in that area. So beyond the U.S., we look at franchising for both brand is a way to accelerate our retail transformation. And on that front, I believe Europe and emerging markets are quite promising. Because different from North America and Asia, there is still a significant amount of traditional mom and pops for retail store. And as the industry is modernizing, they can see in our franchising a perfect plug-and-play business to substitute their mom and pops which with this inflation and with the supply chain is very difficult to manage and become part of our family with a predictable return and a predictable investment. In the past, we've looked at the China JV as \"a hidden asset.\" Now you don't have to talk about Vietnam or Singapore where they're much smaller, we like it but just specifically China. And four is individual investor, KUKA which is listed in Shanghai and Natuzzi is increasingly Board by Board. As I mentioned, there is alternative that with inside the shareholder with Pasquale Natuzzi, the Chairman we discussed which include potentially a IPO of the China operation. But on that, there's been initial discussion with a partner. If there are no further questions, I'd like to turn the floor back over to management at this time for any further or closing comments. I mean, we are looking at a quarter which we believe is a good step, right, in our direction of accomplishing our plan which is around brand, is around retail, is around growing in focused geography and modernizing our factory. We've been mentioning quite explicitly in our press release, the fact that China is in locked down and this is affecting our factories. Good news is that just beginning of June, the authority confirmed that we can go back and having 80% of total workforce operational in the factory which is positive. As I mentioned, we also keep investing to make sure that we can maintain our top line expectation in terms of retail and wholesale in a situation where, as you can see, the market in general for retail, see a more prudent consumer. So this is a bit -- I would say, summary. In that note, that does conclude today's teleconference and webcast."
