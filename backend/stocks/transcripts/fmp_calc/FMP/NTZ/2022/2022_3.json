    "content": " When it comes to marginality, we closed the quarter with 37.7% margin, which compare with 36.6% of 2021 and with 28.7% of 2019, so versus 2019, almost 10 additional percentage points of marginality, this in a year which has been still characterized by significant increase in cost in some of the materials and a true spike in the energy cost. So as a result of those element, let's say, our continued growth and a better marginality, we closed the third quarter with EUR4.1 million profit, which compare with a loss of EUR0.4 million of the quarter -- or the third quarter last year and a profit -- and a loss of EUR8.7 million in 2019, so quite a significant improvement during the quarter. So when it come on the management of our cost, we went back to basic in the sense that in 2019, the company, also with external support of McKinsey, put together a process to manage in a tight way the restructuring cost, looking at any individual dollar, which has been spent across all category, which include purchase, transformation cost, industrial cost, G&A, the quarter cost. So I think if we just look at the third quarter, also to compensate a slowdown in the revenue, we're looking at, I would say, a material potential impact, so in the order of EUR3 million, EUR4 million for a quarter, which doesn't mean that we'll increase the EBIT, but it means that we'll also allow us to counterbalance the negative effect of the loss of revenue momentum. So we are even working harder on the Factory 4.0, because we see it not only in the long term something we believe -- deeply believe on there's an opportunity to enhance margin, but also as an opportunity short term to counter fight the potential negative impact on cost per minute deriving for -- from a lower-capacity utilization of our factories."
