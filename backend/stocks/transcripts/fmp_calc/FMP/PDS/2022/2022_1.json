    "content": " Leading-edge rates, excluding Alpha for our ST-1500 rigs equipped to drill long reach horizontal wells have trended into the low US$30,000 per day range, and customers have been willing to sign term contracts at these higher rates to secure access to the rigs over the course of the next 6 to 12 months and in some cases, longer. While we see some rigs -- did see some rigs relocate from the BC side to Alberta due to the Blueberry First Nations ruling, we have indications from our customers that BC could see rig activity rebound later this year, and it's next to putting further demand on the Super Triples. Over the last dozen years in Canada, Precision has invested in 28 Super Triple rigs, 25 Super Singles rigs and our $40 million Nisku technology center with a fully functioning advanced technology training rig. But quite surprisingly, one of the contracts we've signed recently includes customer paying for mobilization of a rig from -- Carey, remind me, the rigs coming out of... And you couple that move cost with the day rates that we're able to achieve right now, and that's a pretty meaningful move back to the Marcellus. Wouldn't it be -- given the stock has gone up 10x or 12x from the low of two years ago, wouldn't it make sense to raise some equity here 2 million to 3 million shares, gets sort of a pristine strong balance sheet and then have the ability to talk to the customers saying, look, you want us to build your rig, you got to pay us and they'll see that they can't beat you up because you have such a strong balance sheet."
