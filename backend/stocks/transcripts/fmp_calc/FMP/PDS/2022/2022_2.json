    "content": " With repricing of the spot market rigs, impact of Alpha Technologies, and improved fixed cost absorption, we expect normalized margins to increase by approximately $2,000 to $2,500 per day in Q3, resulting in average margins in the mid-$9,000s per day for the quarter and moving through $10,000 per day into the fourth quarter. Currently, we're fully booked for a fleet of 28 Super Triples, but we see customer demand exceeding the available rates by several rigs for the first quarter of next year. So, there's a bit more operating expense as we reactivate rigs in the U.S. Kevin, on the paid Alpha days, I was surprised to see they're only at 4% year-over-year. Looking at our fleet for just a moment, we have beyond our current fleet of super triples the U.S. we have another 12 to 15 high spec DC ser rigs that have AC tough drives, and the conversion cost to bring those rigs into kind of full super spec, we think about in the range of CAD12 million to CAD14 million per rig, substantially less than a new build."
