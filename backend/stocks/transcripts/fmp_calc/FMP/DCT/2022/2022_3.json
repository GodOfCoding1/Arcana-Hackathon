    "content": " During the quarter, we signed multiple wins with new and existing customers who recognize that leveraging Duck Creek's industry-leading SaaS core systems can deliver significant operational improvements that create substantial business value. During the quarter, Duck Creek also signed our first large Canadian distribution management deal with SGI, a $2 billion multiline P&C carrier across 5 Canadian provinces and who also provides government-mandated auto coverage in Saskatchewan. In terms of subscription revenue, our updated guidance reflects the following, the cumulative impacts of the year-to-date bookings performance and approximately $500,000 decline in revenue sequentially related to the contract adjustment Mike discussed, an assumption that we've recognized little revenue from in-quarter bookings. I think what happens is when there's a sudden change in the economic environment, carriers go through a short-term set of decision-making to really look at how are they going to deal with a short-term swing in profitability, which we've seen this past year, even though written premiums grew 9%, their overall loss cost grew about 12%."
