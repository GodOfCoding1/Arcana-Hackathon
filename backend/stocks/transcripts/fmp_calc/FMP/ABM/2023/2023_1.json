    "content": " In all, ABM generated first quarter revenue of $2 billion with an adjusted EBITDA margin of 6.4%, which remained well above pre-pandemic levels, reflecting improved operational efficiency that we believe can be enhanced over time through our ELEVATE initiatives. Total ATS backlog has grown significantly to nearly $450 million supporting our outlook for strong full-year revenue growth, escalating in the back half of the year. Aviation revenue increased 6% to $212.3 million, marking the seventh consecutive quarter of robust year-over-year revenue growth. Please proceed with your question. Please proceed with your question. And that's why we feel so confident in the back half of the year because I'll remind you, and I think you know this, but when we say $450 million in backlog, those are signed contracts. We talked a little bit about -- in the prepared remarks about semiconductors, and we just got a really large contract in the semiconductor space that's a multimillion dollar contract that we think could quadruple over the next few years. Please proceed with your question. Please proceed with your question. Please proceed with your question."
