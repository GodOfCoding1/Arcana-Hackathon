    "content": " In fact, operating profit improved $4.6 million, and margin increased over 200 basis points as we manage labor costs related to the ramp up of in-person learning. First quarter revenue increased 29.7% or $1.9 billion, primarily driven by a full quarter contribution from the Able acquisition, a continued recovery from the pandemic, most notably in Aviation, and solid demand for our janitorial and engineering services. 15:13 With the addition of Able, corporate expenses were $23.2 million higher compared to the prior-period, due to investment in our Elevate initiative, Able integration expenses and costs related to hiring activities, which more than offset the benefit from self-insurance adjustment related to prior years. B&I increased 49.2% year-over-year to over $1 billion, driven primarily by a full quarter of contribution from Able, increased year-over-year office occupancy and growth in special event. Operating profit in B&I increased 14.6% to $83.3 million, driven by higher revenue. 16:16 Aviation revenue increased 42% to $200.3 million, marking the third consecutive quarter of robust year-over-year revenue growth. Aviation operating profit increased to $8.9 million compared to $3.1 million in last year's first quarter, driven by the significant rebound in revenue, as well as our efforts to emphasize higher margin airport facility services. Excluding the gain, operating profit improved 53% to $9.2 million, and operating margin increased 120 basis points to 6.5% as we benefited from operating leverage on higher revenue.
