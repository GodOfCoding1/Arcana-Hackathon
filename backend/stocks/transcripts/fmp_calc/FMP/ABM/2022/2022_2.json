    "content": " Aviation operating profit increased 69% to $9.6 million versus $5.7 million in last year\u2019s second quarter, driven by the significant increase in revenue as well as growth in our higher-margin airport facility services business. Operating profit was $11.7 million, down from $13.8 million in last year\u2019s second quarter due to lower revenue as well as higher wage costs, especially in the southern regions of the U.S. Operating margin remained elevated from pre-pandemic levels and finished at 5.7%."
