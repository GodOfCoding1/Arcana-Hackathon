    "content": " With our projected 2022 free cash flow yield of approximately 22% at the midpoint in today\u2019s market cap, we are enhancing our balance sheet with our net debt to EBITDAX expected to be less than one by mid-year 2022 and net debt approaching $4 billion by year-end 2022. Just had one quick one that I wanted to touch on from the service side of things really briefly with how material costs labor inflation have trended higher, which we are all aware of, just wanted to get a better sense for what Continental has in place from a contractual perspective and over what duration to kind of help mitigate any near-term move towards spot rates on rigs and crews that we\u2019re seeing today as we kind of move into the back half of 2022 and 2023."
