    "content": "  Before I turn the call over, I need to advise that certain statements made during this call today may contain forward-looking information and actual results could differ from the conclusions or projections in that forward-looking information, which include but are not limited to statements with respect to the estimation of mineral reserves and resources, the timing and amount of estimated future production, cost of production, capital expenditures, future metal prices and the cost and timing of the development of new projects. Silver production of over 2.2 million ounces was in line with plan, with production expected to sequentially increase in the fourth quarter due to mining sequencing at El Pe\u00c3\u00b1\u00c3\u00b3n, we delivered strong GEO production of over 241,000 ounces despite the gold-to-silver ratio being near an all-time high and significantly above budget. While underlying costs for metals sold in the third quarter were within plan, the higher gold-to-silver ratio, as compared to metals prices assumed in the guidance, increased unitary costs per GEO sold by over $27 per ounce as compared to plan."
