    "content": " We are very excited about the generational mine life potential at Odyssey and the project represents one important step towards realizing the Board approve Yamana 1.5 Plan as it will establish a large sustainable annual gold production platform between 500,000 and 600,000 ounces on a 100% basis, with a strategic mine life well into the 2040s. We delivered strong cash flows again in the quarter, with cash flows from operating activities before net change in working capital at $195.9 million, up nearly 17% from the same period last year, while cash flows after working capital were $187.8 million during the quarter compared with $153.5 million last year Q2. We also generated free cash flow before dividends and debt repayments of $53 million during the quarter or up about $2 million from last year despite about $30 million of higher capital spending a planned, primarily from the advancement of the Odyssey project. And again, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m repeating things that we discussed on the call a few weeks ago, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not just that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve become a bigger company and amongst the super elites in our industry, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also that we have longer mine life, better free cash flow generation, better growth, although managed growth, as Daniel earlier said, this is growth that comes at very low capital cost. And Peter, I am hoping you can help me to \u00e2\u0080\u0093 help us qualify the shareholder engagement, as it pertains to the 75% thresholds for Gold Fields \u00e2\u0080\u0093 which in some circles are seen as a high hurdle rate, is the goal, when it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all said and done to reach a substantial portion of the shareholder base at the end of the day."
