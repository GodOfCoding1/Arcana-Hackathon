    "content": "  Before I turn the call over, I need to advise that certain statements made during this call today may contain forward-looking information, and actual results could differ from the conclusions or projections in that forward-looking information, which include, but are not limited to, statements with respect to the estimation of mineral reserves and resources, the timing and amount of estimated future production, cost of production, capital expenditures, future metal prices and the cost and timing of the development of new projects. As guided, the previous quarter is expect -- the first quarter is expected to be the lowest planned production quarter of the year, and we expect to see increases in production and generation of cash flows and free cash flows throughout the remainder of the year. Turning to our first quarter financial performance, our continued operational strength helped revenue reach $441.9 million, up nearly 5% from the same period last year. Cash flows from operating activities before net change in working capital came in at $197.3 million, up over 7% from last year. While we pursue the Yamana 1.5 Plan, we expect continued growth in our cash balances of $50 million to $100 million per year during the guidance period. Expansionary capital subsequent to the guidance period to achieve the additional 250,000 GEO per year to reach the Yamana 1.5 Plan is expected to be between 250 and $300 million and will be supported by our increasing production platform."
