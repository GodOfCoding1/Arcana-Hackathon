    "content": " I\u2019m going to make a few general industry comments highlight some of our first quarter achievements update on expectations for the full year 2022, and then turn it over to Robert to go through the quarterly numbers. I want to particularly highlight the recent Novo production ramp on the Willow Lake system in New Mexico and the expected growth of Percussion\u2019s volumes on the Panther Crude and produce water gathering system, which we acquired in the Oasis Midstream deal and they currently have three rigs running on that system now. In the Gathering and Processing South segment, first quarter 2022 segment EBITDA totaled $27 million that representing a 72% increase year-over-year driven once again by significant growth year-over-year on our Delaware Basin gathering systems."
