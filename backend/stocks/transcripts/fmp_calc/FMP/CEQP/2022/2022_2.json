    "content": " As a result, I just want to highlight that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve transformed Crestwood from a company that was generating adjusted EBITDA of about $527 million in 2019 with a relatively scattered asset base and limited competitive advantage in these high growth basins, and we are now at generating north of $820 million a year of adjusted EBITDA - that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an increase of over 55%, and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re generating that with an asset base that is solid and competitive in the regions where we operate with enhanced competitive positioning, much larger scale, operational synergies, and a strong customer base in our core areas of the Williston, the Delaware, and the Powder River."
