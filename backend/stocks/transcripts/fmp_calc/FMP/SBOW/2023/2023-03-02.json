    "content": " If you look at the '22 prices being very high, $6, $90 oil, but more specific to $6 in the -- 75% of our reserves being gas, it demonstrates really the underlying value of SilverBow with a value of close to 5 billion. And we'd also look at operationally, if a window -- if we see gas prices starting to get more stable late in the year, and window opening up on our frac spread that primarily serves the 2 rigs, but sometimes it's so efficient that windows present themselves. Probably as a whole, both when we were thinking 1 rig gas, 1 rig oil, our overall CapEx to go to 2 is the same, but our percentage of what we spend on facilities and land always runs in that 10% to 12% range regardless if it's 2 rigs oil, 2 rigs gas or a split. So as we stay with that 1 rig -- let's assume '24 is 1 gas, 1 oil, we'll probably stay in and around that 45 to 55 split year-over-year."
