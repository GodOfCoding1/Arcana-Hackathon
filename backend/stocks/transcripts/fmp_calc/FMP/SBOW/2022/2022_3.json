    "content": " Our capital budget next year is expected to range between $450 million to $550 million, with the higher end reflecting the potential third rig added in our Karnes trough area in the second half of next year. Yes, Neal, during the first half of '23, we'll plan to allocate half of the capital to Webb County and half of the capital to our oil locations, areas which include central oil and the Karnes trough area, so 50% to each area with one rig operating in each area. During the second half of '23, as we move to three rigs, we see 2/3 of the capital will be allocated to liquids oil properties, both across our central oil area in the Karnes trough area and 1/3 of the capital allocation going to Webb County gas. So as we look into '24 and what's implicit in the guide up in production, first is the activity in the fourth quarter and specifically, the increase of our working interest in our Fasken properties that resulted in 4.5 net wells, that essentially really drives an early production growth for us going into the first quarter of next year. So it's really in and around the end of the first quarter, early part of second quarter, that we'll probably be looking at making a decision going forward with the third rig. But I'm wondering if kind of going forward, if there are other dynamics where you see other opportunities like this, whether it's with the same non-operator, maybe not, being in a position to -- doesn't have the cash available right now or other different non-operators around where you can -- like just sort of the pricing environment or whether these are other companies that are global and are worried about other recession things or something and conserving cash. And then for this winter and kind of how you've directed the two rigs to focus on gas and with timing of fracking and bringing them online and stuff, it seems like this is all around -- it's partly about the quality of the actual asset and those returns you can get just, in some way, sort of in the abstract."
