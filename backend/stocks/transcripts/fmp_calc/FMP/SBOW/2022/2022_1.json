    "content": " The other 2 Austin Chalk wells were part of a 8-well La Mesa pad we drilled in the quarter, which is the largest pad drilled in our company's history and represents a shift towards full-scale development of our Austin Chalk assets. Due to minimal D&C activity in the fourth quarter of last year and the size and timing of the 8-well pad we developed over the first quarter of '22, monthly production in the second quarter should decline sequentially before hitting a strong production ramp in June as first production from our La Mesa pad is brought online. As you're aware, wells down in this area, both -- through all zones, Lower, Upper Eagle Ford, and Austin Chalk have IPs ranging from anywhere in the 12 million to 18 million a day range."
