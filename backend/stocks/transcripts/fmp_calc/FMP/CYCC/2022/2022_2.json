    "content": " Fadra, our lead product candidate is an orally available CDK2 and CDK9 inhibitor, enrolling patients in Phase \u00c2\u00bd study for the treatment of solid tumors and lymphomas designated 065-101 065. Relative to other development stage CDK inhibitors, we believe that oral fadra has the potential for best-in-class thus far, based on dual targeting of CDK2 and CDK9, very good tolerability and higher dose levels, a daily dosing schedule and preliminary anti-cancer activity in patients with lymphomas, endometrial, and pancreatic cancers. As previously mentioned, we plan to hold an R&D day in the fall, at which we intend to provide a comprehensive update on both the oral fadra and oral CYC140 clinical programs in patients who have received multiple treatment cycles and higher doses as well as the preclinical work that has been done by Cyclacel and our collaborators. R&D expenses relating to fadra were $2.6 million for the three months ended June 30, 2022 as compared to $2.8 million for the same period in 2021 due to increased clinical trial costs of $0.5 5 million associated the clinical trials evaluating fadra in Phase 1/2 studies, offset by reduction of $0.7 million in non-clinical expenditures. Additionally, R&D expenses related to CYC140 were $1.5 million for the three months ended June 30, 2022, as compared to $1.1 million for the same period in 2021 due to clinical trial costs associated with the start of the CYC140 Phase 1/2 study."
