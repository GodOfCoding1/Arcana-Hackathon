    "content": " These statements include the company's ability to timely develop and deliver new technologies and technology upgrades and related products introduced this year, including leveraging its wireless connectivity capabilities in the climate control, home automation, security, hospitality and HVAC channels and its ground breaking line of ultra-low power and energy harvesting control products designed to address the growing demand for more sustainable solutions in electronic devices. The continued successful collaboration with existing and new customers and developing and launching new generation products, software solutions and technologies into existing and new and growing markets, which result in increased sales and market share for the company. First, over the past few years, as mentioned, we have deliberately been shifting development spend on new products and technologies from our market challenged core video service provider channel to higher growth channels in the connected home space, where over the past years, we have seen growth. As a result of these actions and the fact that our business has evolved over time becoming less dependent on the video services channel, while experiencing strong growth in new channels, including climate control, security and home automation, we currently have more production capacity than needed."
