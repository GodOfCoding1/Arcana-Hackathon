    "content": " These statements include the Company's ability to timely develop and deliver new technologies and technology upgrades and related products introduced this year, including leveraging our wireless connectivity capabilities to the smart home automation, security and hospitality and our groundbreaking line of ultra-low power and energy harvesting remote controls designed for sustainability that will be accepted by our existing customers and attract new customers. We've been so burned over the last few years, not just us, but every company in the world by unpredicted things that have happened between COVID and the chip supply, the economy, the gas prices, et cetera, that it's just difficult to know where things will be six months from now or 12 months from now. It's probably the highest growth market, particularly HVAC that we serve, double-digit growth as a market and our market share is not as high as it has been in home entertainment, which provides a real opportunity for us because as we bring innovative solutions to that market, helped those customers deal with IP connectivity within their units, bring the intelligence to the product as well as potentially connect it to other systems within the home, which we're specialists in. So while we're seeing a shift in behavior, it's probably not as dramatic as everybody may think in terms of the speed at which it's happening, but it definitely would -- does affect things under the line, meaning in the detail, there are some customers whose volumes over time have eroded and other customers who have risen. That's the real challenge right now is trying to predict because with our products, typically, we don't have it as bad as the example you'll see in the press is the automotive companies because they're the most effective."
