    "content": " During the 6-month period ended June 30, 2022, we reported revenue of approximately $4.9 million compared to approximately $5.9 million during the same period last year. For the three months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, revenue derived from specimens related to COVID-19 accounted for approximately $170,000 and $896,000, or 7%  and 31%, respectively, of our total revenue. For the three months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, revenue derived from non-COVID-19-related specimens accounted for approximately $2.2 million and $2 million or 93% and 69%, respectively, of our total revenue, an 8% increase in non-COVID'19 revenue compared to the same prior year period. However, there was a change in specimen mix that resulted in a decrease in the average selling price per specimen of approximately $130 or 28% compared to the same prior year's period. For the six months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, our revenue derived from specimens related to COVID-19 accounted for approximately $649,000 and $1.6 million or 13% and 27%, respectively, of our total revenue. However, a change in specimen mix resulted in a decrease in average selling price per assessment of approximately $132 or 26% compared to the same prior year's period. Cost of revenue for the 6-month period ended June 30, 2022, was approximately $2.2 million compared to approximately $3.1 million for the same period in 2021, a decrease of 30%. The second quarter 2022 decrease was attributable to a 40% decline in the average cost per specimen impacted by specimen mix, offset somewhat by a 12% increase in the number of specimens accessioned for the current period compared to the same prior year's period. The 6-month period ended June 30, 2022, decrease was attributable to a 44% decline in the average cost per specimen impacted by the specimen mix, offset somewhat by a 5% increase in the number of specimens accessioned during the six months ended June 30, 2022, over the same prior year's period. For the second quarter of 2022, we increased our cash spend for technology to approximately $807,000 from $351,000 for the same prior year's period. For the 6-month period ended June 30, 2022, we increased our cash spend per technology to approximately $1.4 million from $740,000 for the same prior year's period. Increase in spend for the 3-month and 6-month periods ended June 30, 2022, compared to the same prior year period is directly related to our commitment to investment in our technology as evidenced by our recent launch of our enhanced iSpecimen marketplace platform. For the 6-month period ended June 30, 2022, this cash outlay was comprised of approximately $777,000 of capitalized internally developed software and approximately $630,000 of technology expenses that we were not able to capitalize and, therefore, were classified as technology expense. The remainder of the technology expense for the 6-month period ended June 30, 2022, was comprised of approximately $533,000 of noncash amortization related to internally developed software. Total technology expense for the 6-month period ended June 30, 2022, was approximately $1.2 million compared to $772,000 for the same prior year period. For the 6-month period ended June 30, 2022, sales and marketing expenses were approximately $1.7 million compared to approximately $1.2 million during the same prior year's period. For the 6-month period ended June 30, 2022, general and administrative expenses were approximately $3.4 million compared to approximately $2.5 million during the same prior year period."
