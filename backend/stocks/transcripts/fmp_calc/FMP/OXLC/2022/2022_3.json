    "content": " For the quarter ended December, we recorded GAAP total investment income of approximately $57.3 million, representing an increase of approximately $12.1 million from the prior quarter. The quarter's GAAP total investment income from our portfolio consisted of $55 million from our CLO equity and CLO warehouse investments, and $2.3 million from our CLO debt investments and from other income. During the quarter ended December, we ended -- we issued a total of approximately 12.8 million shares of our common stock pursuant to an at-the-market offering, resulting in net proceeds of approximately $98.5 million. During the quarter ended December 31, we made additional CLO investments of approximately $310.7 million, and we received approximately $206.8 million from sales and repayments. Oxford Lane was able to take advantage of the strength in the primary market this quarter, making 8 new issued CLO equity investments, refinancing 5 deals to obtain cheaper cost of debt financing and resetting 2 deals. As a function of our overall activity in both markets this quarter, we were able to lengthen the weighted average reinvestment period of Oxford Lane's CLO equity portfolio from March of 2024 to December of 2024."
