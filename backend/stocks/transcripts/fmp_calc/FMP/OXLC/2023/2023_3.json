    "content": " For the quarter ended December 31, we recorded net realized losses of approximately $1.5 million in net unrealized depreciation on investments of approximately $54.7 million or $0.35 per share in total. During the quarter ended December 31, we issued a total of approximately 7.2 million shares of our common stock pursuant to an at-the-market offering, resulting in net proceeds of approximately $37.2 million. During the quarter ended December 31, we made additional CLO investments of approximately $82.8 million, and we received approximately $49.5 million from sales and repayments. It's essentially market prices, Mickey, supply and demand characteristics for the CLO equity tranches that we hold as of December 31, which during some periods may or may not, as you say, be particularly well correlated to the pricing of the various collateral pools that reside within those CLO structures. Additionally, just given this environment with a healthy discount in the leveraged loan market, CLO managers are able to build par just by going out and purchasing loans at 95%, 96%, 97%, and that's a good way to just build par and build those OC ratios. So I mean, Matt, our view is that to the extent that those loans or significant numbers of those loans begin to see their way into U.S. CLO collateral pools, they're going to enter those collateral pools at prices that reflect the current risk reward of both that particular loan, that corporate obligors, risk return characteristics as well as the current state of the market."
