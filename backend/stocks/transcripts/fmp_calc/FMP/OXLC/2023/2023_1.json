    "content": " During the quarter ended June 30, we issued a total of approximately 4.6 million shares of our common stock pursuant to an at-the-market offering, resulting in net proceeds of approximately $30.9 million. During the quarter ended June 30, we made additional CLO investments of approximately $237.8 million, and we received approximately $119.3 million from sales and repayments. Additionally, the distress ratio, defined as the percentage of loans with a price below 80% of par, ended the quarter at approximately 3.65% compared to 1.55% at the end of March 2022. Oxford Lane continued to be active in the secondary market during the quarter, trading over $200 million notional of CLO equity and junior debt. Matt, one thing I would just add is, if you look at over the last 2, 3 months, CLO managers have definitely been able to take any sort of prepayment and also make kind of relative trading assessment and build hundreds -- many basis points of par kind of month-over-month and quarter-over-quarter because of the depressed loan market."
