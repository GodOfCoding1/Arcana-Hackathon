    "content": " Over the last year, we've invested in new and existing talent, technology and office space, including the onboarding of the EMsights Capital Group and the launch of the team's three new investment strategies, as well as two additional strategies and existing teams. With respect to distribution, it's really been around -- the majority of it's been around new investment teams and strategies, the new team and strategies that we've onboarded this year, as well as sort of accelerating sales in the intermediary space with some dedicated internal resources to target prospective clients, as well as on the digital enablement side. And given the amount of capacity and the number of strategies we've invested in, we're going to focus our investment operation time on those strategies and be highly selective on new teams that we're looking at right now."
