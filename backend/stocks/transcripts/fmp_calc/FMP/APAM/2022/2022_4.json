    "content": " Of our $9.8 billion of net outflows, more than $5 billion occurred in the fourth quarter, we experienced net outflows across majority of strategies and investment teams. Investment returns contributed $12.8 billion to the increase in AUM in the quarter, partially offset by $5.2 billion of net client cash outflows and $300 million of annual Artisan Funds distributions that were not reinvested. And as a reminder, our compensation and benefits expenses are generally higher in the first quarter of each year due to seasonal expenses, which we estimate will be approximately $5 million higher in the first quarter of 2023 compared to the fourth quarter of 2022."
