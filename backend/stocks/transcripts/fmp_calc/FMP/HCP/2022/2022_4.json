    "content": " We're very proud to have some of the largest enterprises running their most critical applications on our products and view the IPO as the next step to support these customers with continued investments in our products and in our ongoing vision for enabling their move to cloud or multi-cloud, providing them cost-savings, risk mitigation, and revenue generation opportunities. To frame the progress we've made with the penetration of our core products with Terraform, Vault and Consul, the absolute number of a $100,000 or greater annual recurring revenue customers that have purchased multiple products, increased 42% year-over-year. We focus on: one, our revenue growth rate; two, the growth in the number of total customers we serve; three, the growth in the number of total customers that represent greater or equal to 100,000 in ARR, as well as their aggregate contribution to revenue; four, the revenue we derived from customers on the HashiCorp cloud platform; five, Our trailing 12-month free cash flow margins, and 6. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. I think the important part to note about HCP is that we continue to see broad-based strong demand signals and also it's a new line of revenue for us and it's opening up this new segment of customers below the G2K, the emerging enterprises. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. So they're already being used by the practitioners, but the conversion to a customer is when the organization makes that decision to say a lot of second, let's think about how we're going to do Cloud in a way that is not a responsible, that's really point number one. Your line is open."
