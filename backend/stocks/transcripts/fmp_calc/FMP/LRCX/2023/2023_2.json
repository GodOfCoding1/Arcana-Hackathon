    "content": " As seen in our results today, these investments have enabled Lam to achieve revenues of greater than $5 billion per quarter, approximately 70% higher than what we saw in the last up-cycle. Given the decreased business levels expected this year, we have made the difficult decision to reduce our overall workforce by approximately 1,300 employees by the end of the March quarter, about 7% of our global employee base. The customer support business group results in the quarter were approximately $1.7 billion, which was down 9% from the September quarter, though it was 16% higher than the December quarter of calendar 2021. I mean I think right now, if you look \u00e2\u0080\u0093 at least by our estimate and listening to what our customers say, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re at very low levels of supply growth this year as a result of the lack of additions and utilization cuts, so I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think you could quite get to the scenario you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re talking about where you just bring utilization \u00e2\u0080\u0093 unutilized tools back online. On the clarification, last quarter, I think you guys sized the potential impact from China export restrictions to your business in calendar \u00e2\u0080\u009823 at $2 billion to $2.5 billion, I believe three quarters on the systems side, a quarter in services. If I take the March ex deferred $3.3 billion, right, and kind of assume quarterly run rate is at level, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sort of how the shape of calendar \u00e2\u0080\u009823 revenue should be, right?"
