    "content": " I think it\u2019s important to point out that we had 59% growth in earnings per share over calendar year 2020, which outpaced the growth in revenue, which was at 39%. But I would say that some of the things that have changed when we talk about the slight worsening that we\u2019re seeing right now is also that in many cases, whether it\u2019s Lam\u2019s inventory or suppliers\u2019 inventory they have been drawn down by these very high output levels to the point where our vulnerability to a miss that might only be just a few days, but at the output rate of our factories. Thank you very much. I think at our Analyst Day, we kind of put out a model to say, look, our objective every year is to go in saying that we will outgrow \u2013 the revenue will outgrow the growth of the installed base, which means fundamentally, you\u2019re moving forward the revenue capture per chamber. Thank you very much. And so, I think that when you ask the question, what is it that prepares us for the industry to add another $500 billion in Lam to meet that output, it\u2019s the ability to tap into this global supply chain, which gives us access to larger talent pools, larger supplier bases for many of our parts. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you very much."
