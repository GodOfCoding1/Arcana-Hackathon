    "content": " In the first quarter, gross written premiums increased 65% as compared to the first quarter of 2021, driven by continued strength in residential and commercial earthquake as well as in our E&S business, Palomar Excess and Surplus Insurance Company. Beyond earthquake, other product lines performing well in the first quarter include in the Marine which grew premiums 133% year-over-year and is now our fourth largest line. Shifting to our E&S business, Palomar Access and Surplus Insurance Company had another strong quarter generating $41 million of gross written premium representing 71% written premium growth year-over-year. For the first quarter of 2022, our net income was $14.5 million or $0.56 per share compared to net income of $16.6 million or $0.63 per share, for the same quarter in 2021. Gross written premiums for the first quarter were $170.9 million, an increase of 65% compared to the prior year's first quarter. Ceded written premiums for the first quarter, were $89.6 million representing, an increase of 106.5% compared to the prior year's first quarter. For the first quarter of 2022, net earned premiums as a percentage of gross earned premiums were 54.7% compared to 51.5% in the first quarter of 2021 and compared sequentially to 55.2% in the fourth quarter of 2021. Losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred for the first quarter, were $15 million due to attritional losses of $14.5 million and unfavorable prior year catastrophe loss development of $0.5 million. On an adjusted basis, our expense ratio was 52.4% for the quarter compared to 62.7% in the first quarter of 2021 and compared to 55.7% sequentially, in the fourth quarter of 2021. Our acquisition expense as a percentage of gross earned premiums for the first quarter of 2022, was 20.2% compared to 21.2% in the first quarter of 2021 and compared to 22.2% sequentially in the fourth quarter of 2020. The ratio of other underwriting expenses including adjustments to gross earned premiums for the first quarter of 2022, was 9% an improvement compared to 11.9% in the first quarter of 2021 and compared to 9.2% sequentially in the fourth quarter 2021. Our adjusted combined ratio was 72.1% for the first quarter, compared to 53.3% in the first quarter of 2021, which included the unsustainable negative loss ratio in the first quarter of 2021 from Uri. Net investment income for the first quarter was $2.6 million, an increase of 16.2% compared to the prior year's first quarter. For the first quarter, we recognized losses on investments in the consolidated statement of income of $1.3 million, compared to losses of $739,000 in the prior year's first quarter. Before 2022, we reiterate our previously provided adjusted net income guidance range of $80 million to $85 million, representing 54% year-over-year growth and adjusted ROE of 19% at the midpoint of the range. But as I mentioned on the call, we went from an average rate increase of 5% in the fourth quarter to 7% plus in the first quarter and that was a reversal of I guess, probably three, four quarters of decelerating rate increases."
