    "content": " Despite a complex macro environment, we were in the range of our guidance, delivering a total revenue of $69.3 million, non-GAAP gross profit of $36.2 million and EBITDA loss of $1.3 million and positive operating cash flow of $19.5 million. Our second quarter revenue was $69.3 million, down 44% year over last year and in line with our guidance of $68 million to $76 million. Q2 non-GAAP operating expenses were $39.6 million, down $7.6 million from the prior year and down $1.6 million sequentially. Our adjusted EBITDA loss for the second quarter was $1.3 million, in line with our guidance range of a loss of $2 million to a positive adjusted EBITDA of $2 million. Versus prior year, our adjusted EBITDA was down $5 million, driven by a reduction in revenue and gross profits, as outlined before, offset by a reduction in our operating expenses. We had an operating cash flow of $19.5 million in the quarter, ahead of our guidance of $7 million to $12 million, primarily due to positive working capital changes. For the third quarter of 2022, we expect revenue to be in the range of $70 million to $80 million, non-GAAP gross profit to be in the range of $37 million to $42 million, adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $5 million to $10 million and operating cash flows to be in the range of negative $5 million to breakeven. For the full year 2022, we are revising our guidance for the revenue to be in the range of $295 million to $310 million; non-GAAP gross profits to be in the range of $147 million to $160 million; adjusted EBITDA in the range of $15 million to $20 million; and operating cash flow in the range of $0 million to $5 million."
