In fact, we expect that this year's capital investments will be less than 40% of our own hedge to EBITDA, and we've generated nearly a $1 in free cash flow through the end of the third quarter. Your line is open. We'll have most of this either approved or at least submitted before the end of the year and I think as you get these caps approved and should be clear that, the box seller cap gets approved this week, let's say we still have OGPs on the back end of this, that should be administrative because we've gone through the preliminary siding. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open."
