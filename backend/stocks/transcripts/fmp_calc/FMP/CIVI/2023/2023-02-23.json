So looking at \u00e2\u0080\u009822 dividends of a little over $500 million going to $600 million this year and $1 billion of free cash this year, roll that forward into 2024, in addition to the cash balance that we currently have and we think, hey, this could be a really good opportunity and a really compelling investment to buyback additional shares. Your line is open. And I would say that a lot of that is being driven by up spacing and optimizing returns, focused on the right things, not necessarily how many sticks we can drill a year, but how do we maximize those returns for the company and maximize free cash flow. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open."
