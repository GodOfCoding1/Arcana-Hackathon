    "content": " Net revenues from smart devices reached RMB 239.9 million for the second quarter, up 16.3% year-over-year. Net revenue from learning services was RMB 564 million, down 7% year over year, mainly due to macro headwinds and different seasonality after double reduction. Net revenues from online marketing services reached RMB 152.8 million, up 25.9% quarter-over-quarter, despite headwinds from pandemic. Net revenue from our smart devices were RMB 239.9 million or USD 35.8 million, up 16.3% from the same period in 2021, driven by the popularity of the newly launched products since last year. So we think that's just like I mentioned in our STEAM products, we think that's also 1 of our advantage always in the long run and we think we can provide more specific services to the each individuals and to help them to analyse about what they need and what demand and what -- how to help them to enhance their epidemic levels in the base services. And finally, we think the English courses are likely to be further rebound in the second half, subject to the pandemic and other macroeconomic conditions, and as I discussed in the prepared remarks, we saw the recovery in demand for the English courses raising over 30% quarter-over-quarter in Q2."
