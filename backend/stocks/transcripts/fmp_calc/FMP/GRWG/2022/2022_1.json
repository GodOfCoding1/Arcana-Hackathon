    "content": " Sales in non-retail businesses, including the acquisition and integration of HRG and MMI, increased from $2.8 million in the same period 2021 to $12.2 million in the first quarter of 2022. Our same-store sales for the first quarter was $47.7 million compared to prior year sales of $74 million, representing a 35% decline against a comparable year ago quarter. However, the addition of HRG and MMI for the quarter resulted in an overall increase in operating expenses, which totaled $14.5 million compared to $8.2 million in the first quarter of 2021. Adjusted EBITDA, which excludes the expenses associated with interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and share-based compensation, was a loss of $700,000 for the first quarter of 2022 compared to income of $11.1 million in the first quarter of 2021. However, cash flow from operations in the first quarter was burdened by an inventory bill for HRG of $5 million and the overall result was a usage of cash in the quarter of $2.3 million. So, to break down your question and in order to be clear, there -- the M&A that we've already done this calendar year, the acquisition of HRG, which is a distribution business, as well as the acquisition at the end of calendar year 2021, which is the business that we acquired in New York, the MMI business that makes benches, those businesses are incorporated into our guidance for 2022. We anticipate that 10 to 15 retail stores will add round about $5 million to $10 million, call $10 million plus or minus revenue for the calendar year, depending on the openings, but that's the way we look at it today."
