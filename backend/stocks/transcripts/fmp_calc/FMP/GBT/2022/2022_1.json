    "content": " The first quarter was a notable start to the year for GBT, highlighted by strong sequential growth in new prescriptions of Oxbryta, including a promising start to our launch in patient ages 4 to 11. Gross to net was 16.3% for the quarter, around 0.5% increase from the fourth quarter, primarily related to increased patient co-pay support as commercial insurance out-of-pocket deductibles reset for patients for the new year as well as higher 340B and Medicaid accruals in the quarter. This reflects slightly lower pediatric new prescriptions following the strong start with patients that have been waiting for Oxbryta, offset by continued incremental improvement in the 12 and older group. In the first quarter, this was aided by several new tactics, including updating the campaign to reflect the pediatric approval and an improved ability to target SCD patients, which we believe contributed to a higher frequency of monthly engagement. Similarly, Oxbryta adherence, which includes compliance and persistence for patients in the first year of therapy, continued to be within the range of our prior quarter\u2019s and analogs. Please proceed with your question. Please proceed with your question. Please proceed with your question. Please proceed with your question. So obviously those patients that maybe weren't covered in the first quarter, becoming covered in Q2 will help us on that aspect of it but we also do anticipate growth overall in new prescriptions, somewhat incremental growth, but we do also expect some growth on the 12 and above as well.
