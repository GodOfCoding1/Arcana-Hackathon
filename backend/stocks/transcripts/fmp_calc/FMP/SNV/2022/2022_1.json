    "content": " Balance sheet asset sensitivity benefited from the continued growth in our floating rate loan portfolios, which increased to 59% of our total loan portfolio at quarter end, a 7% increase year-over-year. And as we sit here today at an 83% loan-to-deposit ratio, we\u2019ll continue to strategically remix where it makes sense where we can bring in to lower costs sticky deposits, we\u2019ve increased the percentage of total deposits being non-interest bearing up to 34% this past quarter. So looking at the rest of the year, I think you would see that 3% to 5% deposit growth, it would obviously be far less than what we\u2019ve seen in previous years, as it relates to revenue growth for the rest of the year. As you saw a 300 basis point increase in utilization this quarter to 46%, so that created about $500 million of growth, but I think it\u2019s important to dissect that $500 million. Now, we haven\u2019t included that in our 6% to 8% loan growth projections, but we think that there\u2019s a likelihood that we could see continued line utilization increases."
