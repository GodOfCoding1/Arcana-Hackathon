    "content": " As seen on slide 11, the common equity Tier 1 ratio increased to 9.63%, reflecting our commitment to retain our strong organic earnings to support core client loan growth while also maintaining strong capital levels. On the fee income side, we expect mid-single-digit growth driven by continued expansion in core client fee income, impacting fee income, our checking account enhancements plan to be implemented in the first-half of the year that is estimated to negatively impact annual service charge revenues by approximately $5 million to $10 million. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. Yes, it's a very important question as we look forward to 2023, and just want to be really clear that as we think about our balance sheet growth in 2023, achieving the high end of our loan growth range requires stronger core deposit growth. And so, those do go hand in hand, but the environment is pretty uncertain, and it's too uncertain to precisely estimate, full-year deposit, core deposit growth, but we do expect to continue to see the strong production, we've seen the past couple of quarters. Your line is now open. Your line is now open."
