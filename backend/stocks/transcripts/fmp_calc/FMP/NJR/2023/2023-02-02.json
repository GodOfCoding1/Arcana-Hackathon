    "content": " Last year, we invested more than $53 million in New Jersey Natural Gas' energy efficiency programs, the highest single year investment of this type in our company's history. New Jersey Natural Gas saw an improvement of $3.6 million, primarily due to the impact of new base rates that went into effect on December 1, 2021, a higher contribution to utility gross margin from our BGSS incentive programs and new customer growth. I know you hit this a little bit already, but if you just want to unpack the guidance raise a little bit more, the $0.20 raise, is that -- is it the full amount of the outperformance you saw, I guess, across NJNG, Storage & Transportation and Energy Services or are there any either offsets to that versus your original plan or kind of cushion for the remainder of the year that you're leaving outside of guidance right now? So at the gas utility, despite the stronger customer growth and higher earnings year-over-year for the first quarter, it looks like you lowered guidance for the segment on an actual EPS basis despite the $0.20 raise for the year for the entire company. Well, I just took the $2.42 to $2.52 original and then did that by 55% and also by 60%, took those numbers and then took the revised $2.62 to $2.72 and did that by the 48% and then separately by the 53% and then compared the bottom of each the -- top of each, and that's where I came up with a $0.06 to $0.08 lower."
