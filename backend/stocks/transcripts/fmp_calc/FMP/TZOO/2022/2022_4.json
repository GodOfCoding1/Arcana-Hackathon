So in general, as you see in Q4 and now again in Q1, it's become easier for us to negotiate offers for our members that of course, resulting in more activity by our members and also advertisers are back much stronger than last year because there's more confidence in travel and while we have high inflation everywhere and possibly recessions coming. For us, I think 2023 will be a year where we'll be doing better than 2022 just because there is more opportunity for us to do what we are best at, which is negotiating and finding offers for our members that inspire them to travel and helping travel suppliers to really fill those dates when they are not busy and the destinations where that maybe -- there may be less known or destinations where they are less busy indoor seasons. Over the last couple of years, there's been significant changes in the way both the company has operated in terms of the changing of the Asia Pacific business, then weathering the pandemic while I think there are a couple of headwinds left maybe in terms of the higher inflation still and maybe the unfavorable currency exchange at this point."
