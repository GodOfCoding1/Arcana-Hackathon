    "content": " As we look ahead, we have four key priorities for 2023 to rebuild our core business, expand the market footprint for TrueCar+, lean into the used vehicle market and focus our marketing on converting our healthy top-of-funnel traffic into sales for our dealers. It is clear to us that the limited availability of new vehicles over the past few years is creating some scarcity, particularly for one to three-year-old vehicles, and we intend to step-up efforts to help our dealers source used vehicles. On the fourth point of traffic, we have continued to see sustained strength in our monthly unique visitors and are focusing on improving conversion across the traffic that we are already driving to our site to both raise consumer awareness of TrueCar+ and convert our existing healthy top-of-funnel into unit volumes for our dealers. So our teams are out in the field, reaching out to both new franchise dealers and new dealers who turned us off when inventories were low and going to the market with a portfolio of great solutions for both new and used vehicles. We operate a full marketplace that includes small, privately owned independent dealers, large public dealerships, and vertically integrated digital operators that focus on the used vehicle market, like Carvana."
