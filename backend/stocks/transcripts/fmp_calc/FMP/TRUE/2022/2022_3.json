    "content": " So I think you're -- as you've seen the way we've been managing our expense rates, our expenses are fairly predictable at this point in time with obviously the only caveat that we've increased somewhat on the tech and product side as we've also fully integrated Digital Motors. And then right now, what happens still is some of that is still driven by certain segments of our top of funnel which then pulls in certain subsets of the population that are interested in certain cars or certain brands or certain -- new or used, what are the best, because if you start slicing and dicing this very much, think of it as -- so roughly 8 consumer profiles that go very much across the different brands. And also remember, we have -- one of the things that's interesting is certified preowned which often is forgotten, because the historical business -- like historically, the industry talks new and used but certified preowned actually, in a world of online transacting, is very important because it provides the comfort for people that may be a little bit wary from a warranty perspective. There is a good moment for us and good opportunity, obviously, in the next couple of quarters to engage with the dealer networks and remind them, obviously, of the value proposition that we have and not only remind them of the value proposition of core which is obviously important for them in a more -- in a world where they have aging inventory but also most certainly that TrueCar+ exists and the online platform that, that provides. So we're going to use that opportunity to make sure that the 7.6 million that came in on an average in Q3 are being exposed to TrueCar+, they understand that it's either available in their market or it's coming soon to a market near them and we'll continue to drive that message and begin to see what sort of messages resonate with consumers."
