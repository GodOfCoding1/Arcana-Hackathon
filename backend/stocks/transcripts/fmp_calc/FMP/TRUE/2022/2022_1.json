    "content": " For us, it's about smart tuck-in opportunities with innovative technology and talented know-how and capabilities that accelerate the product road map for TrueCar+ as we look to bring world-class digital e-commerce capabilities to our dealers and consumers and bring more and more of car buying and selling experience online. So and overall, though, I also think it's worth noting, given the macro and what we've seen around us, that we have an asset-light approach with our marketplace model and our balance sheet is very, very strong, and we can support this, the step-up investments very well with the current balance sheet that we have, and we have runway for many, many years."
