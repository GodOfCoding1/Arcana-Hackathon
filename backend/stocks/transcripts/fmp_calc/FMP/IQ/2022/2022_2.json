    "content": " Despite an extremely challenging environment, we still made achievements in the following three aspects: one, our membership business continued to grow year-over-year; two, we generated non-GAAP operating profit for two consecutive quarters and achieved sequential growth in Q2; three, our cash flow improved significantly, and we achieved positive operating cash flow for the very first time. The net result is that our gross profit margin reached 21% in the second quarter and consistently expanded in the past quarters, namely, from 7% to 12% to 18% then to the 21% in the latest quarter, reflecting ongoing gains in the ROI of our content business. In summary, again, to recap quarterly results that we have presented for investors: the first is profit growth; the second is operating cash flow breakeven; the third is the raising; and the fourth one is the optimistic growth outlook based on Calm Growth strategy."
