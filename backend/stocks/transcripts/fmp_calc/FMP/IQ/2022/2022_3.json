    "content": " Through efforts in the first 3 quarters this year, iQIYI has completed an iconic turnaround, with business performance far exceeding the targets we set at the beginning of this year. There are 2 parts to this iconic turnaround: First, we have been growing the non-GAAP operating profit for 4 consecutive quarters, starting from Q4 last year. And for the first 3 quarters this year, we achieved nearly RMB 1.2 billion in non-GAAP operating profit, a sharp reversal from the operating loss of RMB 2.5 billion over the same period last year. Second, our market leadership remains unchallenged, and our market share in September actually hit historical high on the content side. According to Enlighten data, we remained #1 in terms of effective video views for our exclusive dramas, more than our competitors in the second and the third place combined. Our subscriber base has grown from 95.6 million on June 30th to 106.2 million on September 30th, representing a net addition exceeding 10 million. Among the drama, we launched in Q3, 65% were original content, a historic high. Meanwhile, the hit ratio of our original content improved significantly. As many of you know, iQIYI's popularity index is an influential indicator of content and popularity. Of the 6 blockbuster dramas with a popularity index of over 10,000 in our history, we launched 4 this year, and 2 in Q3, both are original titles. Hundreds of millions of users binge on our original content blockbusters, which drive up user base and a market share, and translate into the huge improvement in our financial results, from loss to major profitability in a single year. Behind these titles is our unique approach to content production and operation, which is our core competitive edge. As such, our iconic turnaround is very difficult for others to replicate, since it is based on our years of expertise and extensive library of original content. With original content as the key to our success, we will continue to execute our \"Calm Growth\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u009d strategy. This means seeking value growth points while ensuring overall operating efficiency, enhancing content investment and marketing spending in an appropriate manner. With this strategy, we will continue to provide users with appealing content and superior services, and further drive the healthy developments of our business Now let's go through the detailed performance of our business segments. The average daily number of total subscribers in Q3 was 101 million, a net gain of 2.7 million compared with Q2. The number of subscribers at the end of September surpassed 106 million, grew by over 10 million compared to June 30th and over 2.6 million compared to last September. We are happy to see that even after summer vacation ended, subscribers continued to grow in September for the first time in the past 4 years, and the average daily subscribers of this September also reached its highest level compared to all the past Septembers. Such success was mainly driven by premium content, indicating that users still have strong appetite in paying for excellent story telling. Our core competitive edge lies around the ability of consistently supplying high quality content, discover and produce exceptional original content. Meanwhile, we strategically emphasized on bringing more privileges to members across wider content categories, which led to improved monetization ability of our subscriber base. In Q3, the top 3 revenue contributors were all original dramas, namely: Love Between Fairy and Devil, Chasing the Undercurrent and The Heart of Genius. Our multi-season variety show, The Rap of China 2022 also adopted earlier access for subscribers, and ranked among the top 5 revenue contributors for the quarter. This was mainly driven by 3 factors: first, the temporary decline in consumer sentiment in May, June and July due to pandemic resurgence; second, the delay of certain key dramas; and third, the significant reduction of marketing spending as part of our business stress test. Starting from the second half of August, we successfully reversed the trend with a series of premium content releases including Love Between Fairy and Devil, Chasing the Undercurrent, and Thousand Years For You. This means, the strong performance of our membership business was not fully reflected in our Q3 results. The performance of our dramas was outstanding in Q3, especially for original dramas, as we had big improvement in areas such as content supply, revenue contribution, success rate, and word of mouth. I'd like to share some data: among major dramas launched in Q3, original dramas accounted for 65%, the highest in our history. Meanwhile, the success rate for original content have also increased. Two dramas broke the popularity index of 10,000 in Q3, with 2 more dramas breaking 9,000 score. This breakthrough in original content was driven by the unique and effective content methodology we established, which runs through processes from content creation and production to post-broadcasting, powered by a strong team of professionals and supported by a mature and highly efficient operating mechanism First, we focused on improving the content creation and production qualities of our in-house studios. Second, we have established a mature and highly efficient mechanism running through the whole process, enabling highly efficient decision-making, strict quality controls and optimal content scheduling. The key to this mechanism is a profound understanding of the content industry as a whole, based on over a decade of experiences in the industry. The breakthroughs in original content have improved the overall quality and influence of our content, giving us absolute advantages as the industry leader. In terms of popularity, we launched the iQIYI popularity index back in 2018, and since then, only 6 titles received a score above 10,000; and 22 titles received score above 9,000. Among the top 6 popular dramas, 4 were released this year, and 2 in Q3. Users actively discuss, rate and recommend our content on social platforms. On the third-party platform douban.com, 9 of our dramas launched in Q3 received a rating of over 7, the best quarterly performance in our history. For the 2 dramas breaking a popularity index of 10,000 in Q3, Love Between Fairy and Devil tapped into the demand of young generation audience during the summer vacation, it's creative story telling set it apart from other titles in the same genre. In addition to dramas, we maintained our output of premium content in other categories. For variety shows, the effective views of the multi-season show The Rap of China 2022 was leading the online variety show market in Q3. In addition, our original animations recorded solid growth in both the number of titles launched and revenues. Membership revenue of this original animation stayed as #2 on the animation channel during the entire summer vacation, just behind the Japanese animation One Piece. Entering into Q4, we will maintain the strong momentum of Q3 by launching a number of highly-anticipated dramas, including New Life Begins, Wild Bloom featuring top leading actress Zhao Liying, and Unchained Love featured the leading actor from our blockbuster drama Love between Fairy and Devil this summer. We continued to explore new content themes that cater to diversified user demand, such as the recently launched drama series selections targeting female audience. For brand advertising, the revenue recovered sequentially and the year-over-year decline narrowed compared with last quarter, reflecting the attractions of hit dramas and variety shows in the peak summer vacation season. Average daily number of users that activated the bullet chat feature increased year-over-year in Q3, and the daily average number of bullet chat interaction increased by 50% year-over-year. By the end of Q3, the system have been applied to 5 iQIYI original dramas. For overseas business, in Q3, we saw healthy growth in membership revenue both annually and sequentially, reflecting the popularity of our premium content and improved operating capability. Top dramas under our Sweet On Theater brand, including The Love Between Fairy and Devil and Thousand Years For You, had sound performance. In the first 3 quarters of 2022, we again demonstrated the powerful execution abilities, professionalism, and strong unity of everyone within iQIYI. As content is our core competency, we are confident that we will be able to deliver blockbusters on a continuing basis as we have worked out replicable methodologies for both original content production and operations. We believe that we have achieved an iconic turnaround in the context of an extremely challenging macro environment this year, and we will continue to deliver values both to users who love our content and stakeholders who are as confident as we are in the prospects of long-form video. In Q3, we booked RMB 7.5 billion in total revenues, up 12% sequentially. Our non-GAAP operating profit reached RMB 524 million, increased 53% sequentially. Meanwhile, we have been generating positive operating cash flow for 2 consecutive quarters, and recorded nearly 200 million operating cash flow in the third quarter. As Mr. Gong mentioned in his opening remarks, the performance of our membership business was back-loaded and the current Q3 result is not a full reflection of the strong momentum we observed. During the quarter, the number of subscribing members grew from 95.6 million as of June 30, 2022 to 106.2 million as of September 30, 2022, representing a net addition of over 10 million during the quarter. The third quarter cost of revenues was RMB 5.7 billion, representing a cost saving of RMB 1.3 billion compared with the same period last year, or down 19% annually. Content cost, a significant component of cost of revenues, decreased 18% annually, and up 12% sequentially. Our gross profit margin, which is a direct metric to reflect the ROI of our content business, consistently expanded in the past 4 quarters and reached historical high of 24% in Q3, compared with 7% in the same period last year. Meanwhile, with the continuous optimization of our business operations, our total operating expenses decreased by 470 million year over year. For Q3, non-GAAP operating profit was RMB 524 million, compared with the non-GAAP operating loss of RMB 1.1 billion for the same period last year, and it's up 53% quarter-over-quarter. At the end of the third quarter, the company had cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and short-term investments of RMB 5.0 billion, compared with RMB 4.9 billion in the previous quarter. And starting from the second half of August, we successfully reversed the trend with a series of premium content releases, including Love Between Fairy and Devil, Chasing the Undercurrent and Thousand Years For You. And also, the reasonable increase in marketing spending and recovery in consumer sentiment also contributed positively to strong and continuous growth in subscriber numbers. As a result, the performance of our membership business was back loaded and the current Q3 result is not a full reflection of the strong momentum we observed. And for our entire membership business going forward, our main goal is to grow the membership services revenue while achieving healthy performance on the subscriber numbers and ARM. One is the continuous investment in content, namely especially for the head of premium content. And since then, only 6 titles received a score above 10,000, 4 were released this year and 2 in Q3. We also have very sophisticated supporting teams across different functions to support these studios through the entire process, which runs through processes from creative ideas development, content production, broadcasting and marketing. At the script level, we rely on the professional teams and get them relative flexibility in screening the creative ideas, emphasize on polishing scripts, which build a solid foundation for the content creation process. At the production level, once we have the solid content creation foundation in place, we will follow by rigorous process before projects entering into the billing process. This mechanism enables highly efficient decision-making, strict quality controls and optimal content scheduling based on user preferences. And going forward, we will continue to seek an effective balance between embracing the diversity of content creativeness and efficiency in the production process. The third effect is that our intelligence reduction system is getting more sophisticated, which also helps in terms of increasing the possibilities of creating blockbuster content and improving efficiency. But on top of that, in the third quarter, we do see some new catalysts coming in and these UCAs including a virtuous cycle, which starts with our investment in the content. Then our investment content generate more hits, more hit titles and give users more value proposition, which in turn attracted more members than creating possibility for generating derivative revenues. So on top of that, we also like to comment that because we have been very much focused on original content, as you guys have been asking questions around that. The main current focus for us is to increase quality and optimize content quantity which not only applies to us and our peers, and we are glad to see that coincidently also applies to the various government authorities and then they would roll out policies that's actually positive to such process. After the three quarters of time for ITE, we now figure out a perfect balance between the quantity that we show for content and also the amount of marketing spending into this market to promote our content. So going forward, based on the success of our past 3 quarters and under the comp growth strategy, we believe that we can have healthy and sustainable growth for our business going forward."
