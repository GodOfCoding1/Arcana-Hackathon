    "content": " And we're seeing healthy gains that are hotels and these downtown markets such as San Diego, Dallas and San Antonio, Our five highest hotels with absolute RevPAR in the quarter were our residents in Fort Lauderdale on the inter-costal waterway with RevPAR over $250 on occupancy of 93% followed by Hilton Garden in Marina Del Rey with RevPAR of $147. And we've - the relationships and the goodwill that we built, I think over the last, you know, two plus years, with some of our key corporate clients, they're talking about in wanting to secure rooms for the fall, again, for kind of some more long-term, product development type business as well. And just from a rate perspective Ari I think it's important to note that, you know, when we first were negotiating the internal rates for this summer, as Jeff talked about, they're about $20 or 10%, below 2019. Yes, good question and I think, one of the benefits, and again, I think in Jeff's prepared remarks that he talked about, the beauty of that intern business is we're going to be running, you know, 90% to 100% occupancy in those five hotels."
