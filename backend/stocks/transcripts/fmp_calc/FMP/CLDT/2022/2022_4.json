    "content": " June RevPAR was up a strong 19% over amaze, driven by a combination of incremental leisure travel, and a more meaningful return of the business traveler, especially in our five hotels in the tech reliant markets of Silicon Valley in Bellevue, Washington. At the five hotels, June RevPAR was $192 on occupancy of 86% and ADR of $223, which is down 10% from June 2019, RevPAR of $213 on occupancy of 88% and ADR of $241, July RevPAR, finished a strong $207, which was up 12% over June's RevPAR and only off 2% to July 2019. Our five highest hotels with absolute RevPAR in the quarter were Hilton Garden Inn in Marina Del Rey with RevPAR of almost $200 on occupancy of 86% followed by our Residence Inn, Foggy Bottom and Hampton in Portland with RevPAR of $195 and then the Residence Inn San Diego Gaslamp District and in the SpringHill Suites, Savannah. These hotels had an average age of 29 years, approximately $12 million of capital requirements over the course of the next year and generated a 2019 RevPAR of $98 versus 2019 RevPAR of a $135 for the rest of Chatham's portfolio. I think we'll whether it softens out compared to the summer, because of all the intern business, and then start kind of building back up again or not, is probably too early to tell, but it's at least as we sit here today, all signs are pretty encouraging that that the top accounts that we normally do business with are going to continue to produce room demand for the second half of the year and after the interns all checkout. And we think we're going to continue to outperform 2019 margins, as I talked about in my prepared comments, we do believe there's a permanent workforce reduction across the portfolio, we're still down, I think just over 20% in employee headcount at the comparable hotel."
