    "content": " We generated $43 million of operating cash flow in the second half of the year, even as second half revenue exceeded first half revenue by 11.5% and we continue to grow our inventory balance. The DIET sector fourth quarter revenue was $248 million, a $28 million or 10% decrease due to the timing of several energy transition biofuel projects, and turnarounds winding down in the fourth quarter. The upstream production sector revenue for the fourth quarter was $195 million, an increase of $19 million or 11%, countering seasonal trends as we typically see a decline in this sectors fourth quarter revenue. From a geographic segment perspective, U.S. revenue was $720 million in the fourth quarter, a $48 million or 6% decrease as the gas utilities and DIET sectors experienced seasonal declines, partially offset by increases in the upstream production and midstream pipeline sectors. Now turning to margins, adjusted gross profit for the fourth quarter was $184 million, 21.2% of revenue, a 70 basis point decline from the third quarter in line with our expectations. Cash generation from operations through the business cycle remains a priority, and we are targeting in excess of $120 million in operating cash flow in 2023 even with double digit revenue growth."
