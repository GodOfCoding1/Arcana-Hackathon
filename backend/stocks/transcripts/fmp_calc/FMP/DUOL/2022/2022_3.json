I mean, of course, like I've been saying also in every single call, I don't know what will happen in terms of if there's a major recession or anything because we, as a company, have never gone through a major recession, but so far, we just haven't seen any softness. Yes, it's a great question. So, for -- in-app purchase stuff, most of the features that we're going to be building are probably going to be mainly helping with monetization, but we just want to make sure that they don't hurt engagement and also don't hurt learning. So this is why we think for us, we're very excited with general user growth because it's kind of the top of the funnel that gets us more users, which then gets us more subscribers, which makes us more revenue. Yes, it's a great question. And it's just going to be like -- it's going to be like doing, like you said, over the last 10 years, Duolingo is still getting better every single quarter, even though we've been working on it for the last 10 years, I think it's going to be the same for the math app. It's going to -- hopefully won't take 10 years for the math app to get there, but it will take several years to get there just. So we're -- stuff like that, there's all these things that we know from Duolingo that we just need to start putting into the math app what we haven't yet."
