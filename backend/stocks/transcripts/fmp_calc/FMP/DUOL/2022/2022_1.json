    "content": " In terms of our Q2 guidance, I'd like to point out that this is seasonally our softest quarter in terms of absolute bookings because we don't have our New Year's promotion or other big marketing events as we do in Q1, Q3 and Q4. In terms of the redesign of the home screen of the app, we do think that's going to really set us up for pretty big improvements into our metrics, mainly in terms of engagement and teaching better. I mean, the result of our performance, it really is the -- our outperformance really is the result of just hundreds of A/B tests that we've been running -- I mean, thousands, actually, of A/B tests that we've been running over the last couple of years, and it's just a compounding effect. The Family Plan is really good for our retention because if you think about it, if you're -- if you have a Family Plan and you're using Duolingo and also your significant other is using Duolingo and also your child is using Duolingo, as long as anybody is still using it, you're going to continue paying. And that's -- it is having an impact but it's not a massive impact, like it's not like, oh, because the price is cheaper in some countries, we're suddenly doubling our revenue or anything like that. But one of the things that I wanted to emphasize again is just that you should not expect any meaningful revenue contribution from the Math app or from these other things, mainly because our language learning is just growing so much that over the next few years, that's where the contribution is going to come from mainly."
