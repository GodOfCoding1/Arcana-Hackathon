    "content": " Net revenue from the industrial end markets also grew 7% year-over-year, but declined 13% sequentially and represented 41% of total net revenues. As I previously mentioned, we continue to see softness in consumer end markets, where net revenues for high-end consumer decreased 43% over the prior year and 15% sequentially and represented 20% of total net revenues. As the overall macro environment improves, we remain well-positioned to grow in the broader protection market with a well-rounded protection portfolio for high speed interfaces such as 10 gig Ethernet, USB Type C, touch displays, and antennas and expect our broader industrial protection business to deliver record revenues in FY 2023. However, driven by record LoRa-enabled revenues, which we expect will grow approximately 39% in FY 2023, we anticipate our Wireless and Sensing business to deliver another record revenue year in FY 2023, despite very weak consumer revenues. Please proceed with your question. Please proceed with your question. Please proceed with your question. We think next year should still be a reasonably \u00e2\u0080\u0093 the growth, it won't be close to the 40% CAGR, but I think if we can get some momentum on some of these other used cases, I think we'll still see good growth. Please proceed with your question. Please proceed with your question. And then the consumer is the big question because I think it's had such a poor fiscal year 2023 that one has to believe that that has a good chance to come back in FY 2024 and that includes our protection business and our proximity sensing business in Asia, particularly in Korea. Please proceed with your question."
