    "content": " In Q1, revenue from Tri-Edge increased over 100% over the prior quarter, and we continue to believe our hyperscale data center Tri-Edge revenues will triple in FY '23 as more customers move to full production and we increased our market share over DSP solutions in the 200-gig and 400-gig PAM4 segments. We expect our 5G wireless base station business to continue to grow in FY '23 and accelerate over the next few years as global 5G system deployments accelerate, driven by new 5G tenders expected in the second half of fiscal year '23. For Q2 of fiscal year '23, we expect net revenues from our Wireless and Sensing Product Group to be approximately flat as continued positive LoRa momentum is offset by a weaker consumer proximity sensing business. I mean, by my math, LoRa close to $50 million this past quarter, up better than 50% kind of year-over-year, I think, again, by my math, it seems to be either sort of in line with last year's growth rate or even accelerating."
