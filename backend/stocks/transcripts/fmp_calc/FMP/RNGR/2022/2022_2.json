    "content": " You guys have -- are competing for people to buy your stock with the other members in your industry who are now all returning capital fairly aggressively, and you've been talking about doing it now for upwards of a year, and I would encourage the Board to stop talking about it and start announcing concretely what the intentions are, even if it's just the beginning of some kind of capital return program and when it could start, you could announce it now even if you wanted to wait until your debt level is lower, I really would encourage more clarification from the Board to you guys as to what they're going to do because shareholders want...
