    "content": " Our adjusted EBITDA increased 69% to $30.3 million with EBITDA margins improving by more than 500 basis points to just over 17%, on the back of increasing prices and activity as well as strong operating leverage. Our operating performance, continued focus on managing working capital and ongoing sales of surplus assets has allowed Ranger to deleverage by $13 million this quarter, reducing our total debt balance by 19%. Finally, in our Ancillary Services businesses, we had a very strong quarter more than doubling segment level EBITDA and realizing segment level -- segment level EBITDA merchants above 25% Well, tubing, P&A, rentals in fishing and Torrent, our field gas processing division, all saw increased revenue and margins quarter-over-quarter. Adjusted EBITDA improved from $18 million in the second quarter to $30.3 million in Q3, a 69% increase with margins expanding 500 bps over that same period from 12% in Q2 to 17% in the third quarter. Turning to the balance sheet, the company reduced its debt, net debt load by $13.2 million, or 19% over the quarter, and is reporting adjusted net debt of $45.2 million at the end of the third quarter. And I think that probably the $8 million is around that's kind of if I was to give you more conservative, I see us probably edging up just a little bit on the back of all the growth this year. But I think about $8 million per quarter is probably where we wouldn't be which is meaningfully higher than 16 and 17, but again, much lower than the 12 and 11 that you've seen."
