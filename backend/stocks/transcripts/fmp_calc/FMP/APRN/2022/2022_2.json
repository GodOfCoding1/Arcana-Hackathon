    "content": " Although, we're only in the early stages, our hard work helped drive a slight increase in revenue versus the prior year in a seasonally slower second quarter and a 6% jump sequentially to $124 million, including a $10 million bulk enterprise sale. Average revenue per customer was $328, up 2% from last quarter and down slightly from the prior year as the increase in average order value was offset by a slight decrease in order frequency, which we largely attribute to the continued post-pandemic acceleration of travel that we're seeing around the country. So probably, what you're going to see is, you're going to see a bit more leaning towards the revenue side than necessarily the customer number side, as we start to introduce more and more of those full card sales and other sort of enterprise sales opportunities into the rest of the year that continue to be really effective for us."
