    "content": " In the fourth quarter, we reduced marketing spend by 18% year-over-year to $17.1 million, in line with our commitment to a thoughtful and targeted approach to marketing. These initiatives, together with the reductions in marketing spend, are expected to drive up to $50 million in annualized cost savings, resulting in over 50% year-over-year reduction in our cash burn as of the end of February 2023. But our focus right now is making sure that we're getting significant return on investment on our customers, because it's all about getting adjusted EBITDA lower throughout the year, and that's really where we're going to be spending our time."
