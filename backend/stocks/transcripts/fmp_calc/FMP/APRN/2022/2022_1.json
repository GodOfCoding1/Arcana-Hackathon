    "content": " While Q1 is always a seasonally strong quarter in our industry, in previous years, we have often started to see a seasonal drop in active customers by the end of the first quarter and into the start of the second. Product technology, general and administrative costs were $43.3 million for the first quarter, which was in line with the previous quarter as a percent of sales and higher than Q1 2020\u2019s $34.2 million. So, that worked quite well and we have seen a shift in higher percentage of paid traffic coming in from organic, which is something that we actually expected based on the COVID quarter year-over-year comparisons to Q1 of last year, which was a high organic traffic quarter because of the COVID comparison."
