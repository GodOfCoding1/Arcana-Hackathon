So, I\u2019m encouraged by the progress we are seeing in the turnaround of our consumer financial services business, which is manifesting in some of the key performance indicators we are measuring. On an annualized basis, Project Spring is targeted to deliver in excess of 300 million rand or $19.5 million in annual cost savings would represent just over 20% of the consumer financial services cost base and freeing up some capacity for targeted investments in the business.
