    "content": " While the economy in South Africa remains challenging, I am encouraged by the continued progress being made in the turnaround of our consumer financial Services business and in particular, the momentum we are seeing in the rate of new account openings and the ability of our team to take action in improving our financial performance. This change in our point of presence strategy when combined with other cost actions taken in this quarter will translate into approximately ZAR 185 million of cost savings over the remainder of the fiscal year, which in turn translates into an 18% reduction in fixed costs within the consumer financial services business this year. In summary, the work that has been done in the last six months by the leadership and management and teams, as well as all of our staffs in Net 1 lay the foundation and moves us in the direction required to transform the Consumer Financial Services business into a full service, profitable and leading Fintech company serving South Africa. The core South African operations saw EBITDA losses for the quarter of $8.6 million compared to the $4.3 million in the prior period, primarily due to the lower revenue levels as well as weaker profitability in the Financial Services segment linked to increased insurance claims related to the COVID pandemic. And then the third point to add is, to pick up on somewhat Lincoln was saying earlier, we want to -- we're putting a real focus on the average revenue per client and that's through training and focusing our staff across the country in terms of the broader product set, MoneyLine, Smart Life and therefore, offering a greater product offering to our client base and improving that overall revenue per client."
