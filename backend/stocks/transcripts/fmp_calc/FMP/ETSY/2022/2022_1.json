    "content": " As so much of the world shut down, we went from serving 2.6 million to 5.5 million active sellers and from 47 million to nearly 90 million active buyers, and etsy.com GMS grew from about $1.2 billion in the first quarter of 2020 to $2.8 billion this past quarter. In fact, even with all the progress in the recent past, half of Etsy's first quarter active buyers still bought only once during the trailing 12 months, and the vast majority of our habitual buyers are still in the U.S. We believe our frequency opportunity is still in its infancy. We'll also be doing a lot more in 2022 to further last year's progress towards reducing time to resolution for customer support, ensuring that Etsy Handmade and other policies are enforced helping sellers better manage shipping settings and delivery dates to give buyers the information they need to make purchase decisions and more. In the first quarter, approximately 50% of Etsy Marketplace paid GMS for these markets came from new buyers. During the first quarter of 2022, Etsy marketplace GMS declined 2% year-over-year and increased 177% on a year-over-3-year basis. Etsy.com ended the first quarter with 89 million active buyers, largely flat to year-end, which includes 8 million habitual buyers and another approximately 36 million repeat buyers, those who made purchases on 2 or more days in a 12-month period, but were not habitual buyers. Our growth of habitual buyers in core non-U.S. markets held up well in the first quarter of 2022, including 55% year-over-year growth in habitual buyers in Germany. While in the second quarter of 2021, Etsy reported consolidated GMS growth of 13% on a year-over-year basis, GMS increased 178% from the second quarter of 2019."
