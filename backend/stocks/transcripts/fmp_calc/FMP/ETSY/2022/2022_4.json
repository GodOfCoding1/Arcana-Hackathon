    "content": " This strong fourth quarter enabled us to finish 2022, having delivered consolidated GMS of $13.3 billion, down slightly from the prior year; record revenue of $2.6 billion, up about 10%; and non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA of about $717 million, essentially flat with the prior year as we reinvested most of the Etsy transaction fee increase back into the business. For example, in 2022, we tasked the Etsy Ads team to make ads more relevant for buyers, while keeping seller ROAS above our target levels, which drove over $100 million in incremental annualized revenue, while improving the experience for our customers. Our consolidated product development spend increased 36% year-over-year to $113 million in the fourth quarter, primarily driven by headcount additions for the Etsy marketplace. For 2022, our revenue per average full-time headcount for Etsy marketplace was $1.4 million, which is well above the approximately $800,000 for the Etsy marketplace in 2019 as we've hired at a pace significantly below our revenue growth rate. We ended the quarter with 7.4 million habitual buyers, a 194% increase from the fourth quarter of 2019, and they accounted for 40% of our Etsy marketplace GMS in the fourth quarter of 2022. Etsy's strong acquisition of new buyers and reactivation of lapsed buyers last year are just two proof points of the strength of our brand, representative of a through line, so to speak, that cuts across volatility that we have seen and may continue to see in 2023. So, we're very excited about the early performance of the purchase protection and want to keep investing in having our customers back, both buyers and sellers because we think it's really important."
