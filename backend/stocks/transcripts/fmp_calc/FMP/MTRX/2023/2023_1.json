In Utility and Power Infrastructure, revenue was $44.9 million which was lower than previous quarters as we are in the final completion stages of a couple of Peak Shaving projects that are carrying low margins. And finally, in Storage and Terminal Solutions, which produced the strongest results for the quarter, revenue increased to $76.9 million related to LNG and other capital projects."
