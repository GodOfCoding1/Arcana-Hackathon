    "content": " Due to breakdown and commercial negotiations concerning the extensive scope changes that impacted our ability to progress the project work according to forecast as well as the impact of global supply chain issues and inflation, we have taken a charge of $9.6 million in the quarter related to the forecasted outcome. At the end of the quarter, project backlog was $740 million, a 26% increase for the start of the fiscal year and backlog up across each of our segments. Excluding the adjustment, our gross profit was $8.3 million in the quarter and our gross margin was plus 4.3%, which was somewhat lower than our expectations due to under-recovered overhead costs at this revenue level, which impacted gross margins by 230 basis points. The segment gross margin was 2.6% from the second quarter, which was impacted by two issues, lower revenue volume negatively impacted overhead recovery, which had a 460 basis point impact in the quarter and increased forecasted costs to complete a smaller capital storage project had a 260 basis point impact in the quarter. We expect our liquidity position to continue to improve for several reasons, including expected improved operating results in the fourth quarter, the receipt of approximately $13 million of tax refunds in the third fiscal quarter and positive cash flow from newly awarded capital projects."
