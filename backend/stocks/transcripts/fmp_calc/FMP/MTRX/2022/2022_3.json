    "content": " Our revenue in the quarter was driven by smaller project activity, a higher percentage of lower margin reimbursable work and the execution of low-margin projects won during the competitive market environment, which we have experienced over the last few years. Moving to the Process and Industrial Facilities segment, third quarter revenue of $69 million represents a 37% increase over the second quarter and the highest quarterly revenue since the third quarter of fiscal 2020. While the revenue increase primarily relates to improved refinery maintenance activity, year-to-date, we have also booked over $315 million of awards, including a number of capital projects, resulting in a book-to-bill of 1.9x. Larger energy infrastructure projects progressing through our pipeline, combined with a normalized cadence of smaller capital projects and maintenance activity could conceivably put us in a position to exit Q1 of fiscal 2023 with the highest level of backlog in several years. And so I would think by the time we get to the probably get into the second quarter of next fiscal year, we will see a higher percentage of the projects that we\u2019ve got in backlog, new projects that we\u2019ve got in backlog and getting back to more of our traditional gross margin rates. And so during this quarter, when we think about the mix of work we have got going on, we are working off capital projects that have been prepaid effectively, and we have increased revenue volume and reimbursable work, and so the \u2013 which we have got to fund."
