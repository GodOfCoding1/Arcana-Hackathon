    "content": " As demonstrated on this chart, we need to see revenue in excess of $200 million to be near breakeven performance, while the project award performance was strong in the first quarter, the bulk of those awards will not begin to positively impact revenue until the third quarter. Turning now to our market outlook, as I said in my opening remarks, we recorded a significant increase in project awards, achieving a book-to-bill of 1.6 on project awards of $267 million and with diversified projects across all three segments, including a thermal vacuum chamber, LNG and renewable fuel storage, Electrical Infrastructure, midstream gas and chemicals, to name a few. I would say, they\u2019re in a range, because of whether this awards cycle or projects maybe moving in or out of that opportunity pipeline or is -- has been in the $4 billion to $6 billion range for the past probably 18 months."
