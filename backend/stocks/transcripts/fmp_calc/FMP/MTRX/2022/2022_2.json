    "content": " The segment gross margin was impacted by two issues: First, low volumes led to the under recovery of construction overhead costs, and second, we are working through projects that were marked down in previous periods and projects that were bid competitively and therefore present a lower-margin opportunities. As far as what's the level of revenue we need to break even the level or revenue we need to achieve full recovery of overheads, those targets of $200 million to break even $220 or so to get full recovery at, those are pretty much the same and I think the reason I'm not changing those is just we've seen some, we talked about this last quarter, some of our markets that we bid in right now are pretty competitive. There is a number of projects that we're in the either the bidding phase or we have put proposals in for related tax and infrastructure and it's really across the U.S. We're also seeing opportunities for LNG for ship bunkering, for export -- small-scale export into the Caribbean."
