    "content": " Overall, the macro trends, energy demand growth, a move to a lower carbon economy and federal spending will positively impact Matrix by clearly aligning with our strategy, capabilities and growth ambitions in providing increased opportunities for project awards and improved bottom line results. On a segment basis, the Storage and Terminal Solutions segment had revenue of $60 million, which was a 24% increase over the third quarter driven by construction on previously awarded LNG and renewable storage projects. Our tank maintenance and repair business, which traditionally does quite a bit of work in that crude oil tank repair and maintenance has been pretty busy, but as it relates to new storage, it's mostly around either LNG tanks associated with larger project or wrapped into an overall project and some kind of peak shaving or small scale export seen a lot of activity in ethane tanks."
