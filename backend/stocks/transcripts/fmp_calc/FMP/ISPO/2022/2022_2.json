    "content": " Brent already touched on the high level attributes of our subscription growth, but I wanted to spend a moment on the components of our travel revenue as it plays a direct role in our gross margin, which came in at $24 million or 28% of revenue for the quarter, compared to $17 million or 32% a year ago. Your line is open. We've grown a lot as you know the second quarter, I think the net adds were 49, total controlled accommodations that number over time, while we haven't put out projections, it will bounce around a little bit some of the larger deals like the Hamptons as an example, those 37 residences in one shot, those will cause that number to fluctuate. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. And it's really the same with Inspirato for Good, there's a little bit more staffing there, because the leads are a lot more in terms of gross volume, but it's not something that has the same level of expense as just the retail business that we have today, where we're obviously spending a lot of money with online and we're spending money on brand, those types of things we don't have to worry about with these new business lines nearly to the same extent."
