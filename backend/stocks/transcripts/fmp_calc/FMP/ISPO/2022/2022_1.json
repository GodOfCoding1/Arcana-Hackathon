Before reviewing our first quarter results, I'd like to begin the call with a sincere thank you to our more than 800 Inspirato team members, whose hard work, dedication, and commitment to delivering best-in-class experiences to our subscribers are the true engine that drives the company. In terms of the first quarter, we continue to benefit from our unique subscription-based platform for luxury travel, and robust travel demand in general, as we generated approximately $82 million in total revenue, a 67% increase year-over-year. Our subscription revenue of $32 million for the quarter was the result of growing our active subscriptions to nearly 15,300, an 18% increase from the first quarter of last year. Further our Inspirato past subscriptions increased more than 80% between periods to approximately 3,300. From a travel standpoint, we generated $50 million of revenue in the first quarter compared to $28 million in the first quarter of 2021. First, the easing of pandemic-related travel restrictions and pent-up travel demand are clearly driving a sustained increase in usage for our subscribers. We're able to not only capitalize on periods of high demand, but maximize occupancy and revenue in our offseason locations through our innovative and proprietary technology. In terms of supply to meet the growing demand, we successfully increased our total controlled accommodations to a record 653 as of March 31. This not only represents an increase of more than 60% from a year ago, but remarkably, more than 20% since year-end 2021. On our last call, I highlighted our new Inspirato real estate platform, as well as our growing team and infrastructure aimed at large scale strategic acquisitions. Earlier this quarter, we announced the tremendous success of our Inspirato Only Luxury Cruise program, including record breaking bookings resulting in more than $3 million of reservations in the first 24 hours. We've also alluded to early success of adjacent subscription offerings, such as a corporate incentive travel platform. We believe that continuing to successfully innovate around our past platform, specifically as it relates to the shareability of travel with employees could lead to significant upside to our near and long-term revenue growth. As we covered in our press release last night, the first quarter was a record setting across several key aspects of our business, namely revenue, active subscriptions; total nights delivered and controlled accommodations. As Brent mentioned, total revenue of $82 million was comprised of $32 million of subscription revenue, and $50 million of travel revenue. With continued execution of our business plan, we are firmly in line to meet our full-year revenue guidance of $350 million to $360 million. Our gross margin for the quarter was $35 million, compared to $17 million in the first quarter of 2021. As a percentage of total revenue, our gross margin was an impressive 43% compared to 38% just last quarter, and 35% for all of 2021. But it's important to note that we have yet to enter the stage of optimizing our margins, and are instead focused on the rapid growth of both our subscription and controlled accommodation accounts. Gross margin benefited from an increase in higher margin subscription revenue, as well as high utilization and significant increases in the nightly rate environment for luxury hospitality in particular. There's typically some seasonality in our business, and gross margin in the second quarter has typically reflected lower travel demand at that time of year. For the first quarter, we had a net loss of $24 million and an adjusted EBITDA loss of $3.5 million, compared to a $3.9 million loss and a $1.6 million loss respectively in the first quarter last year. The change in the fair value of warrants from closing to the end of the quarter was $18 million, and coupled with investments in sales and marketing, technology and corporate infrastructure these are the primary drivers for the differences between the periods. In terms of key operating metrics, Brent already covered the impressive growth of each of our active subscriptions and past subscriptions, which lead to an annual recurring revenue of a record $147 million. As a reminder, annual recurring revenue is total active subscriptions multiplied by the annualized subscription rate for the applicable subscriber. Our ARR of $147 million as of March 31, represents an increase of 56% compared to one year ago, and is a record for the company. In the first quarter, we delivered approximately 43,000 nights, an increase of 45% from the first quarter of 2021. We're proud to have achieved this with total occupancy in our residences of 87%, signaling that there is an incredible demand to keep up with our truly staggering supply growth. As Brent mentioned, total controlled accommodations of 653 at the end of the quarter represent an increase of more than 60% year-over-year, and more than 20% since year-end 2021. The prudent management of this liquidity enables us to opportunistically accelerate our growth, but is not needed to meet our published targets in 2022 or beyond. Brent, maybe a question for you around nightly rates clearly up a lot and there's a ton of pent-up demand. And then to get right to your question on rates and sustainability, I've been doing this for 20 years, so I've been through a couple of different cycles including the Great Recession. And one thing that I think is clear is that the affluent are going to travel, they're highly protected, they're going to travel, luxury hospitality companies typically don't discount, they'll typically offer things like free breakfast or a fortnight stay, things like that, for the brands like tour season. But the one area in our business that we do see, kind of coming back more towards a new normal, I wouldn't call it the old normal; the new normal is I don't see people willing to travel anywhere, anytime for the sake of travel. Excuse me, last year, you would get people to visit a ski destination in the Center of Mud season and they just wanted to go somewhere, they just didn't want to be out of their house. And then very specifically on your rate sustainability, what I would say is during the peak times there's still room for rate increases, actually. But because we're essentially a private club, we really have to balance how much we're charging on a per night basis, relative to the value that we're delivering to our subscribers. And the reason we're not increasing them even more is because we need renewal subscriptions, and we need to keep our retention very high. Unlike, just a five-star hotel that literally during New Year's is just going to charge the maximum rate they can to get one person to say yes. And we see that as starting to realize on significant investments we made in the last year or 15 months around people and infrastructure dedicated to growing and diversifying our portfolio footprint, what we call our inventory. But I would like to highlight and some of this, we had announced via press release throughout the quarter, some of that new ad and a material amount of it were large institutional scale deals, I highlighted in my remarks earlier the 37 residences in the Hamptons. Our platform and building the development that pardon me the acquisition pipeline to secure inventory like that really rounds out our multichannel strategy of acquisition, the bread and butter of the company for years, building over 400 residences has been more high net worth owner users would be at the typical profile. Just curious a little bit, 1Q was really strong and the gross margin was a lot stronger than I kind of modeled. I wouldn't say it's protracted, I wouldn't say it's terribly significant, but it moves the number. You're also right to point out that as we head in to the second quarter, and I tried to make reference to this, we have a lot of experience in this business, we believe we have the largest footprint of full P&L visibility of luxury vacation rentals for the longest period of time of anyone. So historically, we've typically seen that demand for travel does taper off a bit. I'm sympathetic to your modeling challenges, it's tough to lay that against the overall growth trajectory of the business as a countervailing factor. But we would expect gross margin typically, historically has come down from a first quarter high into a still robust and healthy but somewhat moderated second quarter outlook. To your last question on sort of overall gross margin outlook, I play a point to last year, we finished the year at 87% or 88% occupancy, we did the same thing in the first quarter. The combination of those two, we'd outline months ago in our investor deck, a lot of opportunities to significantly enhance gross margin over time, I still believe in those. And they're not just all cruise, they can be land-based as well, and have these members-only experiences that really only we can provide. And so obviously, when we sort of came back, there was a lot of -- there was a lot of pent-up demand, we're contemplating and working on our 2023 and 2024 packages now in that arena. And we anticipate just with the experience economy, and people wanting to get out and try different things and do different things and do it with a trusted source they might be doing something they've never done before or something that feels more adventurous. It's something that we're really focused on, we're investing heavily in and we think that we've really got the tiger by the tail, in terms of the technology and infrastructure that we've built with our patented technology that really drives the Pass. And essentially what it allows for us to do is to create these lists of 100s of 1000s of trips or millions of trips, and have a shopping and merchandising experience for the consumer that's really unmatched. Today the one product that we have is Pass platform, but in the future we think that lends itself very well for things like the individual incentive travel market. There is so much demand for companies to want to really differentiate themselves, to really provide a mechanism where they can win in hiring war or win against the great resignation and providing a trip where historically, these trips would either be like big events, held at a high end somewhere that you just go and it's sort of like all your work people, or maybe it's you can bring your spouse. And then while I'm kind of talking about this other thing that Pass does really well, is it -- it creates a kind of natural exchange platform. So if you think about the ability for Pass, and what we've built, to be able to be used by any kind of loyalty program or any other type of incentive program, we really are excited about the differentiation that we bring to that market. As far as seasonality with respect to subscriptions, what we've seen their historically, and what we project is a much more muted impact as just opposed against travel delivered. The element of seasonality, we've sort of demonstrated on last year and 15 months has been continued growth quarter-over-quarter, an enhanced mix of that growth bias towards the Pass products that Brent referenced. And I would say we are a retail sales business with a data-driven, highly experienced driven digital marketing and sales and conversion machine. And as such, we do have incentives monthly and quarterly and throughout the year towards the end of the year. So given that we do generally see increased subscription sales at the end of each month at the end of each quarter, and of course at the end of the year to align with our sales infrastructure. We have not increased our new subscriber fees, really, since launch essentially Pass launched. What is it almost three years ago, at $2,500 a month, it's still there. But what I would say is, is that we are innovating and really thinking about premium add-ons to our existing subscriptions. We believe that we have pricing power to increase subscriptions, pricing, but there's just not a real reason to do that today while we're in growth mode. The other thing that I would say is that our increases to our existing subscribers as far as every year adjusting for inflation and how their existing subscriptions increase for our legacy customers is extremely nominal for our legacy subscribers that we have had for many, many years typically we increase that subscription by $100 per year."
