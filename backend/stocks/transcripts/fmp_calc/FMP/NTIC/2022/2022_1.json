    "content": " A strong demand we experienced during first quarter led to a 42.4% increase in our total consolidated net sales as compared to the first quarter ended November 30, 2020 to a quarterly record of $18.2 million. For first quarter of fiscal 2022, ZERUST India contributed $2,453,000 in sales to NTIC\u2019s consolidated net sales. For the first quarter ended November 30, 2021, our total consolidated net sales increased 42.4% to a quarterly record of $18.2 million as compared to the first quarter ended November 30, 2020. Total net sales for the fiscal 2022 first quarter by our joint ventures, which we do not consolidate in our financial statements were $26.8 million. Turning to our Natur-Tec bioplastics business, fiscal 2022 first quarter Natur-Tec sales were $3.8 million, a 47.3% increase over the prior fiscal year period. The quarter ended November 30, 2021 represents the first quarter since we completed the acquisition of the remaining 50% ownership interest in our Indian joint venture, which we refer to as ZERUST India for $6.25 million. Looking at our consolidated results in more detail, compared to prior fiscal year period, NTIC\u2019s consolidated net sales increased 42.4% in the fiscal 2022 first quarter to a quarterly record, because of the positive trends Patrick reviewed in his prepared remarks and the incremental sales from ZERUST India. Despite a 1% increase in first quarter sales across our global joint ventures, first quarter joint venture operating income declined 12.3% compared to the prior fiscal year period. As illustrated in our first quarter results, ZERUST India, the ZERUST India transaction, increased our net sales and operating expenses, since it has now consolidated with our financial results and decreased our equity and income from joint ventures in which in each case as compared to the same period last fiscal year and we anticipate that the acquisition will continue to have these effects on our financial results during the remainder of fiscal 2022. Excluding the one-time gain of $3.9 million led to the acquisition of the remaining 50% ownership interest in ZERUST India and other related adjustments, NTIC\u2019s non-GAAP adjusted net income was $780,000 or $0.08 per diluted share for the fiscal 2022 first quarter compared to $1.3 million or $0.13 per diluted share for the same quarter last year. During the fiscal 2022 first quarter, NTIC\u2019s Board of Directors increased our regular quarterly cash dividend by 7.7% to $0.07 per share that was payable on November 17, 2021 to shareholders of record on November 3, 2021. Beyond that, across the ZERUST industrial market, the gross margins throughout first quarter and what we are seeing kind of in the second quarter is that with the increase in the cost of the resins, the main materials, the main raw materials that go into our product, it was pretty volatile during the last 6 months of the last fiscal year and through the first 3 months of this year."
