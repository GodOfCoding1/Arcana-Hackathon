    "content": " The Group's 2022 SG&A was KRW4,535 billion, representing an increase of 9.3% Y-o-Y, but the cost income ratio was 44.4%, which is a 3.1% point decrease versus the previous year. In 2022, the group's SG&A expenses increased 9.3% year-over-year to KRW4,535 billion, and the cost-to-income ratio stood at 44.4%. As of the end of 2022, the group's expected common stock ratio, or CET1 ratio is 11.5%, up 0.1 percentage point from its last year-end. To this end, based on the maximum regulatory requirement of 10.5% and our CET1 target of 12%, the group's asset growth rate in consideration of the nominal GDP growth rate outlook will be managed at 4.5% levels. Even if the total shareholder return rate is maintained at the 30% level, with the future increase in the group's net income and the effect coming from the share buyback and cancellation kicks in, we expect stock related indicators such as dividend per share and earnings per share to showcase a continuous upward trajectory."
