    "content": " In the third quarter of 2022, Sanara generated $13 million in revenue, representing a 124% increase from the prior year period. Third quarter revenues included $3 million of Scendia sales. During the quarter, we worked to integrate Scendia into Sanara's business, and we continue to see significant opportunities as well as synergies from the combination of the 2 companies. We will discuss this later in the call, but this partnership pairs Sanara's product line and deep expertise in wound care and InfuSystem's distribution and complex billing capabilities as well as our existing sales team and national footprint. The partnership is expected to enable InfuSystem to offer innovative products, including medical LLC's negative pressure wound therapy and PWT devices and supplies and Sanara's advanced wound care product line and associated services to new customers. The partnership pairs Sanara's product line and deep expertise in wound care with InfuSystem's distribution and complex billing capabilities, existing sales team and national footprint. Third quarter revenues included $3 million of Scendia sales. The higher direct sales and marketing expenses were primarily attributable to increase in sales volume, our sales commissions of $3.1 million as a result of higher product sales and $0.5 million of increased costs as a result of sales force expansion and $0.3 million of costs related to travel and operational support."
