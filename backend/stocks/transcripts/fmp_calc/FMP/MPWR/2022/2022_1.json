    "content": " In our storage and computing market, first quarter 2022 revenue of $96.6 million increased $18.6 million or 23.9% from the fourth quarter of 2021 due primarily to higher storage and commercial notebook sales. In our enterprise data market, first quarter 2022 revenue of $42.5 million increased 5.0% in the fourth quarter of 2021 due primarily to continuing strength in data center and workstation computing sales. I think that we answered the questions in last quarter, okay, we said that we're going to play in the $4 billion of revenues in the next couple of years."
