    "content": " During the third quarter, third-party operators active on our minerals converted 96 gross or 0.25 net wells to producing compared to 108 gross or 0.48 net wells converted to PDP in the second quarter, with the majority of the new wells located in the SCOOP and Haynesville plays. This was comprised of a 3% increase in royalty volumes primarily attributable to newly drilled and completed wells in the Haynesville and SCOOP plays and a 9% decline in our working interest volumes, primarily attributable to wells being temporarily shut in, in the Eagle Ford Shale play in order to work over an adjacent set of wells. Average realized prices, excluding the effect of hedging received for natural gas, oil and NGLs in the quarter were up 34% on an Mcfe basis from the prior sequential quarter to $8.05 driven by higher oil and natural gas prices and slightly offset by lower volumes. So, we are getting pretty close to \u00e2\u0080\u0093 if you remember, about a year or 2 years ago, Chad stated that within, let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s say, 3 years, we should be well north of 90% of our operating cash flow coming from royalty volumes."
