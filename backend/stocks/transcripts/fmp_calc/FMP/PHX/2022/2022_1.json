    "content": " Those volumes are going to continue to decline over the next several quarters and should drop by December time should drop by about a third and by about two thirds by the end of the calendar year and we, as Chad mentioned, we have opportunistically layered on additional hedges on gas every time that we've seen a spike in prices and as the volumes that were hedged at $2.90 from COVID roll off, the new hedges are coming in at a price between $3.50 and $4 per MCF, which should drastically change the cash generating position of the company as we work through or calendar 2022."
