    "content": " During the second quarter third party operators active on our minerals converted 108 gross or 0.48 net well on progress or width to producing compared to 68 gross or 0.19 width converted to PDP in the first quarter, which is nearly a 60% increase quarter-over-quarter with the majority of the new wells located in the scoop and Haynesville place. For our fiscal second quarter ended March 31, 2022, total hydrocarbon production volumes increased 16% from the prior sequential quarter to 2.46 Bcfe. Average realized prices received for natural gas, oil and NGL in the quarter were down 7% on a Mcfe basis from the prior sequential quarter to $6.01, which is driven by lower pricing in the natural gas market, primarily in January and early February. Unrealized mark to market losses totaled 11.7 million during the quarter as a result of oil and gas prices increasing from $75.21 to $100.28 and $3.73 to $5.64 respectively from December 31, 2021 to March 31, 2022. Total transportation, gathering and marketing increased 23% on an absolute basis to 1.49 million on a sequential quarter basis due to higher volumes, primarily the Fayetteville shale play, which has higher transportation expenses relative to other gas producing regions, such as the Haynesville. So over the last couple of quarters, I think what we\u2019ve guided on royalty volumes was that fiscal \u201822 would grow on average, somewhere between 30% and 35% compared to fiscal 2021."
