    "content": " That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s in spite of a 6% decline in heating-degree days, the decline in weather related deliveries to our residential customers was offset by the increase in our industrial transportation volumes again impacted by that same customer that's been utilizing natural gas to a greater extent this year compared to last year. If you move to Slide 06, our financial results for the third quarter 2022, our operating income of $1.6 million exceeded the third quarter of 2021 by about $98,000 or 6.3%. For the 09 months ending June 30, 2022, operating income which is mainly from the Roanoke Gas subsidiary was $14.5 million, an increase of $238,000. Our underlying net income for the 09 months and 12 months ending June 30, adjusting for the impairment was $9.3 million for both periods and represented a decline of $847,000 and $517,000 respectively. In the prior year, we recognized non-cash AFUDC of over $1.4 million for the 09 months and $2.8 million for the 12 months ending June 30, 2021. This represents our year-to-date capital expenditures and investments made by Roanoke Gas for Utility Property for the nine months of fiscal year 2022 totaled $17,431,000 and was approximately 17% higher than last year. If the application is approved, the project will add about $7.7 million in rate base on which we will be allowed to earn a return based on our cost of capital from our prior rate case plus an additional 100 basis points to our authorized return on equity. We expect to invest approximately $6 million in the fourth quarter including $1.4 million for new business and $2.8 million for renewals, including approximately $750,000 for our the completion of our last gate station renewal: Brown Farm."
