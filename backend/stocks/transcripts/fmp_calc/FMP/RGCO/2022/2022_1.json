    "content": " For the trailing 12 months, Roanoke Gas operating income increased by 12% year-over-year which is a testament to the outstanding performance by our utility subsidiaries Paul just discussed. The strong Roanoke Gas earnings were offset by a year-over-year $4.6 million decline in equity and earnings from Midstream's investment in the Mountain Valley pipeline, resulting in a $1.08 per share earnings on a consolidated basis compared to $1.38 for the prior 12 months. With our capital spending forecast for the fiscal year, we still are at approximately $25 million this year and as we discussed last quarter, this is the largest or will be the largest capital spend in Roanoke Gas is 139-year history."
