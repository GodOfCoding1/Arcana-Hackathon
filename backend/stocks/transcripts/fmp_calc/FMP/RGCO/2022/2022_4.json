    "content": " Based on the comparison of our financial performance attributed to operations for the quarter and the year-ended 9/30, we've adjusted our GAAP results for the non-cash impairment loss on our MVP investment that were recorded in the second and fourth fiscal quarters. In the prior year, we recognized non-cash AFUDC of approximately $181,000 in the fourth quarter and $1.7 million for the 12 months ending September 30, 2021. We experienced strong investments made by the Roanoke Gas for utility property for the 12 months of fiscal year 2021, which totaled $25,461,000 an increase of approximately 27.5% over the prior year. Before we review our fiscal 2023 capital spending forecast and our EPS forecast, Tommy will provide a brief overview and update of the RNG project and discuss the recently filed rate case, which will increase the non-GAAP base rates, our customers pay for natural gas service."
