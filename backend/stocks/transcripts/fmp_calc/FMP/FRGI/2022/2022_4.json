    "content": " During the fourth quarter, we continued the double-digit comparable restaurant sales momentum from the third quarter with improved margins, while continuing to make progress on the key priorities we communicated previously, including continued increases in operation staffing levels and tangible headway on G&A expense reduction. Regarding sales performance, total revenues increased 9.3% to $97.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2022 from $89.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2021, driven by the comparable restaurant sales increase and partially offset by the impact of the hurricanes, estimated at approximately $0.5 million. Fourth quarter improvement compared to 2021 resulted from a 16.3% increase in the net impact of product channel mix and pricing and a decrease in comparable restaurant transactions of 5.3%, including approximately 0.5% due to the impact of the hurricanes. Restaurant-level operating profit margins increased during the fourth quarter compared to 2021, primarily due to the impact of higher restaurant sales driven by higher pricing and lower special incentive pay, partially offset by higher commodity costs and repairs and maintenance costs. Regarding fourth quarter trends in key expense categories, cost of sales as a percentage of restaurant sales in the fourth quarter of 2022 increased to 31.2% compared to 30.1% in 2021, due to higher commodity costs and sales mix, partially offset by our phased menu price increases and improvements due to operational efficiencies. Restaurant wages as a percentage of net sales decreased to 25% in the fourth quarter of 2022 from 27.9% in 2021, driven primarily by lower special incentives and bonus pay, partially offset by the impact of higher wage rates."
