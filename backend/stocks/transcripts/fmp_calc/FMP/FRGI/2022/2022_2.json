Regarding our reference to drive growth across all channels, we continue to drive year-over-year growth in the delivery channel with comparable restaurant sales growth of 17.2% in the second quarter of 2022 versus the second quarter of 2021. In addition, dine-in and counter takeout sales are showing strong growth as we improve staffing levels, with dine-in and counter takeout comparable restaurant sales growth of 25.1% in the second quarter of 2022 versus 2021. Regarding sales performance, total revenues increased 8% to $98.5 million in the second quarter of 2022 from $91.2 million in the second quarter of 2021, driven by the comparable restaurant sales increase. Regarding second quarter trends in key expense categories, cost of sales as a percentage of restaurant sales in the second quarter of 2022 increased to 33.2% compared to 30.4% in 2021 due to higher commodity costs, partially offset by our phased menu price increases. Restaurant wages as a percentage of net sales increased to 25.1% in the second quarter of 2022 from 24.1% in 2021, driven primarily by higher labor costs due to higher wage rates, overtime pay and training costs, partially offset by the impact of higher restaurant sales."
