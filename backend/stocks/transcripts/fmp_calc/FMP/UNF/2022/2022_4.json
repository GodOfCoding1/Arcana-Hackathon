    "content": " Continuing the trend from prior quarters, the strong revenue growth also reflects the impact of price adjustments from throughout the year as we continue to work with our customers to share in cost increases related to the inflationary environment. The costs we incurred during the quarter related to our key initiatives were recorded to the Core Laundry Operations segment and excluding these costs, the segment's adjusted operating margin was 8.3%. This adjusted operating margin reflects continued pressure from the current inflationary environment, higher levels of merchandise amortization, elevated energy costs, indirect costs we are incurring related to our key initiatives as well as additional investments we are making in strengthening our overall capabilities. Back to Steve's comment about the trajectory, I would say that, that trajectory is the quarterly comparisons to the comparable prior year period, meaning the -- I guess, the momentum or the improvement that we're seeing is really the delta between the current or any individual quarter and the prior year comparable, if that makes sense."
