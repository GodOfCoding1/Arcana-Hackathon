    "content": " In addition to these costs related pressures, we have also recently been infusing higher than expected levels of merchandize into service with our customers due to a number of factors, including a pickup in activity in our energy dependent markets, solid new accounts sales, additional ware additions at our customers, as well as certain national account investments. The most significant item impacting our adjusted operating margin in the quarter compared to the prior year was our merchandize costs, which has increased as a percentage of revenues due to the continued normalization of merchandize amortization from depressed levels during the pandemic, ongoing supply chain disruption, the effect of some large national account reinvestment as well as increased activity in our energy related markets. So as far as new account sales, our ratio of new account sales that come from competitive wins versus no programmers remains consistent so far this year, and I am willing to say probably in the more recent period quarter as well, where it's about 60% to 65% competitive and the remaining no programmers -- as we've talked about before, no programmers could be someone who doesn't have a uniform program or someone who maybe buys uniforms direct that we convert into a full service rental program."
