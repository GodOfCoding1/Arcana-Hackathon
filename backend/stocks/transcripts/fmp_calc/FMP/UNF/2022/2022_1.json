    "content": " In our first quarter of 2022, consolidated revenues were $486.2 million, up 8.8% from $446.9 million a year ago and consolidated operating income decreased to $44.8 million from $56 million or 20.1%. Costs we incurred during the quarter related to our key initiatives were recorded to our Core Laundry operation segment and excluding these costs, the segment\u2019s adjusted operating margin was 9.9%. Our First Aid segment\u2019s revenues increased to $17.8 million from $15.5 million in prior year, or 14.8%. However, the segment had an operating loss of $0.3 million during the quarter, primarily due to continued investment in the company\u2019s initiative to expand its First Aid van business into new geographies."
