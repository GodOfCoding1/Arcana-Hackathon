    "content": " Although our financial results in the prior year may have included direct costs related to these key initiatives, which in our second quarter of 2021 would have primarily been for our CRM initiative, company did not specifically track the amounts that were being expensed. This strong organic growth rate was primarily the result of customer reopenings in fiscal 2021, solid sales performance and improved customer retention as well as efforts to share with our customers the cost increases that we are seeing in our business due to the current inflationary environment. The decrease from prior year's operating margin was primarily due to higher merchandise amortization, which continues to normalize from depressed levels during the pandemic, as well as the effect of large national account installations which are providing additional merchandise amortization headwinds. During the quarter, the adjusted operating margin was also impacted by higher travel and energy costs as a percentage of revenues as well as wage inflation we continue to experience responding to the very challenging employment environment. Segment's operating margin decreased to 10.8% from 14.9%, primarily due to higher gross margin on its prior year direct sales, as well as higher labor costs as a percentage of revenues."
