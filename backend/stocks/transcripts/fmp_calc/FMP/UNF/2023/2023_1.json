    "content": " In our first quarter of 2023, consolidated revenues were $541.8 million, up 11.4% from $486.2 million a year ago, and consolidated operating income decreased to $43.4 million from $44.8 million or 3.1%. Our financial results in the first quarters of fiscal 2023 and 2022 included approximately $10 million and $5.9 million, respectively, of costs directly attributable to the three key initiatives that Steve discussed. Excluding these initiative costs, adjusted operating income increased to $53.5 million compared to $50.7 million in prior year or 5.4%. Our Core Laundry Operations revenues for the quarter were $477.4 million, up 11.3% from the first quarter of 2022. The largest item impacting our adjusted operating margin compared to prior year continues to be merchandise amortization, resulting from the inflationary effect on the cost of our products as well as higher levels of merchandise put in service with our customers in 2022 to support solid new account sales, increased activity in our energy-dependent markets, elevated wearer additions at our customers as well as certain national account investments. Revenues from our Specialty Garments segment, which delivers specialized nuclear decontamination and cleanroom products and services, increased to $44.1 million from $39.5 million in prior year or 11.6%. Cash provided by operating activities for the quarter increased to $27.7 million compared to $7.8 million in prior year, primarily due to lower working capital needs of the business."
