    "content": " Just -- I would say in general, as you think about our end markets for the quarter, in the first half, I'd say, municipal has been really strong, relatively speaking, just from a volume perspective, I'd say, kind of in that low to mid-single-digit range and muni is typically an area that's kind of low single digits. So we've got those well tracked and we continue to see expansion there, in particular, moving more product now through private label and then now having really 4 full quarters now of sustained gross margin accretion that we've seen come from some of the acquisitions that we've done and then the related synergies associated with those."
