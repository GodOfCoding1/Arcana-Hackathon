    "content": " Turning to page six, you can see our strong track record of performance over the last five years, with annual sales growth averaging approximately 20%, including 300 basis points above market growth and 600 basis points of EBITDA margin expansion. Adjusted EBITDA margin decreased 20 basis points to 11.9%, due to cost inflation, higher operating expenses to support our growth and lower sales volume. Adjusted EBITDA for fiscal \u00e2\u0080\u009822 increased 55% to $935 million and adjusted EBITDA margin improved 200 basis points, due to our strong net sales growth, gross margin expansion and leveraging our cost structure and the increase in net sales. So maybe help us understand, kind of, the trajectory of pricing as you go through the year to get to the flat estimate or is this just, kind, of being conservative on how the back half plays out, because it seems like you're flowing through the entire -- you're kind of thinking in your gross margin side that prices really normalize, but then there should be some tailwinds to start the year. Sure, Elizabeth, I think when you look at some of the trends that have been happening here with onshoring, certainly industrial and manufacturing growth has been really strong for us, and when we look at our -- particularly our fire protection products, one of the value-add we do there is really working with the designers and the engineers on prefabbing and kitting a lot of the fire protection assemblies, so that they can be put on -- on-site and assembled on-site rather than fabricated on-site."
