    "content": " We generally anticipate an operating cash outflow in the first quarter, and this year was no exception as we continue to build inventory to support demand and to ensure we have products available for our customers while navigating long lead times. Now what we have seen is we've really positioned ourselves in so many different ways from a product standpoint, from a market standpoint, from a sales standpoint to better drive a lot of the adoption on that -- of those and to continue that sustainable growth. So going up against those comps, I'd say we expected a lower growth rate in terms of residential demand, but we're still seeing the strength there and lot of development, just not at the rate coming off of kind of double-digit increases that we saw last year. And in terms of the full year on that, I'd say it's in kind of the mid-teens that we expect, and that's at a lower rate than what we had in the first quarter, obviously, as we continue to anniversary some of those inflationary metrics that we had in 2021."
