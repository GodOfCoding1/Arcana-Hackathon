    "content": " Our fourth quarter performance meant we ended the year with great momentum, with net earnings of $1.3 billion, adjusted EBITDA of $918 million, free cash flow of $537 million and cash flow per share of $3.55, modestly ahead of consensus estimates. As mentioned earlier, we've chosen to reduce our activity in the play and focus on optimizing asset level free cash flow and operational efficiencies, given the weaker outlook for gas and NGLs in 2023. Safe work always, executing a disciplined development program focused on maximizing capital efficiency, generating significant free cash flow to enhance returns to shareholders maintaining our strong balance sheet and continuing to enhance our premium return drilling inventory. We've still got some headroom on the kind of notional level that we set for that to be around $300 million to $350 million a year, which really floats back to the 10% of EBITDA to mid-cycle price range."
