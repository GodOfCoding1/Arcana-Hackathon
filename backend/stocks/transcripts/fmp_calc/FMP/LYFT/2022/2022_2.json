    "content": " The airport use case reached an all-time historic high at 10.2% of total rideshare rides in Q2 and managed Lyft business bookings more than doubled, up 105% year-over-year. In Q2, average driver earnings in the U.S. were north of $37 per utilized hour, which is up 18% year-over-year, including tips and bonuses. In the second quarter, we delivered revenues of $991 million, representing an increase of 13% versus Q1 and 30% versus last year. Revenue growth was driven primarily by rideshare, which was up 27% year-over-year in Q2. We expect Q3 revenues of between $1.040 billion and $1.060 billion, which implies growth of between 5% and 7% versus Q2 and growth of 20% and 23% versus Q3 last year. Excluding the accounting tailwinds in Q2 of $15.5 million in contribution and $29 million in adjusted EBITDA, for every $1 of incremental revenue in Q3, the high end of our outlook implies $0.12 will flow to contribution and $0.22 will flow to adjusted EBITDA. And going forward, on a per ride share basis, we expect contra to decline 20% year-over-year and to come down in absolute terms versus Q2. 150 bps of the beat with stronger revenue per ride due to longer rides and pricing and 160 bps of the beat were onetime accounting items, including a bike share adjustment of $16 million."
