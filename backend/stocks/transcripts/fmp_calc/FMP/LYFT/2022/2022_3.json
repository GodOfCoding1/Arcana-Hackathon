    "content": " Revenue per Active Rider reached a new all-time high of $51.88, up 4% quarter-over-quarter and 14% year-over-year. Normalizing for $15.5 million in discrete accounting items in Q2 and contribution margin decreased sequentially by 200 basis points, reflecting a risk transfer renewal in Q3 that has now been shifted to align with our normal Q4 renewal time line. Adjusting for $29 million in discrete accounting items in Q2 for every $1 of sequential revenue growth in Q3, roughly $0.26 flowed to adjusted EBITDA. We expect revenues of between $1.145 billion and $1.165 billion, up 9% to 11% quarter-over-quarter and 18% to 20% versus Q4 of last year. Given our Q4 outlook, we expect calendar year 2022 revenue of $4.65 billion to $4.85 billion, up roughly 27% versus 2021. We are laser-focused on delivering on our 2024 financial targets between the momentum we are seeing in our business, our product and marketplace work, and our cost management, we are even more confident in our ability to deliver $1 billion of adjusted EBITDA with over $700 million of free cash flow, which is defined as operating cash flow less CapEx. On insurance, in Q4, we expect an $82 million increase in cost of revenue versus Q3 that's reflective of our Q4 insurance headwind. So it's the combination of those 2 things, service fee plus the Rides growth, partially offset by the seasonality in bikes and scooters that are driving the incremental roughly $100 million increase quarter-on-quarter."
