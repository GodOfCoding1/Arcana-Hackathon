    "content": " Revenues increased 28% year-on-year to $587 million driven by rising gas output, commodity prices, B2B Energ\u00c3\u00ada plus sales and higher legacy energy and regulated prices. The adjusted EBITDA amounted to $253 million, 6% up year-on-year, and 13% up quarter-on-quarter, explained by the same reasons detailed before, and better operating margin offset by increased cost on maintenance and contractors for an intense E&P activity and higher peso-linked expenses because inflation is outpacing devaluation. Now moving to E&P in Slide 7, our gas production reached a new all time high record again, recording 11.2 million cubic meters per day in June. Therefore during Q2 our gas production outperformed by growing 38% year-on-year, and 14% quarter-on-quarter, averaging, 10.2 million cubic meters per day in the quarter and outpacing nationwide growth that only increased by 14%. We posted an adjusted EBITDA of a $102 million in Q2, 39% up year-on-year, and almost double quarter-on-quarter, explained by the gas performance that we mentioned before and higher realized oil prices offset by increased cost-related to the growing activity and export expenses. And in order to increase that \u00e2\u0080\u0093 to increase the production, we are a few months away of finishing a new gas plant treatment in El Mangrullo for another 5 million cubic meters of natural gas. So the first question of Lucas Caldi was related to the gas export, but during off peak season as Gustavo mentioned we are having the paperworks ready to have the export permit of 1.5 million cubic meter per day, since October, until May next year on a take or pay basis. But what we are expecting to export during the summer beginning October 1st until the end of April is in firm 1.5 million, hopefully on a \u00e2\u0080\u0093 not on a firm basis, but we expect to export around 0.5 million cubic meters of natural gas per day, so a total of 2 million. As said before on the Frank McGann\u00e2\u0080\u0099s question, by next week winter, we will have the possibility to increase production to 16 million or 17 million cubic meters of natural gas per day. And to export gas to Chile during the winter because of transportation restrictions, during the summer, we can export to Chile, around 9 million cubic meters of natural gas per day from remuneration I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m referring."
