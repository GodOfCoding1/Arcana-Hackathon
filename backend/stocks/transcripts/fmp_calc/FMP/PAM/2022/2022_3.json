    "content": " Revenues increased 11% year-on-year and 7% quarter-on-quarter to $621 million, mainly driven by seasonal gas sales, commodity prices, electricity spot prices and Energ\u00c3\u00ada Plus. The adjusted EBITDA amounted to $246 million, 5% less year-on-year, but similar quarter-on-quarter, basically explained by the same reasons detailed before, plus higher payroll in U.S. terms -- dollar terms. As seen on Slide 4, we posted an EBITDA of $89 million in Q3, down 29% year-on-year and 10% quarter-on-quarter, mainly due to the maturity of these PPAs that we talk about and outages at Loma that we mentioned before, plus higher pesos expenses, offset by better spot energy. However, our gas production in Q3 outperformed by growing 20% year-on-year and 6% quarter-on-quarter, averaging 10.7 million cubic meters per day, and outpacing nationwide growth that only increased by 4%. This figure is 13% up year-on-year and 15% up quarter-on-quarter, explained by the gas performance we mentioned before, and the higher realized oil prices, offset by increased costs related to the growing activity, exports and payroll expenses. However, the lifting costs only increased 22% year-on-year and 8% quarter-on-quarter recording 6.6% -- $6.6 per BOE, evidencing the efficiency of our operations. Back to gas, our average gas price of the quarter was $4.8 per million BTU, 9% up year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter driven by seasonality and export prices. We are through that pipe, we are currently -- Pampa id exporting 1.5 million cubic meters of natural gas per day at an average price slightly above $8. But we envision -- in terms of gas availability, we envision winter similar to 2022 winter because we expect that our most likely scenario that by the end of June, the new pipeline will be available, replaced in what in 2022 has been imported through the LNG ship in Bah\u00c3\u00ada Blanca. Also -- so as I said before, there are not any relevant divestments on the pipeline now after almost 5 years and a lot of sales, including the downstream business, Loma's assets that we sold to  the other 25% of TGS and some others with the sale of Refinor, we managed to divest in all of the assets that we acquired from Petrobras that were not core for Pampa. For example, it's key for our for our intention to grow production in natural gas next year, to have a new fracking equipment available that we want to import because all the sets of -- for fracking there in Argentina are already committed for next year."
