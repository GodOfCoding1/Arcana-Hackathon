    "content": " Gross profit grew 13.2% year-over-year as a result of the shift in customer demand, while net sales grew 3.2% over a previous record revenue performance in the third quarter of 2021. Operating income in Q3 was $31.7 million, an increase of 16.1% or 4.1% of net sales compared to $27.3 million or 3.6% of net sales in the prior year quarter. In our Business Solutions segment, our Q3 net sales of $315.8 million, an increase of 12.2% compared to $281.4 million a year ago. Gross profit in the Business Solutions segment was $63.3 million, an increase of 15.7% from a year ago. Gross margin increased 60 basis points to 20% in the quarter compared to the prior year, primarily due to an increase in demand for software and services recognized as revenue on a net basis. In our Public Sector Solutions business, Q3 net sales were $154.4 million, a decrease of 3.7% compared to $160.2 million a year ago. In our Enterprise Solutions segment, Q3 net sales were $305.5 million, a decrease of 1.4% compared to $309.7 million a year ago. Gross profit for the Enterprise segment was $48.3 million, an increase of 5.7% compared to the prior year quarter. Net income for the quarter was $23.2 million, an increase of 15.8% from $20 million a year ago. Our trailing 12-month adjusted earnings before income taxes, depreciation and amortization or adjusted EBITDA, was $145.5 million compared to $102.4 million a year ago, an increase of 42%. When you say 3% to 5% above the IT industry for 2022, could you help us with what you're thinking of as the IT industry growth rate and maybe even simpler, I think it's going to imply that Q4 revenues might be down year-over-year."
