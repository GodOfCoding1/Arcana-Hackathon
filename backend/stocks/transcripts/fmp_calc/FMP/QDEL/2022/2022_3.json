    "content": " When I look at our financial results for the quarter of this year, the third quarter, the underlying base business grew 6% year-over-year despite industry-wide headwinds and constant currency revenue growth, excluding COVID-related revenue grew 3%, driven by strength in our point of care and transfusion medicine businesses. Point-of-care revenue declined 39% in the quarter but grew 29%, excluding COVID-related revenue, largely driven by pull-through of our broad respiratory menu. Gross profit margin for the quarter was 56.9%, a 540 basis point decrease versus prior year largely due to the decline in COVID-related revenue as well as FX headwinds, partially offset by base business mix. Adjusted EBITDA declined 48% to $226.8 million, largely due to the decline in COVID-related revenue as well as an increase in operating expenses. In light of these dynamics, we are updating supplemental combined fiscal year 2022 guidance as follows: Revenue growth, excluding COVID-related sales narrowed to the high end of the range at 7% to 9% from a prior 6% to 9% on a constant currency basis. We are raising total constant currency revenue growth guidance, which is expected to grow 6% to 8% from a prior 3% to 6% for total revenue of $3.88 billion to $3.96 billion, up from a prior $3.78 billion to $3.91 billion. We expect full year flu-related revenue to be $230 million to $270 million, up from $200 million to $260 million, and this includes $176 million in the first three quarters. Andrew, your line is open. Andrew, your line is open. Maybe just first here, and I'll follow up with Patrick's question around '23, but you've sort of given crumbs over the last handful of months that point to sort of a high single-digit top line growth in '23 and call it EBITDA, $850 million to $900 million in next year."
