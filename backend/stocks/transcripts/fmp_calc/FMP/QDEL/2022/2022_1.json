    "content": " We saw significant sales in our QuickVue At-Home OTC COVID 19 tests and while COVID 19 testing made up the bulk of this heightened demand, it's noteworthy that non-COVID sales grew 56% or almost double that if you exclude the Beckman BNP business, as we saw increased sales of Sofia ABC combination tests for influenza and SARS, as well as increased demand for Sofia influenza tests. We did see a little bit of increase on our COVID revenue inventories but that's obvious since we were in pretty high demand going into the quarter, but overall, I think on average, we're somewhere between three and four weeks of inventory at distribution. So that's the answer on, on that side, I think, and then moving forward, obviously we're, we're you know, we're forecasting and we putting together business development plans around these new and, and I think there's a strong chance that we've identified the things that are important to our customers. Can you give U.S. a sense for how many, how much of the $90 million of cost synergies maybe come from those projects what's fully identified and fully baked versus; hey, we've, identified something, but don't quite have the plan really put together just sort of, where are we in, in, in trying to capture that $90 million right away?"
