    "content": " The quarter free cash flow -- recurring free cash flow that was $169 million of operating cash, less $59 million of CapEx and then you lay on add back, if you will, $25 million of one-time or non-recurring and that gets you to $135 million for the quarter, which is 55% of our adjusted EBITDA and looking forward into the guidance, we expect to be in that same range for 2023, call it, the low end of the range of 50% to 65%, so somewhere in that 55% range makes sense for next year -- for this year I should say."
