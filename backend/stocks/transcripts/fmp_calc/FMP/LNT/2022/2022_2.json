    "content": " Certain key provisions, including tax credit transferability, production tax credit eligibility for solar projects and standalone tax credits for energy storage could provide us even more pathways to bring clean and affordable energy to our customers. When you think about the transferability of tax credits, not only the ones that we may generating from our new solar projects, but from our existing wind projects we see a pretty good opportunity to increase our cash flow over the next several years as a result of those provisions. When you kind of combine that with the fact that we do not think we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be subject to the 15% minimum tax based on our current income levels, we actually think it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to be pretty positive all around when it comes to customers, shareowners and debt holders, so pretty encouraged by the legislation."
