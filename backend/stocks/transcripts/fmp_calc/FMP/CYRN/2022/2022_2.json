    "content": " GAAP revenue for the second quarter of 2022 was $5.8 million, a slight increase from $5.7 million reported during the second quarter of 2021. Excluding this charge, net loss from continuing operations was $5.8 million in Q2 2022 compared to $5.9 million in Q2 2021, an improvement of approximately $100,000. On a non-GAAP basis, Cyren's second quarter 2022 net loss was $4.7 million or a loss of $0.61 per basic and diluted share as compared to a non-GAAP net loss of $4.8 million and $1.28 per share during the second quarter of 2021. Significant changes that negatively impacted the cash include decreases in our deferred revenue balances of approximately $1.6 million during Q2 2022, primarily due to timing difference on a customer billing in which a large customer was billed in Q1 of 2022 versus being normally billed in Q2."
