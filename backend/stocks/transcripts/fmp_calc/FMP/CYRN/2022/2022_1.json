    "content": " Cyren\u2019s Q1 2022 overall revenues declined year-over-year and similar to last quarter, this was primarily due to a contract reduction in our threat detection business from our largest customer, which was effective in Q2 2021 and was previously disclosed in our Q3 of 2020 10-Q. Sales and marketing expense for the quarter was $2.7 million compared to $2.6 million during the first quarter of 2021, representing an increase from 30% of revenue to 37% of revenue in Q1 2022, mainly due to decline in revenue. G&A expense for the quarter was $2.7 million compared to $2.2 million during the first quarter of 2021, representing an increase from 25% of revenue in Q1 2021 to 37% of revenue in Q1, 2022.
