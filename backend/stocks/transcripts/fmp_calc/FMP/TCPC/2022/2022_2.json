    "content": " First, we delivered solid net investment income of $0.37 per share, which exceeded our second quarter dividend of $0.30 per share. And third, as Phil will discuss in more detail, the strength of our underwriting platform continued to drive solid investment opportunities that resulted in a total of $103 million deployed, a total of nine investments during the second quarter. TCPC invested $103 million in the second quarter, primarily in nine investments, including loans to six new portfolio companies and three existing ones. Unfunded loan commitments to portfolio companies at quarter end, equals 8% of total investments or approximately $142 million, of which only $25 million were revolver commitments. Obviously, over the past two quarters, you've easily covered the dividend and with an outlook for rising base rates driving further net investment income acceleration, it would appear that a dividend increase could be supported. This quarter, we did get approximately -- a little over $0.02 of what we would consider non-recurring dividend income from 36th Street which has -- continues to perform very well and just made an incremental distribution this quarter."
