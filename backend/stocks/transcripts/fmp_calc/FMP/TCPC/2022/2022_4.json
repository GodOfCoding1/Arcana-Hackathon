    "content": " In addition to the ongoing monitoring our deal team to perform over investments in their individual portfolios, on a quarterly basis, TCPC's Investment Committee also performs a several review of every company in the portfolio. As an acknowledgment of the higher ongoing earnings power of our portfolio, primarily driven by higher base rates, we announced a $0.02 per share increase in our dividend beginning with the fourth quarter dividend that was paid on December 31. As Raj discussed earlier, unrealized losses were primarily driven by three items; a $21.5 million unrealized loss on our loan to -- and unrealized losses in our investments in Edmentum and Razor Crew of $18.6 million and $6.3 million, respectively, as well as unrealized losses across the portfolio from wider market spreads. Unfunded loan commitments to portfolio companies at quarter-end equaled 8% of total investments or approximately $127 million, of which only $28 million were revolver commitment."
