    "content": " First, we delivered strong net investment income of $0.34 per share, which exceeded our first quarter dividend of $0.30 per share, resulting in a dividend coverage ratio of 113%. TCPC invested $112 million in the first quarter, primarily in 11 investments, including loans to eight new portfolio companies and three existing ones. Unrealized losses during the first quarter, primarily reflected mark-to-market adjustments across the portfolio as a result of wider market spreads during the period, as well as a $3.7 million reversal of previously recognized unrealized gains on our investment in CORE entertainment. Unfunded loan commitments to the portfolio companies at quarter end, equals 7.5% of total investments or approximately $134 million, of which only $29 million were revolver commitments. We believe that our pipeline will continue to allow us to find the right type of deals for this business and strategy, which is focused on credit and also focused on stable well-covered dividend -- this quarter, evidence is I think we've always been open to reviewing kind of more of a risk on situation, just given the platform capability and the team's capability."
