    "content": " Our second quarter overseas business net gross billings reached $7.8 million, representing 46.5% sequential growth. Gross margin for the second quarter was 79.2%, Q2 operating expenses of continuing business were $6.9 million, a 38.3 sequential percent sequential increase from $5.0 million last quarter. Q2 G&A expenses of continued business were $2.6 million, among which $0.5 million were onetime fee related to the divesture of our China Mainland business, excluding this onetime cost, Q2 G&A expenses would have been $2.1 million, G&A expenses for the overseas business were $1.9 million in the first quarter of 2022. Yes, so we believe the overseas market is still in a very early stage and the in the growth the strong growth we see in the past quarter or a few quarters really leveraged our success factors in our existing China markets and we believe the English training market is very different from other education products because the demand for English learning is a common demand for many, many countries and the markets in the world and we see a very strong demand in the overseas market. So basically right out of the gate after only one year, starting our overseas business, we already achieved cash flow breakeven and we do see, we do see the timeline for achieving growth, spinning contribution, positive and GAAP, profitability will be much more accelerated compared to the to the China market."
