    "content": " Though fruit costs were high given extremely constrained supply coming out of Mexico, our price increase cover these higher fruit costs, inflation of other input costs, and modest negative currency effects, leading to a higher gross profit per case compared to both Q1 of this year, and Q2 of last year. As supply normalizes, we fully expect avocado prices in the market to decrease even as we anticipate supply and prices to return to normalized levels, we expect our sourcing initiatives and the breadth of our customers across all distribution channels and all product sizes will allow us to maintain gross margin per case within the historical range of $3 to $4. So, again, we're dealing with a very unique market, extremely high prices, constraints fruit, and yet somehow we managed to service our customers find enough fruit in the market that we could manage to keep our market share the same, by the way, do that while at least temporarily, I would say, doing a hell of a job expanding our gross margin per case. Got it, got it. Got it, got it. I'm excited about the RFG progress, again, we're going to do this kind of one base it at a time and slow and gradual but going from minus 1% to 2% positive gross margin and then having the third month of the quarter be your best month out of the quarter is a really positive sign for our organization."
