    "content": " Additionally, as a sign of continuous improvement, Fresh gross profit also improved by $4.3 million from the fourth quarter of '21 as higher prices more than offset the cost pressures that we've been experiencing. Our gross margin loss widened slightly during the quarter as increased pricing and improved product mix were offset by headwinds from commodity cost inflation, higher labor turnover that led to increased costs and some short-term ramp up cost as our Georgia facility transitioned Florida customers. Please proceed with your question. Please proceed with your question. Please proceed with your question. Please proceed with your question. It's pricing, it's volume growth, it's material efficiency and sourcing strategy, it's labor efficiency and productivity, it's SKU rationalization, it's working with customers to ensure we've got the right product on the shelf for the consumer, all of those things feed into it, but I believe that there is a long-term path for success. Please proceed with your question. So I think you'll have a chance to see some of that in quarter two because, A, we will get some seasonality impact; B, we will have a more stable customer base; and C, I think this has been really encouraging for us in sort of the first 45 days of the second quarter is labor productivity has improved, material costs have improved, we've seen fill rates improve, all of those things obviously help improve your volume line as well."
