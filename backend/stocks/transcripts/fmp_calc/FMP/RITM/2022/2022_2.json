    "content": " So when we look at our company, obviously, we rebranded to Rithm Capital, and I think that reflects our -- where we are today as a company and also the desire to diversify away from more on the single-family residential side. And when we look at the housing market, with mortgage rates higher and housing starting to really slow down, we think we're going to be able to deploy capital at much higher cap rates. When we look at the landscape, we do think we're going to start seeing more pockets of opportunity, not only again in some of the traditional business lines that we've been in, but in other areas such as commercial real estate. As I pointed out a minute ago, we're not just going to manufacture assets to do that because we're in the operating business, we're going to manufacture assets because we think the return on equity for shareholders is something -- is the reason why we want to manufacture assets. And then finally, on Page 19 and 20, the origination and servicing business, I think Baron will talk to this, but when we look at gain on sale, we're starting to see a little bit of what I would call openings for higher gain on sale margins. We will see, I think what you're going to see in the mortgage company business, I don't -- you're going to see people roll over. But I think for now, we're going to be a little bit patient here because we think there's other areas we can make more money by deploying that capital."
