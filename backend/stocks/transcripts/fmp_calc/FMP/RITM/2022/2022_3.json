    "content": " And then as we look at values, one of the questions that we always talk about is can MSR values go up and the answer is they can, our approach to this quarter with wider credit spreads seen everywhere in the fixed income markets, including agency mortgages, we made a conscious decision to be prudent about our increase in our MSR multiple to widen our unlevered yields towards 9%. So on the mortgage origination side or the mortgage company side, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to see some folks, I think, throw in the towel just because a lot of privately held mortgage companies have had a good run \u00e2\u0080\u0093 you will likely see some MSR sales as we go forward. I will say on the capital markets front, when you look at our team, Sanjeev Khanna, for example, who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been with us for a number of years and have been in the business for a number of years, has done a great job opening up new channels of financing with insurance companies and other, what I would call, regional banks. And then as it relates to the volatility going back to book value, we want to have callable capital that we think we could deploy when the world is upside down, which we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re currently in that period when our equity is trading at an extreme discount to book value. I think what you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to see now, and what we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re trying to do is moderate the origination business, stay in it, grow it prudently, and make sure that we are ready for recapture when we come out of this rate environment. If we think there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a better opportunity to deploy a $100 million or $500 million at a 20% or 25% return, and the MSR asset is going to yield on a levered basis 12 or something like that, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll do the 20% to 25% return."
