    "content": " Starting at the bottom left, the originated yield again exceeded 7%, which we expect for the 5th consecutive year in 2022 and Consumer demand for auto remains robust, reflecting the high utility of the auto asset class and driving strong used vehicle values. Turning to corporate finance on Slide 20, core income of $68 million reflected expanding net financing revenue driven by disciplined growth in the portfolio, strong other revenue from investment gains, syndication income and growth in unused commitment fees and stable credit trends. Your line is open. As I mentioned, elevated prepayment activity has created about a 30 basis point drag on retail auto portfolio yields even within the lease business as we\u2019d expect used vehicle values to come down, LBO and DBO should normalize, and that should give us access to more gains just even within lease. So is it reasonable to conclude based on everything that as you explained it, Jen, that 1.4% to 1.6% NCO rate in your outlook for \u201823 to \u201824, is \u2013 it reflects \u2013 and all the other moving parts associated with used vehicle prices, if they were to decline to 2019 levels that you have confidence that the outlook that you laid out contemplates the achievability of the numbers that you\u2019ve laid out, if used vehicle prices were to normalize back to 2019 levels? Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. And as I pointed out earlier, while there is a lot of headlines around used vehicle pricing coming down, continuing to see offsets to that, whether it\u2019s the LBO or DBO dynamics, whether that\u2019s increase in inventory that we will see in the floor plan book or even continued origination unit opportunities that we would expect it to grow from here if used vehicle values come down. Your line is open."
