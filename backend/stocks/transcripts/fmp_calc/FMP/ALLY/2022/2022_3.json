    "content": " Earning asset yield of 5.59% grew 48 basis points quarter-over-quarter and 91 basis points year-over-year, reflecting the benefits of strong originated yields within retail auto, growth in higher yielding assets and more than $40 billion of floating rate exposure across the loan and hedging portfolios. We expect continued yield expansion due to the gradual decline in prepayment headwinds, which we started to see in recent months, continued expansion in originated yield above 9%, and our hedging position, which added 25 basis points to the retail portfolio yield this quarter. On slide 13, consolidated coverage increased 3 basis points to 2.71%, reflecting growth in our retail auto, unsecured consumer lending and corporate finance portfolios. We see $2 billion to $3 billion of loan growth expected in the fourth quarter across our consumer and corporate finance portfolios, so reserves will increase as we grow the balance sheet. But I would say, as we're having these conversations with our auto business leader and the team, I think we're probably closer to not necessarily a peak, but you're closer to a saturation point where you may see demand start to slow a bit where consumers just don't want to see rates in excess of, call it, 10%."
