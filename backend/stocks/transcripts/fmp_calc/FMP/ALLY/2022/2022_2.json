    "content": " Within auto, consumer originations of $13.3 billion represented our highest quarterly flows since 2006 and originated yields expanded 75 basis points quarter-over-quarter to 7.8%. Turning to Ally Bank, retail deposit customers exceeded $2.5 million expanding 6% year-over-year and representing our 53rd consecutive quarter of customer growth. While retail balances declined nearly $5 billion in the quarter, they were up year-over-year and total deposits of $140 billion account for roughly 85% of our funding profile. On Slide 13, consolidated coverage increased 5 basis points to 2.68%, reflecting growth in our retail auto, unsecured consumer lending and corporate finance portfolios. Turning to Corporate Finance on Slide 20, core income of $60 million reflected disciplined growth in the loan portfolio, a year-over-year decline in other revenue from elevated investment gains in the prior period and stable credit trends. Your line is open. I mean, look, we had incredibly robust retail auto originations this quarter, the highest level that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve had since 2006 and the vast majority of the increase in our reserving this quarter is a result of loan growth and its accretive loan growth, serving our customers, positioning us well to drive accretive returns over time to generate that 16% to 18% plus percent ROTC that we guide to. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open."
