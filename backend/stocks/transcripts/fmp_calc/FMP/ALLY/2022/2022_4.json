    "content": " Earning asset yield of 6.24% grew 65 basis points quarter-over-quarter and 149 basis points year-over-year reflecting the continuation of trends we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve highlighted previously, including strong originated yields within retail auto, growth in higher-yielding assets, and more than $40 billion of floating rate exposures across the loan and hedging portfolios. Based on what we know today, we see adjusted EPS of approximately $4 in 2023, the main drivers of which include NIM of 3.5%, which we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve covered previously, other revenue expanding to roughly $500 million per quarter, modest earning asset growth, mid-single-digit expense growth, retail auto net charge-offs of 1.6% to 1.8% and consolidated net charge-offs of 1.2% to 1.4%, and finally, a tax rate in the 21% to 22% range, slightly favorable versus our historic average given ongoing tax planning strategies."
