    "content": " We wrote $17 billion of new insurance written in the quarter in a slowing housing market, while the persistency of our portfolio increased to 80%. New insurance written was $17 billion for the quarter, down sequentially from $19 billion in the first quarter and down from $27 billion in the second quarter of 2021 driven by lower originations given the recent increase in interest rates. Given the rise in interest rates throughout the second quarter, we would expect persistency to improve prospectively, which is a positive for the embedded value of our in-force insurance portfolio of which 87% is comprised of monthly policies. The sequential increase in net earned premiums was primarily driven by growth of our insurance in-force and the sequential improvement in base rate, partially offset by the lapsing of older higher price policies as compared to our new insurance written, lower single premium cancellations of $8 million in the current quarter and higher seated premiums in the current quarter of $20 million from the expanded use of our credit risk transfer program."
