    "content": " Sales were driven down primarily due to three factors: higher inventory levels held by our customers and our non-OEM channels, with a few exceptions, driving lower order volume during the period; OEM production was suppressed within the quarter due to supply chain issues; OEM volumes began to improve towards the end of the quarter, however, our production throughput was limited by component availability. Net sales were down $40.9 million as compared to quarter two, with the volume impact being approximately $57 million, partially offset with the impact of pricing recoveries. Specifically, net sales in our aftermarket sales channel, traditionally our highest margin channel, dropped approximately $25.8 million from the same period in Q2 2021. Consolidated net sales for the second quarter of 2022 were $181.2 million, a decrease of $40.9 million or 18.4% comparing to the second quarter of 2021. Net sales in the Americas were $110.9 million, $17.5 million or 13.6% lower than the second quarter of 2021. Net sales was $70.3 million, a decrease of $23.4 million or 25% from the second quarter of 2021. Total trade working capital was $106.2 million in the second quarter of 2022, which represented a decrease of $2.6 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2021, an increase of $5.2 million comparing to the second quarter of 2021. Excluding convertible notes paid off on July 1, 2022, our gross debt increased approximately $14 million from the end of the fourth quarter of 2022, which was primarily due to increased ABL borrowings. Performance was driven by many factors, but for the most part, volume and mix of sales realized, we retained a strong order book as we closed the quarter at over $50 million in the Americas."
