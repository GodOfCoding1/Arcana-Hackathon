    "content": " Our net sales and adjusted EBITDA are down $47.5 million and $18.9 million, respectively, from Q3 2021. Total costs have been flexed down 14% from manufacturing overhead perspective, a $31 million reduction in North America purchases in Q3 2022 versus Q3 2021, furlough actions in various geographies to align our workforce with market demand. Consolidated net sales for the third quarter of 2022 were $149 million, a decrease of $47.5 million or 24.2% compared to the third quarter of 2021. The decrease in net sales was driven by lower sales volumes in the aftermarket, e-commerce and retail sales channels with certain customers using their existing inventory to satisfy consumer demand, coupled with material availability constraints. The decrease was driven by lower sales volumes as well as a significant mix shift from higher sales margin channels to lower margin sales channels, coupled with a continuation of elevated material supply chain and other manufacturing input costs. Net sales were $69.8 million, a decrease of $10.9 million or 13.6% from the third quarter of 2021. Total trade working capital was $99.9 million in the third quarter of 2022, which represented a decrease of $8.9 million comparing to the fourth quarter of 2021 and a decrease of $9.6 million compared to the third quarter of 2021."
