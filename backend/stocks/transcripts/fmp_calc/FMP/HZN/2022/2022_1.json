    "content": " Gross profit and adjusted EBITDA were negatively impacted by delayed or missed sales due to the aftermarket seasonal shift, OEM production volumes, critical component shortages, which delayed timing for completion of roughly $20 million in booked orders and the lag in pricing recognition described earlier. Inventory growth in the Americas of $41.7 million compared to quarter 1, 2021 was driven primarily by $28 million of increased material costs and retime to lost sales due to supply chain constraints and/or customer interruptions. Net sales increased from Q1 2019 by approximately $3.2 million or 1.8%, while the comparison to Q1 2021 reflected a decline of $18.3 million or negative 9.2%. While we are down from the peak disruption levels today, these customer interruptions negatively impacted our Q1 2022 performance in net sales by approximately $9 million and an adjusted EBITDA by approximately $3 million. Consolidated net sales for the first quarter of 2022 were $180.9 million, a decrease of $18.3 million or 9.2% compared to the first quarter of 2021. Gross profit margin decreased to 11.2% compared to the first quarter of 2021, primarily driven by the lower sales volumes, increased input cost and the timing of price recoveries described above. Net sales in the Americas were $101.9 million, $7.9 million or 7.2% lower than the first quarter of 2021. Net sales were $78.9 million, a decrease of $10.5 million or 11.7% in the first quarter of 2021. Trade working capital was $111.2 million in the first quarter of 2022, which represented an increase of $2.4 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2021 and an increase of $29.4 million compared to the first quarter of 2021. Specifically, receivables increased $14.9 million to $95.6 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2021. Inventory increased $16 million to $178.8 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2021 driven by the unfavorable material costs, supply constraints on critical components and a return to seasonal ordering patterns."
