    "content": " Looking forward, our 2023 business plan is designed to capture capital efficiencies through larger scale projects, and we expect to deliver solid returns and help offset industry-wide inflation, ultimately creating value for our shareholders through reinvestment in our high-quality inventory. In terms of wedge production from new drilling activity, which is the production that is incremental to establish base production, we expect to benefit from the relatively consistent return profiles of new co-development projects as discussed earlier, improved project cycle times from the ongoing use of simultaneous operations and optimization of project sizes over time and leveraging of past facilities investments as we return to previously developed areas. Just to be clear, even when we reach $1 billion in debt and commenced capital return initiatives, debt reduction will continue to be a key priority for our free cash flow deployment with an eye towards achieving less than $1.5 billion of gross debt and a leverage ratio of less than 1x. A solid plan to obtain our $2 billion debt milestone and commenced the return of capital to shareholders later this year that will complement further debt reduction and the successful integration of ESG initiatives and targets across the business, which tied to compensation to incentivize right behaviors. And as much as we're trying to provide a 5-year outlook, I think the key point to take away from that is that capital efficiency profile, which really highlights the ongoing efficiencies within our inventory program that are relatively consistent over time that we don't see any periods. But if you look at that capital efficiency, it gives us a lot of flexibility through ups and downs and tweaking the program to continue to deliver free cash flow, and that's going to be used for debt reduction and returns of capital."
