    "content": " Strong oil and natural gas price realizations experienced during the quarter, combined with cost structure improvements resulted in the second consecutive increase in quarterly operating margins, driving a leading operating margin exceeding $58 per BOE in the first quarter. Switching to the capital program, our disciplined reinvestment rate of just over 45% drove another quarterly increase in free cash flow, while also setting us up for efficient production growth in the second half of the year."
