    "content": " Operationally, this was a transitional quarter for us, as we ramped up our completion activity and placed 33 gross wells on production, almost double the first quarter, as we started developing our DUC backlog at an increased pace early in the quarter. First, we set up our workover activity, as we accelerated the implementation of Callon's artificial lift program in the Delaware Basin, particularly in the Delaware South area, as we experienced higher levels of well downtime from power disruptions and typical equipment failures that occur after useful life is reached. While our second completions crew began operations late in the first quarter due to a crew moving from the Delaware over to the Eagle Ford, we really didn't hit our strides until the start of the second quarter and over the three-month period the number of completed wells increased by 75% versus our activity in the first quarter. During the second quarter, Callon generated adjusted free cash flow of approximately $126 million, which brings us to over $300 million of adjusted free cash flow for the first half of the year. Callon currently trades at a 2023 consensus free cash flow yield of approximately 30%, a price earnings ratio of 2.3 times and our enterprise valuation is over $1 billion below the June 30 PV-10 of just our crude developed producing reserves using last month -- 12-month pricing and current operating costs under SEC methodologies."
