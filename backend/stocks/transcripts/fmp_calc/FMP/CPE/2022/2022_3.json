    "content": " At a bigger picture level, our commitment to a life of field development philosophy of our multi-zone resource base, paired with continuous improvements in drilling and completion designs, has resulted in year-over-year improvements in Callon's well performance at a time when concerns around inventory degradation are increasingly becoming a focal point of the industry. We highlighted an approximate 20% improvement in Delaware productivity versus 2021 during our second quarter earnings call, which has continued to increase into this quarter and have delivered a similar level of improvement with this year's Midland Basin activity as seen on pages six and seven of the presentation. Additionally, we realized a reduction in our per unit lease operating expense, which contributed to another increase in our adjusted EBITDA per BOE and an 18% sequential increase in free cash flow generation, despite lower benchmark oil and NGL pricing relative to the second quarter."
