    "content": " For the first half of 2022, we insured $1.6 billion of par sold through 79 primary and secondary market policies on bonds rated in the AA category by S&P or Moody\u00e2\u0080\u0099s or both. This included $1.1 billion of par on 52 deals sold in the second quarter, of which approximately $300 million was insured in the secondary market. International Public Finance produced $30 million of PVP during the first half of 2022, including $18 million in the second quarter. On the asset management side of our business, during the second quarter, we increased assets under management by approximately $950 million to $17.9 billion, of which 96% is now fee earnings. In the second quarter of 2022, adjusted operating income was $30 million or $0.46 per share compared with $120 million or $1.59 per share in the second quarter of 2021. The largest drivers of the quarter-over-quarter variance are mark-to-market movements on alternative investments, which had a $27 million after-tax loss in the second quarter of 2022 versus a $38 million after-tax gain in the second quarter of last year. And the trading portfolio, which consists of Puerto Rico contingent value instruments, and \u00e2\u0080\u0093 that experienced a $15 million loss in the second quarter of 2022. Both of these mark-to-market adjustments, which account for $80 million of the variance are reflected in the insurance segment, which had adjusted operating income of $55 million in the second quarter of 2022 compared with $152 million in the prior year. Economic development on our BIG insured portfolio was a benefit of $32 million, primarily consisting of a $39 million benefit in U.S. RMBS including \u00e2\u0080\u0093 included in total economic development is the effect of increasing discount rates, which was a benefit of $42 million in the second quarter of 2022 across all sectors. Net investment income was $66 million in the second quarter of 2022 compared with $71 million in the second quarter of 2021, primarily due to lower average balances. With respect to our capital management objectives, we repurchased 2.6 million shares for $151 million in the second quarter of 2022."
