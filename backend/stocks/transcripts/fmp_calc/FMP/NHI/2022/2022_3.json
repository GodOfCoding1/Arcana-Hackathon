    "content": " Since we announced our optimization plans in the second quarter of 2021, we have completed the sale of 32 senior housing properties for net proceeds of $296 million and had a cash NOI yield of just 2.7% and EBITDARM coverage of only 0.47 times. We're seeing the positive impact of the dispositions on our senior housing coverage ratios, trailing 12 EBITDARM coverage for the senior housing portfolio, again showed improvement and has increased from 0.98 times to 1.14 times over the last two reported periods. While the Bickford enterprise copes with the current industry operating challenges, NHI has worked diligently to better position our lease portfolio through strategic asset sales and rent restructuring, which has improved the pro forma EBITDARM coverage to 1.32 times. But you're talking about margins at low levels and that's rebounding, maybe pushing rents a little bit harder when you -- but I was wondering how you see the next few quarters progress just given the continued expense pressure and the recent decline in occupancy levels."
