    "content": " As expected, fourth quarter FAD declined from the third quarter, primarily from lower collections from two need-driven tenants, which have now been placed on cash basis accounting and a third tenant whose lease we restructured during the quarter. For the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2022, our FAD was $44.7 million and $201 million, respectively. When we reiterated our guidance during the third quarter earnings call, we were confident in our FAD guidance, but we also knew our continuing portfolio optimization efforts were likely to result in further fourth quarter impairments, write-offs and reserves. Fourth quarter net operating income for our SHOP segment was a disappointing $1.9 million, down from $2.8 million in the third quarter. As Eric mentioned, for the fourth quarter, plus the recently announced 2023 acquisitions, we have closed over $114 million in investments at an average initial first year yield of 7.6%. During the fourth quarter, we did not purchase any of our stock and ended the year with $88 million in available share buyback authorization under our 2022 share repurchase program, which was set to expire in April of this year. Overall, fourth quarter collections of contractual cash due was strong at 98.1% with deferrals of $1.2 million, which compares to 97.9% and $1.4 million in the third quarter. SLC, our largest tenant, had EBITDARM coverage of 1.22x, SLC's occupancy improved throughout the fourth quarter and again into January at 84%, up 230 basis points year-over-year."
