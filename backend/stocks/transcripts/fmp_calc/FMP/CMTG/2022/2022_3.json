We think we're well positioned going forward with liquidity, the ability to increase our leverage, the ability to buy back stock and great access to deal flow and the ability to work through issues as we've been able to demonstrate in our portfolio, and we'll expect that we'll have a bit more of that to do as we continue to go through this fairly disruptive dislocated market over the next probably year plus."
