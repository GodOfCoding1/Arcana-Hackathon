    "content": " I think that's absolutely right, it's probably going to be, let's say it's between 5% and 15% on those types of assets, to me, and it's very hard to be an equity investor today, given all these dynamics, but given the equity subordination that we have in our loans, and given that spreads are widening, I really like where we're sitting as a transitional lender, much better than I like, equity investment right now, equity investing in broad brush very, very hard, because of the dynamics, but with the equity subordination that we have, I think the risk adjusted returns in transitional lending right now look really, really strong to me, relative to equity, given all this interest rate, risk and the risk of recession that's out there as well."
