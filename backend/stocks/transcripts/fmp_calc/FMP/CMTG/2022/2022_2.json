    "content": " Amidst this positive environment for transitional real estate lending, it is important to acknowledge that rising benchmark rates and widening credit spreads are creating uncertainty surrounding equity valuations which we believe need to adjust downward for any asset with medium- to long-term leases with modest and no rent escalations or lying outside quickly inflating rental markets. Our recent $150 million bridge acquisition facility closing amid the capital markets turmoil, demonstrates our ability to access incremental capital during a period of stress and speaks to the strength of CMTG's credit quality and our capital markets team. The quarter-over-quarter increase in distributable earnings was primarily due to, one, $0.21 per share gain resulting from the resolution of the nonaccrual land loan; and two, improved operating performance of our New York City REL hotel portfolio that contributed $0.03 per share to distributable earnings compared to a loss of $0.03 per share last quarter. So that's not all ROE but certainly, we're seeing ROE growth or net interest income on those underlying assets that is accretive to our position and accretive to the portfolio in the long term but we're definitely having to work harder on the liability side of the balance sheet to make sure that we're putting together the optimal capital stack. And I think we are in an environment where we can be in growth mode and also reducing our risk in terms of the amount of cash flow assets that we're lending to and diversifying our portfolio, particularly by lending to multifamily in high-growth markets at cap rates where we don't need much rent growth at all and these are assets that follow our mantra."
