    "content": " Global Humira sales were approximately $5.4 billion, up 6.8% on an operational basis with 9.6% growth in the U.S., partially offset by international performance where revenues were down 7.3% operationally due to biosimilar competition. And so, those are some of the factors we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re thinking about when we think about the deceleration of the filler market in Q2 but while the market has slowed and despite the performance in Q2, we do continue to expect a positive second half growth for U.S. Juvederm, really weighted more in the fourth quarter as we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to launch two new fillers in the fourth quarter."
