    "content": " While our U.S. aesthetics market share remains stable across both toxins and fillers, we now believe it's prudent to adjust our full year aesthetics forecast to reflect the moderating market growth over the near to medium term, which is expected to predominantly impact Juvederm as well as our body contouring portfolio products, which represent higher price points for consumers. We remain very excited about the long-term potential for Skyrizi and Rinvoq which are already having a significant impact on AbbVie's growth and performance, contributing approximately $2.1 billion in combined sales this quarter, representing nearly 15% of total company net revenues. Turning now to Rinvoq, which delivered global sales of $695 million, demonstrating more than 17% sequential growth, we continue to see positive momentum in RA, with total market share increasing to more than 6% in both the U.S. and across key international geographies. Global Humira sales were approximately $5.6 billion, up 3.9% on an operational basis with 7.4% growth in the U.S., partially offset by international performance where revenues were down 16.8% operationally due to biosimilar competition. Operator, next question please. Operator, next question please. Operator, next question please. Operator, next question please. Operator, next question please. And that seems straightforward, but we see the market moving very, very fast there in terms of understanding and that's what we can deliver, whether it's the Skyrizi data on the endoscopic healing rates with a very, very convenient and strong safety profile, or similar on the Rinvoq side in second line in the U.S. second line for patients that aren't doing well in UC. Operator, next question please? Operator, next question please? Operator, next question please?"
