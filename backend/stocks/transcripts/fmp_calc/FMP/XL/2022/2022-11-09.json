    "content": " Spruce Power was strategically positioned as the largest privately held operator of residential solar in the U.S. And with our acquisition of the business, Spruce, now well capitalized has the resources it needs to elevate the company's mission to the next level. Taken together, our roughly 51,000 customers, combined with multiyear commitments, make monthly payments to Spruce Power reflect total subscriber value of $821 million. Prior to the acquisition by XL Fleet, Spruce Power was the largest privately held owner and operator of residential rooftop solar systems in the U.S. And since I became CEO in 2018, Spruce is focused on our current strategy of owning and operating residential solar assets on behalf of homeowners. SG&A expenses for the third quarter of 2022 included approximately $2.6 million in legal fees related to the previously disclosed class action complaints and SEC investigation, and approximately $50 million of transaction costs associated with the Spruce acquisition. Turning into our segment results, revenue from Spruce Power, a residential solar segment totaled $5.1 million, reflecting the period from September 9th through September 30th."
