    "content": " Our compression sales business experienced a good quarter with sales revenue up almost $1.8 million over the fourth quarter of 2021, with adjusted gross margins of 31% during the quarter. This is a $1.9 million or 11% increase from the same quarter in 2021, as a result of a $1.8 million increase in rental revenues with $180,000 or 7% increase in sales. Sequentially, adjusted gross margin for the first quarter of 2022 increased to $8.9 million from $4.3 million in the prior quarter. Sequentially, operating income increased to $382,000 in the first quarter of 2022 from an operating loss of $8.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2021. This compares to a net loss of $394,000 in last year's first quarter and a net loss of $5.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2021. Adjusted EBITDA also increased approximately $4.5 million sequentially from $2.3 million last quarter to $6.8 million in this quarter, primarily due to lower costs and improved margins. Compressor-only sales margins were $621,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2022, compared to a loss of $136,000 for the same period a year ago and a loss of $1 million last quarter. Rental revenue in the first quarter of 2022 was $17.1 million compared to $15.3 million in the first quarter of 2021, an increase of 12% year-over-year. For the sequential quarters, rental revenue grew $17.1 million from $16.5 million last quarter, an increase of 4%. Rental adjusted gross margins this quarter were 46%, a 3% or $285,000 decrease from the 53% gross margin we saw year-over-year, a significant $3 million increase from the 30% gross margin last quarter. Our capital expense for new gas compressor rental fleet units in the first quarter, which does not include work in progress, was approximately $8.1 million. And as I mentioned, as I committed to the last quarter's call, we intend to be at gross margin on the rental side by the end of the year, we're at 46% now."
