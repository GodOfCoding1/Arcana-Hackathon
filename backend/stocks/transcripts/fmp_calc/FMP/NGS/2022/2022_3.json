    "content": " Rental revenue increased 15%, $18.6 million from $16.2 million in the third quarter last year and 3% over the second quarter's rental revenue of 3.1 million. Sequentially, total revenue increased 4.1% to 20.7 million in the third quarter of 2022 compared to 19.9 million in the second quarter of 2022 primarily due to a $0.5 million increase in sales revenues, and a $0.5 million increase in rental revenues partially offset by a $200,000 decrease in service and maintenance revenues. And yes we're -- as I mentioned we're talking to others about additional liquidity and things like that but the issue you get in and we start moving into 1500 horsepower you and so medium horsepower you run into equipment that runs brand new maybe $250,000, $300,000 you move into the 1500 horse realm and you get stuck that's $1.5 million to $2 million. Start moving into 2500 horsepower and you get $2.5 million to $3 million so the magnitude of the expenditures grows even though the number of equipment that so yes we're going to have to, and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what we're doing and Micah is leading the charge on that. We've been very protective of the balance sheet, waiting for the right opportunity and the market that we're seeing today with the wide gap between supply and demand, the rights we can secure with this new large horsepower additions are very accretive and something that we don't -- it doesn't bother us to take on leverage in this kind of operating environment, it's just the rights that you can get and the returns you can achieve on those investments it is too good to pass up."
