    "content": " Total revenue for the three months ended December 31, 2022, increased to $22.5 million from $22 million for the three months ended September 30, 2022, or a 2% increase. Total revenues increased year-over-year from $18 million for the three months ended December 31, 2021, for a 25% increase. Rental revenue increased 10.4% from $18.6 million in the three months ending September 30, 2022, compared to $20.6 million in the three months ending December 31, 2022. As noted in our earnings release, adjusted gross rental margin increased sequentially from $8.6 million or 46% of revenue in Q3 2022 and to $11.3 million or 55% of revenue in the fourth quarter of 2022. On a year-over-year basis, our adjusted rental gross margin of $11.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2022, more than doubled when compared to $4.9 million in the same period in 2021. On a year-over-year quarterly basis, our net loss for the three months ended December 31, 2022, was $757,000 or $0.06 per basic diluted share compared to a net loss of $5.6 million or $0.42 per basic and diluted share for the three months ended December 31, 2021. For Q4 2022, adjusted EBITDA was essentially flat at $7.8 million when compared to the prior quarter, but increased significantly from $2.3 million for the same period in 2021. I will note that SG&A expenses in the fourth quarter of 2022 were approximately $4.8 million, a $2 million increase from the year ago period and an increase of approximately $700,000 in the third quarter of 2022. The CapEx numbers are surprisingly large, $30 million in the most recent quarter, sounds like you'd probably do something around another $30 million in the first quarter and $95 million for the coming year. That will put our -- well, I just went through puts our debt balance of $120 million at the end of the year, I'm assuming no interim paydown or anything. If I look at 2022, it's $13.6 million, which is an increase of $2.9 million versus last year. And as it relates to that, if you're spending $150 million of CapEx between 2022 and 2023, and I'm using round numbers, and I know you're hesitant to give guidance, which I totally appreciate."
