    "content": " Having been the CFO for the last several months, I certainly understand both the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead for the company, which is no doubt help me get a head start on the work we need to do in order to unlock the value that I believe this company has the ability to deliver on. We're committed to and focused on delivering innovative products and solutions that our customers want, while driving the growth and profitability our shareholders expect. This is the second quarter we're reporting on our new revenue solution groups, and as a reminder, our focus is on measuring content and ads and enabling the planning and activation of media in a privacy forward way across all screens. This quarter, we reported revenue growth of 4% to $91.4 million and a near 150% increase in adjusted EBITDA to $6.5 million. We're also tightening our guidance, calling for 5% to 7% revenue growth, coupled with an increase in our full year adjusted EBITDA margin that we now see exceeding 9% on the year. I wanted to take some time to provide everyone with the sense for how I think about the business, the opportunities we have, and where we're going to be focused as an organization. We've got a strong foundation built on a diversified business, with over 1/3 of our revenue coming from growing local and national television business lines. Nearly 60% in digital, rounded out by almost 10% from our leading movies business. Our client base is also diverse, with almost half of our business coming from media companies, 1/3 from agencies and advertisers and nearly 10% from both local TV and movie customers. Finally, as I just highlighted, we've got a strong, long-standing relationship with industry-leading clients and well established -- and we're a well-established trusted brand. Perhaps our biggest strength is that we have one of the most complete data sets in the industry, just more than 50 billion events per day across digital, linear TV, on-demand, connected TV and theatrical, all coupled with advanced audience insights. In linear TV, we measure more than 1 in 3 households on more than 75 million screens via our MVPD partnerships, supplemented by 13 million smart TV screens. Additionally, our digital census-based data collection measures content in a privacy-forward manner across more than 200 million mobile devices, 150 million desktop screens and more than 50 million connected TVs via a combination of tagged content and direct integrations with publishers. Our census level TV and digital data is augmented by an opt-in panel with more than 600,000 global active participants, adding additional context and details for the audience that we measure. It's that combination of TV, advertising, digital data that positions us incredibly well as we think about solving cross-platform measurement. In summary here, across the roughly 120 million house -- video households in the U.S., we've built a data set and methodologies that capture viewing from multiple scaled sources, and that is a massive differentiator from others in the measurement space. But I've also heard what isn't working, and what it is they need us to be focused on. We're not fast enough -- we haven't been fast enough to innovate, we haven't been fast enough to deliver the data that our clients need in order to own their businesses effectively. And one of the first tangible results of this initiative will be our move to deliver preliminary data in comScore TV within 48 hours, which we plan to have in market by early Q4 of this year. Second, I've also heard that we have complex solutions, complex deliveries, and we can be hard to work with sometimes. One of the ways we're going to address this is by having an increased focus on execution on what we do and don't do, and on making sure that we're executing in a way that doesn't just produce the right data, but also produces it in a way that's easier for our clients to work with. We've got some amazing products, but we need to make sure they're more accessible. I'm committed to pursuing scalable growth that expands our margins and increases our free cash flow, providing value to shareholders and enabling the development of the pathbreaking solutions that our clients tell us they want and expect from us. In terms of our opportunity, one of the things that I've heard consistently is that we've got a compelling offering in multiple measurement, and it's a place we should be winning. Simply put, our national measurement numbers are the sum of all of our local markets, unifying 2 of the largest silos of programming and ad inventory, which nobody else in the market has done. There's somewhere around $24 billion in local advertising spend right now, and the market has been comfortable with roughly 2% to 3% of that ad spend going towards measurement. As I mentioned a minute ago, we're addressing speed of data delivery in early Q4 when we plan to release 48-hour preliminary data in the market. And third, we're working on expanding our partnership with the sell side, adding a greater share of station groups as  clients. Finally, our path to growth in local measurement is going to require us to focus on embedding ourselves more deeply in our clients' existing workflows, adding things like advanced audiences for local advertising, which requires a thoughtful approach to make sure that buying on those advanced audiences is as easy as possible. Moving on, obviously, the biggest battleground in the space today is around solving cross-platform measurement. When we talk about cross-platform, we're talking about following and measuring content and ads wherever they're distributed, linear, both local and national, ad supported on-demand and subscription on demand. When it comes to measuring content across these means of distribution, comScore has one of the most complete data sets, again, measuring 75-plus million screens, 30 million smart TVs, more than 600,000 panelists, coupled with tagged content and direct publisher integrations across hundreds of millions of mobile devices, desktops and CTVs. More importantly, we know that each type of data has unique attributes, positive and negative, that must be accounted for when combining these data sets to produce accurate, reliable and stable measurement. If anything, I've heard some frustrations from clients that we haven't delivered fully on their demands for cross-platform measurement given the assets we have. We have a data advantage, the market has been waiting for us to deliver, and we're going to make sure we do just that. As an example of recent progress, we're revamping our comScore Campaign Ratings, or our CCR product, to start delivering on cross-platform ad measurement today. CCR is our cross-platform ad measurement product, that provides deduplicated person-level reach and frequency for ads wherever their viewed across linear, CTV, desktop and mobile, including walled gardens. In June, comScore and Google released insights from the 6-month 20-plus campaign study run exclusively on CCR to highlight findings of the overlaps of linear and CTV for the largest ad-supported CTV platform. We're encouraged by the results and what they mean for our clients and industry in moving towards reliable, independent cross-platform measurement. Having a campaign measurement solution, combined with the depth of our linear TV data, both set-top-box and connected TVs, provides one of the most powerful solutions in the space. As I just covered a minute ago, the data and integrations that underpin our digital product are also essential to our ability to deliver the cross-platform measurement that our clients are asking for. One of the first steps we're taking is combining our social platform packed with real-time insights from Meta, TikTok, YouTube and Instagram with our Media Metrix products. We're intent on doing that again as we help the industry build a bridge to the third party cookie-less future, whenever that become a reality. Lastly, we're working hard to drive product synergies, create products that are simpler and bring together the data sets that our clients tell us are most important. Moving on, as many of you've heard me say before, it's critical that we drive greater profitability as we deliver on the opportunities I've been highlighting. To do this, we're committed to transforming how we operate in order to increase our margins and bring added value to shareholders, employees and customers. We believe that by better aligning how we work to our strengths and what our clients demand of us, along with other steps to optimize our business, that we're well on our way to delivering on our 15% adjusted EBITDA margin goal in 2022. First, culturally, we're going to be obsessed with our customers and what they need. We're going to be disciplined in our innovation, making sure that we're innovating in the areas that will yield the biggest impact for our clients. Second, when it comes to execution, we'll be laser-focused on investing our time, money and resources into expanding as a local currency, delivering on cross-platform and maintaining our market-leading position in movies. And third, while no company cuts their way to growth, we know we've got work to do to optimize how our capital is put to work. We're taking measured steps to hone our focus or our top line growth scale profitably, and we've set aggressive goals to improve our adjusted EBITDA margin so we can hit our goal of 15% in 2023. When we look at revenue growth by solution growth, cross-platform solutions grew 13% from $35.2 million in the second quarter last year to $39.8 million this year. We also saw continued growth in our movies business, which was up 12% from $7.5 million in the second quarter last year to $8.4 million this year as the business continued to rebound following the pandemic. Given the uncertainty in today's economy and the unknown impact inflationary pressures may have on ad spend in the short term, we're updating our full year revenue guidance to reflect a growth rate of 5% to 7% over 2021. We expect our growth rate to continue to be driven by double-digit growth in cross-platform solutions, with digital ad solutions remaining nearly flat compared to the prior year. However, as Jon mentioned, we're putting the wheels in motion to become more fiscally disciplined, which we believe will allow us to achieve an adjusted EBITDA margin in excess of 9%, an improvement over the prior year. Well there's so much work to be done, I'm excited and energized about the opportunity that we've got ahead. And what I mean by that is, when you talk about things like investing to -- for speed in terms of getting data and solutions faster to customers, decreasing the complexity of your solutions, it seems like you would want to increase investment spend. I think what I will say is, as an organization, we have the opportunity to be a little bit more disciplined and focused on what parts of the ecosystem we continue to serve. And I think what you heard in my comments, our priorities are going to be around cross-platform measurement. It just seems like there's been a lot of positive announcements, but we really haven't seen the needle move at this point. We feel pretty good about, I think, what you're seeing and if you kind of unpack the growth a little bit, Surinder, I would look at cross platform as an area where we're growing double digit. But in terms of the near term, the growth rate on that business is likely, as Mary Margaret highlighted, to kind of be more flattish than anything. And we'll leverage the asset to really roll out our cross-platform solutioning, which, again, where -- is where we see the accelerated double-digit growth that we talked about in the narrative. Yes, I think that -- just to take the last part of that, that's certainly a tailwind in the second half of the year in terms of the accelerated ad spend. I think from a digital standpoint, what you saw in the guide overall is some -- I would say, some thinking around the uncertainty in the ad market for the second half of the year. And so I think what you see in the guide, at least on our digital ad business, is some pullback in our expectations around the growth rate on that side of the business. I think that the feedback that we've heard from our core media clients has been that the upfront went the way of the traditional, meaning that they didn't move to new currencies as fast as the marketplace would like. Yes, I think what you heard in the narrative is we're going to be focused on our opportunity in winning currency and local. Cross platform, as I said, again, in the narrative, there's no company in my mind that's more uniquely positioned to solve that problem for the marketplace than comScore. And then as I mentioned in my comments, the financial profile of the company will be improved as a result of, obviously, that growth coupled with more disciplined approach on the bottom line."
