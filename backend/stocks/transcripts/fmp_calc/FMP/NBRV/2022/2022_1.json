    "content": " We reported total revenues of $8 million in the first quarter of 2022, consisting primarily of net sales of SIVEXTRO, with double-digit demand growth versus the first quarter of 2021, which Ted highlighted earlier. Our operating expenses remained generally flat in the first quarter of 2022, which when coupled with the top line growth driven by SIVEXTRO continues to unlock operating leverage and provided significant improvement in our operating cash burn in the first quarter of 2022 compared to the prior year. Total revenues increased by $5.5 million year-over-year, driven by the increased prescription demand of SIVEXTRO and the change in the accounting of the SIVEXTRO agreement from collaboration revenue in the first quarter of 2021, to fully recording net sales in our P&L beginning in the second quarter of 2021. As you\u2019ll recall, the first quarter of 2021 was the last one where Nabriva recognized a percentage of SIVEXTRO\u2019s performance, as a collaboration revenue. With the launch of our NDC in the second quarter of 2021, Nabriva pivoted towards recognizing 100% of SIVEXTRO\u2019s performance as net sales in our P&L."
