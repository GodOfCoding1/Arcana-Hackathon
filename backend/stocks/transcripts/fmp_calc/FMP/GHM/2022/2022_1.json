    "content": " And the Barber-Nichols business, if you think about the direction that we provided on the Barber-Nichols call on June 1, we had -- we talked about on EBITDA level that if you kind of backed into you would get into low double-digit EBITDA levels, we would expect to be in those -- that level in the second, third and fourth quarters in general. If you look at the last three quarters, our expectation of revenue, again just taking our guidance and backing up the first quarter is $37 million to $40 million of revenue per quarter and a positive EBITDA margin, sequentially growing lower in the first -- in the second quarter, but growing into the third and fourth quarter."
