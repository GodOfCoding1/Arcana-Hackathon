    "content": " Our backlog at the end of Q3 is a record $272.6 million, with both Barber Nichols and the legacy Graham business having a nice step-up in their respective backlogs during the quarter. I'm sorry about the results and certainly understand what you had to do to keep the business moving, but what I wanted to know is it over the last year, the firm has made a pretty big effort at telling us about how they've got a welding school program and you know that it's working well for you. And then I think, Jeff, I think you mentioned $4.5 million forward loss on the Navy business and then sort of collateral $3 million EBIT headwind on the commercial business relative to some of the knock-on effects. We should - no, I don't think - I think that's once we get the recovery on the commercial side, realistically probably happens on future jobs as we're getting labor, a direct labor back to the commercial side of the business those that have been transitioned over to Navy."
