    "content": " Sales were $36.1 million, up $15.9 million over last year's first quarter and was across all of our diversified markets. SG&A expenses in the first quarter of fiscal 2023 were $5.8 million, up $836,000 over the prior year, but lower by $502,000 from the sequential fourth quarter. And then thirdly, we did benefit in the quarter from a good mix in the revenue that we are realizing some of the challenges with supply chain with material receipts and things like that, some of the orders we are expecting in the first quarter didn't come out, but the management team did a great job pivoting and moving to other orders, which were higher profitability. That's why we're also saying we think we're not going to get the same benefit in the second quarter, but it should normalize in the second half of the year. Certainly, as you sit there and build it, getting manufacturing engineering out there on the floor, watching how things are going, thinking about alternate ways to do that and then trying different fabrication techniques on that first article are all things that we've been able to do, especially on the Navy side with our new Operations Director there."
