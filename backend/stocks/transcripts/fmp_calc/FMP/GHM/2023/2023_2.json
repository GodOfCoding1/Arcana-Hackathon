    "content": " Sales were $38.1 million, up 12% over last year's second quarter and 6% over the trailing first quarter. Offsetting these increases were sales to the defense market, which were down $5 million compared with the second quarter of last year, which is a record quarter for this business. For the quarter, sales in the US increased 16% to $30.3 million and represented 80% of our sales, while international sales of $7.8 million, accounted for 20% of total sales and were consistent with the prior year. In addition to strong defense sales, we had $13 million in refining and petrochemical orders, which related to continued strong commercial aftermarket demand and $4 million of orders each from space and other commercial, which is comprised primarily of new energy. If you turn to slide seven, you can see that these orders drove a 20% increase in backlog from the sequential first quarter and now sits at a record $313 million."
