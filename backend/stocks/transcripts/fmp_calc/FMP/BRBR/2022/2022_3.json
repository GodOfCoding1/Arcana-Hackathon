    "content": " Premier Protein net sales grew 7%, driven by higher average net selling prices reflecting price increases and reduced promotional activity, offset partially by a 9% volume decline. Our sales outlook for the quarter remains largely unchanged with double-digit net sales growth expected for Premier Protein and Dymatize, which both benefit from higher net pricing. We expect sequential net sales growth from the third quarter driven by new products on both brands as well as increased distribution, promotional activity and media support for Dymatize. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. We still are -- even though we're the highest household penetration within the category, we still believe there's a ton of upside were between 7% and 8%, and we believe that it can go much higher. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. Yes, if your question is obviously, EBITDA margin is over 20% this quarter, we would not expect that to continue going forward, partially because we have further inflation coming, but no, we're targeting still more to be in that -- on the higher half of our algorithm, which is 18% to 20%."
