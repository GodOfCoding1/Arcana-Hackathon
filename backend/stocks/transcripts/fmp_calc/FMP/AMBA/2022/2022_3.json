    "content": " So, I think that for consumer security camera, we do believe that the percentage of our CV revenue goes up significantly from Q3 to Q4 and will continue to see next year, particularly, we think there are a few customers will be in production in the near future. On the automotive side, I think it\u2019s the number of units -- if you look at the forecast for next year, I think China also -- the forecast for China, Chinese automotive market also reduced in terms of total numbers. So, I think that definitely is the main reason that Hikvision and Dahua are doing very well in the last, I would say, 10 years, it\u2019s really about government-driven driving the whole security camera market in China. And we -- I believe that the biggest opportunity -- revenue opportunity for us moving forward is for our customers gradually moving downwards and putting more and more CV solution to their low-end products, then we\u2019ll start seeing more unit numbers to the -- path to our revenue mix."
