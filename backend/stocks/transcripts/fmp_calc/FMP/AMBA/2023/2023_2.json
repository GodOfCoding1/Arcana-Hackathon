    "content": " I think there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s another very important milestone, I think you should track is when we can demo Oculii software running our CV3 silicon, which will probably -- the first silicon platform that can do sensor fusion with video data and the Radar data at the same time. One is we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going -- in November, we want to give a final update, which will probably give you indication how we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re doing with the OEM in terms design wins as well as we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to talk about CV3 engagement that we said by the end of the end of the year, we will talk about that. This Q3 and Q4 will be a ramp-up time for several customers, but I think meaningful revenue probably will -- probably move to Q1, Q2 next year."
