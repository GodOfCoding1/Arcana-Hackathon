    "content": " On our last call, we indicated that Crimson's volumes increased in the third quarter 2022 due to operational issues elsewhere in California, which continued into the fourth quarter. In order to offset the volume declines in the first quarter of 2023, Crimson filed a 36% rate increase on its San Pablo Bay pipeline and 107% rate increase on its KLM pipeline based on the regulated cost of service tariff structure. To wrap up our 2022 commentary, unfortunately, on March 3, 2023, after discussion with the company's management, our Audit Committee determined the company's 2021 10-K and 2021 and 2022 10-Qs require restatement due to an error in its accounting for EPS arising from over-allocation of Crimson net income to non-controlling interests."
