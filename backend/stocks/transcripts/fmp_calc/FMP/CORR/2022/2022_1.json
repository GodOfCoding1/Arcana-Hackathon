    "content": " Looking at the results first quarter revenue was $32.9 million with steady performance from MoGas and Omega and lower overall volumes in California, reflecting the continued temporary closure of the offshore amplified pipeline and the continued delay of new drilling permits that would bolster production volumes potentially shift on our line. As to dividend coverage for the three months ended March 31st 2022, we had adjusted EBITDA of $12 million, adjusted net income of $4.7 million and after providing for maintenance capital and debt amortization, adjusted cash available for distribution or adjusted CAD of $2.5 million resulting in a robust 3.3 times common dividend coverage. And then just on the economics as mentioned in the call, we target a hurdle rate of 5 times to 7 times, so these are pretty attractive projects for us and the thing that really maybe is overlooked is that they're utilizing an existing right of way not only produces cost, but also I think reduces uncertainty around some of the permitting and securing of rights of way, compared to a greenfield project."
