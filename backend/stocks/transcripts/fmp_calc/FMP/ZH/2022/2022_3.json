During the third quarter, our high quality content-centric communities saw sustainable improvement in our monetization ecosystem, enhancing the resilience of our business model and creating new growth drivers for our longer term development. In the third quarter, the average income earned by premium content creators increased by almost 30% compared to the same period last year. For instance, our app DAU and MAU are getting increase for three quarters consecutively, and also we believe that we focus more on the commercialization that goes more in line with our community, so that our high quality users will keep giving us drivers for commercial growth so that we can develop a virtual cycle of healthy community and sustainable business growth. And in a third quarter, our paying user number increased by nearly 300% year-over-year and with a quarter-over-quarter 40%, but still right now the paying users are relatively small and still has a great, great room for further growth."
