    "content": " As a result, total sales declined double digits to $16.2 million in the third quarter of 2022 from the same period last year, while net loss and adjusted EBITDA amounted to $4.7 million and a negative $2 million respectively. Sales decreased 27.1% to $16.2 million in the third quarter of '22, mainly due to the macroeconomic headwinds that Sarah outlined earlier in her prepared comments. Brick-and-mortar sales dropped 12.5% or $0.6 million year-over-year to $4.4 million in the third quarter of 2022, while sales from our wholesale channel decreased 41.8% or $1.1 million to $1.6 million during the same period. Excluding software implementation and configuration costs as well as the wage and rent subsidies received under the Canadian Government COVID-19 Economic Response Plan, adjusted SG&A decreased 8.1% year-over-year to $9.5 million. Adjusted net loss, which excludes the impact of restructuring plan activity, the wage and rent subsidies from the Canadian Government as well as software implementation and configuration costs amounted to $3.3 million compared to an adjusted net loss of $1.8 million in the same period last year."
