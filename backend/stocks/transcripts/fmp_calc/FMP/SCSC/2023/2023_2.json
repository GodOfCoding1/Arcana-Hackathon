    "content": " For the quarter, we delivered 17% net sales growth and adjusted EBITDA margin of 4.8% and record adjusted EBITDA for the quarter and the trailing 12-month period. Given our outstanding Q2 results, we are raising our full year outlook for FY '23 and now expect net sales growth of at least 6.5% and adjusted EBITDA of at least $176 million. For Q2, we delivered strong top-line growth with net sales exceeding $1 billion, up 17% year-over-year. Gross profits for the quarter increased 7% year-over-year to $115 million, while our gross margin of 11.4% reflects a higher mix of big deals and less favorable sales mix for the quarter. Our non-GAAP SG&A expense for the quarter of $71.9 million increased $2.7 million or 4% year-over-year, demonstrating operating expense leverage. Our record Q2 adjusted EBITDA of $48.8 million represents a 15% year-over-year growth and a 4.83% adjusted EBITDA margin, emphasizing the scalability of our business. One moment for our next question. And if I focus on your adjusted EBITDA margin guidance, that's suggesting they fall to roughly 4.5% for the rest of the year versus what you've been able to deliver the past several quarters. One moment for our next question. One moment for our next question. One moment for our next question."
