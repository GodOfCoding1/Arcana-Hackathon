    "content": " For fiscal year 2023, we expect double-digit year-over-year net sales growth for Intelisys, driven in large part by the strength of our relationships and the trust and credibility we foster with our partners and suppliers. For Q1, we delivered strong top line growth with net sales of $944 million, up 10% year-over-year and record profitability. Our Q1 recurring revenue of $26.6 million grew 11% year-over-year, and that business is close to 100% gross profit margins. Finally, we are reaffirming our full year 2023 outlook of at least 5.5% for year-over-year net sales growth and at least $174 million for adjusted EBITDA."
