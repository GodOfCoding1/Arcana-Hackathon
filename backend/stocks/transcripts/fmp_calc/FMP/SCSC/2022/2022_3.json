    "content": " Q3 net sales of $846 million, up 16% year-over-year, reflects strong customer demand across our technologies and a modest benefit from supplier price increases. Additionally, Q3 benefited by approximately $30 million of sales pulled forward from Q4, due to timing of product availability near the end of the quarter. Our Q3 margins increased to 12.6%, up from 12.1% in the prior year's quarter and includes a onetime benefit from supplier price increases of approximately 45 basis points. Our non-GAAP SG&A expense for the quarter of $66.5 million, increased $6.7 million or 11% year-over-year. Our Q3 results include approximately $3 million of onetime SG&A expense benefits, primarily due to a large bad debt recovery in the quarter. Third quarter adjusted EBITDA totaled $44.1 million, up 38% year-over-year, reflecting a 5.21% adjusted EBITDA margin, which includes the benefit of the onetime items we've discussed. Year-over-year working capital which includes accounts receivable and inventory net of accounts payable, increased $80 million or 18% year-over-year to support our sales growth. As Mike noted in his opening remarks, we are raising our FY 2022 net sales growth and adjusted EBITDA expectations and our updated guidance includes the benefits of the onetime items noted in the quarter."
