    "content": " The foundation of our hybrid distribution strategy is helping suppliers and sales partners accelerate growth across innovative technologies by providing hardware plus services, software or other recurring offers. Included in this segment is Intelisys, and we achieved 13% year-on-year net sales growth and exceeded $2 billion in end user ARR, annual recurring revenue or billings by suppliers to end users. Our non-GAAP SG&A expense for the quarter of $63.5 million increased $1.9 million or 3% year-over-year, which includes investment in strategic headcount for Intelisys, Brazil and other growth areas, including IT investments to expand our capabilities. For fiscal year 2022, we expect our year-over-year net sales growth to be at least 5.5%, and we expect adjusted EBITDA to be at least $135 million."
