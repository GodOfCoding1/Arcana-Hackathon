I would now like to turn the call over to Herbj\u00c3\u00b8rn Hansson, Founder, Chairman, CEO. Thank you, Mondi and good morning to you. As an introduction, I will make some observations on the general position of Nordic American. Our view is clearly at this time that there is scarcity of ships, there are too few ships in the marketplace. And when there are too few ships, rates go up and value of ships, go up. Our main focus is on so called ton mile, which is the same as transportation work. We have business in Japan, in China, in Korea and also in India. Collectively, I would call it East. I can tell you that we have a ship in China, about if not necessarily every week, but every 2 weeks or so, we are often in China. That is an oil field, which essentially is managed by ExxonMobil. And we \u00e2\u0080\u0093 our main focus and our main customers are what I call big oil, the big oil companies, ExxonMobil, Shell, British Petroleum and the like. And again, we focus on transportation work. And evidently, we have a lot of business in the Middle East and also in Saudi Arabia. One of my closer friends, he was living in Saudi Arabia for 13 years and he has been helping me a lot in understanding the country. We lift oil from the Port of Yanbu, in Saudi Arabia and we have close links with Saudi Arabia. Alexander Hansson, he is Head of our Operation in Monaco and he has closed friends in Saudi Arabia at the very top of that country. I would like to emphasize and note that in our group in Nordic American, we have not carried Russian oil, the last 18 months. In the past, we were lifting oil from the Port of Primorsk in the Baltic Sea, where \u00e2\u0080\u0093 from which we lifted Russian oil, but it is 1.5 years ago since we have done that. As a general observation, I would say that uncertainty is always good for our business, because in uncertain times, we see the notion of hoarding. Because if you are in the tanker business, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not the place to be if you are a nervous person. Generally speaking, observers seem to forget that the action of the Federal Reserve is good for some people and bad for other people. We are now in a situation in which we clearly see that we will repay all that to our excellent partner, the Beal Bank of Dallas. And when we have repaid our debt, we are in a position to increase our dividend strongly from this level we see today and we expect to have repaid all debt to Beal Bank of Dallas in a year or so. I would also like to mention our excellent cooperation with the Ocean Yield, which is owned or controlled by KKR in Boston, Massachusetts. When it comes to new business, we see now that there are many parties who wish to do business with us. And we have been, as I mentioned, stock listed in America since the mid 1990s. I am talking about Shell, the French group, Total and British Petroleum and the like and also the Norwegian major oil company, Equinor, which is controlled by the Norwegian government. Of special importance, we now see how we are able to reduce emission. I will explain this in more detail, because quite a few people are not aware of the fact. When we go into a loading area with our ships and we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have a cargo on board, then we go slow speed. When we go slow speed with our ships, we consume about 20 tons of bunker oil. When we go full speed with the same ship, we are consuming about 50 tons bunker oil. And in the past 10 years ago, we went much more full speed than today. Coordinator, Mondi, you are sitting in camera I believe. Going on a year plus now, you have got plenty of experience in this tanker market going back. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to put too many ears, but at least into the 70s you have seen a lot. So that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s as I say with great seriousness, I have only been in the business for 50 years. And I would make one special point, there is very low order become new tankers. There will be almost no increase of the fleet during the next year, two or three. We could discuss the details of that, but that is a main point. Secondly, what we do see of course also is that our main customers, I mentioned major oil and they look upon transparency and they know for sure that we had good ships and we have good people and that is the main principle in our group. Sorry for talking for such a long time, Omar, but I hope this gives you a background. No, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a very interesting setup as we move forward. I would like to ask my colleague, our Chief Financial Officer, Bj\u00c3\u00b8rn Gi\u00c3\u00a6ver to elaborate a little bit on that question. And I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think NAT ever has had a policy of putting out a payout ratio, we usually distribute the excess cash that we find suitable and shareholders have usually been happy with that. I would note, Omar, that I and my family are the biggest private group in Nordic American and my son, Alexander in Monaco he did buy shares last week and he has now quite a lot of shares. Of course, nobody knows what the future is holding. And we have to communicate openly, but we will never, never say anything, which is wrong in our judgment. I appreciate that and thanks Bj\u00c3\u00b8rn for the color, so definitely sets up a really interesting payout going forward, where the doubling would take your dividend from potentially $0.15 to $0.30 quarterly. Good afternoon to you, sir. Herbj\u00c3\u00b8rn, as you pointed out to Omar, you haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t seen a better market for your fleet. And my English isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t all that good, but we now have a large fleet and to use an American expression, I believe this American we are raking in money. Because when we are debt free, we have large flexibility, nobody can decide, except our Board can decide what we are going to do going forward, but it is important to have our eyes on the goal. And we must not let the goal become diluted, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the main point. But I mean, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not so easy to know about the future. But I as the Founder and Chairman and large shareholder of this group, I had to have a feeling and I had to have an understanding of the future. Because otherwise, if I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know, when people ask me what you think about the future, I cannot say, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know at all, because if I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know, then I would rather find another job. But coming back to the main point, we are in a good position. And I can assure you, I will hang in there for long time. I think it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s in our business, which is volatile and highly cyclical, I think we do have a fairly high operational leverage. And for this reason, we want to continue to take down our financial leverage so that we pay-down the Beal facility, which again will allow us to increase our dividends, like we talked about. So, I guess that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u0093 I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think we are going to change that in the near-term. In the present situation, that is not our priority, because the major oil companies, they know that we have first class ships, and they know that we \u00e2\u0080\u0093 I am sorry, I am not sorry to say I am proud to say we are first class people. But I am always saying like important , the biggest room in the world is the room for improvement. And I think for me, I think right now the challenge for a lot of people is that if you are going to order a tanker today, it will be delivered, probably early 2026. So, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a long lead time for that decision in order to commit to a long-term charter starting in 2026. And even after these couple of quarters with very strong earnings, the order book for new tankers has not moved. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s still very low, yes. And I would like to add, when we ordered two of our recent ships, we paid about $54 million, $55 million. And a close associate of ours, he said that I was mad when I said we should order two ships at $54 million, $55 million. And we have had feelings out in the market, what would be the price now and the price would be in excess, probably of $80 million. And so that gives us a few rooms and it gives us financial stability and the financial stability is important for us, as I mentioned when we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have that anymore. We do have a question from the line of Thomas Steed, Private Investor. Mr. Hansson, I am a Private Investor. You see, I am a tanker man in the United States merchant marine. Secondly, I can tell you, today, we have Russians onboard the ship. And we also, I can tell you have Ukrainians onboard the ship. And they work excellently together, I can tell you. Point number two, they wish to hang on those ships and stay on our ships, because they are in a very unfortunate situation. And they don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t wish to go home and to join the war, very unfortunate war going on. But we do see now at pressure in the way that when we come to America, Russians are not allowed to disembark or embark. When you are listed on the New York Stock Exchange, you must not infringe American rules. In summary, the cooperation on our ships is going excellently also between Russians and the Ukrainians. I have a follow-up, sir, if I may. I have been an investor since 2004 and as a tanker man, you said, we have good ships and good people. Now, obviously, I have noticed we haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t had any groundings or major collisions. And I am proud to be a shareholder of NAT just for that one reason, it is run very efficiently with our officers and engineers. I can tell you, sir, that those who have been with us since the mid-70s, mid-90s, sorry, they had received about $50 in dividend per share. Also, because we cannot run the company based on 90-days periods, either a company can go up, it can go sideways, and it can go down. And if it goes sideways, and it goes down, it goes down. But Nordic American, the New York listed company, is definitely going up as we see it. Mondi, any other questions? We do have one final question from Ken Davidson, private investor. And I thought that when the last two new tankers were delivered, they were put under contract to the Sultanate of Oman, under long-term contracts. And I believe that I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t remember exactly what the dollar amount was, but it was relatively low at that time, perhaps in the area of $15,000. Whereas some of the communications that you have put out recently, the spot contracts, for instance are much higher than that now, 50s, 60s. When we charted out these ships, we chartered them out 2023, \u00e2\u0080\u009824 or something like that. And we charted them out for 6 years to create the financial stability at the time, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s always in the business. You know, when you are looking to setback the mirror, you look into mirror, you could always have done that differently. And we are hopeful that we should be able to expand the business with Oman, in a way which is good for our shareholders, including my own family. So, the following up with that the new \u00e2\u0080\u0093 two new tankers were indeed put under long-term contract with the Sultanate of Oman, but for a higher amount. Yes, much higher than  mentioned, made almost mid-20s, \u00e2\u0080\u009823 or \u00e2\u0080\u009824 or so. Mondi, any other questions? There are no more questions, sir. You are free to call me or my colleagues any time, of any question. We will, in fact encourage you to call us because we believe that we know quite a lot about this industry. We must always be better tomorrow than we are today or than we were yesterday, for which reason, I would thank you very much for spending time with us and taking your time."
