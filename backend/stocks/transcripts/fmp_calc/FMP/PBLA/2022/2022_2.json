    "content": " Turning to milestones, as I mentioned, we closed on the CPP acquisition and announced the first patient enrolled in our ASPIRE trial, as well as expansion outside the U.S. Additionally, in the second half of this year, we anticipate announcing the final data from our Phase 1 trial in untreated metastatic pancreatic cancer patients and the opening of the neoadjuvant pancreatic cancer investigator-initiated trial. With the closing of the CPP transaction, we also anticipate achievement of additional milestones for 2022 that include initiation of the non-small cell lung cancer trial with eflornithine in combination with KEYTRUDA initiation of a Phase 2 trial in Type 1 onset diabetes, and a futility analysis in the PACES trial by early 2023."
