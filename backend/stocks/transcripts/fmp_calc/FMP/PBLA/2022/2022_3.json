Lastly, we in partnership with One-Two also have an ongoing Phase III double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of Flynpovi, the combination of Eflornithine and Sulindac, prevent recurrence of high-risk adenomas and second primary colorectal cancers in patients with stage 0 to 3 colon or rectal cancer. In addition to continued execution of the various trials in our development program, we anticipate announcing final data from our Phase I trial in untreated metastic pancreatic cancer patients and early onset Type 1 onset diabetes by year-end or early 2023."
