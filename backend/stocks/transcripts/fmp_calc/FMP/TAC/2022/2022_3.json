    "content": " Yes, so, Maurice, I think when we look at kind of what has happened over the course of the year, I'd say I'm not surprised by how we've seen the AS proceed in terms of the average price that's been realized kind of in that call it 50% to 60% range, I think in times where like we experienced in Q3, you had high levels of volatility, we would expect there to be a greater percentage, I would say, Todd a higher lift in terms of the difference between the energy price and the AS price and at times when there is less volatility, even though the average price might be reasonably high, you'd expect it to be, think of a sliding scale more on the left side of the scale, as opposed to the higher right side of the scale."
