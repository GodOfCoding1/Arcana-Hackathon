    "content": " My name is Kathy Darnell, and I'll be operator for today's call. Before we begin, I would like to remind everyone that during this call, the company may make certain statements that constitute forward-looking statements. Our remarks today may include forward-looking statements, which are based upon management's current beliefs, expectations, and assumptions, and are subject to risk and uncertainties. During the pandemic, we launched and built out our cargo business and now, and over the next several quarters, our main focus at Sun Country is to staff our airline to get back to 2019 utilization levels on our passenger fleet, as quickly as possible. We want to deliver this growth, while also maintaining the operational excellence and service levels that our customers expect of us. I'm especially proud that year to date, Sun Country has led the industry in completion factor with 98.2% in this challenging operational environment. Like all airlines, we're facing the challenges of record-high fuel, tight labor market, and inflationary pressures. Our flexible network, combined with having a large percentage of our flying committed to long-term pass-through contracts, give us the ability to be successful regardless of what challenges we're facing. By design, our response to high fuel is to cut off-peak flying and concentrate our schedule on periods of the calendar when we're able to achieve acceptable returns. As fuel rose rapidly through February and into May, we aggressively cut weaker periods like mid-week, May and September and long-haul routes that are more fuel intensive. These capacity cuts, along with all our revenue initiatives, allowed us to deliver over 29% schedule service TRASM growth versus 2019 for 2Q. As we've had more lead time going into the third quarter, we expect our scheduled service TRASM to approach 40% improvement, and we continue to see strength across our selling schedule currently posted through April of next year. We expect not only to be profitable in all environments, but also to deliver industry-leading margins. I want to give some color as to why, for the first time in 10 quarters, that isn't the case. However, the fare environment and our fleet size justifies significantly more flying during peak periods. Since ratifying our pilot agreement at the end of last year, we haven't had any issues with retention or hiring. However, we're attempting to train about 4x the amount of crews versus pre-COVID levels. This resulted in a reduction for June, a peak month, of 30% in passenger fleet utilization versus 2019. With 40% of the fleet committed to contract flying, we were under-allocated to the best margin opportunities during the quarter, namely scheduled service, large volume domestic markets. Before I get into a discussion of our results, recall that Q2 is a seasonally weaker quarter for Sun Country than Q1. Our results were driven by a combination of unprecedented growth in unit revenue, historically high fuel prices, and under-capacity driven by staffing issues. Second quarter revenue totaled $219.1 million, a 29% increase versus Q2 of 2019. Scheduled service revenue was $152.6 million, a 22.5% increase over Q2 2019, and scheduled service TRASM grew 29% versus 2019. For the month of June, scheduled service TRASM was 44% higher than 2019 and July finished over 40% higher than July 2019. System block hour growth for the quarter was 23% higher than Q2 of 2019, driven by the growth of our cargo segment. System ASMs declined by 6%, compared to Q2 2019, which was considerably smaller than we would've optimally been, even at $4 plus fuel prices. As Jude mentioned, since finalizing our pilot agreement in December of last year, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been able to attract all of the pilots we need to meet our staffing requirements. As we implement the new agreement, we've been increasing the size of our hiring and training pipeline to accommodate our growth plans. Charter revenue for the quarter was $42.7 million, a 25% increase over Q2 of 2019. While increasing the proportion of business under contract is a favorable trend, there remains ample opportunity to increase the amount of profitable ad hoc flying that we do. In 2019, 49% of our charter flying was ad hoc. Cargo revenue for the quarter of $21.2 million was flat with Q1 2022, down by 4% versus Q2 2021. Our Q2 non-fuel costs per block hour only increased 3.6% versus Q2 of 2019, despite implementation of our new pilot agreement. Adjusted CASM over the same period increased 15% versus 2019, and a 6.4% decrease in total ASMs. This increase in our non-fuel CASM is largely driven by the fact that, as I mentioned, we were significantly undersized relative to both our initial plans for Q2 and for the profitable flying opportunities that were available to us. The average price that we paid for fuel in the second quarter was $4.39 per gallon, was far higher than the $2.29 per gallon we paid in the second quarter of 2019. Relative to the Q2 guidance we gave last quarter of $3.50 per gallon, the higher price drove $15.5 million in added fuel expense. As we move through Q3, demand environment remains very strong and we expect scheduled service TRASM to be in excess of 40% higher than Q3 of 2019. Our projected Q3 fuel price is $3.84 per gallon, and we expect to fly 31,000 to 32,000 block hours, or approximately 1.5 billion ASMs. As our pilot output continues to improve, we anticipate growth will come at higher margin as fixed aircraft costs are already being incurred. Finally, let me focus on our balance sheet where we closed the second quarter with $308 million of liquidity, consisting of $283 million in cash and $25 million of undrawn revolver. Despite extremely high fuel prices, we generated over $15 million of free cash flow during the quarter, excluding aircraft CapEx, and we continue to expect to be strongly free cash flow positive for the year. One of the biggest ones, which we've now largely overcome, is on basically check airmen, IOE pilots who can certify our pilots to fly before they get online. There's a couple other things we're sort of working through here as we go forward, which I think we're going to have solved, I would say, in the next quarter to two quarters. If you look at our growth, as we look out later into the year, we'll be accelerating again relative to the fourth quarter. The good news is, sort of some of the uncontrollable factors, like attrition and new hires, we have a solid handle on, so we can attract all the pilots we need and our classes are as big as we want them to be. So, the most disappointing under-capacity allocations were markets that were in, kind of an in-elastic state where they were large enough markets to handle a lot more capacity, showed significant revenue improvements. So, those markets, I think we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re \u00e2\u0080\u0093 we don't know for sure, but were lifted by a return of business demand, which lifted overall fares. Instead, we were allocated more into fixed fee, as we talked about, but also a lot of leisure markets that didn't see the, kind of revenue   improvement that we saw in these larger markets. No, I'll just \u00e2\u0080\u0093 well, I would add one thing. It's just, we've grown Minneapolis non-stop destinations by over 50% through COVID. And as Jude mentioned, some markets performed better than others, but I would say broadly, Minneapolis performed very, very well. When I did see you pull down also some of the long, you know high volume summer markets, say West Coast, Hawaii, I just assumed that that was all because energy prices or fuel prices were above $4 a gallon, but it does sound like that you just \u00e2\u0080\u0093 you didn't have the staffing. I mean, keep in mind, like, if you talk about Hawaii, we're talking about a market that would've started around Memorial Day, a little bit before, and, I mean, everything in June works on the schedule service side. So, we were making decisions, a combination of fuel intensity, so it's about 50 gallons per passenger to fly somebody to Hawaii versus 20 gallons or so on our domestic network. And then also crew efficiency because we're crew constrained, if there's any positioning or penalty, then we can get more flying done in a different way, then that goes into the calculus as well. Hawaii, we expect to be back next summer, it was \u00e2\u0080\u0093 I would have done just fine in this environment, but we're just trying to put the best stuff in. And when I sort of think about what you're dealing with right now, it doesn't seem like that that's anytime soon, but maybe it is. And it may be that in conversations that you're having with Amazon, if you were to do wide-body, I'm sure that there'd be a cargo complement as well. Otherwise, I don't think it would make sense. And I agree with what your sentiment that there would be \u00e2\u0080\u0093 need to be, kind of a cargo complement as well, to get the same synergies out of our multi-segment business in narrow-bodies into the wide-body spaces. So, we're not \u00e2\u0080\u0093 our focus right now is putting pilots out onto the line and that'll be the focus for the next two quarters. Because I do think that that will also help, kind of work through \u00e2\u0080\u0093 help you work things through. We just got to implement it and it's going to be early next year, but that's going to help, no doubt. Yeah, I mean, I think in the near term, we're certainly constrained by pilots. We expect, as we move into 2023, to be able \u00e2\u0080\u0093 our goal, and we have line of sight on a plan, to achieve a 20% block hour growth rate, which I think is achievable over a more sustained period. I mean, we need to have high margin opportunities for that incremental flying, which I think exists in today's environment, even with fuel price, but in a recession or higher fuel, that growth rate would change. But we're building out training capacity, and also we have a contract and a value proposition to incoming pilots with diversity of our flying and growth rates that I think 20% is attainable. We are in advanced discussions, pretty close right now, on three more aircraft that'll deliver to us later in 2023, and we are remaining active in the market. And we're going to continue to do that, just like we've been doing. So, we're moving forward and planning for sustained growth. The other thing to think about, this is always tough with us because we've got a big cargo business. So, we really look at a lot of stuff on a cost per block hour basis, which we feel is pretty well in-hand, but I don't have a precise CASM forecast for you right now. So, Scott, just want to make a clarifying point, which is that that's for scheduled service TRASM, which is about, I don't know, 60% of our \u00e2\u0080\u0093 70% of our block hours, 65% of our block hours, something like that. So, we don't see any slowdown associated with \u00e2\u0080\u0093 any pullback in demand from where we were on peak levels in July. We don't want fares to get too high where travel is unattainable for a large portion of our customers, but there's no indication in any of our forward bookings of any weakness or any change from this summer  . And so, at least for now you feel like you'll be able to sort of keep the drop in fuel and keep the benefit of that. Yeah, I mean, so if you look back in the second quarter, the foregone opportunities of flying, it's hard to tell, but it's probably worth on the pre-tax basis and operating basis, in the tune around $15 million, which would've put us pretty close to double-digits. Now, the fuel price is higher, so the flying opportunities for high utilization are, sort of concentrated when fares are naturally higher. So May, there wasn't that much  ; September, there won't be that many opportunities to add other than ad hoc charter opportunities. But for summer months, where this demand environment is so good, we're forgoing significant opportunities with utilization down 30%. And that's the key to delivering back to operating margins that lead the industry, I think. There's some \u00e2\u0080\u0093 as you compare across the industry, so Frontier is taking sale leaseback, they take a gain from that. So, just keep that in mind, and I think when we think more long-term, we're in a really good place."
