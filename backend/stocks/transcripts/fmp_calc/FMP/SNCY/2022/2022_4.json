    "content": " Ticket plus ancillary revenue grew 45% year-over-year as we saw an increase in total fare to $177.36, combined with an increase in load factor from 76.6% last year to 84.4% in Q4 of 2022. Full year revenue for the ad hoc charter business is still about 60% below its peak in 2019, but as we continue to add pilot resources, we expect to see steady growth in this segment. As I said previously, we're seeing very strong demand, with approximately 80% of our planned Q1 passenger revenue already booked, and we expect the strength to continue throughout the quarter. But if all we're looking at is unit revenue and fares and ancillary production, things like that, for the bookings that we can see, which again for the summer period is well below 20% of our volume, it's very, very strong. Jude mentioned the fact that we're going to get growth mostly through utilization, but I would expect us to add probably one or two aircraft into the fleet this year. And for us, in particular, I think that's going to drive continued tailwind on total revenue per passenger because of the kind of products that we're seeing growth in. Because summer is such a strong peak for most markets, with what we would say is a price driven consumer where we're going to be competitive during peak periods, still generating an average fare that's higher than the incumbents because we're only capitalizing on those very picky opportunities."
