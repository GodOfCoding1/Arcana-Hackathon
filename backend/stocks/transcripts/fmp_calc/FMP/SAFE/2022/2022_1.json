    "content": " Historically, because the market's long-term inflation expectation has hovered at approximately 2%, the value of our CPI lookbacks were frequently ignored by external parties since the minimum contractual escalators in our Safehold ground leases are also structured with a comparable 2% annual fixed rent increase. Assuming the market's current long-term inflation expectation of 2.49%, our portfolio generates a yield of 5.7%, which primarily includes the value captured by the CPI lookbacks and our Safehold ground leases."
