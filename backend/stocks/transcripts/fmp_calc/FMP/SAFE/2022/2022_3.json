    "content": " In the meantime, we will work to highlight that while the contractual cash flows from our $6 billion ground lease portfolio are certainly impacted by higher discount rates for assets with a similar credit profile. The new ground leases originated during the quarter, generated a weighted average yield of 5.8%, assuming 0% inflation, which is approximately a 30 basis points higher than the 5.5% yield for the deals we closed in the second quarter also with a 0% inflation assumption. Including the sale of a ground lease during the quarter, the estimated value of all of the unrealized capital appreciation above our cost basis grew to an estimated $10.5 billion, a $597 million increase from our last update for the previous quarter, equating to an 80% compound annual growth rate since our IPO in 2017. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you very much."
