    "content": " Our most important success though was our impressive profitability of $15.5 million marking unheard of 15,400% rise compared to Q2 2022 while generating in the course of three months a profit equivalent to 23% of our current market cap. We ended the third quarter of 2022 with a free cash base, including our time deposits of about $92.5 million equivalent to 1.3 times our current market capitalization. Strong rates allowed us to capitalize upon our fleet additions and therefore we managed to increase our average time charter equivalent per vessel by 20,000 per day and produced a profit of $15.5 million. Looking at our income statement for Q3 2022 in Slide 8, revenues came in at $42.6 million up by $38.5 million due to our fleet additions, plus mostly due to high spot rates, particularly for the Suezmax and Aframax vessels. Our running costs increased by $3 million due to the average increase of our fleet by four vessels and one of our product tanker, the Clean Sanctuary ex Clean Thrasher coming off their boot close to the end of the quarter. As a result of having acquired six vessels in the course of 10 months, we generated net income of $15.5 million in a single quarter, which is 15400% higher than our profit in Q2 2022, an equivalent to 23% of our current market cap.
