    "content": " We believe EDP-323 could serve as a standalone treatment or may be used in combination with other agents such as EDP-938 to potentially broaden the treatment window or addressable RSV patient populations, and we plan to initiate a Phase 1 study of EDP-323 in the second half of this year. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. So we're certainly looking at 323 that advances into the clinic, and we'll be looking at that in a typical Phase 1 study and then understanding a little bit more about the characteristics and antiviral activity on its own and then thinking about potential combinations down the road with 938. Your line is open. Your line is open."
