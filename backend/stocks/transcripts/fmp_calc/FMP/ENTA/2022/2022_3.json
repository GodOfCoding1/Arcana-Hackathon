    "content": " We continue to believe that RSV antiviral treatment, including EDP-938 has the greatest potential to show optimal efficacy in high-risk populations as these patients have reduced RSV immunity, which manifests in a higher and longer duration of viral load and greater disease severity, allowing a bigger window to realize the full potential of EDP-938. Well, it's a little confusing in part, because remdesivir seems to have good data in terms of prevention of hospitalization and death in patient populations, but yet it hasn't demonstrated an effect on viral load reduction, yet other mechanisms such as protease inhibitor has demonstrated viral load reduction."
