    "content": " With multiple ongoing and planned clinical studies across our pipeline, we are poised to execute on our vision to transform the lives of patients with curative therapies, building on our prior success in hepatitis C. Today, I'll start by detailing our recent advances in the development of EDP-235, our once-daily orally dosed inhibitor of coronavirus 3CL protease, which is in clinical development for the treatment of COVID-19. Regarding clinical symptoms and outcomes, again, in a small study like this, they're more exploratory than anything, I think, in a small study that size in this way you're not really -- and in this patient population, in particular, you're not really going to be expecting to see too much in the way of that, but we'll be looking for -- we'll be definitely be looking for trends and things that can possibly measure and focus on as it relates to later stage studies. So pre-clinically, we believe it's a good stand-alone molecule on its own right, it's potentially a good combination partner down the road, again, thinking about different patient populations, ones that might need an extra little support in terms of drug pressure on the virus, maybe in highly immune suppressed patients, for example or -- and/or just reading a more normal patient by maybe able to reach a little bit later in the stage of infection by using two agents rather than one and translating that into patient value."
