    "content": " Following on this thought however, I would like to highlight the robust reductions in serum lipids demonstrated in our first-in-human clinical trial of Pemvidutide, where we achieve 20% to 30% reductions in total and LDL cholesterol within 12-weeks of Pemvidutide treatment. Can you just remind us what you are hoping to understand in the Phase 1 basically safety portion study in the diabetic patient population, is that purely drug, drug interaction work or is it possible that we could see treatment related effects in that patient population, just to kind of replicate the 29% of patients that are in NAFLD. And finally, regarding your question of the diabetes study, recognize that there are only a limited number of subjects who are diabetic, who are participating in the 12-week NAFLD study, doing a committed diabetes studies allows us to increase those numbers, get more robust readouts, and also put some measures into that study that are considered to be more of an industry standard in assessing diabetic patients such as continuous glucose monitoring, that would be too difficult to incorporate into a NAFLD trial. We look to the first quarter of next year, you are going to have the interim data for MOMENTUM, you will also have the Phase 1b NAFLD study 12-week and 24-week data and as well, but Phase 1 study data in diabetic subjects, so additional Phase 3 data."
