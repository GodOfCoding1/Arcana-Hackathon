    "content": " Enrollment in the Phase 1b non-alcoholic fatty liver disease or NAFLD trial has been completed, and data readouts for weight loss and liver fat reduction at 12 weeks of treatment are expected in the third quarter of 2022. In addition, a double-blind placebo-controlled 12-week extension of the NAFLD trials has been initiated with an expected data readout on weight loss at 24 weeks in the 4th quarter of 2022. As Vipin mentioned, we completed enrollment in our Phase 1b NAFLD clinical trial of pemvidutide and expect a data readout in the third quarter of 2022. Based on the results of our Phase 1 clinical trial, we expect to achieve a robust reduction in liver fat content and again show a significant weight loss in subjects after 12 weeks of treatment. With the added financial flexibility afforded to the delay in initiation of a Phase 2 trial pemvidutide in NASH, our existing cash not only fully funds us through NAFLD and 48-week momentum obesity trial datasets, but we currently estimate that our cash is sufficient to allow us to operate well into 2024. None of these sites have competitive studies, and we don't think that the prep -- the titration or the absence of it is any issue, if anything it's a plus because patients are looking forward to more rapid weight loss when they come into the program."
