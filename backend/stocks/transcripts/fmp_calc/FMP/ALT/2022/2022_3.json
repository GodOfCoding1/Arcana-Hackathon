    "content": " The recent data from our Phase 1b NAFLD trial highlighted a 68.5% relative liver fat reduction at 12 weeks in the 1.8 milligram dose group, which translated into more than half of those subjects, achieving a normal liver fat content of 5% or less. Your line is open. And one moment for our next question. Your line is open. Your line is open. And one moment for our next question. Your line is open. So we're very happy with that, but we're trying to emphasize because of the great differences in the populations, in the very nature of the way that the study was conducted with there being no branding or no emphasis on weight loss, no communication on weight loss, really to patients, even investigators on the study that the kinetics of weight loss in this population -- or the kinetics of weight loss in the population, they don't translate to the kinetics that we're going to see in dedicated obesity trials with patients, dedicated obesity patients with one quarter the amount of liver fat and one quarter the amount of Hispanics. And one moment for our next question. Your line is open. And one moment for our next question. Your line is open. It was seen when the MGM program was active and was seen very strongly with the accurate data, and we would suspect that with the same, if not better levels of liver fat reduction, probably achieved in a shorter period of time that we will see comparable effects in a late-phase NASH trial, and we've received comments from KOLs like Stephen Harrison that this is the best data that he's seen yet at this phase of development. And not only do we have comparable levels of liver fat data and at least as good reductions in fibroinflammatory activity in our current trials, but we have one thing that the other compounds in NASH with similar levels of fat reduction don't have, which is meaningful weight loss."
