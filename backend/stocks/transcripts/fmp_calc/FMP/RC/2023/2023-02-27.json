    "content": " To that end, in 2022, we originated over 1,200 commercial and small business loans totaling $5.7 billion, and expanded our loan product offerings with the launch of our CRE construction program originating $220 million across four multifamily transactions at expected yields of 20%. To achieve the scale necessary to support our first and second objectives year-over-year, RC increased its capitalization 48% via both secondary markets and through our merger with Mosaic, a leading private credit lender focused on construction lending. Furthermore, our focus on mid-market multifamily, which accounts for 81% of the current portfolio, is positioned to withstand the post-COVID and macroeconomic factors plaguing other sectors such as office, where we have a very modest 5% exposure in small ballots, average of 6.3 million loans. Please proceed with your questions. The first is that the core Broadmark product, which is very analogous to our heavy transitional lending, and obviously with the Mosaic transaction last year, we've entered into construction lending, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s really - in terms of what we currently do, we currently do multifamily residential heavy transitional, and this is with an average balance, let's say, of $15 million.
