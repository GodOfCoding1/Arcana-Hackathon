    "content": " In the quarter, we continued our strategy of funding growth through accretive M&A assuming a singular reliance on secondary offerings, adding $670 million of equity through the closing of the merger with Mosaic and a secondary offering in January. Net income from residential mortgage banking declined $600,000 quarter-over-quarter, revenue from mortgage banking declined $13.5 million due to a 12% decline in production, and a 5% decline in average margins, which now stood at 70 basis points. And as far as the second question regarding the credit performance of our lower middle market niche in a recessionary scenario, maybe, Adam, if you can comment on that, but I just preface that with the fact that the -- due to the limited competition in our market, our debt yields, and cap rates tend to be 100 to 100 -- up to 200 basis points higher than, let's say a large balanced portfolio, which provides some level of cushion."
