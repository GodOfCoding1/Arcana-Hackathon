    "content": " We split 7(a) originations into large loans, mostly real estate secured, which posted $111 million in originations, 16% quarter-over-quarter growth and our largest quarter by volume in a non-COVID stimulus period. Our residential mortgage banking business, GMFS, continues to be impacted by lower refinancing volume with originations of $750 million for the quarter, of which 78% was purchased loans. Our second quarter earnings, absent PPP-related income, were supported by continued growth in net interest income from our loan portfolio, offset by expected reductions in gain on sale margins in our 7(a) business, lower contributions from residential mortgage banking and mark-to-market losses on certain non-core assets."
