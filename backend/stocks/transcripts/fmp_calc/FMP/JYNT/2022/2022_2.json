    "content": "  Factors that could contribute to these differences include, but are not limited to, the continuing impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on the economy and our operations, including temporary clinic closures, shortened business hours and reduced patient demand; inflation exacerbated by COVID-19 and the current war in Ukraine, our failure to develop or acquire company-owned or managed clinics as rapidly as we intend; our failure to profitably operate company-owned or managed clinics; our inability to identify and recruit enough qualified chiropractors and other personnel to staff our clinics due in part to the nationwide labor shortage, short-selling strategies and negative opinions posted on the Internet, which could drive down the market price of our common stock and resulting class action lawsuits or failure to remediate the current or future material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting, which could negatively impact our ability to accurately report our financial results, prevent fraud or maintain investor conference and other factors described in our filings with the SEC, including in the section entitled Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021, filed with the SEC on March 14, 2022, and subsequently filed current and quarterly reports."
