    "content": " The increase in gross profit was driven by year-over-year improvements in volume versus fiscal 2021 and compared to the same quarter in both fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2019, increases in GP dollars per case across all segments as we successfully managed to increase costs from our product suppliers and acted to optimize our business processes and performance. As we touched on earlier and as you can see on Slide 15, operating costs this quarter were impacted by variable costs associated with significantly increased volumes, more than $35 million of onetime and short-term transitory expenses associated with the snapback, $48 million of purposeful investments to further accelerate our Recipe for Growth initiatives, and lastly, the still present but improving expense challenges associated with new hire productivity. Our financial performance this quarter reflects three key points: first, our volume grew 18.8% in U.S. Broadline compared to last year, and we significantly exceeded our market share target; second, we improved operations expenses, reducing snapback costs by more than 50% while continuing our transformation efforts; and third, we generated strong profit performance despite a dynamic operating environment. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. And then I know you mentioned separately something about April, that you were seeing strong demand across all geographies, which just trying to get a better sense whether maybe we're misunderstanding the headwinds we're hearing about in the international markets, or whether or not your strong performance is driven more by the delayed recovery that went on in international markets, and therefore, that's more than offsetting maybe a slowdown that might be going on underneath. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open."
