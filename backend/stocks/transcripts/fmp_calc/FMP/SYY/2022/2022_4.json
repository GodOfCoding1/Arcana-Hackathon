    "content": " Our supply chain mission at Sysco is clear, enable profitable growth by delivering the industry's leading assortment of products delivered on time and in full at a delivery frequency that meets or exceeds our customers' expectations. While it is difficult to be precise from the current macro environment, based on initial estimates of market growth and inflation, we expect top line growth of at least 10% over fiscal year 2022, which will move Sysco above the $75 billion annual sales mark for the first time. The stronger earnings growth in the second half reflects continued progress with our rescue for growth, progress on productivity initiatives, lapping last year's Omicron related slowdown and the fact that Q4 is always our seasonal profit high point. All of these efforts are consistent with fulfilling our long-term guidance from Investor Day, which includes exceeding 1.5x market share growth by the end of fiscal year 2024 and adjusted EPS growth of at least 30% over our record 2019 levels. Last but not least, Aaron's comments of at least 10% sales growth this year and 30% EPS growth, and we're confident in our ability to deliver against those mile-markers. And to perhaps reinforce Kevin's point, I am quite pleased with both the opportunity we have to optimize our product portfolio, the cost structure, as Kevin called out for us, but also to work with our customers, utilizing Sysco Brand products to optimize for both of us while also being pleased with our continued ability to pass through increased product inflation costs to our customers and then on to their own customers. Aaron, I'll toss to you for additional comments. Aaron, I'll toss to you for additional comments."
