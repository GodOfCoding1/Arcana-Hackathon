That's a real sign a health in our business  is gross profit dollars that count, inflation did impact our gross margin rates for the enterprise during the quarter as a decreased 79 basis points versus the same period of Fiscal 2021, and finished at a rate of 18.1%. Even with those significant snap back in transformation, operating expense investments, we leveraged our adjusted operating expense structure in delivery expense as a percentage of sales of 13.9% and almost 200 basis point improvement from fiscal 2021 into 64 basis improvements from the same quarter in fiscal 2019.
