For the Washington Metro area, our Same Park industrial assets average occupancy increased to 98.5% for the fourth quarter, a 240 basis points sequential increase. Despite this, I'm proud that the team was able to maintain 88% occupancy in an office market that is 80% occupied and have GAAP rent growth of 5.8% on a 171, 000 square feet of leasing with transaction costs of only $4 per square foot. Same Park NOI was $72.2 million for the three months ended December 31, 2021, which compared to the $66.5 million for the same quarter in 2020, an increase of 8.6%."
