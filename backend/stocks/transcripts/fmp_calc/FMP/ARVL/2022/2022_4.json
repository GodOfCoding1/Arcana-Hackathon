    "content": " The larger market size for commercial vehicles in the U.S., paired with higher average selling prices and margins and IRA tax credits of up to $40,000 per vehicle, create an extremely compelling opportunity for electric commercial vehicles in the U.S.  Last quarter, we announced that we decided not to ramp production at our Bicester UK facility so that we could focus our efforts on the U.S. market. Given the high commonality of componentry between the XL Van and the L Van built in Bicester, this additional validation mileage will provide an opportunity to identify any issues well before building XL preproduction vehicles next year. Secondly, I want to provide more details on the capital raise process we are announcing today in an effort to fund the XL Van start of production in Charlotte next year. This will include reaching out to potential strategic and financial investors in an effort to raise up to $500 million of capital to fund the following activities for our U.S. launch, investments in prototyping, supplier production tooling, the procurement and installation of equipment in the Charlotte factory, working capital for the factory and general corporate purposes. To fund the XL program this year and meet our start of production target date in late 2024, we will need to raise approximately $100 million to $150 million of the $500 million investment."
