    "content": " Furthermore, as a result of our capital management program, and continued strong business performance, we maintain our $1.6 billion cash flow guidance for the year. Assets under management at the end of the quarter was $754 billion, reflecting the market draw-downs and positive net flows from our retirement and wealth management businesses, offsetting modest outflows from AB. At the half year, we have deployed nearly 50% of the $10 billion general account capital commitment to generate additional yield and support growth in AB\u00e2\u0080\u0099s higher multiple private markets business. Net inflows of $1.3 billion in our core Retirement products are up 52%, the highest since our IPO, helping drive record value of new business. This gives us confidence in our $1.6 million of cash flow guidance to the market for the year, with the retirement dividend offsetting some of the equity market impact on our other business lines. In addition, our capital position and financial flexibility was strengthened at holding with $1.3 billion of cash as of quarter end and upstreaming $930 million from our retirement company. Your line is open. Your line is open. So, we will get benefits from the $10 billion fully deployed, not only into additional income, but AB\u00e2\u0080\u0099s strong track record in raising 4x to 5x of third-party capital, which effectuates the synergies between the insurance company and the asset management company and delivering value for shareholders over the long-term. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open."
