    "content": " 90 days ago, I talked about the first quarter and the full year in the context of our medium-term model, which is to deliver mid single-digit revenue growth and about $35 billion of free cash flow from 2022 through 2024. We wrapped on weak performance in the first quarter of last year, which was down 15% and we continue to see strong renewals of these critical software offerings, building on the expanded zSystem\u2019s capacity and traction we have gotten through the strong z15 program. Consulting\u2019s hybrid cloud revenue grew 32% on trailing 12-month basis to $8.3 billion, which makes up 45% of the Consulting business. Your line is open. Now today\u2019s new IBM, that composition being much more skewed towards growth vectors, Software and Consulting, and our solid recurring revenue base that offers us on any economic shocks and I think that\u2019s what you are referencing, Wamsi, in -- if you look at past economic shocks overall. Your line is open. Your line is open. So growing IBM both with incremental sales of Kyndryl and with our broader client base on the back end of a Mainframe product cycle, we are pretty pleased with the operating leverage we see in our business and that gives us the confidence in that free cash flow guidance of $10 billion to $10.5 billion. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. At high single-digit revenue growth, the investments we are going to make, the integrated value it delivers IBM, you take that high single-digit revenue growth, you take low double-digit approach into the low teens, we are in a competitive playing field and it\u2019s an integral part of IBM that drives that software portfolio and that profit. Your line is open."
