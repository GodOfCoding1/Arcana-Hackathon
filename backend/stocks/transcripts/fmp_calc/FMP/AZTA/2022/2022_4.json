    "content": " On a year-over-year basis, organic growth when adjusted to remove the estimated COVID-related revenue from each period was strong at 12%. Fourth quarter organic growth for the segment, when adjusted to remove the estimated COVID-related revenue from each period, was 13% year-over-year. Revenue is expected to be in the range of $175 million to $190 million, with a midpoint supporting growth of approximately 30% year-over-year. We expect Services to be in the range of $86 million to $93 million, which is approximately 6% year-to-year organic growth, excluding COVID. The growth rates are lower here in the fourth quarter, lower in the first quarter than we anticipate, but we think all the things that we're doing are going to help us as we get to the second half of the year, we'll get back into consistent double-digit growth. When I was referring to $1.25 million, that is -- that's a number on our base business, and B Medical did highlight that at the $45 million that we're looking at this quarter, there will be a couple of million."
