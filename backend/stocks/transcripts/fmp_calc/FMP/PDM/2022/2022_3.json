    "content": " Our current leasing pipeline remains stable with over 300,000 square feet currently in documentation and over 150,000 square feet of leasing already executed in the fourth quarter, positioning us to close 2022 with over 2 million square feet of complete leasing, and the portfolio approximately 87% leased. In fact, we've already signed six more new deals in October for another 57,000 square feet, including a well-known Atlanta Financial Services firm, which is relocating their regional headquarters into our LEED Gold 999 Peachtree property from the Buckhead sub market. We have approximately two million square feet of outstanding proposals, which is in line with the past four quarters, with only a few leases expiring for the remainder of the year, we expect positive next space absorption in the fourth quarter, resulting in an anticipated year end lease percentage around 87%. I'm pleased to report that we have closed on the acquisition of what we believe is the highest quality, most differentiated office setting in Atlanta and almost 700,000 square feet 1180 Peachtree is a LEED Platinum Skyline defining asset with a weighted average lease term of over seven years and in place rents at approximately 20% below market rates. In terms of average size, it's been a small kind of market for the most part, I would say the last quarter I think 24 of our 25 deals were under 10,000 square feet."
