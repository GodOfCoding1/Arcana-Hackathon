    "content": " And on that metric, I would note that Piedmont's new tenant leasing activity this past quarter was the most robust it has been in over three years and marked the third consecutive quarter we've exceeded pre -pandemic levels of new tenant leasing. I'm very excited this year, our leasing results for the quarter we completed approximately 50 individual leases totaling 552,000 square feet with just under half of that activity related to new tenants\u2019 leases. This marks the second location for this tenant within our portfolio and demonstrates the frequency in which tends to return to Piedmont for their office space needs with the latest Kimley-Horn lease, new leasing of the South Orange Avenue property now totals approximately a 125,000 square feet since January of 2021. I would note that we don't have really any capital coming in indoor from a disposition standpoint and would not consider levering up to buy back shares at this point, but we do feel that some of these acquisition opportunities that are in the pipeline that are more value-add and core plus and continue to tighten the footprint and grow cash flow are going to create value for shareholders certainly, and that's where we're going to continue to look for."
