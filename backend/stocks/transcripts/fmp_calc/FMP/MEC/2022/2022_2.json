    "content": " Overall, it is clear that both our business with current customers, plus our pipeline of new projects with both existing and potential customers remain very strong as we look towards the second half of 2022. We recorded second quarter net sales of $138.3 million, a 15% increase over the second quarter of the prior year, which was primarily driven by contractual raw material price pass-throughs to customers, commercial pricing increases and improved volumes. But keep in mind that versus the prior year, we have had nearly 150 to 200 basis points of dilution to our current percentage related to higher material cost pass-throughs to our customers, which increased sales but does not impact the margin dollars. For the full year 2022, we continue to expect our capital spending to be between $55 million, and $65 million, which will be focused primarily on investments in new technology and automation, the addition of equipment related to new programs with existing customers and the repurposing of assets at the new Hazel Park, Michigan facility. While supply chain disruptions and inflationary pressures persist, end market demand signals remain strong over the medium term, and we continue to believe our volumes will gradually improve as we move through the second half of 2022 as the supply chain challenges facing our customers start to subside. So overall, I think we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re in a really great shape to bring some production into Hazel Park in second half of this year and continuing to ramp up with new business and core business next year."
