    "content": " Concluding with our military segment, which remains a stable market for us, our customers have a solid backlog for US government contracts, and we continue to see opportunities based on upcoming vehicle updates and unique opportunities such as a new 2-year aftermarket program we are working on for a top customer. Our sales team continues to see business opportunities with new and existing customers coming from, number one, new model and program launches; number two, new product line offerings by customers; number three, outsourcing by OEMs; number four, reshoring by OEMs; and number five, takeover business with several top powersports customers. In the military end market, our market share on tactical wheeled vehicles continues to expand with our customers launching their next-generation of products and new product development activities that have the potential to bolster revenues in the coming years. We can also continue to see a pipeline of interesting M&A opportunities and focus on analyzing the potential targets that could open up new end markets, expand product offerings, develop new relationships with new blue-chip customers and possibly extend our geographic reach. We recorded first quarter net sales of $136.3 million, a 21% increase over first quarter of last year, which was primarily driven by contractual raw material price pass-through to customers, commercial price increases and improved volumes. For 2022, we expect our capital spending to be between $55 million and $65 million, which will be focused primarily on investments in new technology and automation, adding equipment related to new programs with existing customers and the repurposing of assets at the new Hazel Park, Michigan facility."
