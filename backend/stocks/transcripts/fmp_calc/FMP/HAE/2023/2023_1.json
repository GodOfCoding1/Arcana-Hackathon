    "content": " Today we reported first quarter organic revenue growth of 17% and adjusted earnings per diluted share of $0.58, an increase of 16% compared to the first quarter the prior year. We are encouraged by our first quarter results, and we are nearly doubling our full year Plasma organic revenue growth guidance from 7% to 12% to 15 to 20%, primarily due to the growth in volume. Our results for the first quarter of fiscal '23 show continued strength across the business, starting with a new record adjusted gross margin of 55.2%, which beat our previous record from the third quarter of the prior year and delivers additional adjusted gross margin expansion both year-on-year and sequentially. Our first quarter adjusted operating income was $44.9 million, an increase of $7 million or 18% as a percentage of revenue, adjusted operating margin was 17.2% in the first quarter, up 60 basis points compared with the same period in fiscal '22. Your line is open. Your line is open. So to start with the overall view, right, we've -- this business continues to deliver, we grew 15% in aggregate in the quarter, it's quite powerful and a nice trend line that's now got some longevity to it, which gave us confidence in terms of raising the guidance for the year. When I -- when we look at that collectively, we are essentially measuring the non-CSL Plasma growth rates, the trends we're now experiencing, if we continue those that's even better than we had thought about in terms of earlier attainment of some of the long range plan goals, which is great and will certainly help '24. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open."
