    "content": " You'll hear more at our Investor Day next week but to set the stage today, our long-term strategic growth drivers and our flexible subscription business model give us the confidence we can achieve our goal of sustainable double-digit revenue and free cash flow growth beyond fiscal '24. By helping our customers grow, we will grow too. By helping our customers grow, we will grow too. Your line is open. As we look ahead to next year, as I mentioned in the opening commentary, we have a material cohort of multi-year contracts that are coming up for renewal in our base products subscription business, renewing those contracts is one factor that drives us to 2.4 billion in cash flow next year and year-to-date this year, the proportion of multi-year renewals that we're seeing in that cohort is in line with our expectations. Your line is open. One of the things that's also exciting, you're seeing these large subscription counts, 11,000 again -- breaking 11,000 again this quarter, but one of the other exciting aspects here is that our billings growth is actually growing faster than our subs growth, which is a result of the new extension strategy, which has continually added more. Your line is open. And you're right to talk about fab capacity for Intel and other places like that, then has matured to a point where when you combine especially not only with the capabilities of design and build, but ultimately you will see Tandem play a role in that space as well because Tandem as a digital twin allows us to do a handover long term, not yet, Tandem's relatively new to the market, but a digital handover to the owner for doing the lifetime management of the asset as well. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open."
