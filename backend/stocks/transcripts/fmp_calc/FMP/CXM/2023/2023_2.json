    "content": " In addition, during today's call, we'll be making forward-looking statements about the business and about the financial results of Sprinklr that involve many assumptions, risks and uncertainties, including our guidance for the third fiscal quarter of 2023 and full fiscal year 2023 and our actual results might differ materially. This past quarter, the world's largest cosmetics company, L'Or\u00c3\u00a9al, expanded its partnership with Sprinklr, we're now helping to power a digital transformation that will enable their 35-plus brands globally to support beauty advisers in their one-on-one engagement with consumers to deliver more relevant, personalized and transformational experiences at scale whatever -- wherever their customers are on digital. In Q2, the multinational banking and financial services company, Standard Chartered, renewed its partnership with Sprinklr as the company continues its mission to make online banking simpler and faster for customers across 59 markets, it's leveraging Sprinklr to listen to and engage with customers on digital and social channels with the goal of digitizing 70% of the conversations and converting that engagement into sales. During the second quarter, total non-GAAP operating expenses increased 23% year-over-year to $115 million, representing 76% of revenues which was down from 78% of revenues during the same period last year. As of the end of Q2, total remaining performance obligations, or RPO which represents revenue from committed customer contracts that has not yet been recognized was $607.3 million, up 33% compared to the same period last year, while current RPO was $429.2 million, up 29% year-over-year. Starting with Q3 FY '23, we expect total revenue to be in the range of $155 million to $157 million, representing 23% growth year-over-year at the midpoint. As a quick reminder in deriving the net loss per share for modeling purposes, a $9.5 million total tax provision for full year FY '23 needs to be added to the non-GAAP operating loss range just provided."
