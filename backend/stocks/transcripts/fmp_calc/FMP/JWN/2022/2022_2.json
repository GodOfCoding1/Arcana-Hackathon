    "content": " Total sales increased 12% over last year, which includes a benefit of approximately 200 basis points from one week of the Anniversary Sale shifting into the second quarter. This quarter, total Anniversary event sales increased 5% over last year, including one day that fell in the third quarter, despite softening customer trends that began in late June. In the second half of the year, we expect to deliver more significant customer benefits and operational efficiencies by accelerating our work on the following four initiatives: First, improving the consistency and predictability of unit flow through our network; Second, increasing productivity in our distribution and fulfillment centers; Third, accelerating delivery speed; And finally, expanding the market-level selection for in-store shopping as well as same-day and next-day pickup."
