    "content": " Net revenue was up by 8.9% year-over-year for the quarter, approximately $121.4 million. However, we don't have a cruise event in the fourth quarter this year and that event generated approximately $7 million in revenue and $400,000 in profit for the fourth quarter last year, which is not returning this year, but we will have a cruise in 2023. Cable TV advertising revenue was up 16.7% with a favorable rate volume impact of $3.4 million, driven by higher average unit rates, $0.4 million of free video on demand, $1 million increase for CLEO TV and then there was $1.3 million unfavorable or deficiency unit burn-off. During the quarter, the company repurchased $25 million of its 2028 notes at an average price of approximately 91.1% par, resulting in a net gain on retirement of debt of approximately $1.8 million. An additional $18,271 million of the 28 notes were repurchased in the fourth quarter at an average price of approximately 85.75%, bringing total gross debt to a balance of $756.7 million, down from $825 million at the start of the year. We've got our -- we didn't have Tom Joyner cruise this year, we're going to have it next year, it's already 80% sold out. At the high end about -- at $150 million, that would imply only $16 million of EBITDA in the fourth quarter, which obviously doesn't sound right. I mean, the same -- as they've increased their -- look Procter & Gamble and McDonald's and General Motors, these are all entities that have said that they're going to -- and I don't have the exact numbers off the top of my head, but they're going to grow their spend with black owned media from 2% to 4% over the next 2 years."
