    "content": " Cable TV advertising revenue was up 46.9%, excluding political, with a favorable rate volume impact of $5 million, $700,000 of free video-on-demand , $1.5 million increase for CLEO TV advertising and $1.6 million of favorable  burn-off and increased advertising related to UONE owners, Urban One owners. We recorded approximately $2 million of cost method income less administrative expenses for our investment in the MGM National Harbor property for the quarter, compared to $1.7 million last year and $1.7 million in 2019. But just kind of given what you've done in Q1 around -- you're pacing at about $160 million run rate on an annualized basis, and typically, Q1, I think, is kind of the weakest quarter. So assuming that the casino project happens and we spend, call it, $10 million of cash this year on the things we would need to do, including not just referendum, but including all the other things we would need to do, I still have us below 4x at the end of this year. What's your thinking on the cash generating from a business is looking pretty strong, probably in excess of $80 million going forward on free cash flow. Because we're a mix of radio and we are cable and we got digital, and so -- but I am interested in getting to a position of being able to return capital to shareholders, whether that's through a combination of buybacks and dividends or one or the other. But look, if we have to send $100 million out the door that's going to change -- that's going to stall our leverage profile at where it's at right now."
