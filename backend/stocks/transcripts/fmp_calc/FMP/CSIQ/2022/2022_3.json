    "content": " For the full year of 2022, we expect CSI Solar's total battery storage shipment to be in the range of 1.8 to 1.9 gigawatt hours, including approximately 300-megawatt hour through the company's own projects. Canadian Solar's strategy of profitable growth is one of our key differentiators or continue to prioritize investing in long-term growth, which is positioning our business in strategic areas, such as battery storage and leading in the deployment of technology innovation. I agree with Yan and also want to comment that, although, the pricing is growing higher with storage product, the customer demand is -- customer demand continues to be strong, that's because it's more solar and wind, the market requires more and more solid and also the energy price itself is going up, as you all know."
