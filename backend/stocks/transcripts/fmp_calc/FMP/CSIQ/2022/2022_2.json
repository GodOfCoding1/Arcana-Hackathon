Shawn, please go ahead. In Q2, the CSI Solar division delivered 5.1 gigawatts of solar module shipments, 800 megawatt hour of battery storage shipments and $1.8 billion of revenue. Shawn, please go ahead. And so it's not something strange or shocking to us, but we try to make the best decision to better support the U.S. market and to service our customers in the U.S. At this time, I would like to turn the call back over to Canadian Solar's CEO, Dr. Shawn Qu, for final closing comments."
