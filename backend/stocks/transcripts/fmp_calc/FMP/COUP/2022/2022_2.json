    "content": " However, similar to last quarter, I\u2019d be remised if I didn\u2019t mention that customers and prospects continue to operate with some level of caution and that the Delta variant and other variants have some feeling uncertain about the potential impact on their business. Before wrapping up prepared remarks, we\u2019ve got a couple new folks joining the coverage team, and I wanted to remind everyone that in Q4 of last year we had a one-time opening deferred revenue benefit of $14.8 million for LLamasoft for calculated billings. Just to give you a sense for that, obviously, folks on the more traditional core application side are seeing value in supply chain design and planning and vice versa, but what they\u2019re all seeing is, is the overall Business Spend Management opportunity. We don\u2019t have a continued move up market, we have three really strong businesses in enterprise, in upper mid-market and mid-market, which have a really strong growth rate, have a very strong sales and marketing efficiency to them that are operating in and of themselves separately as very good strong businesses. So the idea of attaching one product to another is interesting but that isn\u2019t the driver for us and having said that, without even a focus on attach rates, it\u2019s encouraging to see now multiple quarters of over 30% attach rate on Coupa Pay."
