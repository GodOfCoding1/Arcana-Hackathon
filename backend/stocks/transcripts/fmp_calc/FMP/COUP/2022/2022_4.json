    "content": " Calculated billings for Q4 were $318 million, a year-over-year increase -- organic increase of 25%, after backing out the $15 million of onetime opening deferred revenue from the LLamasoft acquisition. As we continue to invest in our business to drive growth, we expect a non-GAAP gross margin for the year of approximately 71% and non-GAAP operating income for the year of $25 million to $29 million, resulting in non-GAAP net income per share of $0.15 to $0.19 on approximately 88 million weighted average diluted shares. Either for yourself, Rob, or for Tony, help us understand the disconnect that we're seeing in terms of the strong pipeline and the commentary that you gave on the core business being healthy versus what looks to be deceleration in organic growth for fiscal year '23. I mean if you look at our CRPO numbers, our total RPO numbers, new business growth, really, what that illustrates, I think, is core Coupa new business subscription deals have performed very strongly, right, in this last year. And then looking at whatever the time interval it is, whether it's fiscal '24 or '25 or any given quarter, any 1 of those vectors could be the contributor to help us in the continued reacceleration as we move our way past COVID and into the growth years that we're anticipating."
