    "content": " Total sales for the quarter were $277.2 million, representing a year-over-year increase of 8.6% as reported, an increase of 9.8% in constant currency. Excluding special items that affected comparability, our adjusted net income of $24.8 million increased 11.8% year-over-year and our adjusted diluted net earnings per share of $0.76 increased 7% year-over-year. Global organic growth for Q2 was 9.0% compared to the second quarter of last year, which as Curt said was our strongest quarter of 2021. Second quarter SG&A expense, on an adjusted basis was 38.1% of sales, a decrease of 20 basis points from Q2 2021. Excluding the impact of special items discussed earlier, we reported adjusted net income of $24.8 million, an increase of 11.8% compared to the second quarter of 2021. Our Q2 adjusted diluted net earnings per share was $0.76, an increase of 7% compared to the prior year quarter. Are you saying that we're starting to kind of see the top here in Q2 as far as the inflationary pressures and maybe we should start to see some of the pressures abate starting in Q1 or Q2 of next year, or is it going to linger just because you've got a lot of inventory and if it all to turn that because -- the Street is just modeling pretty meaningful increases in operating margins next year and I just don't think that's going to happen."
