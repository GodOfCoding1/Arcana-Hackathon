    "content": " While we\u2019re seeing some positive trends in our ability to fill open roles in our clinics, we expect to experience higher-than-normal, year-over-year labor cost increases for all of 2022. Revenue per treatment was down quarter-over-quarter by approximately $0.35, primarily due to the impact of higher seasonal coinsurance and deductibles, largely offset by increases in the Medicare fee-for-service rate for 2022 and continued improvement in both MA and commercial mix. Putting this all together, while it\u2019s still early to give full guidance for 2023, particularly given the dynamic environment, we currently believe that if COVID largely subsides as a source of increased mortality this year, we feel good about the range of $250 million to $400 million OI increase versus 2022. Q1 is typically a higher mistreatment rate quarter because of flu seasonality, but it was even higher than we would have thought, and that\u2019s largely due to COVID."
