    "content": " Total revenue was up 50% to $26 million, compared to $17.4 million in the year ago period, driven by increased demand for our non-hydroponic product portfolio, which includes items like commercial fans, shelving equipment, chairs, cards, et cetera. Moving to the balance sheet, cash and cash equivalents were $4.8 million as of September 30, 2022, compared to $1.8 million at the same time at the end of our June quarter, increases primarily due to purchasing less, inventory as we previously added to that product stock to ensure availability earlier in the year."
