    "content": " As we closed out the calendar year, we begun to experience a shift in the supply chain environment as freight and shipping costs begun to stabilize returning to pre COVID levels with a improved supply chain, we no longer need to carry these higher level of inventory, and prudently leaned into sales and marketing to offload access inventory. Total revenue was up 12% to 19.3 million, compared to 17.1 million in the year-ago period, driven by strong demand for our in-house product portfolio, including shelving, office, and pet products, as well as hydroponics. As Lawrence mentioned earlier, with the normalization of the supply chain, we have seen freight and shipping costs, return to pre-COVID levels as well as shipping times, when coupled with lower inventory levels and the elimination of our excess warehousing costs, we expect to significantly reduce operating expenses as we as exit our fiscal year."
