    "content": " Nutrient and fertilizer sales have historically accounted for approximately 20% of our total revenue, which means this new in-house product introduction will provide us with a very strong opportunity for both revenue growth and margin expansion going forward. Total revenue was up 52% from the year-ago period to $17.1 million, driven by greater in-house product sales and increased demand for our ventilation products in particular. Gross margin for the quarter was 44.1% compared to 44% in the year ago quarter, with a small increase driven by the greater mix of in-house product sales, partially offset by higher freight and input costs in the quarter."
