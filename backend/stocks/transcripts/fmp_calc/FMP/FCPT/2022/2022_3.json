    "content": " We grew cash rental revenues 12.7% on a year-over-year basis, including the benefit of rental increases and $236 million of acquisitions over the trailing 12 months. This included the acquisition of 26 properties in the third quarter for $70 million at an initial cash yield of 6.3%, reflecting rent credits at closing and near-term rent increases or 6.2% on rents in place as of September 30. In the quarter, we also sold four properties for a combined sales price of $8.6 million, representing a 5.5% weighted average cash capitalization rate. Last week, we also announced the amendment to our credit facility, which reduced pricing and extended maturities by five years on a $150 million of existing term loans and raised $30 million of additional proceeds. On the disposition front, as Bill mentioned, we completed the sale of four properties in the quarter for $8.6 million at a 5.5% cap rate. On a run rate basis, our current annual cash base rent for leases in place as of September 30 is $185.5 million and our weighted average five-year annual cash rent escalator is 1.44%. We are hedged on $325 million of the $430 million of term loans currently at an average all-in rate of 2.79%, including the credit spread for 2023. As also disclosed in the earnings press release, we have $75 million of forward starting swaps in place, effectively fixing the 10-year treasury base rate at approximately 2.6% for contemplated long-term debt issuance."
