    "content": " A reminder to our investors that we think 90% fixed 10% variable rate debt is appropriate for our business, and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve benefited some quarters, but unfortunately, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re impacted in quarters like last quarter. We discussed last quarter but to remind everyone that in October, we announced an amendment to our credit facility, which reduced pricing extended maturities by five years on 150 million of existing term loans and raise 30 million of additional proceeds. As we discussed in the earnings press release, as of December 31, we have 75 million and forward starting swaps in place, effectively fixing the 10 year treasury base rate at 2.6% for that portion of our next long term private note issuance."
