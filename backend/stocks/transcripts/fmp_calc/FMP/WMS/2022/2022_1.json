    "content": " So, out line of sight as we look forward through the year, that\u2019s why we are confident in getting that revenue guidance up to the level that we are talking to and staying in front of not just material cost, which again sequentially month-over-month continues to go up, but as well as the labor inefficiencies as well as transportation cost and a lot of that we will see coming in, in the second half. And that\u2019s why when you hit the third quarter \u2013 fiscal third quarter, plus or minus, you should start seeing a lot more favorability in terms of the cumulative price cost metrics and what those margin metrics might look like just as the catch-up starts materializing based on what we know right now. So again, when we look at pricing, absolutely material costs are one of the first things we look at, but it\u2019s the value proposition, it\u2019s what\u2019s coming at us on labor, transportation, etcetera, and make sure that we can go get that value in that return, so it\u2019s all in when we look at it further for all of the remaining year in that line."
