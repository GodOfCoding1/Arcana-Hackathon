    "content": " While we are a cyclical company and as such, are impacted by the lower end market demand, it is important to highlight secular growth trends around the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act money that would be coming into play during calendar \u00e2\u0080\u009823, onshoring and nearshoring trends, as well as the recent Texas Department of Transportation approval for the use of thermoplastic pipe. I would -- in the manufacturing, even though that's down 43%, that's really due to kind of lack of some large petrochemical type facilities that started this year that don't repeat next year. I think we continue to see good strength of activity in the Southeast, pretty good activity continuing in Texas, where we've seen softness is geographically, like we've talked about, kind of Northeast New England the Northwest and kind of over the third quarter, this has kind of seen the weakness emerge more broadly in the West and in a couple of key states in the Midwest. Clearly, the forecasts are for slower housing starts next year, but kind of based on what we know today, we think those areas that have showed kind of continued strength over the past couple of years will be more resilient and that being kind of Southeast Texas, Florida be more resilient than kind of more mature areas for us like the Midwest and the Northeast."
