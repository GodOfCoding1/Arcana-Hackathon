    "content": " I do think, as we look forward, macroeconomic headwinds could create some pressure with respect to net retention, but we're still seeing our customers continue to want to invest into really enabling and creating a better environment for their sellers. So I think consistent with what we've seen historically and continue to see in -- throughout the year, new sales continues to be a really strong driver of growth, and it's more than half of the growth that we see. But there's also a tremendous amount of white space expansion within those customers, whether it's adding on new users to go wall-to-wall, whether it's helping their data teams really get to higher-quality data or, honestly, a lot of the advanced functionality that we offer is still relatively nascent out in the market. And I think as we've demonstrated in the past, as growth moderates when we're growing off a larger and larger base out in the future, we will see margins naturally increase through operating leverage and less requirements for that upfront costs around sales and marketing capacity and client service capacity to bring on clients at a higher level."
