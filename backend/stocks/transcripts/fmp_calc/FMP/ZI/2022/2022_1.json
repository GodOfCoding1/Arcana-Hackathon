    "content": " With Hitachi, we recently expanded our relationship into their marketing department and grew into $1 million plus ACV engagement that continues to leverage our SalesOS platform across their sales teams and add OperationsOS to leverage ZoomInfo to enrich append and clean across a historically inaccurate database of leads and prospect data for marketing campaign. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Henry, strategically, when I look at the different pieces of the puzzle you\u2019re trying to put together TalentOS, Marketing, Sales, Operations, et cetera, it looks like the company is getting a piece of other categories, budgets through levers in MarketingOS, TalentOS, OperationsOS, SalesOS previously, you're doing it in a way that is synergistic with your core data platform. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. So I think that what we see, if you think about the margin kind of outlook going forward is that from some of those earlier acquisitions, they'll continue to become a little bit more efficient as they're kind of more deeply integrated into the model, but then we have newer acquisitions where we need to, again go through that process of realizing some of that synergy and kind of integrating into the platform where we're able to get those faster sales cycles running as well. Your line is open. I guess, Henry, Cameron, great to hear companies like Alphabet, Shopify leading into the platform, I guess, at a high level, the vision to move up into apps from just the core data layer seems to be resonating \u2013 my question here is if you just think about this quarter biggest dollar beat operating profits that you've seen since the IPO, really strong cash flows. Your line is open."
