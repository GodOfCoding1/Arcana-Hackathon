    "content": " Today, we reported outstanding fiscal first quarter results including higher-than-expected quarterly revenue of $1.06 billion and adjusted gross margin of 43.7%. This was largely driven by revenue growth in India, which was up 150% year-over-year in Q1 to $64 million, reflecting the strong demand environment in that market. If you sort of look through that dynamic and when we get to some kind of new normal, let's sort of assume that's '24, then I think you can look back on this and say that the consistent market demand has been strong, mid-single digits, which I think it is consistently and historically been. And I think it's sort of natural that they are looking at their business in the wake of what's going on in the world, and we've seen a lot of noise out there in the market about what they're doing with their people and what they're doing with their CapEx. But I would say that the priority for them is actually in this space and is on capacity to build out their networks, particularly when you think about it, the last two to three years, first of all, they did not during the sort of COVID period -- they were operationally conservative and really the growth in the market was pretty flat. Backlog for the year end, as we've said, I think everybody needs to get their head around the fact that we're not going to have 25% order growth year-on-year and the specific dynamics that have built up for that. But if you look through all of that and the dynamics around various quarters and even various years, that's very strong, 10% to 12% in a market that's growing at about 5%."
