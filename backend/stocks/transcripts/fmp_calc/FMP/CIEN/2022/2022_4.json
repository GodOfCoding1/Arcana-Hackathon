    "content": " Today, we reported strong fiscal fourth quarter results, including higher than expected revenue of $971 million and adjusted gross margin of 45.2%. Despite the difficult supply environment in fiscal \u00e2\u0080\u009822, we saw robust demand from customers across our segments, regions and applications, as evidenced by annual order growth of 26% and a backlog of greater than $4 billion as we exited the year. As we look to FY \u00e2\u0080\u009823, specifically the combination of continued signs of gradual supply improvement and our significant backlog gives us confidence that we will deliver outsized year-on-year revenue growth and gain market share. That said our revenue growth over the next 3 years will not be linear, particularly given our expectations for outsized revenue growth in fiscal \u00e2\u0080\u009823 predominantly driven by improvement in supply. Your line is open. Your line is open. Katherine, we are ready for the next question. Your line is open. Katherine, we are ready for the next question. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. But I would just say this, if you deconstruct the 10% to 12% average annual growth rate that we project for the next 3 years, and you say we are going to do \u00e2\u0080\u0093 we believe we are going to do 17% in \u00e2\u0080\u009823, which is the midpoint of our guide, then the growth rates for the last 2 years are actually a bit higher than what we have called before."
