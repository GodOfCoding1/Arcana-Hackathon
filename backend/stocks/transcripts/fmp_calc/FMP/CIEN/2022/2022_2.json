I would say this, I think, given what we think our backlog will be at the end of this year and assuming that our suppliers deliver on their commitments to us, we\u2019ll have a growth rate in revenue next year, that\u2019s well above the 6% to 8% than we\u2019ve seen in the past and I can\u2019t give you a number on that. Your line is open. Your line is open. But I -- all we can say about next year today really is that, given where we think our backlog will be at the end of this year, we do expect to have a significantly higher growth rate in 2023 than the 65 to 8% we\u2019ve promised in the past. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open."
