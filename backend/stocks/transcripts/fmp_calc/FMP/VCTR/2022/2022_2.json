    "content": " We returned a total of $34 million through share repurchases and dividends, which is 26% higher than the $27 million returned in the first quarter of this year. On a cash basis, compensation was reduced in the second quarter by 9% to $53.6 million or 24.8% of revenue, down from $58.7 million or 25.5% of revenue in the first quarter. About $2 million of this decline can be traced to seasonally higher payroll taxes and benefits in the first quarter of the calendar year and the majority of the remaining decline relates to the adjustment of our variable incentive compensation pool, which is linked to revenue and earnings. As you think about the comp expense going forward from a cash compensation perspective for 24.8% this quarter, we ebb and flow and flow based on that timing of payroll, but 24% to 25% really is what we look at long-term."
