Your line is open. 32:12 And one point additional point Alex is, if you think about last quarter or some of our historical fee rates, the drop in the fee rate from the fourth quarter to the first quarter is primarily almost entirely because of the WestEnd revenue and the amount that they earn on the revenue. Your line is open. As far as solutions on what's driving some of the flows in there, first, WestEnd Advisors, our new acquisition and franchise resides within our solutions bucket, our ETF business Victory shares, which I think was mentioned has been net flow positive for probably over the last year and a half, and that's driving it. Your line is open. And if you look at our history of doing acquisitions, I think they've been really shareholder accretive, create a lot of value and we think there's a lot of opportunities in the market and that's how we're going to use our capital and being able to do the buyback program at the levels we are, being able to pay the dividend at the levels we are is really a reward to our shareholders for our growth and our cash flow growth. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open."
