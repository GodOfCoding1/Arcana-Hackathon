    "content": " The decrease in other service fees was mainly related to seasonality in credit and debit card fees, which were lower by $3 million due to higher purchase activity in Q4, and $4 million contingent insurance commission that typically happened in the last quarter of the year. These decrease is were partially offset by a $7 million increase in employment compensation cost mostly driven by higher incentives and commissions, as well as seasonality in payroll taxes that increased by $4 million, a $4 million increase in credit and debit card processing expense due in part to lower volume incentives and a $3 million increase in professional fees."
