    "content": " Skyworks delivered record third quarter results with double-digit year-over-year growth and revenue and non-GAAP earnings per share, highlighting our resilient business model and disciplined execution. Fueling our momentum going into the second half of the calendar year, with our customer count doubling year-over-year in a broad markets portfolio on pace for $2 billion in annualized revenue, our business is more diverse than ever. So we just guided September up 14% sequentially and obviously that is more and higher in terms of sequential growth at the large customer, based on the known design wins that we are shipping today and we do expect further sequential growth into the December quarter with that customer as well total Skyworks revenue. And going-forward, looking forward to the September quarter, obviously that is a very strong mobile quarter as we execute on some of those launches with the large customer as well with many of our other customers, but we still expect our broad markets to be up double digit year-over-year in the September quarter. And that's one of the reasons why the mid-to-high tier really appreciates Skyworks, because we can do a lot of good work with those partners and really help lift their business with our teams beneath them under the wings here, supplying the right kinds of technology."
