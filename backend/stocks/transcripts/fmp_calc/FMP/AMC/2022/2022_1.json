I would now like to turn the conference over to John Merriwether, Vice President of Capital Markets and Investor Relations. Before I turn the webcast over to Adam, let me remind everyone that some of the comments made by management during this webcast may contain forward-looking statements that are based on management's current expectations. Numerous risks, and uncertainties and other factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those that might be expressed today. The company undertakes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information or future events. On this webcast, we may reference non-GAAP financial measures such as adjusted EBITDA, operating free cash flow, operating cash burn, operating cash generated among others. This afternoon's webcast is being recorded, and a replay will be available in the Investor Relations section of our website at amctheatres.com later today. Good afternoon, everyone and thank you for joining us today. Following on the heels of our progress throughout 2021, AMC's first quarter of 2022 marked yet another milestone. Thanks in part to Sony's UNCHARTED and Warner Brothers, The Batman, it was our best first quarter in 2 years. We are especially encouraged that when they did come to our theaters, our guests have been spending like never before, with revenues per patron through the roof at AMC up 34% above pre-pandemic norms and meaningfully higher than was seen at our largest competitors. During our last earnings webcast, we noted the timing of when big movies would release this year, not because of streaming and not because of COVID fears among patrons, but rather solely because of what titles would open when. We told you in our last call that the first quarter of 2022 would be the softest quarter of this year, and that box office numbers would improve sequentially as the year progressed. This view remains exactly how we see this year unfolding, with an improving box office and improving financial performance at AMC each and every successive quarter. But the real news of the day is the $187.4 million domestic opening, and the $450 million global opening of Disney's Doctor Strange. This one was the biggest movie opening of 2022, and the second biggest opening of the pandemic era, second only to Spider Man: No Way Home. Given that AMC is the largest movie theater company in the world, we can say to our shareholders with some glee and delight that the resilience of movie theaters is right now on clear display and that the future of the cinema is bright. Indeed, we've already kicked off the second quarter with Sonic who raced his way to the highest domestic opening weekend of all time for a video game adaptation and has thus far generated nearly $350 million worldwide box office revenue. And as I said just a moment ago, this past weekend, Doctor Strange, Doctor Strange, Doctor Strange, Doctor Strange. But we believe this is just the tip of the iceberg for what's to come in this summer, and the balance of 2022. We're just 2.5 weeks away from the premiere of my personal favorite, Paramount and Tom Cruise's long awaited and highly anticipated Top Gun: Maverick. In my view, it's a cinematic masterpiece, and oh my, are we going to sell tickets for Top Gun: Maverick at AMC. The second quarter also will include such crowd pleasers, as Universal's Jurassic World Dominion and for audiences young and old, Back from Infinity and Beyond, Pixar's Lightyear. Later in the year, in the second half, we have one amazing title after another, especially including Baz Luhrmann's brilliant biopic of Elvis, starring Tom Hanks as Colonel Parker. Along with Illumination's Minions: The Rise of Gru, Marvel's Thor: Love and Thunder, Jordan Peele's latest original edge of your seat horror flick, Nope. We'll finish the year with Warner Brothers, DC Comics based Black Adam starring Dwayne The Rock Johnson, and three more Disney films, which are sure to be monstrous hits, including the animated Strange World, and two highly anticipated Tentpole Disney sequels. Marvel's Black Panther: Wakanda Forever, and James Cameron's Avatar 2, the sequel to Avatar at the time of its original release, the highest worldwide grossing movie of all time. I've had the privilege of spending some time with the brilliant James Cameron and his producing partner John Landau, and I've seen actual footage from Avatar 2 which is just glorious. As a result, the entire movie industry is going to end 2022 in grand style. Just as Nicole Kidman proclaimed in our ever so successful television advertising, which has attained a cult like status movie goers are so eager to return to the magic offered at AMC theaters. And for just a few hours, they want to escape, they want to escape the news, the internet, war, politics, inflation, interest rate hikes, their phone, and the interruptions that inevitably come when at home. At AMC, we are very optimistic about the outlook for the 2022 box office that we believe to be close to double that of 2021 and 4x that of 2020. Many of us on this call can remember the revealing and clarifying language that came out of the 1992 presidential campaign when James Carville said it's the economy, stupid. Well, for the movie theater business, it's the movies, stupid. And oh, do we have hit movies now coming to an AMC theater near you. During the first quarter, we welcomed 39 million guests to our theaters around the world. And our Q1 2021, sorry, Q1 2022 attendance generated revenue of $785.7 million. In addition, our Q1 '22 adjusted EBITDA improved by $233 million to a loss of $61.7 million. While Q1 revenue and attendance were well below pre-pandemic levels, this is precisely as we predicted in our most recent quarterly earnings call. In Q1, we saw that the box office momentum built as the quarter progressed. Consolidate admissions revenue per patron was up 23.9% and consolidated food and beverage revenue per patron was up 40%, both of this compared to the first quarter of 2019. In our domestic business, admissions revenue per patron increased by 28.5% compared to pre-pandemic Q1 2019 and our international business achieved a 15% increase. The admissions revenue per patron growth was driven by increasingly choosing to upgrade to the very best possible site and sound experiences that could only be found at our premium large format offerings such as IMAX, Dolby Cinema and AMC Prime. PLF, or premium large format attendance, represented 16% of our domestic attendance in Q1 of 2022 compared to 13% in the first quarter of 2019. And in our international markets, Q1 2022 PLF tenants represented 9.5% of compared to 8.1% in the first quarter of 2019. In addition, we also benefited from an overall favorable Showtime mix, coupled with pricing adjustments, including blockbuster and opening weekend pricing. From a food and beverage perspective, we continue to enjoy exceptionally strong food and beverage revenue per patron as our guests enjoy the full outside-the-home entertainment experience that is offered at AMC. In our domestic markets, food and beverage spend per patron in the first quarter was $7.52. And in the international business, food and beverage spend per patron was $4.40, and that is 35% higher than pre-pandemic Q1 of 2019. Consolidated other revenue per patron in Q1 2022 increased by 82.4% compared to the same period in 2019, with domestic other revenue per patron increasing 93.5% and international other revenue per patron increasing by 61.9%. These statistics reflect an increasingly higher percentage of guests that are choosing to reserve their seats and to order their food and beverage in advance using our industry-leading website and app, together with the benefit of diversification initiatives that we've deployed such as renting our theaters during off-peak times to businesses and government organizations for meetings or other events. In an ongoing effort to enhance efficiency, we continue to be extremely agile in adjusting payroll hours and flexing showtimes to reflect the market demand and to optimize our efficiency. For example, our Q1 domestic attendance of 25.8 million guests represented 46.9% of Q1 2019 attendance, but it also represented 71% of Q1 2019's attendance per showing. As anticipated and as discussed during last quarter's webcast, cash burn this quarter was adversely impacted by normal seasonal Q1 working capital needs. Our working capital almost always comes under pressure during Q1 following a strong Q4 holiday box office, and this year was no exception. Looking ahead, we expect our cash burn to improve sequentially through the year, with Q2 being better than Q1, but still relatively weak. Our priorities remain unchanged: One, ensuring that we have sufficient liquidity to manage through the recovery phase of our business; two, strengthen our balance sheet by reducing our debt and associated interest costs; three, invest in our business to enhance the guest experience; and four, opportunistically pursue value-enhancing initiatives, including those that lead to diversification of our business. As we previously reported, earlier this year, we completed a highly successful capital raising, issuing $950 million of 7.5% first lien notes. During the first quarter of 2022, we also repaid approximately $45 million of deferred rent, reducing our deferred rent balance to approximately $272 million. Actively managing our theater portfolio is ongoing at AMC as we add new high-performing locations and eliminate low performance, all with the goal of improving guest satisfaction and optimizing our overall profitability. During the quarter, we added 3 new theaters and we closed 12. In addition, in early April, we announced the acquisition of 7 formerly bow tie cinema locations in Connecticut, Upstate New York and Annapolis, Maryland. And last month, we announced a significant investment to dramatically upgrade the sight and sound experience at AMC through the installation of laser projection equipment at 3,500 auditoriums in the U.S. through 2026. This equipment has a value of approximately $0.25 billion, although our upfront capital investment is minimal based on our agreement with our partner, . Net CapEx, including landlord contributions, in Q1 was $34.2 million. And for 2022, separate and apart from any M&A activity, we're expecting net CapEx to be in the range of $150 million to $200 million. As a result of this investment of $27.9 million, we recorded a mark-to-market gain of $63.9 million in the first quarter of 2022. The third operating enhancements and efficiency optimization initiatives implemented over the last 2 years have positioned us very well, and we continue to focus on initiatives to grow our revenue, increase our efficiency, enhance the guest experience and diversify our business, all with the goal of growing shareholder value and ensuring our success in a post-COVID environment. Before we open up this webcast to questions, I'd like to update you on some of our key strategic initiatives to enhance value for AMC and for our shareholders. Let's start with our strategy at AMC, which can best be described with three unmistakable words: recovery, agility, transformation. As for recovery, over the last 5 quarters, our financial performance has clearly indicated that AMC is on a glide path to recovery from the impact of COVID-19. For sure, in 2020, COVID took AMC to our knees. But like the plot in any great fight movie, in 2021, AMC got up off the canvas, dusted ourselves off, steadied ourselves and started to play on offense again. We get stronger and stronger as each day passes, and pretty soon, we will be back to normal, punching away as you would expect, I'm the #1 player in theatrical exhibition. And we already believe that given the expected movie slate, 2023 will be a better year than 2022. If 2020 and 2021 have demonstrated anything, it's that the management team at AMC is expert in navigating our way through uncharted waters. Therefore, I have every confidence looking forward that AMC will continue to cope well as we Bob and weave and adjust our course as may be required. Taken as a whole, AMC has demonstrated a remarkable ability and achieved a remarkable track record of navigating successfully through change. At the same time, armed as we have been by our shareholders, with more than $1 billion war chest, we also will be looking for a transformational and value-creating metamorphosis of what AMC is. But you underestimate us, and you underestimate us mightily if you do not think we are looking to change AMC, to make it a bolder and grander enterprise. But during the pandemic, AMC demonstrated a keen insight into how companies could rescue themselves from liquidity challenges. At a time when the NASDAQ is off 9% in overall value, our investment in Hycroft Mining has increased by more than 30% as of Friday's closing price. As I've said before, those who think of AMC just in terms of the company that existed pre-pandemic are looking through a rearview mirror to the past instead of looking through the front windshield towards the future. There will be more Hycroft's ahead, not gold or silver mining per se, although I must say that gold and silver mining was a fun way to start. For sure, though, we plan to be deliberative and disciplined in investing in opportunities to enhance our existing business or to diversify in the previously unexplored markets or into industries where we can use our bold thinking, penchant for innovation and capital raising experience to unlock value for AMC and for our shareholders. In addition to talking about our strategy, I also would like to share a quick update on a few previously announced initiatives. Among other popcorn-related concepts, later this year, you'll be able to order and have delivered your home our AMC Feature Fare and classic menu items, including, of course, AMC perfectly popcorn, flat bread, pretzel bites and other snack items. This service will be piloted in key markets, such as Chicago this summer, with plans to launch system-wide in the United States in the fourth quarter of this year. We are also developing, as you know, a line of microwave and ready-to-eat popcorn products to be sold at grocery stores and other outlets so that customers can enjoy our unique and differentiated popcorn offering in the comfort of their homes. Our hope, too, is that this can be a quite lucrative business opportunity for AMC. They've already helped us to stimulate the sale of movie theater tickets for movies like Spiderman: No Way Home, Dune and The Batman or to increase the effectiveness of other AMC programs like AMC Investor Connect, which now has some 665,000 enrolled members. As for cryptocurrency, with great fanfare, we now expect a wide array -- we now accept a wide array of cryptocurrencies for online payments at AMC. The same IT programming that was required for us to accept cryptocurrency also enabled us to accept other payment types including Apple Pay, Google Pay, PayPal, Bit Pay and Venmo, among others. Taken together, these various new payment options impressively recently represented about 35% of our total online payments. AMC has taken in the past a number of big, smart and innovative steps on theater ticket and food and beverage pricing. Just look at our revenues per patron in Q1, which have been well in the March with obvious positive result. So far, that rational view of the laws of supply and demand has worked well for AMC. During 2021 and so far during 2022, we acquired one-third of the former Arclight Pacific theater circuit located in major metropolitan markets like Los Angeles, San Diego, Washington, D.C. and Chicago, and we acquired about 3/5 of Bow Tie cinemas locations, mostly in Connecticut, along with Upstate New York and Annapolis, Maryland. When we add AMC's expertise, unique guest offerings and industry-leading loyalty programs, these new theater locations begin to sore. As an example, our mid-2021 acquisitions of the Grove 14 and Americana Brand 18, both in the Los Angeles market, have consistently ranked among the 30 highest grossing movie theaters in the entire United States since joining the AMC family. We will continue to explore adding high-profile interesting, potentially profitable theaters to the AMC network. In addition to PLFs, our first major broadscale projector upgrade since the transition to digital was announced 3 weeks ago by AMC as we introduced a new premium format, Laser at AMC, where we will begin deploying the latest laser projection technology in our theaters at some 3,500 auditoriums across the United States over the next several years. With this upgrade, AMC moviegoers can expect improved picture contrast, maximum picture brightness and more vivid color. In short, a much better viewing experience, they will get moviegoers off their couches at home and into our theaters. As I conclude, I'd like to make a special comment to our avid, enthusiastic and passionate retail investors who have embraced AMC with gusto over the past 1.5 years. As an example, there is one group of particularly committed AMC shareholders who sent me a binder, then followed up by an e-mail that were filled with about 1,000 different ideas for AMC. Looking more broadly, the ideas keep coming and keep flowing to AMC from our shareholder base. So literally, thousands and thousands of times, I have personally seen your observations and advice. And I hear the advice coming in Twitter post after Twitter post that comes from our approximate 4 million retail investors, who own the vast, vast, vast majority of our 516.8 million issued shares. Most is well intended, but some might be hurled at us with an intent of actually harming me or the company, possibly even coming in from short sellers or others motivated by malevolent intentions. Also, running a company with such broad interest as AMC is an art form, not a science. And even with my well disclosed and advanced stock sales, I still have an interest in 2.9 million AMC shares. That is 793,974 shares that I own outright and 2,010,076 granted but unvested AMC shares in addition. My every incentive is to think and to act like a shareholder to maximize the long-term value of AMC shareholders, because like you, that's what I am. In summary, our first quarter of 2022 was encouraging. AMC just put a very big weekend on the books, and we are highly optimistic that it's a harbinger of things to come. And if you want to know what's to come, Top Gun: Maverick, Memorial Day Weekend, then Jurassic World Dominion, and then more and more and more and more. Sean, now let's turn to questions starting with questions from our shareholders. Specifically, there's questions about people's voting materials, when they will be received, what is on the docket for voting at the shareholder meeting. Look at the Financial Performance tab, it's all there. As for voting materials, you should usually allow about 2 weeks or so for brokerage firms to get the proxy materials to you as a shareholder at AMC. If you do not receive proxy materials by mid-May, you definitely should contact your broker or our proxy solicitor, DFK, who has a special toll-free number for AMC shareholders at 1-888-625-2588. As for our international shareholders, many of whom will be listening to this call today, we have a particular appreciation for those of you around the world who still follow AMC. As I said in my prepared remarks, our hope is that we can be there in the fourth quarter of this year, 2022. There's a lot of action behind the scenes, including discussions with various major retailers. And I'm sure that we will, sort of like Cracker Jack has a gift in every box, I wouldn't be surprised if we have some benefit relating to AMC Theatre moviegoing in every box of our perfectly popcorn. One of the many questions that -- sorry, one of the many suggestions that we've had is relating to AMC merchandise. We are in the process of figuring out now how to make AMC-branded merchandise and movie themes merchandise available to our guests, whether at theaters or online. There are like 5,000 movie theaters in the country, and these two have consistently been performing in the top 30 ever since we took them over. In terms of what we do, the first thing that we look at is how can we upgrade the product, bring AMC service levels and amenities into the theaters that we acquire. We will be doing the same thing at the Bow Tie theaters in Connecticut, Upstate New York and Annapolis that we did out West. In the case of some of our theaters, we're going to be installing IMAX locations or Dolby Cinema locations or both. Beyond improving the product, we are also bringing our loyalty programs to these theaters. AMC Stubs, our frequent moviegoing program; AMC Stubs A-List, our monthly subscription program. We are also then, as we convert customers from these theaters into our loyalty program, we\u2019re then communicating with them frequently, certainly on a weekly basis to let them know what's coming at AMC. We are adding to all this local marketing through social media, including paid media, and as I said, it's all working really well so far. Well, I have seen suggestion after suggestion that you'd like to see us pay a dividend. Several years ago, AMC owned 50% of Open Road Films, where we did make our own movies, and in fact, got the Oscar in 2016 for the Best Picture of the Year with Spotlight. We've had very serious conversations with some very well-known movie studio executives, major movie directors and it is something that has our attention. But even if we were to make our own movies, now is a good time to put in a good word to our long-standing studio partners. Hollywood is turning out great product again, and it's finally being released exclusively in theaters for exclusive theatrical window. And we are just -- I just want to say how grateful we are to the likes of, you name it, Disney, Universal, Warner Bros., Sony, Paramount, Lions Gate, all the makers of movies. We continue to make it very clear that we would be very pleased to show some of their bigger, better movies. But if we can convince the streamers, that it's in their interest to show movies theatrically, that might be another -- yet another way of getting more movie product into our theaters. While crypto itself is modest in usage, when you take all of those new payment types that we introduced for AMC as a result of our exploring crypto, again, it's in the neighborhood of one-third of our total online ticketing is now being paid for in all these various alternate payment methods. And we want to make sure that if we do embrace issuing cryptocurrency rather than just accepting cryptocurrency, that we anticipate the new regulatory climb as well, and we stay on the right side of the law. And we, historically -- sorry, we only have 4 of these programs so far, but historically, we've been giving away these NFTs. And I would say that with respect to our competition, we are way out in front of any other movie theater exhibitor anywhere on the planet. Well, look, I do think that's playing out before our very eyes. If you look at the pandemic, the period when movie theaters were shut, studios played around with every possible variation of theatrical release, including taking some movies to the home simultaneous with that release. In other cases, just taking movies to the home and not releasing them in theaters overall. I think we've convinced Hollywood that the way to optimize their profitability is for them to support their streaming services, but also to support theatrical exhibition. Beyond that, though, if you really look at the darker times for revenue generation over the past 24 months, it's been because there just wasn't a lot of good movies coming out. What's happened of late that started in the fourth quarter of 2021, finishing up with huge hit in Spiderman: No Way Home, third biggest movies all time. Now we are seeing Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness, Top Gun: Maverick is around the corner, Jurassic World Dominion is around the corner, the summer is filled with movies, the fall, Christmas comes Avatar 2. Beyond that, then AMC, we, ourselves, we have a further obligation on top of just having good movies at our disposal. As I said, we're investing sufficient funds to get $0.25 billion of laser projection equipment into our theaters coming down soon. So take all that together, combine it with the fact that people go into movie theaters for a century, I'm just certain of 1 thing in life: The movie theater industry has an entry at AMC as a company. Will AMC consider more Dreamscape locations, for example. Well, for those of you who don't know what Dreamscape is, it's a really innovative virtual reality product. But the fact that we are willing to embrace Dreamscape 3 or 4 years ago, I think is yet another signal of AMC's willingness to embrace alternate content. And this summer, we experimented with a variety of interesting concepts showing concert movies, some live, some on tape. For 2 of the past 3 years, we showed NFL games on Sunday afternoons in our theaters. And I just have a strong view that if we can obtain the rights to show professional sporting events or collegiate sporting events in our theaters going forward, that would be very popular with our guests. But if you ever want to get enthusiastic about where we are on that road, just look at the $187.4 million, 26% of it was ours, from the Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness this weekend, go see it at an AMC theater near you."
