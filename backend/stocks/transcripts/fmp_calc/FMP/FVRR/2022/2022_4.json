    "content": " Growth of large wallet customers also continues to be robust, those with an annual spend of $10,000 or more grew 29% year-over-year, significantly higher than overall buyer growth. As we mentioned in the shareholder letter, in any of the previous years, it was very consistent that our buyers typically increase their spend on the platform from the first half of the year to the second, as our wallet share expands over time, and as the holiday season drives additional investments."
