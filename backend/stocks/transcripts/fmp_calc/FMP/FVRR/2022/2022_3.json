    "content": " You talked about the accelerated supply coming to the marketplace, how much unfulfilled demand would you say is on the platform, where you think there's an appetite to buy, but they're just not able to find the freelance or that they want for whatever reason. So over time, you enjoy \u00e2\u0080\u009cthis more\u00e2\u0080\u009d everything that we've done in terms of focusing on our core business, without neglecting the strategic investments that we're doing, are really focusing on the money making parts of our machine, improving them, improving the way we do our customer acquisition and our continued focus in high-value buyers, larger buyers, the focus on fiber business. So, all-in-all, I think that from that perspective, obviously, we're very happy with the outcome, and I think it brought us to a good place where it also will allow us to accumulate cash so we can be opportunistic when the market rebounds or show signals where there's opportunity to go back into growth, that is going to give us a lot of ammunition to actually do that very effectively. To augment on what Ofer said on the product side, I think that when we look at it, there's really two areas, where one is the core business, where we continue to improve top-of-funnel efficiency, improve conversion, retention, there's a lot to do in a true e-commerce market base."
