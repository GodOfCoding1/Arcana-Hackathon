    "content": " Just curious on the broader environment you're seeing, because I think there's sort of a push and build between your workers that still want flexibility and you increasingly could find employers who want cost flexibility and how, even though there might be some headwinds you're seeing from the macro environment, maybe there's a broader theme around aligning flexibility with your platform that could offset some of it. And we think that in the current environment, where a lot of companies are also doing cost reductions are thinking about how to lower their fixed expenses, they're using variable expenses or flexible talent as a way to close talent gaps and make sure that their performance doesn't decrease while their cost structure needs to improve over time. Sometimes it manifests in more frequent purchases that are not necessarily very large, and sometimes it's less frequent and much larger types of projects depending on their complexity and within that, within Fiverr Business also the ability to use not just individual talent, but also agencies that have higher capacity and multiple talents to accommodate for more complex projects."
