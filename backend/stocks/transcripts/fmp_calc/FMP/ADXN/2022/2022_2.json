    "content": " Our mGlu2 negative allosteric modulator program for mild neurocognitive disorders associated with Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and depression has entered clinical candidate selection phase. Today, I would like to share with you the progress we have made in four of our most advanced preclinical programs, the GABAB positive allosteric modulator program, the mGlu7 negative allosteric modulator program, the mGlu2 negative allosteric modulator program, and the muscarinic M4 positive allosteric modulator program. We have been progressing significantly our mGlu7 negative allosteric modulator program for post traumatic stress disorder, or PTSD, as we have now identified a clinical candidate drug to enter IND-enabling studies. We believe that mGlu2  have initiated a Phase 2 proof of concept clinical trial in treatment resistant depression with mGlu2 NAM compound, and they are currently running a drug-drug interaction study with Donepezil suggesting they prepare a study in mild NCD patients with a combination between their compound and Addex . In summary, our drug discovery engine has achieved great progress with multiple drug candidates advancing towards IND-enabling studies, the renewed commitment of our partner Indivior, the delivery of a candidate ready to start IND-enabling studies in the mGlu7 program are further validation of the quality and productivity of our allosteric modulation platform. In terms of expenses, R&D expenses of 5.7 million are primarily related to research and development activities on our dipraglurant program and to a lesser extent, our GABAB PAM, mGlu2 and M4 PAM programs."
