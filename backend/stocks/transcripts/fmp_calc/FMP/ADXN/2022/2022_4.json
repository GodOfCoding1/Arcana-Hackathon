    "content": " As a reminder, 71149 is a metabotropic glutamate receptor subtype 2 or M2 positive allosteric modulator discovered in partnership with Janssen Pharmaceutical and by Johnson & Johnson Company using Addex's proprietary allosteric modulator platform. The rationale for inhibiting mGlu7 receptors as an approach for treating stress-related disorders, including PTSD, is based on a wide body of preclinical evidence from the anxiolytic profile of mGlu7 knockout or knockdown animals to studies using mGlu7 negative allosteric modulators performed at Addex but as well as in many other groups."
