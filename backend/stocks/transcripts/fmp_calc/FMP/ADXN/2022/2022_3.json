Today, I would like to share with you the progress we have made in four of our most advanced preclinical programs: the GABAB positive allosteric modulator program, mGlu7 and mGlu2 negative allosteric modulator program, and muscarinic M4 positive allosteric modulator program. We have made significant progress with our mGluR7 negative allosteric modulator program for stress related disorders, including post-traumatic stress disorder, or PTSD, as we have selected a clinical candidate drug to enter IND-enabling study."
