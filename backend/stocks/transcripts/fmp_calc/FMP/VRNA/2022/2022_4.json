    "content": " As far as your second question on payer acceptance, I think it's really important to think about ensifentrine differently than what you typically see with launches today, because launches today typically launch within Medicare Part D as in Dog is involved or commercial and those payer channels tend to have very tight restrictions for new products at launch. I think that's -- when we go back to a question earlier, which is around pricing, one of the reasons why the payers are believing ensifentrine will be priced at a premium versus the current products is because of that benefit that ensifentrine has on exacerbations and potentially overall healthcare utilization within their plans."
