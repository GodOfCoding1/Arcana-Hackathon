    "content": " Looking at our fourth quarter 2022 results, we were pleased to report another strong quarter during which we generated consolidated adjusted EBITDA of $3.4 billion, which was up more than 20% compared to the fourth quarter of 2021. This capital includes projects that will address growing demand like Frac VIII at Mont Belvieu, the Bear processing plant in the Permian Basin, compression and optimization projects on existing pipelines, new treating capacity in the Haynesville, additional gathering and compression build-out in the Permian, improved efficiencies and emission reduction work, as well as preliminary spend related to carbon capture projects. Now for our 2023 adjusted EBITDA guidance, given the continued domestic and international demand for our products and services, the ability of our base business to operate through various market cycles as well as our market outlook for the year, we expect our adjusted EBITDA to be between $12.9 billion and $13.3 billion. So we're so well positioned both to feed our own LNG project, should we get that to FID, but regardless even our results, we're seeing volumes find their way from North Marcellus to  and Trunkline and through all of our pipeline system to the Gulf Coast already to see the growing demand for LNG. This is Tom Long. And as we continue through the year, if you were comparing 2022 results, with what we've got in the guidance for 2023, you're going to have about probably $400 million to $600 million that was coming just from the, what we call the price and the spreads that we saw. This is Tom Long. This is Tom Long. This is Tom Long."
