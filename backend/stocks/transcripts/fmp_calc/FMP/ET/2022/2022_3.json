    "content": " Crude oil transportation volumes increased to a record 4.6 million barrels per day compared to 4.2 million barrels per day for the same period last year, driven by higher crude oil prices and strong refinery demand as well as the addition of the Ted Collins Link and Cushing South pipelines and increased throughput through our Houston terminal. Looking at our growth capital spend for the 9 months ended September 30, 2022, Energy Transfer spent approximately $1.3 billion on organic growth projects, primarily in the midstream, intrastate and NGL refined products segment, excluding SUN and USA Compression CapEx. For 2022, adjusted EBITDA guidance given our strong performance for the first 9 months of the year as well as continued demand for our products and services, we now expect our adjusted EBITDA to be between $12.8 billion and $13 million. But you nailed it when you said looking at trying to pay down as much as we can of it if not moving some of it to the revolver only because when you look out over the remainder of the year and you see what the free cash flow continues throughout the year, we have a lot of financial flexibility right now is the way I'd like to leave that, and we're going to play the best options we can of reaching all the targets that we want we're going after."
