    "content": " During the first quarter of this year, we completed construction of the final phase of the Mariner East pipeline, which brought our total NGL capacity on the Mariner East pipeline system to more than 365,000 barrels per day, including ethane. DCF attributable to the partners as adjusted was $2.1 billion for the first quarter of 2022 compared to $3.9 billion for the first quarter of 2021, again, as a result of the impact to the prior period from Winter Storm Uri. This was primarily due to higher food transportation volumes on our Texas crude pipelines, improved performance on our Bakken and Bayou Bridge pipelines, increased throughput at our Gulf Coast terminals as well as the addition of the Enable assets in December of 2021. Gathered gas volumes were 17.3 million MMBtus per day compared to 12 million MMBtus per day for the same period last year due to the addition of the Enable assets, increased production in South Texas as well as additional gathering capacity from the Permian Bridge pipeline in West Texas. Now turning to our 2022 adjusted EBITDA guidance, given our strong performance in the first quarter as well as continued increasing demand for our products as we move through the rest of the year, we now expect our adjusted EBITDA to be between $12.2 billion to $12.6 billion. And moving to our growth capital update for the 3 months ended March 31, 2022, Energy Transfer spent approximately $390 million on organic growth projects, primarily in the midstream, interstate and NGL and refined products segment, excluding Sun and USA compression CapEx."
