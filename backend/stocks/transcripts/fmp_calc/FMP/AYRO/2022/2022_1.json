    "content": " Revenue in the first quarter of 2022 was $1.03 million, a 30% year-over-year improvement, and a 26% sequential improvement from the fourth quarter of 2021. Due in large part to reduced headcount, the elimination of many consultants previously used and careful general expense control, we reduced our net loss by another $1 million dollars to $4.6 million in the first quarter, versus a net loss of $5.6 million in the first quarter of 2021. This is a continued dramatic improvement in net loss under my tenure $7.4 million in reduced net losses, versus a quarter six months ago, and $3.2 million in reduced net losses, versus the fourth quarter of 2021 even as we enjoyed record revenue in each of the last two quarters. Expense control remains a vital part of our strategy even as we now focus on ramping design and production efforts for the AYRO Z, a 62% decline in the net loss in my first two quarters, along with a 41% sequential reduction in net loss from the fourth quarter to the first quarter speaks well to our team's ability to execute and maintain cost discipline. Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure in the first quarter of 2022, was a loss of approximately $4.2 million, versus a loss of $3.8 million in the year ago quarter and a loss of $7.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2021, representing a sequential improvement of approximately $2.9 million. Net loss in the first quarter was $4.6 million, which was an improvement from the net loss of $5.6 million in the third quarter of 2021, and a net loss of $7.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2021."
