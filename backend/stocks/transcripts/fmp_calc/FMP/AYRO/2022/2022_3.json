    "content": " With respect to our financial results in the third quarter of 2022, our revenue declined sequentially due to the quality control issues I discussed in our last earnings call, to recap, in the second quarter, we received some defective battery components from a foreign supplier that were to be used in the lithium-ion battery-powered version of the current vehicle, we rejected this shipment of components, which led us to not have any inventory of lithium-ion battery-powered current vehicles to sell. The sequential decrease in net loss from the second quarter of 2022 was largely a result of a write-off relating to the aforementioned effective components and impairments, as well as a write-down of the third quarter of 2022 of the Club Car discount of all current vehicles, previously sold in 2022."
