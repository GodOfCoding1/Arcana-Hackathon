    "content": " We're currently generating sales on our first-generation, low-speed, purpose-built electric utility vehicle called Current that's based on our legacy partnerships with Cenntro for component delivery from China, and with Karma Automotive for manufacturing and assembly and with Club Car for end product distribution. With its numerous food box architectures, configuration solutions and enabling technology features we intend to offer such as telematics, logistics support and route optimization, we believe the advanced Ayro Z electric vehicles will be an excellent solution for food delivery in many urban environments and address general utility needs in campus and arena environments. Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure, in the second quarter of 2022 was a loss of approximately $4.2 million versus a loss of approximately $5.9 million in the second quarter of 2021, and a loss of approximately $4.2 million in the first quarter of 2022. The net loss in the second quarter of 2022 was approximately $6 million, which was an improvement over the net loss of approximately $7.7 million in the second quarter of 2021, but lower than the net loss of $4.6 million in the first quarter of 2022. This sequential increase in net loss from the first to second quarter of 2022 was largely a result of the $1.3 million in write-off charges in the second quarter of 2022 relating to the defective Cenntro components and impairments of Cenntro prepaid expenses that led to a write-down expense or cost of goods sold in the amount of $621,000."
