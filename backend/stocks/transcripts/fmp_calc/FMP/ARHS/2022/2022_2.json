    "content": " This growth was driven by increased demand for our products in both showroom and eCommerce channels, as well as delivery of orders in the backlog as our supply chain continues to improve, and deliveries from our new distribution center in North Carolina exceeded expectations. Our second quarter gross margin increased 71% to $133 million in the quarter driven by our higher net revenue, partially offset by higher variable costs related to the increase in net revenue and higher credit card fees related to demand. Net merchandise inventory was $272 million, up 31% from December 31, 2021 and up 100% year-over-year as we continue to build inventory in response to strong ongoing client demand and as inventory value increased due to higher freight and product costs. And the demand outperformance in the quarter really is indicating to us that there's -- in this time period, there's a little bit less of a correlation than what we've seen historically, so really interesting data point for us as well but less tied to housing starts and more tied to stock volatility. John mentioned it in the comments earlier, we are really excited about this launch with a lot of new products, a lot of new storytelling and marketing that aligns really, really nicely with some really exciting trends and things that are happening within the industry as a whole going into fall."
