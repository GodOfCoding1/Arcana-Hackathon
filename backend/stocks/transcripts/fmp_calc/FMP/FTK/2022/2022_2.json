    "content": " In Q2 2022, we delivered a total of 40 million pounds of chemistry, with 9 million pounds of the chemistry to our transactional chemistry customers alone, 9 million pounds being almost half of what we delivered in the full year to transactional customers in a single quarter. On that release, we promised revenue in excess of $28 million, and we're pleased to announce that we were able to report revenue of $29.4 million, which again represents 2.3x growth over Q1 and 3.2x growth over Q2 2021. The cumulative fair value of these notes as of the closing dates of the 2 tranches was approximately $83 million and reported as a contract asset, which will be amortized over the 10-year life of the ProFrac supply agreement and be reflected as a noncash reduction to revenue in our U.S. GAAP financials. Consolidated revenue of $29.4 million for the quarter was up 128% compared to Q1 2022, and up 221% compared to the second quarter last year. In the second quarter 2022, SG&A of $7.4 million was up 52% compared to Q1 2022 of $4.9 million and up 77% compared to Q2 2021. Our non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter was a loss of $7.2 million, which decreased $1.8 million compared to last quarter's loss of $5.4 million and a second quarter 2021 loss of $6.7 million. The much improved cash position was favorably impacted by the $20 million and $19.5 million PIPE issuances in February and June and several improved working capital metrics, partially offset by the quarterly operating losses, which included fees for the closing of the PIPE and the previously mentioned ProFrac supply agreement."
