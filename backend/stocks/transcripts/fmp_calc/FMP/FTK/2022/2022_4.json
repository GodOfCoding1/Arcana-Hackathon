I think in terms of the second question on my own history, I am familiar through a lot of my private equity work and training, as well as having been involved with more than one public company as CEO that ratcheting costs down and holding it tight as revenue is increasing is the key to many businesses and we are singularly focused on getting into positive EBITDA, as well as making sure the shareholder experience is robust at Flotek."
