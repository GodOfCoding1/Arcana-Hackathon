    "content": " And if you were to take the chemistry that we have for particularly our prescriptive chemistry management service which looks at cuttings, produce, water, the types of crude formation impacts and the whole chemical system that's applied, with customers, particularly E&P operators that we work directly with, we see as high as a 15% to 25% improvement in the initial flowback and what we see on the overall type curves. And typically, when we see a strengthening market, particularly what we're seeing now where the capital is pretty tight in terms of the availability of hydraulic fracturing fleets and the hydraulic horsepower, they total a lot of the bigger stick on the pricing component and have been able to push spot pricing and contracted pricing up significantly from what it would have been at the end of last year. Now compared to speaking, when you look at the total volume of revenue increases we're seeing in the U.S. hydraulic fracturing business, it's not of that magnitude but we're seeing a ton of value-add sales going on there with our complex nano-fluids stimulation services, et cetera, there."
