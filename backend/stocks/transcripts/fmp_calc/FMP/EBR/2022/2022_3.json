    "content": " As a disclaimer, we would like to clarify that any statements made during this conference regarding the company's business prospects, projections operation and financial goals constitute the beliefs and expectations of the Eletrobr\u00c3\u00a1s management team as well as information which are currently available to the company. So the Cotas system or hydroelectric is just a tariff readjustment, and the bilateral contracts besides Santo Antonio Energia that we had mentioned before, we had a very important effect in Candiota, that this quarter exported energy and in CCEE, we had a variance of 61% because last semester we have imported energy from Uruguay, what didn't happen this year. In this quarter, we had BRL 1.5 billion in provisions, starting from disputes provisions, BRL 766 million especially by Chesf, and we had reported that to the market 15 days ago because we had a non-favorable decision against Chesf, and we had a technical discussion with our auditors regarding the accountable rules to categorize risk. It's important to highlight, and I should describe to you because we have been talking at Eletrobr\u00c3\u00a1s in an international scale to be the second better company in benchmarking and in best practices for emissions and renewable sources of energy, but there are still improvements to be done regarding the emission of some like coal plants or natural gas plants."
