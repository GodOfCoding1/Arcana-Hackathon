    "content": " We started also the first, the first wave of negotiations of loans, already with an effective -- with initial effect of reducing of R$1.3 billion in our provisions, or 26 5% in just a quarter. So when we see the first quarter of this year, that we are leaving, as I mentioned, due to that conversion of those controlled companies, subsidiaries company, integrated subsidiary companies that have already been concluded, we had already the main gains in the supplies over a R$200 million, R$120 million in CapEx and 90% of efficiency, with a baseline of R$1.4 billion, and here a reduction of R$80 million within optimization of our packs, 38% of efficiency versus a baseline of R$230 million. Vice President, Legal Vice President because we are having over R$35 billion in liabilities and we have demonstrated already in this quarter that we can -- what we can do to make this liability an asset for the company, and the counterparts and also Vice President of Innovation, Research and Development and IT, what is the most modern, what is the most -- what is the best way that a company can grow in a most efficient way making the job easier, people's job easier. It's important say that this structure has been formulated in a way that is really consciousness with a lot of questionnaires by the -- all the director, so that we can go ahead in these values that are being here highlighted, but also keeping a brand, a company, our efficiency continually, especially our reliability in terms of our systems, so that we can again, make this modernization of the company, adding value and keeping our traditions. And due to this elevated volume of water we had in our better period, but what weighs all of this scenario, you can see in the left side on the bottom, the variation of our revenues, revenues of generation in the fourth semester -- in the semesters, in the years and in the last, just going to look at the right side, our overall revenue has gone up to R$24.2 billion. As you can see into the composition we have reduced our liquidity in ACR and therefore we had an important growth in the sales of 16% in the market sales, ACL and also the decrease of price of -- to prices up to R$190 and you're basically looking at yellow, we have there the regulator contracts for the company, R$200 and going up to $$288, 22% increase, and also the Cotas which are just a by inflation, growth of 11% from R$4.22 billion to R$4.7 billion. So it's also important to highlight since May 2022, Amazonas is 100% insolvent with -- due to the law that was made when they had a monthly payment of CCE due to the exposition or involuntary position and also some actions that we have done with the distributors. In the bilateral contract we had positive impact, the volume of Santo Ant\u00c3\u00b4nio Energia, as we can see there was an increase of almost 20% increase in volume, and an average price of -- it has a small fall, so 186 which is reflect the prices, following due to the PLD that in the right side has a highlight, the PLD in the first quarter was R$135. So we have a trade-off that we're using here, looking at the what, we know that the financial market is also -- is now needs resources and disruption to make an agreement with advantage of the company, when the interest rate is very high becomes a benefit for those who offer, like in our case, but then the company that can they make an agreement and recognizing that the cost of taking these resource in the market would be much bigger. So starting April next year, so, you will see an economy of great economy for a month and then later you have any additional investment on this on this plan up to 20% of the number of people with values that will be less than that, remembering that the retirees are those people who have the main remunerations of the company due to the advanced age and also the experience, average experienced in the company of 33 years."
