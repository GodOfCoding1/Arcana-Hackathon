    "content": " On that final capital raising point and before diving into the quarter, I would like to highlight that this morning, we filed an amended registration statement for a one-for-one rights offering at $12.50 per share or up to $57.5 million, assuming 100% participation. As a result, we were able to reverse an additional $4.9 million of previously accrued incentive fees in the first quarter, which benefited NII and NAV by over $1 per share. Furthering our strategy to increase our investments in specialty finance and related opportunities in February, we acquired Sterling Commercial Credit, a leading asset-based specialty finance lender that provides short-term asset-based loans and working capital solutions to small businesses with annual sales typically between $3 million and $10 million. During the quarter, we deployed $22 million into specialty finance-related investments or 80% of total dollars deployed in the period. For the first quarter of 2022, NII was approximately $6 million or $1.31 per share, which is inclusive of the $4.9 million reversal of previously accrued incentive fees. Our NAV per share as of March 31, 2022, was $15.06, down from $16.63 per share as of the prior quarter end and $23.36 per share as of March 31, 2021, as adjusted for our reverse stock split in February 2022."
