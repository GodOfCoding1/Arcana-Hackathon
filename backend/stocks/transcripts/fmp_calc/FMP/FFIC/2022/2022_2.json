    "content": " We have nearly $1 billion of loans that are hedged or tied to short-term rates like Prime, LIBOR and SOFR, which will reprice within the next quarter and at least twice in 2022. This $1.3 billion of loans represents approximately 25% of interest bearing deposits, which serves as a natural hedge for Fed rate moves. For example, in 2023, nearly $1 billion of loans should reprice 154 basis points higher based on the contractual rates as of June 30. Core net interest income, which removes the impact of net gains from fair value adjustments and purchase accounting accretion increased 3% quarter-over-quarter as the core net interest margin expanded two basis points 3.33%. While core loan yields rose faster than the core deposit yields in the second quarter, this positive spread will be challenging to achieve going forward as the magnitude of the rate moves is expected to pressure deposit rates. Combining the 200 basis point increase in rate and the 10% increase in operating expenses, the pro forma weighted average debt service ratio would still remain over 1.15 times. Despite the accumulated other comprehensive loss doubling during the quarter from the effects of the higher interest rates on the investment securities portfolio, 61% of earnings were returned to shareholder through dividends and share repurchases. With the pace and magnitude of interest rate increases, deposit costs are expected to rise at a higher pace than seen in the second quarter and thus we expect NIM pressure."
