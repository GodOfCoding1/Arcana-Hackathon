    "content": "  Core net interest income, which removes the impact of net gains from fair value adjustments and purchase accounting accretion, increased 2% quarter-over-quarter as the Core net interest margin expanded, 10 basis points to 3.31%, excluding the impact from net prepayment penalty. The better we manage deposit costs, the more favorable the net interest income outlook to provide additional perspective as 50 basis point increase in short-term rates equates to an approximate $5 million annual increase in net interest income without any deposit rate adjustments."
