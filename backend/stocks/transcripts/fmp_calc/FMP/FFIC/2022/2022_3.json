    "content": " Core loan yields increased 20 basis points quarter-over-quarter, while core deposit yields expanded 47 basis points, resulting in net interest margin compression of 28 basis points on a reported basis and 30 basis points on a core basis. From the fourth quarter of 2021 through the third quarter of 2022, interest bearing deposit yields increased 63 basis points compared to the 211 basis point rise and average Fed funds rates implying a deposit beta of 30% compared to 43% in the prior cycle. Core net interest income, which removes the impact of net gains from fair value adjustments and purchase accounting accretion, decreased 6% quarter-over-quarter as the core net interest margin declined 30 basis points to 3.03%. As John said previously, in a rising rate environment, the path of net interest income is expected to look like a V with compression from rising funding costs from the Fed increases rates followed by expansion over time as loans reprice. So, I think that the -- obviously there's a difference in magnitudes there, but we will continue to see some pressure on the NIM over the next quarter, and certainly until the Fed starts to reduce, let's say, its increases going forward. So, at this point in time, it's a little bit difficult to see because I think that -- with this rate increase we've seen a natural pullback in terms of -- certainly our loan pipeline as we wait for customers to potentially adjust. I think we're going to see -- I think it's going to be dependent upon whether or not the -- in the short-term, in the next couple of quarters or so, borrowers begin to accept the higher rate environment."
