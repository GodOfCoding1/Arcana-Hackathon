    "content": " For the year, GAAP return on assets was 93 basis points, with a return on equity at 11.4%, while core return on assets totaled 92 basis points with return on equity at 11.4% and Returns were within our goals of 1% and 10%, respectively. And -- this translated to a return on assets of 48 basis points and a return on equity of 6% on a GAAP basis and 82 basis points and 11.4%, respectively, on a core basis. Core loan yields increased 28 basis points quarter-over-quarter, while core deposit yields expanded 87 basis points, resulting in net interest margin compression of 37 basis points on a reported basis and 40 basis points on a core basis. Asset quality remains solid with low charge-offs, nonperforming assets of only 63 basis points, strong debt service coverage ratios and low average loan-to-value ratios. As we've said many times, credit quality is important to our company and the trends remain solid as net charge-offs were below 10 basis points for the past 5 years. Bottom line, while the macro environment is becoming more challenging for the industry, our balance sheet today is well positioned to handle the credit quality and liquidity challenges with the outlook for interest rates expected to move in our favor shortly after the Fed stops raising rates. Overall, the allowance for credit losses to loans ratio decreased 1 basis point to 58 basis points during the quarter. Overall, noninterest expense is expected to increase by low double-digit percentage points in 2023 of the reported base of $144 million. So after fully absorbing the December rate increase, the incremental pressure might, in fact, ease as the Fed raises rates by smaller amounts than the 75 basis points that we've seen for the bulk of 2022."
