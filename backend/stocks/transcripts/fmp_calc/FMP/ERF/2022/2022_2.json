    "content": " We generated over $325 million of free cash flow through the first 6 months of the year, which we expect to increase by an incremental $475 million in the back half of the year based upon rest of year prices of $90 TI and $6.50 NYMEX gas. Given this free cash flow outlook and our solid financial position, we have increased our cash returns to shareholders to at least 60% of free cash flow commencing in the second half of 2022 and continuing through 2023. Under these updated assumptions, our annual capital spending from 2023 through 2026 is forecast at approximately $500 million and our cumulative free cash flow between 2022 and 2026 is estimated at approximately $3 billion. Under our updated return on capital framework, we have committed to returning a minimum of 60% of free cash flow beginning in the second half of 2022 and at least $425 million to shareholders this year, whichever is greater. Over the last 12 months, we bought back 10% of our public float under our normal course issuer bid by spending $285 million and repurchasing approximately 26 million shares at an average price of $11.14 per share. So, if these prices hold, I think 2% to 3% is still a good number to use for this year, but we would see that moving towards 10% to 12% of adjusted funds flow before tax next year, again, under the current commodity prices for both oil and gas."
