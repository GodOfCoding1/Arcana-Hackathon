    "content": " We expect to generate approximately $675 million in annual free cash flow in 2022, assuming rest-of-year prices of $85 West Texas and $5 NYMEX. We have committed to returning a minimum of $350 million or 50% of annual 2022 free cash flow, whichever is greater through dividends and share repurchases. As Ian covered earlier, the board approved an increase to our return on capital plan for 2022, which is a minimum of $350 million or 50% of free cash flow, whichever is greater. Lastly, as a result of the higher commodity price environment for both oil and natural gas, we are updating our 2022 current tax guidance to $20 million to $30 million or 2% to 3% of adjusted funds flow before tax from $10 million previously. And then looking to next year if we can dare to dream and current oil price persist, again we've got you at 40% plus free cash flow yield, you're debt free."
