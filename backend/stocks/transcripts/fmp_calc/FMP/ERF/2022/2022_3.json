    "content": " Operating costs were $10.47 per BOE in the third quarter, an increase from the prior quarter largely attributable to higher planned well service activity and an increased liquids production weighting in the third quarter. We recorded current tax expense of just under $8 million in the third quarter and based on the current commodity price environment, we continue to expect 2022 cash taxes of 2% to 3% of our adjusted funds flow before tax. As we noted in our prepared comments, we do anticipate seeing capital costs driven up a bit next year, maybe on the order of 10% relative to where we'll average on well costs for 2022."
