    "content": " We generated free cash flow of just under $800 million during the year, which allowed us to reduce net debt by 65% and return over $450 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Consistent with our multi-year outlook, we have a Bakken-focused capital program designed to generate attractive free cash flow and efficiently deliver 3% to 5% liquids production growth. The updated plan projects annual capital spending of between $500 million to $550 million, 3% to 5% annual liquids production growth and an average reinvestment rate of approximately 50% based on long-term commodity prices of $80 and $4 NYMEX. While we are continuing to drive improvements to our drilling and completion cycle times, we expect well cost to average about $7.8 million in 2023, up 10% compared to our 2022 average. The capital spending of $86 million, our fourth quarter free cash flow was $230 million, which we allocated towards the balance sheet and returning capital to shareholders."
