    "content": " This increase results from the addition of GeneDx revenues, which were not present in 2021 on a reported basis, offset by a decline in revenues from the exit of the legacy Sema4 Diagnostic business and by a onetime charge to legacy Sema4 revenues of $16 million in the quarter related to a true-up to the final settlement agreement with a payer as previously disclosed in our public filings. When combined with the revenues and costs from the now discontinued reproductive health and somatic oncology businesses, total company adjusted gross margin in the fourth quarter and full year 2022 was 7% and 5%, respectively. Within our total company unadjusted GAAP results for the fourth quarter of 2022, we recorded certain material cash and noncash charges amounting to $210.1 million related to the shutdown of legacy Sema4 reproductive health and somatic oncology and its related effects."
