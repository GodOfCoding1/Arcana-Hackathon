Please go ahead, when you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re ready. Please go ahead, when you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re ready. Please go ahead, when you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re ready. With 8,000 net new added and 14% constant currency growth on that number in Q3, I'm not sure we've seen those metrics work as well and balance this quarter as what we're generally used to seeing. Part of HubSpot's differentiated value proposition is that because everything is on one data platform in one database, wanting to bad experience, we have the data to be able to draw the insight, not just how many people visit the website or how many engaged in social or how many through ads, like who were those customers, what was the revenue associated with that, we can do kind of full circuit reporting, which is really hard to do when you get kind of the siloed products, and that's one of the appeals of the HubSpot platform. Please go ahead, when you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re ready."
