Your line is open. Our product innovation is in high gear as you just heard me talk about the innovation that we \u2013 with the features we launched and relaunched this quarter, we're seeing customers consolidates on HubSpot because we are quick to implement, we're easy to use and we are easy to adopt and our value proposition is resonating within our customer base. Your line is open. Your line is open. And I wanted to get kind of what your response is at particularly in light of, if you look at what happened during COVID, it was a very short-lived challenge  and HubSpot in fact, accelerated meaningfully in the September and December quarters after the onslaught of COVID because many of the SMBs, in fact, weren\u2019t prepared for the whole kind of work from home model and whatnot. Your line is open. Yamini, I was wondering if you could just talk about the upmarket opportunity for you all, if there\u2019s anything you\u2019re seeing, that\u2019s different in say the U.S. versus Europe or international markets in terms of bundling, Europe would seem to be actually an area where there\u2019s potentially more Greenfield where customers haven\u2019t made as many decisions across as many hubs. And we are certainly see that within the market, but overall our approach to the value side of our sales play is build fantastic products, continue to solve for our customer\u2019s biggest problem and enable our partner channel as well as direct channel to have great conversations that drive multi-hub growth. And when we know we have added value and when our customers have received a tremendous amount of value, then we look at pricing changes, and that\u2019s exactly what we did with the service hub pricing increase that you just mentioned. Your line is open."
