Now it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s my pleasure to turn over the call to HubSpot\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Chief Executive Officer, Yamini Rangan. Today, I want to focus on our Q4 results, reflect on 2022 and share our strategy for driving profitable growth going forward. Before we get started, I want to acknowledge the restructuring announcement we just made two weeks ago, where we decided to part ways with approximately 500 HubSpotters. This was the most difficult decision in HubSpot\u00e2\u0080\u0099s history and not one we took lightly, but one we believe is in the best interest of the company over the long-term. Total customers grew 24% to over 167,000 globally. We saw strong net customer adds of 8,400 in Q4 driven by a strong quarter of free CRM sign-ups, CMS Hub Free, which continues to open up our distribution channels, and the Starter Suite, which is delivering more value through better automation. At the same time, we also have momentum upmarket where we are delivering clear value for larger customers. In fact, large deals were the fastest growing area of our business in Q4. These results demonstrate that HubSpot\u00e2\u0080\u0099s connected, easy-to-use, powerful platform is mission critical for our customers. In terms of the demand environment, I talked in November about what we are seeing with customers, including longer deal cycles, more decision makers and increased budget scrutiny. While these trends and macro pressures persisted throughout Q4, they did not get materially worse. I am pleased with how we continue to solve for the customer with product innovation, while executing against our strategic priorities throughout 2022. Much like our peers, we experienced a perfect storm of uncertain macro, tighter customer budgets and longer decision making cycles. As I talk to our customers, a few shifts are increasingly clear. But instead of operating in a buy first, understand value later mode, they are now in a understand value deeply by cautiously mode. HubSpot has always resonated with customers because we deliver easy-to-buy, easy-to-use and easy-to-manage solutions. Now in this environment, we are focused on helping our customers drive innovation and efficiency with a quick time to value with customers taking under eight weeks on average to activate and see value. Throughout 2022, we had two key areas of focus; maintaining our fast pace of product innovation while driving consistent results. We relaunched Service Hub, added CMS Hub Free and launched hundreds of new enhancements to meet our customer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s evolving needs. Three areas I want to highlight; we drove more omni-channel execution with launches like our WhatsApp integration; more intelligence and insights with customer journey analytics and Campaigns 2.0; and more connected commerce with payment subjects, recurring ACH and payment schedules. Also, I am happy to announce that we are promoting Andy Pitre to lead our product organization as EVP of Product and User Experience. He is one of the very early product leaders who drove the CRM platform vision, was the brain behind Operations Hub and is exceptionally customer-centric. Andy will be filling the role formerly held by Steph Cuthbertson, who made a personal decision to step down as Chief Product Officer at the end of 2022. In terms of go-to-market execution, as customer behavior shifted in 2022, we adopted. In short, we stepped up to the challenge, executed well and helped our customers navigate choppy waters. Our continued focus is on driving profitable growth, maintaining agility and executing efficiently. First, in January, we announced plans to reduce our workforce by 7% and consolidate our facilities. Specifically, we are looking at multiple areas within sales and marketing. On the direct sales side, we are investing in systems and automation to improve rep productivity internally. We are continuing our journey on product-led growth, both to scale the low end of our business with Starter and to drive demand for Pro and Enterprise in a more efficient manner. On the partner side, we are making important changes to our commission structure to align partner incentives with customer value. We are leaning into better reward partners who source demand, who co-sell alongside us and engage deeply with our customers. These are multiyear initiatives and will lead to a more efficient direct, product led and partner sales motions that set us up for profitable growth and margin expansion. While the environment may be uncertain, we operate in massive markets and are confidently pursuing our goal of becoming the number one CRM platform for scaling companies. Our first objective is to become the SMB market share leader in marketing, sales and service. We are laser-focused on these three mega markets and we will enable more upmarket customers to adopt HubSpot with easier customization, greater extensibility and better governance capabilities. This year, as we continue to ramp, we will be focused on driving greater awareness of our commerce capabilities and increase customer adoption, while adding key functionality like native invoices, flexible billing and flexible payment processing that our customers need. Our strategy of focusing on volume of customer adds at the low end, while expanding the value of customers at the upper end is working. These initiatives drove results, and we added over 30,000 net new customers last year, with the majority landing on the Starter CRM Suite and expanding beyond. Q4 subscription revenue grew 28% year-over-year, while services and other revenue increased 8% on an as-reported basis. Full year subscription revenue grew 34% year-over-year, while services and other revenue decreased 5%, again both on an as-reported basis. Domestic revenue grew 31% year-over-year in Q4, while international revenue growth was 38% in constant currency and 23% as reported. We added over 8,400 net new customers in the quarter, bringing our total customer count to 167,000, up 24% year-over-year. Average subscription revenue per customer grew 9% year-over-year in constant currency and 3% on an as-reported basis to $11,200. Net revenue retention was 107% in Q4, down 2 points sequentially, driven by continued customer optimization of HubSpot spend. As I have mentioned in the last few quarters, we continue to expect net revenue retention to remain pressured as a result of the challenging macro environment. Deferred revenue as of the end of December was $546 million, a 25% increase year-over-year. Calculated billings were $542 million in Q4, growing 29% year-over-year in constant currency and 26% as reported. Q4 gross margin was 84%, up 2 points year-over-year. Subscription gross margin was 86% in Q4, while services and other gross margin was negative 14%. Full year gross margin was 83%, again up 2 points year-over-year. Subscription gross margin was 85%, while services and other gross margin was negative 29%. Q4 operating margin was 14% and full year operating margin was 10%, both up compared to 2021. At the end of the fourth quarter, we had approximately 7,400 employees, up 26% year-over-year and up slightly sequentially. CapEx, including capitalized software development costs was $19 million or 4% of revenue in Q4 and $82 million or 5% of revenue for the full year. Finally, our cash and marketable securities totaled $1.5 billion at the end of December. Now before I dive into guidance, I wanted to provide a bit more context regarding our recent restructuring. As Yamini indicated, this wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t a decision we made lightly, but it is one that we believe will better align our people with our strategic needs and help position HubSpot as a more efficient and agile company. Our headcount reductions allow us to continue to invest against a number of strategic business needs, including product innovation and systems and automation to scale better in a hybrid world. We are also taking steps to optimize our real estate portfolio to better serve our hybrid employee base by consolidating leases, including our Davenport headquarters building in Cambridge. As we outlined in the 8-K filing a few weeks ago, we expect to incur charges in a range of $72 million to $105 million in connection with the restructuring. We expect the majority of employee severance costs to be incurred in the first quarter, while the lease consolidation costs are expected to be incurred throughout 2023. These charges and related cash expenditures will be excluded from our non-GAAP operating profit, operating cash flow and free cash flow results. And with that, let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s review our guidance for the first quarter and full year of 2023. The customer behavior we are seeing today is very similar to Q4, tighter budgets, deals taking longer to close and more people involved in the approval process. For the first quarter, total as-reported revenue is expected to be in the range of $473 million to $475 million, up 20% year-over-year at the midpoint. And for the full year of 2023, total as-reported revenue is expected to be in the range of $2.05 billion to $2.06 billion, up 19% year-over-year at the midpoint or 20% in constant currency, including a foreign exchange headwind of 1-point for the full year. We expect non-GAAP operating profit margin to be between 9% and 10% in the first and second quarters, low-double digits in the third quarter and high-teens in the fourth quarter. As I look ahead, we have a clear long-term vision to become the number one CRM platform for scaling companies and a focused strategy in 2023 to make progress on that vision. I want to thank our customers, our partners and our shareholders for your support. Sorry, I was saying that, it was an impressive 2022 under tough circumstances and the initial 2023 guidance is also very healthy considering the macro environment. Thanks a lot for your question. In terms of the layoff, this was the most difficult decision we had to make in HubSpot\u00e2\u0080\u0099s history and something that we did not take lightly. The first is that we had areas within the business where headcount had grown faster than revenue, areas like recruiting and services, and even when we consider 2023 growth, we had that excess capacity. Look, demand environment in Q4 remained very consistent with what we shared in Q3. Q4 did not get better, but it did not get materially worse and so what we have assumed is that the demand environment will remain challenging going into 2023. The baseline assumption in our 2023 guidance is consistent with Yamini\u00e2\u0080\u0099s description of the environment, which is, it stays difficult, but it remains very consistent with what we saw throughout Q3. And so we feel good about our guidance with that set of base case assumptions, but we also feel good about that guidance even if the external environment gets a little bit worse from here. Basically since we started to see some of the cooler CPI inflation data, I am just curious if that development might be sporadically loosening up some conversations. Thanks a lot for your question. And look, I think, overall, the demand environment has remained consistent. Short-cycle deals, ones that are typically created in month and closed in months and they tend to be in the lower end of our segments are continuing to maintain velocity. Longer-cycle deals that typically tend to be upmarket are taking just a little longer to close, and again, this is because of more decision-makers involved, more kind of caution in terms of looking at the budget. Now if I look at pipeline, I have been talking to customers a lot more in Q3, Q4 and going into Q1, there are few kinds of characteristics of what we see within the pipeline, customers care a lot about time to value. The number one question that I get, we get, is how quickly can we migrate, what is the value and how quickly am I going to get there and HubSpot is resonating because we can deliver value in a matter of weeks, not months. And then, finally, eliminating point solutions and driving down costs, a lot of conversations on platform consolidation and with a view towards cost savings, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what we are seeing. We have seen an appetite to consolidate vendors, which really spiked up in our survey ahead of the year. Thanks a lot for the question. Within that, the 200 to 2,000 segment is what we consider upmarket customers. And as I mentioned, we certainly saw momentum and a lot more larger deals in Q4 and we are continuing to see that now. I think if you step back and think about these larger customers, they are expecting a lot more out of their marketing and sales spend this year. They want better rep effectiveness, and as you think about this, HubSpot delivers that. We are a connected marketing sales and front-office solution and our hubs are clearly delivering value, which is why we see that. One of the key priorities this year is to look at the Sales Stack and the Martech Stack and look at ways of eliminating point solutions to drive cost savings and in all of those considerations, HubSpot is becoming the platform of choice. Now that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s certainly because of the product momentum we have, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s because our go-to-market has adapted with our partners to be able to drive value for these upmarket customers and we are really proud of the work that the entire organization is doing in terms of where we are in the market. Yamini, I had a question related to partners. I mean funders over time, I mean, some of these partners have grown up with you all and scaled up as you all scaled up and they have become pretty big themselves. And if you could just unpack a little bit about it, it sounds like there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s some changes or evolution with partners. Look, our partner strategy is working, and a few years ago, we went to our partner ecosystem and we said, look, we are transitioning to marketing automation to CRM platform and our vision is to scale selling and servicing with export partners. If we step back, our partner commission was initially set up when HubSpot had one hub and just a couple of additions. And then as you all know, over the last couple of years, we have expanded our product portfolio. So as we step back and we looked at our partner commission strategy, we want to incentivize our partners who are now coming along this journey with us to do a couple of things. When partners get involved with customers, it leads to better close rates and it leads to better retention and we want to drive that. And second, we want to be enabled to incentivize them on driving more multi-hub, as well as co-sells. And so we just announced, I just came from the partner kickoff today, as well as yesterday, where we announced a few changes to the commission structure, which again, incentivizes them to have deeper connection with our customers. And I have been talking to a number of our top partners over the past few weeks in terms of this change they get it, they understand that we are evolving to a multi-hub company and they understand that we are going to continue to invest within the ecosystem. I mean just maybe start with the facts, which is I shared in the prepared remarks that our net revenue retention in the fourth quarter was 107%, which was down a little bit from Q3, but really very much in line with the expectations that we shared in Q3. And I think you know, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s really two big components of net revenue retention. The other piece is the net upgrade rate and that includes a number of motions, some of that you are talking about, which are seat upgrades, contact tier upgrades, edition upgrades, some cross-selling. And it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s really that net upgrade motion that has been challenged in the economic environment as customers are both slowing the rate at which they are upgrading, but also have a bit of a sharper eye on their overall spend with HubSpot. Over the longer term, we continue to believe that we can deliver net revenue retention of 110% in any healthier macro environment. Yamini, I wanted to dig a little bit more into some of the momentum you are seeing with Service Hub post-relaunch. And really, importantly, when you think about the feedback that you have gotten from customers so far. Thanks a lot for the question. Now I mentioned in the prepared remarks a little bit about multi-hub momentum, a lot more three, as well as five hub deals and customer wins that we are seeing and part of that is the strength of Service Hub. And we are going to continue to focus on it, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s one of our strategic objectives in 2023 is to go deep in terms of leadership in Marketing Hub, Sales Hub and Service Hub. And we are evolving to support workspace, we are going to be driving even more omni-channel service through improved calling functionality, knowledge base, SMS. The recent WhatsApp launch in Q4, that was a pretty big win and we got a lot of positive feedback from our customers and we are pretty excited to share more there. As we do these things, we step back and listen, are we getting more multi-hub customers, are we delivering more value and when the customers begin to use it, are we driving improved customer satisfaction. And for each of those questions in Service Hub, the answer is, yes. So we are pleased with it, and it will continue to be a strategic objective this year to drive thought leadership within Service Hub. And then, I guess, just to clarify the comment on net revenue retention, expect to keep it over 100% in the short term but return to potentially 110%. And I think -- when I think about the areas of pressure on the net upgrade rate, they are very much tied to the external environment, and as we start to see that like solidify and recover, I think that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s when you will start to see net revenue retention recover. We are seeing really nice sign-ups of our free CRM, we are seeing the free CMS really resonate and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s that sort of sign-up volume converting into our Starter tier that is driving a real strength in net customer adds. Now like -- as you know, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s push and pull across ASRPC and net customer adds when it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s being fueled by that low end of our bimodal. And what you saw in Q4 is after a period of real strength at the Enterprise that drove ASRPC up in the double digits in constant currency pretty consistently, we dipped below 10% in ASRPC growth. So maybe I will take that margin as a topic -- as an extension to Alex\u00e2\u0080\u0099s question where you went with that, Kate. I guess, maybe I will just start by answering your foundational comment, which is, like focusing on adds versus focusing on ASRPC. These are output metrics and I think we have talked about this in the past, like our goal is consistently to drive topline growth in ARR over time, not to drive growth in one or the other of ASRPC or new customer adds. And when you see us consistently investing in that bimodal strategy, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to naturally be some periods of time where we have more expansion in ASRPC and more expansion in other times in net customer adds, and probably, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just as the balance of new versus installed base sort of moves around. We delivered nice results in Q4 at a full year of 10% operating profit margin and our guide implies another 2, excuse me, 250 basis points of margin improvement. Over time, we have the financial framework that shows and demonstrates our balance between growth and profitability and we continue to remain committed to delivering against that. The one thing I would say is, as we think about this mid- to long-term and especially as we think about our sales and marketing efficiency, look, we have product led growth, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sales rep growth and partner led growth, and all of these are the input engines that then result in our net adds as well as ASRPC. And as we think about each of these three things; product led growth, we are driving more and more initiatives so we can get efficient; sales led growth, we are driving more automation, more systems, more investments so we can make our reps even more productive; and partner led growth, we talked about some of the changes that we are structurally making so that we can become even more efficient. And so as we think about how we balance growth and profitability, we have short-term initiatives and then we have medium-term initiatives and we are really committed to balancing both growth and profitability. Is that more a function of the landing with more hubs and higher attach rates on Starter tiers or where we have seen a lot of success on cross-sell as well, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a lot of time kind of spend on the net down sell. Look, I think, we are seeing both multi-hub lands, as well as strong cross-sells. As we talk to customers, a couple of things are becoming very clear. As they think about 2023, it is a lot about driving sales and marketing alignment. So if you think about customers, they want more needs, they want better campaign effectiveness, they want more activity tracking and they want all of this to line up to growth from a sales perspective. And therefore, in our conversations, we see that there are more multi-hub starting points, more starting points with Marketing and Sales and Operations Hub, for example, in the initial sale. And then, similarly, what we see is when our customer has adopted, for example, Marketing or Sales and they see the value proposition of HubSpot, which is easy-to-use, easy-to-manage, driving adoption, then it becomes an easier conversation to have a cross-sell dialogue with the VP of Sales or the VP of Service. And so we do find that in the first year of HubSpot purchase, customers have a high propensity to kind of look at additional hubs and get the visibility across customer base. And so the combination of both of those lead to very healthy three-hub, as well as five-hub wins from a customer perspective. I mean Sales and Marketing, obviously, the core. Look, I think, if you look at our performance in Q4, we are very pleased, because it shows strength in upmarket, it shows strength in multi-hub and it shows strength in our low end adds of Starter Suite. Our bimodal strategy is we want to add volume of customers at the lower end and as they scale and as they see value within HubSpot, they continue to upgrade to Pro and Enterprise tiers and get even more value from HubSpot and that bimodal strategy working. And in terms of which product areas are we seeing strength, certainly, Marketing and Sales are core front doors and we are very pleased to see Sales Hub become a legitimate front door. And when they buy Sales and Marketing and they want to deeply integrate and connect with other systems within the organization, Ops Hub comes in. And Ops Hub, we have talked about how it drives value from an integration perspective and providing and building on that reporting and then Service Hub. So across all of our core hubs, we are seeing pretty good momentum. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s early, early stages, and there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just a lot more to go, and as I look at our strategy this year, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s super clear. We want to go deep in Marketing, Sales and Service, and we want to continue to maintain the momentum that we have in commerce and we want to do both of those by focusing on the bimodal strategy, which is working. One of the interesting points I thought highlighted at the Analyst Day last year was the large mix of Starter customers as a percent of total paying customers, which potentially is creating the kind of pent-up demand to migrate to Pro and Enterprise when the market recovers. In terms of what we are seeing today around Starter upgrades, the newer cohorts that have started with us are actually upgrading at pretty healthy rates. We talked about things like bringing marketing automation down, introducing a free CMS and we continue to experiment around pricing and packaging. But at the same time, we watch those cohorts really closely to make sure that their usage and their upgrade patterns are consistent and healthy and they are pretty consistent with what we have seen in the past. I would just say Payments, as we -- I will reiterate Yamini\u00e2\u0080\u0099s comments. As I shared with -- at Analyst Day, it is not going to be a material contributor to our growth or profitability in 2023. On the Marketing Hub Enterprise price change, we continue to hear positive feedback on the change. You talked a lot about deals taking longer and more scrutiny, which we are clearly hearing across the broader landscape. When we talk to customers, two things are happening at the same time. Now at the same time, what we have been talking about is that, they want to understand value deeply, they want to buy a little bit more cautiously and that translates into longer deal cycles. Every conversation is about value, about delivering quick time to value, as well as the cost savings that our customers can see in terms of consolidating on the platform. And our sales teams, as well as the partner organizations are enabled to have these conversations and our value proposition really resonates. In G2, we have been rated as number one in Marketing, number one in Sales. And we have become a platform of choice for mid-market companies and scaling companies that are looking at options, whether they are driving productivity or they are driving cost savings, we are in those conversations. So I feel even given the macro conditions, the combination of our product innovation, as well as go-to-market execution positions us really strongly. And so part of the focus in terms of the leadership team is, how do we make strong and thoughtful decisions right now to position ourselves to emerge stronger when the cycle turns. As you know, we tend to have seasonally stronger back half margins anyway. Yamini, maybe one for you, just going back to the restructuring a little bit. This was a strategic realignment of our investment so that we can drive long-term innovation, as well as scalability within the organization. So as we step back, we look across the company on how best to align our people, resources to our strategy so that we can emerge stronger from this economic cycle. And in fact, as we have said a couple of times, we are reinvesting in areas of product, as well as internally so that we can drive scalability. A huge thanks to HubSpot employees, customers, partners for their resilience as they have navigated all of these times."
