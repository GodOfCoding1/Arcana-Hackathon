    "content": " Likewise, our expectations for free cash flow burn in excess of $60 million for 2022 remain the same as we plan to invest more than $40 million of growth capital in 2022 in the additional inventory and spinal implant sets needed to support the launch of more than 15 new products and line extensions this year and our higher revenue expectations. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. You could probably kind of back your way into it\u2019s going to be higher than 12% for the 7D portfolio as a percentage of their revenue because we\u2019re still going to be in sort of that 10% range on the legacy spinal implant and orthobiologics business, but more on the 7D side is a percentage of their revenue just because there\u2019s so many exciting new technologies and product line enhancements that we\u2019re going to bring to the market that we wanted to have the 7D team as worked as quickly as they can with the additional liquidity we can provide to be able to accelerate those programs. Your line is open. Your line is open."
