    "content": " Before I dive into a recap of the quarter, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d like to mention that during the period, we successfully raised $240 million in convertible debt financing, allowing us to retire 50% of our prior convertible debt and add to our existing cash position. In the period, we delivered a total revenue of $64.2 million, representing approximately 10% growth over prior year\u00e2\u0080\u0099s period as reported and a 15% growth on a constant currency basis. Discounting the impact of foreign exchange rates in the period, top line revenue would have eclipsed a previous all-time high revenue of $65.6 million in our seasonal peak in the fourth quarter of 2021. During the second quarter of 2022, we posted $43.7 million in capital equipment revenue, a record result for the company in this segment. Specific to our capital revenue performance, our North American sales team continued to demonstrate momentum in the period, posting $25.2 million of revenue, representing a 27% growth over prior year period. International capital equipment sales were $18.4 million, representing a 17% growth as reported and a 26% growth on a constant currency basis compared to previous year\u00e2\u0080\u0099s quarter. As expected, our European capital sales rebounded sharply from the decline reported in first quarter 2022, posting second quarter revenue of $5.3 million or 36% constant currency growth over the prior year period. Following the second quarter results, the European capital equipment revenue now represents an 11% growth year-to-date on a constant currency basis. And Australia and New Zealand also provided healthy year-over-year growth with $5.2 million in capital equipment revenue, representing 17% growth and 26% constant currency growth over the prior year period. Our recurring revenue category defined as the combination of skin care service and consumable products was $20.6 million in the period, a decrease of 11% over prior year period as reported and a decrease of 2% on a constant currency basis. Consumer revenues of $5.3 million in the quarter represent approximately 20% growth over prior year\u00e2\u0080\u0099s quarter as reported and 23% on a constant currency basis, driven by the growing demand for treatments from the truBody family of products. Total revenue for the second quarter was $64.2 million compared to $58.6 million for the same period in 2021, representing an increase of approximately 10% and 15% in constant currency. International capital equipment revenue for the second quarter was $18.4 million, up 17% as reported and 26% in constant currency from the second quarter of 2021. Recurring revenue, defined to include our consumables, global service and skincare product lines was $20.6 million in the second quarter, down 11% as reported and down 2% in constant currency. The decrease over the prior year was driven by skin care revenue of $9.6 million, down 18% as reported and down 6% in constant currency as well as a decline in services revenue of $5.6 million, down 17% as reported and down 13% in constant currency. Non-GAAP gross profit for the second quarter of fiscal 2022 was $35.7 million, with a gross margin of 55.6%, representing a decrease of approximately 250 basis points compared to the same period last year. Non-GAAP sales and marketing expense for the second quarter of 2022 was $24.6 million compared to $16.7 million for the same period last year, driven by continued expansion in our sales force, higher commissions, increased travel as well as $4.4 million in expenses associated with the launch of AviClear. Non-GAAP R&D expense for the second quarter of 2022 was $5.7 million compared to $4.5 million for the same period last year, driven by increased investments in AviClear and additional clinical studies. Finally, non-GAAP G&A expense for the second quarter of 2022 was $7 million compared to $6.1 million in the same period last year, driven by inflation and expansion in our head count. For the second quarter of 2022, our non-GAAP operating income, which we refer to as adjusted EBITDA was a loss of $1.6 million compared to a profit of $6.8 million in the prior year period. Excluding acne program impacts of $7.5 million for the second quarter of 2022 and foreign exchange headwinds over the prior year of $2.4 million, adjusted EBITDA would have been $8.3 million. As Dave mentioned earlier, during the quarter, we raised $240 million from a convertible debt offering announced in May that will net $154.6 million of incremental cash, after accounting for the extinguishment of 50% of our 2026 notes at $45.8 million, capped calls of $31.7 million, which were done to limit dilution and $8 million in issuance costs. We are reiterating 2022 guidance of $255 million to $260 million, entirely absorbing the impact of the unprecedented foreign exchange headwinds of $15 million annually, implying constant currency growth of 17% to 19%."
