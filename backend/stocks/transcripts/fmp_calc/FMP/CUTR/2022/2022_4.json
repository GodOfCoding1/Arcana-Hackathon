    "content": " Based upon our experience, thus far with the AviClear launch, we believe that these efforts spent prospecting and closing AviClear deals, would have translated into advancing approximately 100 to 120 million core capital deals, which we estimate to have resulted in roughly $4 million to $5 million of core capital revenue, some of which may still be recovered over the course of 2023. Recurring revenue defined as our Consumables, Global Service, Skincare and AviClear product lines was $24.9 million in the fourth quarter up 13% as reported and 29% in constant currency. This growth was partially offset by a decline in Consumable revenue, which came in at $4.2 million down 22% as reported and 18% on a constant currency basis driven by our clear account onboarding activities diverting the attention of our sales team away from core promotional events. Non-GAAP sales and marketing expenses for the fourth quarter of 2022 were $26 million compared to $22.3 million for the same period last year driven by continued expansion in our sales force, higher commissions and increased travel. For the fourth quarter of 2022, our non-GAAP operating income, which we refer to as adjusted EBITDA, was $0.2 million compared to $4.3 million in the prior year period, largely driven by FX headwinds of more than $3.4 million and costs associated with the full North American launch of AviClear. So I get that you don't like to give specific quarterly guidance but considering those changes and again the new products that I don't think are 1Q events, can you just help us out a little bit directionally on the thoughts of the waiting specific to capital if you would for 2023 as much \u00e2\u0080\u0093 as many details you want to provide."
