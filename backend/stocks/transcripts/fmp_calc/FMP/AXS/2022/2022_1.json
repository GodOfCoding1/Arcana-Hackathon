    "content": " Our insurance combined ratio of 87.5% is down over six points from the prior year period, with almost two points of reduction in the core ex-cat loss ratio and almost four points of reduction in the nat cat loss ratio. Operating income was $180 million and as Albert noted, annualized operating ROE was 15.3% and the combined ratio for the quarter was 91.4%, which was 7.5 points better than the prior year quarter, with core underwriting results continuing to show strong improvement. The consolidated current accident year loss ratio ex-cat and weather was 54.2%, a decrease of 0.9 point over the prior year quarter due to the improvement in the insurance segment. We reported net favorable prior year reserve development of $9 million compared to $5 million in the first quarter of 2021, the consolidated acquisition cost ratio was 19.7%, essentially flat year-over-year, and this was driven by a decrease in the insurance segment, which was offset by an increase in the reinsurance segment. The current accident year loss ratio ex-cat and weather decreased by almost two points in the quarter, and this was principally due to the impact of favorable rate over trend in most lines of business and improved experience. As Albert noted earlier, when we exclude the catastrophe line of business, the rest of the portfolio's current accident year loss ratio ex-cat and weather decreased by just over two points. Yes, I would just add that I think that the comments about inflation are noted, and you have seen the insurance non-cat loss ratio was 50.8% in both the third and fourth quarter of last year, now it's 50.5%. I would add, I think it's fair to say that just for the avoidance of doubt, we continue to believe that we're going to -- if things go the way we plan, we're going to deliver a lower loss ratio to insurance than last year."
