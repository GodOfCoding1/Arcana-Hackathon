    "content": " Yesterday, we announced final key data from the U.S. CTC registry on a 100 critically ill COVID-19 patients with refractory respiratory failure from five U.S. ECMO centers, where enhanced lung rest with CytoSorb and ECMO led to a 90 day survival of 74%, and where early intervention yielded better clinical outcomes. Finally, we announced the release of new cardiac surgery data at EACTS 2022, highlighting new positive data using CytoSorb intraoperatively during cardiothoracic surgery to improve outcomes in staph aureus endocarditis, heart transplantation and antithrombotic drug removal and also received a $282,000 award from NIH to test new and existing polymers for cytokine and LPS endotoxin removal to advance new treatments for deadly gram negative sepsis. Our cash burn for the third quarter of 2022 was approximately $7.8 million, which is higher than expected due to reductions in gross margins, resulting from the decrease in the euro to U.S. dollar exchange rate, lower sales and higher cost of sales because of inefficiencies associated with lower production. And most recently, we presented the main results of our CTC registry at the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine with excellent outcomes with our pioneering enhanced lung strategy -- enhanced lung rest strategy combining the use of CytoSorb plus ECMO in patients with severe respiratory failure, otherwise turned ARDS."
