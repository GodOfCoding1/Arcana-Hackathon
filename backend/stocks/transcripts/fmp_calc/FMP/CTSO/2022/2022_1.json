    "content": " Product sales were $7.9 million in the first quarter of 2022 of which $7.6 million was core non-COVID product sales and $0.3 million was COVID-related versus $10.1 million in product sales last year, of which $8.3 million was core and $1.8 million was COVID-related. We had lower COVID-19-related revenue of only $0.3 million in the first quarter of 2022 compared to $1.8 million a year ago, which mainly accounts for the difference in product sales that you see."
