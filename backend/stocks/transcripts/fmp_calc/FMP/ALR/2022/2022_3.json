    "content": " In the third quarter, occupancy increased 180 basis points sequentially across our Residential segment, which included a 290 basis point increase in our owned portfolio and a 160 basis point increase in our managed communities. Over the next couple of quarters, A&M's recommendations will continue to be rolled out, including incremental alignment of sales, marketing, clinical, and resident programming under a national operations support function, implementing labor opportunities, both at the corporate level and within key functional areas of the communities we own and manage, and driving efficiencies in the food services we provide. In the third quarter, management and operating revenues were approximately $41.5 million, an increase of $1.8 million or 4.6% from the sequential quarter. Additionally, third quarter construction management fees were approximately $900,000, which represented a slight increase from the second quarter, as we deployed $29.3 million of capital on behalf of the managed portfolio this quarter for routine community capital improvements. Despite this momentum, Lifestyle Services revenues were $14.5 million, approximately flat to the sequential quarter, as efficiency losses due to investments and process improvement offset the growth from new clinics and increased utilization."
