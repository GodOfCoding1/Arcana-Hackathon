    "content": " During the call, we will make forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, statements relating to our markets and future growth opportunities, the benefits of our health care commercial intelligence solutions, our competitive position, customer behaviors, our financial guidance, our planned investments and the anticipated impact from the COVID-19 pandemic on our business and results of operations as well as on our clients, the health care industry generally and the macroeconomic environment. Our total revenue was $54.5 million, which represents a 37% year-over-year growth, and our adjusted EBITDA was $16.3 million, which translates into a 30% margin. To be sure, that's high-value quantitative data that, in many cases, only Definitive Healthcare has, but to truly maximize sales force efficiency, these organizations need behavioral data about their provider population and their patient population, including a provider's willingness to try new therapies and whether the policies of their affiliate delivery network permit them to make that decision. In Q3, we expect total revenue of $56 million to $57 million for a median growth rate of 31%, non-GAAP income from operations of $15 million to $16 million, adjusted EBITDA of $16 million to $17 million or 29% median EBITDA margin and non-GAAP net income of $7.5 million to $8.5 million or $0.04 to $0.05 per diluted share on 155.4 million weighted average outstanding. I mean obviously, if we saw a longer term secular trend, we would adjust where we make investments in our sales and marketing investments to target more in areas of opportunity, which we've done that across the past couple of years as we've added teams to our provider we started to focus more there and seen really good growth there and added more to life sciences as we've seen opportunity there and have more products targeted there."
