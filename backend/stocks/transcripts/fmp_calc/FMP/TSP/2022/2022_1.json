And just to clarify an earlier point and questions around the Navistar relationship and supply chain, and it sounds like you're saying that the industry's timeline to commercial deployment has shifted a little bit to the right based on issues with redundant steering or braking or some -- or a multitude of technical issues that really haven't been solved yet."
