    "content": " General administrative expenses decreased by 2.8% to approximately $13.4 million for the three months ended June 30, 2022 as compared to the three months ended June 30, 2021, primarily due to decreases in taxes and license costs, legal expenses and employee variable compensation costs, which were partially offset by costs associated with the acquisition of Kinetic. Net income of $3.5 million for the three months ended June 30, 2022 decreased $6.5 million or 65.1% as compared to the prior year period. Cash flows provided by financing activities increased approximately $20.8 million during nine months ended June 30, 2022, primarily due to proceeds from borrowings under revolver loans and issuance of notes payable, which was primarily associated with the acquisition of Kinetic."
