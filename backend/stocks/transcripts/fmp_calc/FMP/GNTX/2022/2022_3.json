    "content": " For the third quarter of 2022, the company reported net sales of $493.6 million compared to net sales of $399.6 million in the third quarter of last year which was a 24% increase quarter-over-quarter. For the third quarter, global light vehicle production in North America, Europe, Japan, Korea and China, increased approximately 26% when compared to the third quarter of last year. During the third quarter, product mix issues driven by component shortages in our advanced feature mirrors and lower sales to our Tier 2 customers contributed about 150 basis points of margin headwind that we believe will improve during the fourth quarter. Our operating expense growth for the third quarter continues to support our product development strategy as well as previously sourced new program launches, product redesigns and support of component supply issues and our ongoing commitment to new technology areas. The company has continued to be proactive related to raw materials inventory with ongoing supply chain issues, component shortage issues in addition to significant customer order volatility as well as our forecasted growth in the next 12 to 18 months, the company has taken on additional components of certain medium and long lead time items to help manage risk and meet customer demand. The company's current forecast for light vehicle production for the fourth quarter of 2022 and full years 2022 and 2023 are based on the mid-October 2022 S&P Global Mobility forecast for light vehicle production in North America, Europe, Japan, Korea and China. Additionally, based on the company's current forecast for light vehicle production for calendar year 2023, the company still expects calendar year 2023 revenue growth of approximately 15% to 20% above the new 2022 revenue guidance of $1.9 billion and $1.95 billion."
