    "content": " The strength in rates was primarily due to a combination of the continued rerouting of Russian oil exports from Europe to Asia, which has created significant tonne-mile demand in the mid-size segment as well as Europe repricing Russian barrels with imports from more distant sources, including the U.S. Gulf, Latin America, West Africa and the Middle East. Based on approximately 43% and 38% of spot revenue days booked, Teekay Tankers' fourth quarter to date Suezmax and Aframax bookings have averaged approximately $40,000 per day and $36,600 per day, respectively. As shown by the chart on the top left, European seaborne imports of Russian crude oil have fallen just over 2.5 million barrels a day at the start of the year to around 1.5 million barrels per day by September. As per Clarksons, tanker tonne-mile demand is expected to grow by over 6% in 2023 and around 5.5% in 2024, far outstripping fleet supply growth of just under 1% and negative 1%, respectively, which should help tanker freight rates remain firm, albeit volatile over the next year and beyond. As an illustration, at the current fourth quarter-to-date rates, we would expect to generate free cash flow of approximately $12.50 per share in the next year, which equates to a free cash flow yield of approximately 38%. By positioning our fleet to trade spot, we are very heavily exposed to the current tanker market strength and our high operating leverage means that strong tanker market translates directly into TNK's free cash flow."
