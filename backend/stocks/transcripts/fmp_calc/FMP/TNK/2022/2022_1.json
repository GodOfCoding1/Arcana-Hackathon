    "content": " With 46 vessels or about 90% of the fleet trading in the spot market, Teekay Tankers has high operating leverage and we are exceptionally well positioned to take advantage of strengthening rates to generate significant cash flow, while in turn -- which will in turn enable us to further reduce our debt, creating value for shareholders. Second question, a bit of a two-parter, maybe pull in Christian and Kevin, obviously the Afras have done incredibly well, Suez has done well relative to VLCCs, but the product tanker market has been just consistently outperforming the crude market and these diesel shortages that are going from problems to potentially really dangerous, don't seem to have a near-term remedy. You also mentioned oil prices, obviously bunker prices are high, and that's flowing through not our OpEx, but our voyage economics and that is part of the picture of where our spot rates are, obviously, we're having -- experiencing periods of volatility that one where we've enjoyed some much stronger rates in Q2 in our fixed-to-date figures and notwithstanding the high oil prices."
