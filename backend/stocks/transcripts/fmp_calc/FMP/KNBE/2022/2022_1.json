    "content": " Similarly, our reported revenue for the first quarter totaled $75 million versus $53.6 million during the same period a year ago, an increase of $21.5 million or up 40.1% year-over-year. Our total customer distribution remains relatively consistent with about 88% of our customers in the SMB space, which we define as organizations of less than 1,000 employees and about 12% in the enterprise space, which we define as organizations with greater than 1,000 employees, where we've seen significant growth over the past few years. During the first quarter, we continued to see strong multiproduct adoption, resulting in the percentage of customers subscribing to multiple products growing to 24.5%. And although we don't report the growth of our individual products separately, our combined revenue growth for PhishER, Compliance Plus and KCM GRC reached triple digits year-over-year for the quarter, the result of this continued cross-sell success."
