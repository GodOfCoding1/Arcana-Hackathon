    "content": " Similarly, our reported GAAP revenue for the second quarter totaled $80.8 million versus $59.4 million during the same period a year ago, an increase of $21.4 million or up 36.1% year-over-year. Our total customer distribution remains relatively consistent with about 88% of our customers in the SMB space, which we define as organizations of less than 1,000 employees and about 12% in the enterprise space, which we define as organizations with greater than 1,000 employees where we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen significant growth over the past few years. During the second quarter, we continued to see strong multi-product adoption, resulting in the percentage of customers subscribing to multiple products growing to 26.3% from 24.5% previously. Our international revenue grew 56.1% year-over-year and grew sequentially by $1.4 million from Q1, representing our strongest quarter of sequential growth from international in the last three quarters. Year-over-year increases in non-GAAP sales and marketing expenses for the quarter were primarily attributable to higher headcount-related costs, including headcount-related subscriptions and overhead allocations as well as higher marketing, PR and demand generation costs contributing to our revenue growth. But when you talk about SMB, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s really 100% greenfield opportunity for international, a little less so for enterprise, because with the bigger global sized companies, they are well on the way to having something with regard to security awareness training."
