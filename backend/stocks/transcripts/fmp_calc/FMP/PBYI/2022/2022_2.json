    "content": " Today, Puma reported total revenue for the second quarter of 2022 of $59.5 million. Product revenue net was $51.3 million in the second quarter of 2022, which represents an increase, as expected, from the $40.7 million in product revenue net reported in the first quarter of 2022 and $48.9 million in product revenue net reported in Q2 2021. Royalty revenue was $8.2 million in the second quarter of 2022, an increase from $5 million in Q1 of 2022 and $4.3 million in Q2 2021. As Alan noted, our net product sales were $51.3 million in the second quarter of 2022. For the second quarter of 2022, we reported net income based on GAAP of $9.4 million or $0.21 per share. On a non-GAAP basis, which is adjusted to remove the impact of stock-based compensation expense, we reported net income of $12.6 million or $0.28 per share for the second quarter of 2022. As Alan mentioned, net product revenue from NERLYNX sales was $51.3 million compared to the $40.7 million we reported in the first quarter of 2022. Royalty revenue totaled $8.2 million in the second quarter of 2022, an increase from $5 million in Q1 2022. Cost of sales for Q2 2022 was $14.9 million, including $2 million for the amortization of intangible assets related to our neratinib license. For the fiscal year 2022, Puma reiterates its prior guidance that net product revenue will be in the range of $180 million to $190 million. Furthermore, for fiscal year 2022, we anticipate receiving royalties from our partners around the world in the range of $27 million to $30 million, lower than our prior guidance due to the timing of our NERLYNX shipments to our partner in China and potential negative foreign exchange impact. In the second quarter of 2022, Puma reported cash burn of approximately $14 million compared to cash burn of approximately $17 million in Q1 2022."
