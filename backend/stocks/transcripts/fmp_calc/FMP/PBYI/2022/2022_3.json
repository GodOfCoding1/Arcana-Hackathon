    "content": " Today, Puma reported total revenue for the third quarter of 2022 of $57.1 million. Product revenue net was $54.3 million in the third quarter of 2022, which represents an increase from the $51.3 million in product revenue net reported in the second quarter of 2022 and $43.4 million in product revenue reported in Q3 2021. Royalty revenue was $2.8 million in the second quarter of 2022, a decrease from $8.2 million in Q2 2022 and equal to the $2.8 million recorded in Q3 of 2021. As Alan noted, our net product sales were $54.3 million in the third quarter of 2022. On a non-GAAP basis, which is adjusted to remove the impact of stock-based compensation expense, we reported net income of $2.5 million or $0.05 per share for the third quarter of 2022. As Alan mentioned, net product revenue from NERLYNX sales was $54.3 million compared to $51.3 million reported in the second quarter of 2022. For fiscal year 2022, Puma is increasing its previous guidance, now expecting that net NERLYNX product revenue will be in the range of $194 million to $196 million. Furthermore, for the fiscal year 2022, we anticipate receiving royalties from our partners around the world in the range of $25 million to $27 million, lower than our prior guidance due to the timing of our NERLYNX shipments to our partner in China and potential negative foreign exchange impact. In the third quarter of 2022, Puma reported cash burn of approximately $17.4 million compared to cash burn of approximately $14 million in Q2 2022."
