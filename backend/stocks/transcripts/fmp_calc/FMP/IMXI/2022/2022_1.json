    "content": " Even though we have a 21 per share in Mexico, if we picked up a 4% or 5% more share in Mexico that's going to be more valuable than taking Ecuador to a 20% share partly because of the size of Mexico probably, because of the profitability, but also because we know that's doable when we look at the share we have of Mexico in many of our states in the U.S. if we projected anything even close to that in some of the states out west which were growing at a market rate that's faster than the market's growing then Mexico we could end up with a 25 share or more to Mexico a 35 share or more to Guatemala."
