    "content": " Intermex is the only omnichannel remittance provider that continues to grow revenue and profitability through our retail network each and every quarter by more than double digits, while achieving triple-digit growth in our digital online division year-over-year. We believe the strong growth the company is achieving is sustainable, driven by expansion of the company's growing ecosystem of neighborhood retail agents, a focus on agent productivity and performance and the accelerating rollout of new digital products. On Slide 10, when we look at the top line, agent growth and customer growth all contributed to the 16.6% year-over-year growth in revenue, which reached $140.8 million during the third quarter."
