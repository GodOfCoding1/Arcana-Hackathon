    "content": "  On this morning\u00e2\u0080\u0099s call, the team will provide a business overview of the fourth quarter of 2022, including an update on our clinical programs and our commercial progress in that period with Cosela, which is approved and commercial available to decrease the incidence of chemotherapy-induced myelosuppression in adult patients when administered prior to a platinum/etoposide-containing regimen, or topotecan-containing regimens for extensive-stage small cell lung cancer. Beginning with sales results, we ended the quarter with $8.9 million in net sales of Cosela, representing 8% vial volume growth compared with Q3. First, we remain confident in the potential of Cosela in lung cancer, and as you heard from Andrew, we made good progress since the end of the third quarter, including return to vial volume growth in the fourth quarter of 2022 with month-over-month growth throughout the fourth quarter, January being our highest vial volume month since launch, and volume strength has continued through February. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve added nearly 100 new accounts in the fourth quarter, including eight new top 100 organizations with two more added since the start of Q1 to continue to build that broad platform for future growth."
