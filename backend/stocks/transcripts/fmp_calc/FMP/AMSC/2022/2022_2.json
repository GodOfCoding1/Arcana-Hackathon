    "content": " Before starting the call, I'd like to remind you that various remarks that management may make during today's call about American Superconductor's future expectations, including expectations regarding the company's third quarter fiscal 2022 financial performance, plans and prospects, constitute forward-looking statements for purposes of the safe harbor provisions under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by such forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors, including those set forth in the Risk Factors section of American Superconductor's annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended March 31, 2022, which the company filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on June 1, 2022, and the company's other reports filed with the SEC. And then this mining, minerals and materials portion, what we're realizing is a lot of the things we talked about during the beginning days of the acquisition, being able to cross-sell, being able to get interesting unique content that's not there in the marketplace that makes customers excited about us, I mean, that's really what we're seeing. And I am - I'll say this, I'm really looking forward to the call in January, February timeframe, because I think you're going to see all the good things that we're - we've been talking about just start to come to fruition."
