    "content": " Before starting the call, I'd like to remind you that various remarks that management may make during today's call about American Superconductor's future expectations, including expectations regarding the company's fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 financial performance, plans and prospects, constitute forward-looking statements for purposes of the safe harbor provisions under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Moving on to operating expenses, R&D and SG&A expenses for the third quarter of fiscal 2022 were $9.3 million, compared to $9.4 million in the year-ago quarter. Our non-GAAP net loss for the third quarter of fiscal 2022 was $7.7 million or $0.27 per share, compared with $4.6 million or $0.17 per share in the year-ago quarter. The company is moving in a direction where expects to provide more new energy power systems for more industrial users, more than half of our new energy power systems orders during the third quarter of fiscal 2022 come from industrial markets, one fourth is from renewables. Thanks so much, guys. For material prices, specifically in John's commentary, we see a stabilization of those costs, which means now as we've priced in new orders, it's just the time it takes from when we receive that order to when we deliver on it and we're kind of in that cadence now in the coming quarters. Thanks so much, guys. I wanted to understand the kind of cash flow, breakeven scenario and the model you're thinking about, I think I heard that it was $35 million in revenue with gross margins, near 20% but correct me if I'm wrong, so it'd be about $7 million in gross profit."
