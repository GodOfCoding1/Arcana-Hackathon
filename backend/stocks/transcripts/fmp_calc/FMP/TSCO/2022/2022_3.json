    "content": " Much like the second quarter, retail price inflation contributed about 12 points to our comparable store sales as the team continues to navigate the ongoing cost pressures across the supply chain. we're now at 500 Fusion stores and over 260 garden centers, and we continue to see that same type of lift even as we reach scale, real tribute to our team on the execution, operations and then ensuring that we've got the right programs as we roll those out. As I mentioned earlier, on the revenue side, many of our initiatives are just starting to really reach kind of scale that you can kind of \u00e2\u0080\u009csee from space.\u00e2\u0080\u009d You think about 500 Fusion stores now, 260 Garden Centers, the continued strong lift we're seeing with those as we round into next year, we anticipate that those will continue to help fuel our business, and if there is any sort of further degradation of the economy that they can help fill in some of those cracks. And then on the cost side, while there's a bunch that goes in and goes out, while we performed well in the last 2 years and half off to the team for managing our operating margins, there's been a lot of inefficiencies in our cost base the last couple of years, higher container cost, higher freight costs, having to open up pop-up distribution centers freight arriving -- and not on the day and time that we anticipated in the back of the stores or having inefficient labor in our stores to do tasking."
