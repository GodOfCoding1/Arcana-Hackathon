    "content": " The team demonstrated grit and determination as they overcame the lapping of last year\u2019s robust performance, the impacts of the Omicron variant, particularly in January, the significant inflationary pressures and the ongoing supply chain constraints, the last two of which were both exacerbated by the tragic conflict in Ukraine. Our Neighbor\u2019s Club program reached a record 24.8 million members in the quarter, an increase of 24% from last year\u2019s first quarter. Where we -- in the business where we\u2019re lapping the stimulus from last year, notably in big ticket, we saw some follow-up there, but it was very much in line with what we expected and what we had foreshadowed at our enhanced earnings event, when we talked about some pressure from big ticket dominantly in the last part of Q1 and early part of Q2. If I understood the question, your first question generally is around needs discretionary versus a needs-based business, which we\u2019re predominantly, and then really more of a -- how do you reconcile and how do you manage the cost, the operating margin throughout the rest of the year. And just to point out, Q1 on a two-year stack basis, from the strength in new customers, the strength in Neighbor\u2019s Club, our transaction toward the highest two-year stack of any of the four quarters. Even if you look at the existing home sales and new home sales, which have come up the last few days, while there were some year-over-year reductions, still very strong absolute numbers, and then if you look at the amount of housing stock that were short in the United States, I think you\u2019re going to continue to see very strong absolute numbers for many years -- many quarters and years to come."
