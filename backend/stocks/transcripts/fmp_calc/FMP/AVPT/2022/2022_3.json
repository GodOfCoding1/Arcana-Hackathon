    "content": " Q3 was another strong quarter for AvePoint, highlighted by 34% ARR growth and 26% total revenue growth, both adjusted for the impact of FX. For the third quarter ended September 30, 2022, total revenues were $62.7 million, up 16% year-over-year and up 26% in constant currency. Within total revenues, Q3 SaaS revenue was $30 million, up 34% year-over-year and up 45% in constant currency. And while our Q3 revenue guidance included an FX headwind based on the prevailing rates at the time, the US dollar continued to strengthen in the quarter, further impacting our total reported revenues by approximately $1 million, bringing our total revenues to the high end of our guidance range. As of September 30, 2022, total ARR was $191.7 million, representing growth of 30% from a year ago, up 34% adjusted for the impact of FX. Lastly, SMB ARR ended the quarter at $14.2 million, up 80% year-over-year as we continued to see momentum from our SMB customer acquisition strategy. For the fourth quarter, we expect total revenues of $63 million to $65 million or approximately 19% year over year growth, 22% adjusted for constant currency. As a result, for the full year 2022, we now expect total revenues of $231.7 million to $233.7 million or approximately 21% year over year growth, 28% adjusted for constant currency. Lastly, we continue to expect total ARR of $202 million to $206 million or approximately 28% year over year growth, 32% adjusted for FX impact. So I think one thing to think about is if you look at our operating expense growth for the first two quarters, we grew 35% year-over-year in the first two quarters, but Q3\u00e2\u0080\u0099s growth rate was 21% and we're guiding Q4 for only 10% growth year-over-year."
