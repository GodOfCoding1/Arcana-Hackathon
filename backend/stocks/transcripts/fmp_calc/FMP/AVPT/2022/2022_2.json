    "content": " Total revenues for the second quarter ended June 30, 2022, were $55.7 million, up 23% year-over-year and up 31% in constant currency. For the third quarter, total revenue is expected to be in the range of $62 million to $64 million or approximately 17% year-over-year growth, 23% adjusted for constant currency. And for the full year 2022, total revenue is expected to be in the range of $230 million to $234 million or approximately 21% year-over-year growth, 26% adjusted for constant currency. Can you just talk about the dynamics on that revenue progression and then just the guidance would accentuate that you're kind of exiting Q4 with about mid-upper teens revenue growth, but you're guiding to yeah, 31% AR growth at year-end. And I think it's important here that we recognize that in this economic environment right now, where we're being conservative and understanding what the revenue could be, we also want to take the same approach on our expenses and be much more conscious in terms of how we're investing and understanding that if we're being conservative on the revenue and understanding that there's impacts there, we also need to be prudent on the expenses."
