    "content": " For the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2022, total revenues were $63.6 million, up 18% year-over-year and up 26% in constant currency. Within total revenue, Q4 SaaS revenue was $33 million, up 36% year-over-year and up 46% in constant currency. As of December 31, 2022, total ARR was $201.7 million, representing growth of 27% from the prior year. Excluding this impact, Q4 non-GAAP operating income would have been $4.5 million or an operating margin of 7%, which was ahead of our guidance. While our operating expenses through the first 3 quarters of 2022 grew 30% year-over-year, Q4 operating expenses grew only 17%, reflecting our focus on expense management and excluding the $3.1 million onetime charge I just mentioned, Q4 operating expenses grew only 9% year-over-year. Total revenues were $232.3 million, representing growth of 21% and growth of 29% on a constant currency basis. Within total revenues, SaaS revenues were $117.2 million, representing growth of 37% and growth of 46% on a constant currency basis. As mentioned, total ARR as of December 31 was $201.7 million, representing growth of 27% and growth of 32% adjusted for the impact of FX. For the first quarter, we expect total revenues of $57.5 million to $58.5 million or approximately 15% year-over-year growth. For the full year, we expect total ARR of $238.4 million to $244.4 million or approximately 20% year-over-year growth. We expect total revenues of $253.8 million to $260.8 million or approximately 11% year-over-year growth, driven in part by our continued shift to SaaS, consistent with the strong growth we saw in 2022. So what we're providing in terms of our guidance on ARR, including that 20% growth is already factoring in as we look at the runoff of those contracts, we've already baked in the FX adjustment, assuming that the rates as of the end of December '22 would have held."
