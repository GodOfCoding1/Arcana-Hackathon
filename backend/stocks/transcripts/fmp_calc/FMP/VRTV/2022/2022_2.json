    "content": " Last week we expected to see a steady increase in sales approaching pre-pandemic levels in most verticals with the exception of office, and that's consistent with what we've seen in Q2 and caring in Q3, and in the Print segment we continue to see a significant imbalance between supply and demand and we basically have our third and fourth quarters estimated to be our allocation as we don't see any influx of imports from either \u00e2\u0080\u0093 you know from Asia to help the situation, and so we expect a strong Q3 and Q4 and frankly would be stronger had we had more access to product for print."
