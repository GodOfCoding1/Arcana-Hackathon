    "content": " Third quarter adjusted EBITDA increased 63.8% to $259.2 million, and our adjusted EBITDA margin was 19.9%, a 120-basis point improvement compared to last year. Labor is still tight, but we're going to have that dynamic that I think Rob and I both spoke to where some president of piece of builders are definitely having more conversations and pushing back on that, but there's still inflation really across the industry right now. We were right to see improvements there, and we think that's some good signs of what's going on there commercial and industrial, quite honestly, both probably service partners side, we'd say it was an easier comp, if we compare it to Q3 of '21 as well. And then if you just kind of break it down a little bit further, if I think about the building envelope and like commercial, that's going to follow some residential trends but on a different cycle, right, because as you're building infrastructure in a community to support the new communities that like commercial follow that."
