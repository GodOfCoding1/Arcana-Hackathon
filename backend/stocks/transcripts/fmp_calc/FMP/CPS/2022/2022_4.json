    "content": " Excluding these and other special items, we incurred an adjusted net loss of $31.9 million or $1.85 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2022. Full year net loss was $215.4 million, including a gain recognized on the sale leaseback at one of our European facilities, noncash asset impairment charges, restructuring costs, deferred tax asset valuation allowances and other special items. For sales, favorable volume and mix, net of customer price adjustments and recoveries increased sales by $89 million. For the full year, favorable volume and mix, net of customer price adjustments and recoveries increased our sales by $322 million. For full year adjusted EBITDA, a number of positive factors benefited our profitability, including $167 million from improved volume and mix, including customer price adjustments and recoveries. Net cash used in operations was $25.8 million in the quarter, primarily due to the net cash earnings and changes in working capital, which continued to be impacted by challenging industry conditions. In terms of cash interest, we expect to pay $50 million to $55 million in 2023, a reduction from 2022 levels given the flexibility of the PIK Toggle feature in the notes we issued in the refinancing last month. We expect improving volume and mix, including customer price adjustments to drive $150 million of improved profitability in 2023. With improving volume, we also expect our manufacturing and purchasing teams to continue their aggressive lean initiatives in 2023, driving combined planned savings of approximately $60 million for the year."
