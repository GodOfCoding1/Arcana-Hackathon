    "content": " So that's why I mentioned that come July, I think when we typically do our review the first half of the year and then we update guidance or talk about what we see the second half, we're hopeful that we're able to give you guys more color around those agreements. I think that the Encouraging news is that our largest customers here in North America, have been pretty clear about the third and then the fourth quarter being better from a volume point of view than it has been, so I'm hopeful that that's the case, but like I said, there seems to be a footnote related to chip availability with each of those statements, and so we have to recognize that those are the facts. So if I go back to the fourth quarter presentation, and I think it's Slide 13, the guidance bridge on EBITDA, negative $70 million materials that econ headwind. Last one for me is, if I'm sort of reading the tea leaves around your comments regarding the capital structure, in particular, first-lien loan and bonds, it sounded like your commentary was slightly different than last quarter, in that last quarter, I believe you are more focused on the term loans specifically and now this quarter making a comment about potentially trying to include the 13th solution there as well."
