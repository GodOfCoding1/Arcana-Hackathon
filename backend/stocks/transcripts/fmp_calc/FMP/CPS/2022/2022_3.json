    "content": " On the top line, favorable volume and mix, net of customer price adjustments, increased sales by $168 million versus the second quarter of 2021. As for the headwinds in the quarter, higher material costs amounted to $35 million, and higher wages, compensation-related costs, general inflationary pressures, and other items reduced adjusted EBITDA by a combined $10 million in the quarter. For adjusted EBITDA, significant improvements from positive volume and mix, net price adjustments, manufacturing and purchasing efficiencies, lower SGA&E, and restructuring savings were more than offset by increased material costs, which have now reached $117 million in the first nine months of this year, as well as higher wages and general inflation. In terms of our 2022 guidance, we're trimming our full year estimate for sales and adjusted EBITDA, factoring in the results for the first nine months of the year, which fell short of our original expectations, primarily due to continued variability in our customers' schedules and weak production volumes. Your line is open. So as Jeff mentioned, you can think it in terms of being around that 70-plus percent of recovery on that $117 million both from a current period perspective as well as some catch-up on 2021 commodity inflation that we're able to call back this year. Your line is open. Your line is open. Yes, this is Jeff. Your line is open. Yes, this is Jeff. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Yes, this is Jeff."
