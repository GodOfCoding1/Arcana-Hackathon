    "content": " Most importantly, due to strong loan production, margin expansion, enhanced efficiencies and meaningfully improved asset quality, we are generating profitable growth with our pre-provision net revenue return on average assets increasing to 1.79% from 1.65% in the preceding quarter, while our pre-provision net revenue return on average equity increased to 16.26% from 14.66% in the prior quarter. We had $534 million of commercial real estate loan production in the third quarter, which was down slightly from the preceding second quarter and accounted for 40% of total originations, but the average rate of new CRE loans increased 99 basis points over the preceding second quarter. Commercial real estate loans accounted for 71% of our total portfolio at September 30, 2019, having increased by less than $1 billion over the course of 3 years, CRE loans as a percentage of total loans declined to 61% as of September 30, 2022. Of our new loan production in the third quarter, 57% represented variable rate loans and as of September 30, 2022, variable rate loans increased to 46% of our total loan portfolio. And while the fourth quarter tends to be a seasonally slower quarter for commercial loan production, our commercial loan pipeline continues to be relatively strong as the more recent additions to the CBG team ramp up their business development efforts, particularly as the expected recession draws nearer, we are being ever more selective with the loans that we are adding to our portfolio and focusing on those that are more recessionary resistant, have greater ability to absorb interest rate and macroeconomic risk and ultimately contribute to profitable growth for the company."
