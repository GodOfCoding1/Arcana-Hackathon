    "content": " Today, speaking on the call, we will also have Liberty Broadband's Chief Accounting and Principal Financial Officer, Brian Wendling; and Ron Duncan, CEO of GCI; and Pete Pounds, CFO of GCI, will be available to answer questions. The mood up here is definitely more positive than it was 15 months ago, and I think we're looking at a reasonably strong economy between oil revenues and a tremendous amount, $16 billion of federal stimulus under the Infrastructure Act flowing into the state, fortunately only a small portion for broadband, over the next several years. Well, I think it's a complicated topic in the sense that we like our Charter shares, but we don't exactly complain about buying Liberty Broadband back at the discount even net of the taxes."
