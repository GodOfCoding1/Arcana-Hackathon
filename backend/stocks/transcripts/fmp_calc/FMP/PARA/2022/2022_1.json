    "content": " While many legacy streamers are rethinking their paid-only models, our mix of free ad-supported and paid subscription streaming options has been a hallmark of our strategy from the start, offering viewers the freedom to choose the plan that\u2019s right for them and giving us access to the largest global total addressable market, while providing the benefit of dual revenue streams. Our deep expertise and expansive reach across theatrical, broadcast, cable and streaming gives us multiple advantages the legacy streamers don\u2019t have, strong promotional platforms to market and launch content and multiple revenue streams to generate return on every dollar of content investment. Turning to our TV Media segment, Q1 revenue declined 6% year-over-year, including an 8-percentage-point impact from CBS\u2019 broadcast of Super Bowl 55 in the prior year period. As we said, we\u2019re running a differentiated playbook, taking our broad content, this broad streaming business model spanning free and pay with dual revenue streams ad and subscription, multiple platforms, broadcast, cable, theatrical, plus streaming, and this global operating footprint. It has broad reach television networks, including the market leading Colors brand, combined with a film business, Hindi film business, it\u2019s both national and regional, and of course has streaming assets as well, all underpinned by a strong local content engine. Great portfolio of sports assets, including NFL, including NCAA, including golf, including by extension on -- mostly on Paramount+ plus but also been on CBS UEFA, that\u2019s all obviously U.S. And we have been select adding sports properties outside the U.S. We do all this in a very disciplined way looking at ROI to ensure there\u2019s some stuff that\u2019s traded that we haven\u2019t done because we didn\u2019t think it was worth the price point."
