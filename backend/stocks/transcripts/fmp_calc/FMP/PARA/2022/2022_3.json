    "content": " Our businesses include the number one broadcast network, CBS; a portfolio of industry-leading cable networks, many of which are number one across their respective demographics like Nickelodeon and BET; the number one free ad-supported streaming TV service in the US, Pluto TV; a rapidly scaling subscription service, Paramount+; and a Hollywood studio with six number one hits this year, Paramount Pictures. To date, we've only done limited marketing, really leveraging some e-mail lists they have and some of our media the full in-store Paramount+ presence, for example, which will reach, I believe it's $140 million-ish customers visiting a Walmart store in the US every week has yet to kick off. And that's when you'll see real benefit from our positioning as a market leader with the number one broadcaster, cable group that includes leaders in young and diverse audiences, the number one fast service in the US, Pluto; rapidly scaling streaming service, Paramount+."
