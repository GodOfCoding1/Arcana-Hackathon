    "content": " The Personal Care product line also had an excellent 2022, achieving 10% adjusted local currency revenue growth. The Color Group also had a strong finish to 2022, reporting fourth quarter adjusted local currency revenue growth of 12% and adjusted local currency operating income growth of 8%. Food & Pharmaceutical colors continued its strong performance in the fourth quarter, achieving 15% adjusted local currency revenue growth. The Flavors & Extracts Group had another solid year in 2022, reporting 6% adjusted local currency revenue growth and 10% adjusted local currency operating profit growth. In the fourth quarter of 2022, the Flavors & Extracts Group delivered 3% adjusted local currency revenue growth. For the year, I expect the Flavors & Extracts Group to deliver mid-single-digit revenue growth and mid- to high single-digit operating profit growth in 2023. In the fourth quarter of 2022, the Asia Pacific Group reported 6% adjusted local currency revenue growth and 4% adjusted local currency operating profit growth. I think, again, while we face that in every one of our businesses, the new wins we generated in Flavors & Extracts, in Food Colors and Pharma, we're so much larger than the destocking impact that we were able to come out on dry ground there from a revenue standpoint and then of course from a profit standpoint and color in Asia. So all those things come together that I think we're going to -- we'll be off for another good year, but we'll start off with a little bit of slowdown again in SNI, and that's going to have an impact in Flavors & Extracts on the top and bottom line, but I think we'll largely overcome those factors in Color and Asia even in Q1 and then, of course continuing through the year."
