    "content": " Over the long term, I still expect the Flavors and Extracts Group to deliver mid-single digit revenue growth and operating profit margin improvement of 50 to 100 basis points annually for the next couple of years. I think the success we've had certainly at the first half of this year and last year is very broad-based natural colors, synthetic colors, personal care each of our businesses has done quite well on a lot of different dimensions. Flavors don't necessary cost a lot compared to other ingredients and so I think that gives us a some level and some degree of flexibility, but again, you have to find a situation that's going to work for your customer because you said it perfectly, otherwise you're going to start losing business. So that's -- I think, ultimately, it's kind of a first half, second half improving, which then ride very nicely into 2023, we would be in a much more favorable crop position in the first half of 2023, obviously, versus the first half of 2022. And again, I think that we're set up very, very nicely for the back half and into 2023, right, I think there's a lot of good momentum going into 2023 for the company across each of our groups."
