    "content": " I'm Steve Rolfs, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Sensient Technologies Corporation. I am joined this morning by Paul Manning, Sensient's Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer. Earlier this morning, we released our 2022 first quarter financial results. During our call today, we will be explaining the differences between our GAAP results and our adjusted results. The adjusted results for 2021 remove the impact of the divestiture-related costs, the results of the operations divested, and the impact of the costs and income related to our operational improvement plan. I would also like to remind everyone that comments made this morning, including responses to your questions, may include forward-looking statements. Our actual results may differ materially, from those that maybe expressed or implied due to a wide range of factors, including those set forth in our SEC filings. We urge you to read Sensient's previous SEC filings, including our 10-K and our forthcoming 10-Q for a description of additional factors that could potentially impact our financial results. Our continued focus on sales execution, customer service and product delivery are driving the growth and each of our groups. It continues to build on an already strong sales pipeline, our exceptional customer service broad product portfolio and our robust technologies that position us as a reliable supplier for our customers, and have also positioned us for future success. As discussed during our last couple of calls, we continue to experience an increase in input costs including raw materials, transportation, energy and labor, along with logistical delays. While we expect these supply chain and inflationary challenges to persist throughout 2022, we will continue to provide robust customer service and on time product delivery, and we will conduct additional pricing actions as required. Turning to the lock downs in China and the war in Ukraine, the current situation in each of these reasons has not had a significant impact on our revenue in the first quarter. Any impact on Sensient as a result of the events in China, Ukraine will most likely be on raw material availability, shipping and logistics. Higher adjusted local currency revenue was primarily the result of favorable pricing and volume growth in Flavors, Extracts and Flavor Ingredients as well as favorable pricing and natural ingredients. Overall, the Flavors and Extract Group achieved a mid-single digit price increase in the first quarter. During our last call, I mentioned that the natural ingredients business would face a modest volume headwind in the first half of 2022. Excluding natural ingredients, the Flavors and Extract Group experienced double digit sales growth across all of its product lines. The growth in the group's operating profit margin is a result of a focus on more value added product solutions, lower overall cost structure as a result of the group's past restructuring and the divestiture activities and recent pricing actions. Flavors an Extract group is off to a good start to the year, I expect the group to deliver mid to high single digit revenue growth in 2022 an operating profit margin improvement of 50 to 100 basis points for the year. Over the long-term, I expect the Flavors and Extract Group to deliver mid-single digit revenue growth and operating profit margin improvement of 50 to 100 basis points annually. Furthermore, the focus on product line diversification into skin, body care and other categories is a key component of the business's growth in 2022 will be for the foreseeable future. In addition, the group implemented a low single digit price increase in the first quarter. Over the long-term, I expect the group to deliver mid-single digit revenue growth. We've had a great start to 2022, we are operating at or above the previous guidance we outlined for the year. As Steve will discuss, we are raising our guidance. Sensient's first quarter GAAP, diluted earnings per share was $0.88. As I mentioned in our opening remarks, we do not have any adjustments to Our GAAP results for the first quarter of 2022. Last year\u2019s is first quarter GAAP results included divestiture and operational improvement plan costs, which decreased last year's first quarter results by approximately $0.07 per share. In addition, our GAAP earnings per share in the first quarter of 2021 included approximately $25.6 million of revenue, and approximately $0.05 per share of earnings related to the divested product lines. Excluding these items in our 2021 results, our consolidated adjusted revenue in the first quarter of 2022 grew by 8.4% in local currency to $355.5 million. Our adjusted local currency EBITDA was up 16.3% for the quarter, and our adjusted local currency EPS was up 16.9% for the quarter. Our cash flow from operations was down in the first quarter, primarily due to strategic investments in our inventory position and higher instead of compensation payments. As Paul mentioned, we continue to make strategic investments in our inventory to support our demand and to ensure we have appropriate safety stock positions as logistics and supply challenges continue. Our balance sheet is well positioned to support our capital expenditure spend attractive M&A, and our long standing dividend. Turning to our 2022 guidance, we are raising our reported GAAP EPS to now increase at a high teen growth rate compared to our 2021 reported GAAP EPS of $2.81. At this time, we do not anticipate any material divestiture related costs or operational improvement plan costs in 2022. In addition, we are also raising our 2022 adjusted EBITDA and EPS guidance to both grow at a high single to double digit growth rate in local currency. Based on current exchange rates, we now expect currency to be a headwind of approximately $0.12 per share. So if you look at Q1, I'll go through each of the groups. So starting with Asia Pacific, just saw, we're up 14% on revenue, kind of low single digit on pricing, nearly about 3%, which then implies a double digit increase in volume. So really strong volume growth there, driven a lot by new wins, targeted customers. Again, our sweet spot of these sort of B and C style customers applies very strongly there in Asia Pacific. Looking over at colors, as you're heard, they were up 12% revenue, their pricing was about a mid-single digit, type increase, nearly about 5% was pricing, which then suggests 7% was volume. There, again, really, really strong new wins across a broad variety of customers, really good growth across really each of the geographic regions and the product lines. So -- I know there's a number of new investors on the call today, too. So as you know, Flavors consists of Flavors, Extracts, our flavor ingredients, which are HPPs, and yeast extracts. And then, of course, our Sensient natural ingredients, which is onion and garlic. So if you take Flavors extracts and Flavor ingredients, that's about two-thirds of the Flavor Group. That part of the business was up about 13, kind of almost mid-single teen -- sorry, mid teen revenue growth, with very nice operating leverages there, well into the double digit profit growth. That two-thirds, we got a kind of the mid-single digit pricing increase pretty much what we expected about 5%, which then implies that part of the business got about a 7% or 8% volume, contribution. So very, very nice volume build there, again, a lot of new wins, targeted customers, et cetera. Now you look at that other part of the Flavor, the one-third of the Flavor Group, the two-thirds flavors ingredients and extracts the ones that are the SNI business. So this is the flag this is the headwind, I flagged in the earlier call, the Q4 call, suggesting that this would be a bit of a headwind for the first part of the year. But the crop comes in April, it's being pulled as we're speaking right now. So far, so good. And we feel very good about SNI for the year that one-third of the Flavor group, we feel very good that they'll achieve what they need to achieve from a volume standpoint, and from a revenue standpoint, as well as pricing. So, overall, as expected a little bit of a headwind there. Again, this is really kind of a market driven thing. There have been, as you heard, and know very well droughts and other situations in the west coast in particular, that have impacted the crops for this last cycle, but the cycle moving forward, we expect that to be a much improved situation. Maybe picking up on that on the I don't think we've ever discussed earnings on a conference call on our end, but maybe take us through, how much that impacted you, specifically the first quarter. And then just given the supply shortages, you cited whether. Well, I think, we -- at the at the highest level here, we're raising our guidance for the year, because we think we see very broad based growth across all the groups really driven by new wins. So I think that's a very, very important insight. So, it's overall for Q1, our revenue was up 8%, if not for the SNI impact, we as a company we would probably been up about 10% or 11% with about say overall say 5% of that pricing and 6% volume. It stems a lot from the customer service side, the delivery side. COVID or no COVID, recession or no recession, we expect a high level of service out of all of our businesses every single day. So, yes, I think when you look at -- I'll kind of break down each of the regions, starting with Asia. Asia, what's driving a lot of that margin improvement is the product mix, as you heard me say, we didn't necessarily drive a lot of that revenue with price. So the continued emphasis on Flavors, the continued emphasis on natural colors, and with the types of customers that we like to emphasize, I think, is paying dividends. When you look at Color, very similar dynamic in terms of the types of products natural colors there. While makeup is still not quite where it was, versus pre pandemic, or in the pre pandemic measures. Hair care, body care, these markets still continue to grow very, very nicely. And as you know, that's a profitable business for us. And then, of course, on the flavor side, why I think we continue to improve the margin is, again, a lot of fundamental good volume and the Flavors and Extract side of that business. Precisely what we've been emphasizing for many, many years now. That restructuring thing we went through that very painful process is still paying dividends for us, as we continue to better utilize our capital footprint, we continue to see a very nice uplift in that operating profit margin. So I, even though it seems like it was many years ago, and sometimes I wish it was even longer ago, in my own mind, anyway, it really has had a profoundly beneficial impact on the Flavor Group in terms of helping us to raise that margin. So mix, the outcome of that restructuring and cost savings work that we did. And of course, in each case, pricing is going to be a little bit of a factor. So you wrap all those together and then you pair that with our good service levels, and our strong wins across the Board. As I look at Q2, looking at sales for April, right now, sales look really good in each one of the groups. And then as I look at here, and May and June, sales look really good. Well, yes, that's a great question. I mean, certainly, there's evidence in some markets of folks trading down, Europe, for example, has tended to be a much larger private label market compared to say, the U.S. market. Ironically enough, it would appear that private label sales in some product segments in the U.S. are actually down despite this inflation. So, right now, it's kind of hard to predict how that pricing elasticity is going to play out here in Q2 and beyond. But I would tell you this, Sensient as a company, we deal in all types of customers from the biggest multinationals to some of the smallest startups, we're dealing across every one of the product categories, from beverage to pet food, to savory snacks, we're very, very well represented, we have a very substantial sales force. So that when somebody wants to go from a very expensive drink, to a not as expensive drink, well, the not as expensive drink still has color, and it still has flavor in it. Sensient is a very recession resistant business, the nature of our products or products that people continue to buy, whether there's a recession or not, yes, they may trade down, but ultimately, we're still represented even in those products they would trade down too. And then lastly, I wonder if you're seeing any regulatory tailwind helping your business. I think last time, we had talked about titanium dioxide as an example. Well, regulatory in general, I like to always see that as a tailwind. Consumers want what they view as better products, and better products require more technology. Specifically, about titanium dioxide, I think there's a lot of activity. As you know, the European Union has come up very strongly against titanium dioxide, that\u2019s the food agencies have. So yes, it's very early for some customers, given the recent regulatory change, but for other customers, they've been working on this for some time. It's very much when you say R&D, it's kind of little R, really big D and titanium dioxide replaces a good example of that type of dynamic. So yes, I think that'll be a nice tailwind for us for Europe. And then as it migrates over the Atlantic for the U.S., and then eventually into the Asia Pacific region as well. Paul, I just curious on the first on the column makeup, I know you mentioned it's not back to where we were pre pandemic, but do expect to ever get back there, given that it seems like remote work has become sort of a permanent thing for a lot of companies now. I do, I think it will, you still have to look good on the camera Mitra, and so I think there's always going to be a need for that. I think the demographic has changed a lot more younger females using makeup, males using makeup. So, I think makeup has been used for probably the last 2000 years of human history. But yes, I think there\u2019s a lot of good signs, telltale signs, the pipeline has picked up. But that's a market where I think many of our customers are very much emphasizing, okay, we got to go to customers with innovative products, we need to show them interesting things, different things. So I think you're going to see a little bit of a renaissance perhaps in some of the color makeup, but remember this too, personal care, it kind of goes moves in cycles. Couple of years ago, makeup was the biggest thing. But ultimately, consumers make choices about where they're going to spend their money. And as you know, we had a larger subscription than the makeup segment going into the pandemic. But over the last couple years, we've actually been quite successful, diversifying into some of these other segments. When precisely and to what degree, that's a little bit harder to predict. But I would tell you that the pipeline looks very good, the customer activities is quite good. Switching over now on price increases, you clearly have had some success here, in terms of being able to implement increases across all businesses. I just curious if part of the negotiations more or less just trying to offset the higher input costs you're seeing, or maybe perhaps fees out even more than that. Well, we're not looking to put our customers at a disadvantage, we know they have to compete in the market. So our goal is, obviously there's many input costs to address into cover. And so I think philosophically, that's what we've done. Again, we're not looking to, we don't want to put our customers at a disadvantage. Pricing is not as easy as it may seem, it can be quite complex, it can be very time consuming. I just curious, almost a year into that acquisition, if it's kind of met your expectations or even exceeded it. So, FSI is I would tell you that it would be exceeding my expectations. And so I would tell you, it's exceeded it. They've got very hardworking, very dedicated people in that business. Sure, there's always a possibility of M&A and there's certainly a fair amount of activity now. But as you just referenced, sometimes you don't need to buy a company, when you can set up the appropriate relationship, whether it's a contractual obligation, or a contractual arrangement to purchase their material. And again, we don't necessarily always have to buy something to get what we're trying to get. Again, maybe we contract on the supply chain side, and that gets you what you want. And then finally one for Steve, always a tough one in terms of the tax rate. So you're right, it was up about 100 basis points in the quarter and in most quarters this year I expect it to be up a little bit over last year. So for the full year, we're probably looking at maybe 200 basis points above prior year would be my guidance. And, unfortunately, it'll be a little up and down each quarter. But by the time the year is done, we're looking at about a 200 basis point increase. So Leigh the -- our personal care business that you -- we have skin care, makeup, hair care, body care is really kind of our four key segments. To your point around skin and makeup, skin has been a very strongly growing part of the market right now for a lot of different reasons. Whether it's whitening effects, or anti-aging, or anti polluting factors, a lot of interest in skincare, and that has been robust throughout the pandemic. As you turn to makeup, as I mentioned before, we're not quite fully recovered from COVID. Because eye makeup has actually done pretty well, because you can't hide your eye, I guess you could put a mask over your whole face. So yes, when you wear a mask, though, it's kind of, it's not so great. So that's why we're glad that people don't have to wear masks as often anymore, because I think that's only going to contribute. But yes, I think that would be the only other comments that I would make on that one. I mean, obviously, inflation is high, so it opens up the dialog. Well, nobody likes getting a price increase. The first thing person, they're all trying to do their job. So, again, it takes skill, it takes judgment, and you got to work with your customers, whether they're beverage or snack or savory or whatever they may be selling. So maybe some have stronger logistical costs, because for example, beverage products tend to be heavier. So they may have more of an impact there than say, a snack food, which would have some of the same constraints there. But then again, a snack food has a lot of grains. So I think that most of the raw material inflation, logistics, utilities, et cetera, that you read about in the Wall Street Journal, those are essentially the things that we have to contend with. And so again, it's a matter of working with your customers, you got to keep it so that they can continue to be competitive. Okay, can you talk a little bit about the M&A environment in terms of rates and the dollar and just what you're seeing when you're looking around, I know a lot of deals are opportunistic, and not strictly driven by the economy. Well, I think you can see the number of companies that have been bought and sold over the years and I think it's a fairly robust environment, even during COVID, deals were happening. Well, I guess I mean, I can guess just as much as anybody else can guess. I would tell you though, that we're always looking at companies. Others, it's part of an auction process. But as I mentioned, to Mitra, sometimes you don't need to do an acquisition to get those things that you want from that situation. And so we'll continue to evaluate, where we will continue to be very sensible. I don't want to say conservative, I just want to say sensible, we need to earn a return, we have a cost of capital. And we have needs that accompany technology and otherwise, so you put all those together. And if you can have something for a price that makes sense for both sides, then hey, it can work. We're always looking, we're always in the market. Number one, the actual numbers that I'm already seeing for April, May, June, and they're good. Number two, I would look at our sales pipeline, what's in our pipeline, is it bigger than it was last year, and make an evaluation on what would close in the next year. And the third thing I look at is what's my trailing 12 months of new wins, we've been generating a lot of new wins. During our trailing 12 months, our new wins has been very, very robust. So that tells me and it gives me a great deal of confidence, those three factors, that I feel good, raising our guidance for '22. Well, you know, in a lot of cases, pricing is ongoing. I think you're seeing our revenue, I quoted the price and volume impact for each one of the groups. You can also see that we're generating operating leverage in each of our businesses with that revenue came profit growth, above and beyond the revenue growth. And you know what, maybe it's just this one raw material, or maybe it's just this one shipping line, or maybe it's just one country facing this utility, inflation. So I would tell you that it's just going to, we're going to continue to monitor the situation and take action as we need to. So there's no silver bullet, there's no easy answer to that one again, every day you kind of pick up the newspaper, or maybe you pick up your phone and look at the newspaper. And you talk to your purchasing folks, and they're like, there's something going on every day. But I think we've managed through it very skillfully, our salespeople done a hell of a job. So I'm very confident that we will do what we need to do and work with our customers in a very judicious manner, as the year continues. When we look at the cost base of your peers, they all talk about or they all seem to be talking about more of a sort of high single digit double digit increase in cost basis, across the Board. And when you're sort of articulating the trends that you're seeing, it feels like it's sort of you guys are closer to a sort of mid-single digit. Well, you're right, our costs are more of like a mid-single digit, on the basis of our cost of goods sold. So, you've seen a take kind of mid-single digit pricing, that mid-single digit on the basis of revenue. And that's, again, to cover mid-single digits on the basis of costs. A couple more, just the last two, I promise. I'm just thinking about the margin, achieved for Q1 and sort of had to think about the cadence for the rest of the year. So would expect margins, I would have thought to improve in that division as we go throughout the year. Yes, so Flavors, we expect that 50 to 100 basis point improvement in that OP margin for the year. So you know, those aren't necessarily linear. And it doesn't necessarily always follow a neat, tidy pattern. On the Color side, that as I noted in my prepared comments, we look to be north of 20% OP margin for the year. Again, how one individual quarter may play out, I really don't want to predict that one. But, last year, we were just we were kind of 19.2 to on the OP margin. So that implies, something better than that 50 to 100 basis point improvement there in Color, probably more like 80 to get to that 20% OP margin. They were about 20 last year Q1, they were 22.5. Great, thank you, and I promise the last question on the balance sheet. And as you mentioned, you're not down to sort of a 2.1 times net debt EBITDA level? Yes, well, I think the best way to give shareholders return is to grow EBITDA. And then once you have that cash to use, you want to invest in the business. $90 million, is what we're planning this year, I'd love to spend $90 million next year, because I got a lot of ROI projects that is the purest, finest return I can ever offer to shareholders. Point 2, we've got a long standing commitment to the dividend. And then, I like that the debt to EBITDA anywhere between two and three feels very manageable. So if I don't have an interesting company to buy, yes, I can pay down a little bit more debt. But then again, maybe it's a better return to shareholders to purchase back our own stock. So if we had an acquisition on the horizon, which we might, we might not, that would that would tell you that what, we're not going to do buybacks. But if you don't see an acquisition, then you could probably expect that there will be some buyback activity. And at this time, I'd like to turn the conference back over to Management for any closing remarks."
