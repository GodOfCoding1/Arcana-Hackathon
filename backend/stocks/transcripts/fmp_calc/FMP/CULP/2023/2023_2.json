    "content": " We believe but of these moves will generate meaningful cost savings, estimated at approximately $3 million annually without sacrificing our ability to support our customers, grow our cut and sew business and maintain our competitive advantages through our lower cost manufacturing and sourcing operations in Haiti and Asia. The company reported a loss from operations of $11.9 million compared with income from operations of $1.6 million for the prior year period, and compared sequentially with a loss from operations of $4.7 million for the first quarter of this fiscal year. It also includes approximately$1 million in higher-than-normal inventory markdowns associated with our upholstery fabrics business and $713,000 in restricting expense related charges associated with the closure of the upholstery fabrics segment\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cut and sew facility in Shanghai China. Net loss for the second quarter was $12.2 million or $0.99 per diluted share, compared with net income of $851,000 or $0.07 per diluted share for the prior year period. Our overall operating performance for the second quarter was primarily affected by lower sales, impairment charges due to the write down of inventory to its net realizable value, and inventory close out sales for a mattress fabric segment, markdowns and inventory due to our age inventory policy for both segments and restructuring related charges associated with our upholstery fabric segment. During the second quarter of this fiscal year, we reported a foreign exchange gain associated with our China operations of $1 million, which is mostly non-cash compared with the foreign exchange loss of $151,000 during the second quarter of last fiscal year. For the mattress fabric segment, sales for the second quarter were $26.2 million down 35.8% compared with last year, second quarter and down 10.7% compared sequentially with the first quarter of this fiscal year. For the upholstery fabric segment sales for the second quarter were $32.2 million down 4.5% over the prior year, which was affected by Culp  related shutdowns in Vietnam. Cash flow from operations and free cash flow were $6.2 million and $4.8 million respectively for the first six months of this fiscal year, as compared with cash flow from operations and free cash flow of negative $1.3 million and negative $5.8 million respectively for the first six months of last fiscal year. Importantly, since the end of the third quarter of last fiscal year, inventory reduction has contributed approximately $13.7 million to the company's cash position. The company also did not repurchase any shares during the second quarter of this fiscal year, leaving approximately $3.2 million available under our current share repurchase program. We expect net sales for the third quarter will be moderately lower as compared to the $58.4 million in net sales for the second quarter of this fiscal year, with sales for the third quarter affected by pure billing days to the longer than normal holiday shutdowns both internally and by customers and suppliers, as well as the timing of the Chinese New Year holiday which falls primarily within the third quarter. We also expect our cash position as of the end of the third quarter of this fiscal year to be lower than the $19.1 million at the end of the second quarter this fiscal year, but higher than the $14.6 million at the end of last fiscal year. Looking ahead to the fourth quarter of this fiscal year, we are cautiously optimistic for some improvement in business conditions with an expectation for a sequentially improved sales and reduced operating loss as compared to the third quarter of this fiscal year and with a cash position that is expected to be comparable to slightly lower as compared to the $14.6 million at the end of this fiscal year."
