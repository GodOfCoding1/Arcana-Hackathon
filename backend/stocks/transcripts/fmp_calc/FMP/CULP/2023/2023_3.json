    "content": " So, when we think about the third quarter, there are really three major themes: number one, current weak demand within the two industries we service; number two is our focus on maintaining a strong balance sheet and managing our cash position; and number three, the transformation within our CHF Mattress Fabrics business. Our overall operating performance for the third quarter was primarily affected by operating inefficiencies due to lower sales and holiday shutdowns affecting both of our businesses, operating inefficiencies in our Upholstery Fabric segment's cut and sew facility in Haiti and in our Read Window Products business and restructuring charges associated with our Upholstery Fabrics segment. For the Mattress Fabrics segment, sales for the third quarter were $24.7 million, down 35.8% compared with last year's third quarter and down 5.8% compared sequentially with the second quarter of this fiscal year. For the Upholstery Fabrics segment, sales for the third quarter were $27.8 million, down 33.5% over the prior year, which was the segment's strongest sales -- quarterly sales performance since 2006. Importantly, since the end of the third quarter of last fiscal year, inventory reduction has contributed $18.2 million to the company's cash position. We expect net sales for the fourth quarter to be moderately higher as compared to the $52.5 million in net sales for the third quarter of this fiscal year, driven largely by strong sales improvement in the Mattress Fabrics segment, and comparable sales performance in the Upholstery Fabrics segment."
