    "content": " Our effective income tax rate during the first quarter of this fiscal year was affected by the mix of taxable income that is mostly earned by our foreign operations located in China and Canada, which have higher income tax rates than the U.S. Income tax expense during the first quarter of last fiscal year was significantly higher than the current quarter because of the $3.7 million net income tax charge, I mentioned earlier. Despite our topline growth, operating performance for the first quarter as compared to the first quarter of last year and also compared to the fourth quarter of last year\u2019s 7.2% operating income margin was negatively affected by the dramatic increase in freight costs and by lower sales in our Read Window Products business, as well as startup cost in our new Haiti facility."
