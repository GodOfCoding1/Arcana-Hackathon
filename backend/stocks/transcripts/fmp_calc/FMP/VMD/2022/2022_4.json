    "content": " Our core business generated net revenue of $37.5 million during the fourth quarter of 2022, as compared to net revenues of 29 million in the fourth quarter of 2021, which equates to a 29% increase. It's the least amount of impact for patients changing insurances and all the things that cause challenges really in the first quarter that we end up fighting headwinds on, which is why our revenue guidance may look muted to some people on a sequential basis, but if you look year-over-year, we're up 27%."
