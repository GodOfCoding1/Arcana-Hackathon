    "content": " Our TCE for the quarter ended at $44,376 per day across the fleet and above $40,000 per day across our MR business, which is the largest segment in Hovik  At the last Friday, TORM had fixed 55% of our open days in the fourth quarter of the year at US$45, 257 per day. Since the start of the rationalization of Ukraine in February of this year, we've seen strong improvements in product tanker rates, increased tradeshows, longer trade distances, more inefficient trading patterns, partly due to the EU sanctions on Russia and partly due to more fundamental factors such as oil demand recovery and increased import needs. Please turn to slide eight - slide 11, sorry, As Jacob mentioned, we have seen continuous rate increases in the tanker market in the third quarter of 2022 with our TCE rates reaching US$44,376 per day, an increase of 165% from the first quarter of 2022. And as per 6th of November 2022, 49% of our Q4 2022 tanker days for LR2s were fixed at US$55,105 per day, 44% of our LR1s fixed at US$47,661 per day and 58 of our  fixed at US$43,268 per day. During the third quarter of 2022, our net working capital does increase with US$312 million  primarily driven by the increase in trade receivables to US$248 million, but which logically will be released to cash later. Our net LCV decreased to 31% end of Q3 from 43% end of Q2 2022, which was largely driven by the 20% increase in vessel values now exceeding US$2.5 billion and our strong cash generation. TORM is thus very resistant to the interest rate increases we currently see globally and has seen globally and especially in the U.S. As per end of Q3 2022, we have fixed 89% of the interest rate exposure over the coming 5 years at 1.38% excluded margin and the 5-year interest rate swap in U.S. dollars is currently trading around 4.33%."
