Average rates in the fourth quarter of 2022 increased our rates from $44,376 per day in Q3 to above $47,500 per day in the fourth quarter across the fleet. By the beginning of the year, rates have increased from an average of $16,743 per day, equaling an increase of 184% from the first to the fourth quarter. For MRs, the average rates for the fourth quarter ended at $45,029 per day for LR1s at $48,076 per day and for LR2 the average rates were $58,889. And for the MRs in the first quarter, we as of the 30th of March fixed 89% at $37,730 per day and so far 86 of the LR1 tanker days were fixed at $44,135 per day and 90% of the LR2 days are fixed at $65,950.

A strong TCE rate led to the highest EBITDA from our operations on record and our fourth quarter EBITDA of $267 million brought us to a full year of $743 million, which is more than the previous four years combined. Also today, we have obtained commitment for the refinancing of $433 million bank and leasing agreements with two new bank facilities, thereby extending debt maturities until mid-2028 and with the possibility to extend most of the debt expiration to mid-2029. Please go ahead, sir. Please go ahead, sir."
