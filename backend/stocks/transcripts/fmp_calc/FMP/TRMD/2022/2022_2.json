    "content": " As Jacob mentioned, we are seeing a continuous rate increase in the tanker market in the second quarter of 2022 with our TCE rates reaching $29,622 per day. Spot rates are just below $35,000 per day for the quarter, but due to our accounting principles, part of the revenue related to the increasing rates at the end of the quarter will be recognized after -- so far in the third quarter of 2022, we have seen a further increase in TCE rates per day, and we have now fixed 67% of our data at $45,462. We are, therefore, pleased to see that the average daily trading has increased by almost four times over the past year, with our US market picking up strongly trading volume at NASDAQ, New York accounts for approximately 57% of the total trading volume during the second quarter 2022. Since the end of Q1, established market cap increased by approximately 115%, which is also supported by our operational leverage, so we currently maintain a high operational leverage, which means that and assume $1,000 per day increase in spot rates over the course of the full quarter and all other things being equal, result in a net profit effect of $7.2 million."
