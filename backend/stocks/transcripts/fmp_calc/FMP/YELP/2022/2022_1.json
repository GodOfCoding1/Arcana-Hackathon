Advertising revenue from services businesses increased 14% year-over-year to a quarterly high of $160 million, reflecting record revenue per location. We also made further progress on our initiatives to drive sales to our most efficient channels, driven by record acquisition and strong retention self-serve channel revenue increased by more than 30% year-over-year to reach a new high in the first quarter. In summary, our first quarter results reaffirm the strength and breadth of both our platform and initiatives amid a volatile environment, providing us with continued confidence in our ability to deliver on our plan and drive profitable growth in 2022. net revenue increased by $3 million from the fourth quarter and 19% year-over-year to $277 million, $7 million about the high end of our range. Even as we increase these strategic investments in the first quarter, net loss improved by $5 million year-over-year to a loss of $1 million or adjusted EBITDA increased by 10% year-over-year to $48 million, $3 million above the high end of our range. And we think that's a reflection, both of the expanded portfolio of products that we're providing, as well as obviously, the opportunity for those advertisers to reach high intent consumers who come more than 50% of the time from households with income over $100,000."
