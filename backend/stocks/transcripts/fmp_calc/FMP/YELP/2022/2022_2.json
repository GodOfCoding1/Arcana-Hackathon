    "content": " Our second quarter results show that our product-led strategy is delivering just what advertisers need in a time of economic uncertainty, ad products that connect them with a large and high intent audience that provides measurable performance advertisers spent at record levels with Yelp in the second quarter. Advertising revenue from services businesses increased 14% year-over-year to a high of $174 million, driven by strength in the Home Services category. Our Multi-location channel was a strong contributor to the continued recovery in our RR&O in the second quarter, with revenue growth of approximately 30% year-over-year. Net revenue increased by 8% from the first quarter and 16% year-over-year to $299 million, $9 million above the high end of our outlook range. Underlying this strong performance, we achieved record average revenue per location and grew paying advertising locations by 4% from the first quarter and by 8% year-over-year to a record 569,000. Even with these investments, net income increased 90% year-over-year to $8 million, while adjusted EBITDA increased by 6% year-over-year to $67 million, $12 million above the high end of our outlook range as all of our revenue outperformance flowed through to the bottom line in the quarter."
