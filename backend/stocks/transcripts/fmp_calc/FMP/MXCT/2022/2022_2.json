    "content": " We continue to build traction and saw steady growth in our core business, which was up 45% year-over-year led by revenue from cell therapy customers, which increased 61% year-over-year, while revenue from drug discovery customers increased 4%. As Doug mentioned, we reported total revenue of $9.6 million in the second quarter, compared to $7.1 million in the prior year's quarter, driven by strong performance in our core business. We're also seeing quite a bit of kind of new capital formation, new companies that are being launched with more complex cellular therapies as their base asset, which really portends well for MaxCyte that's what we -- that's in our wheelhouse in terms of doing these more complex cell therapies."
