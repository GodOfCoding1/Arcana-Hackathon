    "content": " Outside of our core business, we recognized $800,000 of SPL Program-related revenue during the third quarter, which puts us at $2.8 million of milestone revenue through the end of Q3 and gives us confidence in our full year milestone revenue guidance of $4 million. The investments we're making in 2022 will advance our ability to support new and expanding markets, engage successfully with emerging therapeutic development programs and companies and support our partners as they move through the clinic towards commercial launch of therapeutic products. In summary, we are pleased with our third quarter 2022 results and remain excited about the future, especially in the cell therapy market as we continue to execute on our financial and strategic goals and make investments to drive growth across the business in the long term. And as we discussed previously, the timing of SPL revenues is predicated on our customers' clinical and regulatory progress and, therefore, is fundamentally more difficult to predict than core revenues, which we manage directly, noting that we continue to expect SPL milestone revenue of approximately $4 million for 2022. In summary, we are encouraged by our third quarter achievements and remain optimistic about the opportunity to lead the industry forward as the premier cell engineering platform technology supporting the development of advanced cell-based therapeutics for patients who may not otherwise have treatment options."
