Other net sales, which principally include pop-up shop and shop-in shop net sales, increased $8.1 million or 92.7% to $16.9 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2023 as compared to $8.8 million in the prior year period, principally driven by higher productivity of our temporary online pop up shops, one additional costco.com pop up shop and the additional Best Buy shop-in-shops over the prior year period. Advertising and marketing expenses increased $5.2 million or 48.9% to $15.9 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2023 as compared to $10.7 million in the prior year period, resulting from continued investments in marketing spend and awareness campaigns to support our sales growth."
