    "content": " As a matter of fact, our preparations for the coming years demand along with the growing market adoption of our new growth engines propelled more than 60% growth in Nova's production output in 2021 and led us to invest in two new production facilities opening later this year. Blended gross margin in the first quarter increased to 57% on a GAAP basis and 59% on a non-GAAP basis, mainly due to a favorable product mix, which included newer product configurations, embedding higher metrology and throughput performance adopted by several customers. Operating margins in the first quarter were at a record level increasing to 28% on a GAAP basis and 35% on a non-GAAP basis, as a combined result of higher revenues, improved gross margins and stable operating expenses. Obviously, up at 59.5% on a non-GAAP basis in the second quarter towards the higher end of the range, I guess, as you guide to 58% is it just do you see a more normal mix in the second quarter, or are there any other pressures whether its input costs or other inflationary pressures on gross margin that bring you back to the 58% level in Q2?"
