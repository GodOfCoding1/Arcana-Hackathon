    "content": " For the quarter, our earnings results came in well ahead of expectation and at the top end of our guidance, including another sequential quarterly revenue record, which represents around 45% growth year-over-year. Our diversification efforts across markets, segments and products continues to bear fruit this quarter as approximately 80% of our revenues were generated by 10 different customers compared to just five in the same period last year. With the company revenues exceeding $500 million over the last four quarters and profitability rates hitting the higher mark established by our planned business model, we can delineate this quarter the realization of our Nova 500 strategic plan, which cemented the fundamentals to support our future organic and inorganic growth. At the midpoint of our third quarter estimates, we anticipate the following: gross margins of approximately 57%; operating expenses on a GAAP basis of approximately $44 million; operating expenses on a non-GAAP basis of approximately $39 million; effective tax rate of approximately 13%. Before I conclude my remarks, I would like to note the following: Nova's first half 2022 revenues increased more than 50% over the comparable half year of 2021, outperforming the capital equipment market and the peer group growth rates. And I think that the results in the second quarter, which evidently we had four territories for the first time accounting 15% or more adding one new territory, it's a significant one relative to the Korea, Taiwan and China in \u00e2\u0080\u0093 historically."
