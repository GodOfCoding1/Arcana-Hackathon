    "content": " Thus far, we are encouraged by preliminary PK and blinded safety data observed to date, which supports our thesis that at appropriate dose levels and antibody selected for abeta oligomers, such as ACU193 may provide a differentiated product profile in the fight against Alzheimer's disease. And considering the blinded case of ARIA-E observed in the Cohort 4 at the time, we opted to amend the trial's protocol to reduce the dose level in Cohort 7, our last Cohort to 25 mgs - milligrams per kilogram every 2 weeks. So I think we're really encouraged that sort of the overall thesis for the ACU193 is very much intact and are confident that the modification for Cohort 7 in particular, gives us more information kind of with the mid-dose level between the 10 mgs per kg and the 60 mg per kg that's ongoing in Cohort 6."
