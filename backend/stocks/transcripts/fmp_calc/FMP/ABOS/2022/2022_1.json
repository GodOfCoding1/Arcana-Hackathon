    "content": " Daniel O'Connell, President and Chief Executive Officer will begin today's call with a review select first quarter 2022 business highlights and provide an update on the ongoing INTERCEPT-AD trial. To start, we continue to make significant progress with our INTERCEPT-AD clinical trial of ACU193 the first monoclonal antibody developed to selectively target soluble amyloid-beta oligomers to enter the clinic. In addition to our efforts, we do anticipate growing interest in upcoming clinical and regulatory developments for other novel Alzheimer's disease programs in the coming quarters, including Phase 3 data readouts for bapineuzumabversus gantenerumab and Lilly donanemab while these treatments are targeted primarily at amyloid plaques and protofibrils, not soluble a beta oligomers. Before I turn the call over to Matt, I wanted to highlight that we announced that Frontiers in Neuroscience published the well supported rationale for targeting soluble A\u03b2 oligomers in early Alzheimer's disease, as well as the preclinical evidence to characterize ACU193 selectivity and differentiated profile. ACU193 is unique and differentiated from other monoclonal antibodies studied in Alzheimer's disease, given its high selectivity for A\u03b2 oligomers, relative to other anti-amyloid monoclonal antibodies that are less selective or target different amyloid species, such as A\u03b2 monomers were deposited A\u03b2 amyloid plaques."
