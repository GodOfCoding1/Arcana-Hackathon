    "content": " I'll cover three areas on today's call: first, key highlights from the quarter and drilling down on what drove our Q1 performance; second, sharing more about why customers choose BlackLine and the efficiency, automation and success they're seeing with our software; and third, an update on our FourQ acquisition and our intercompany momentum. Customer expansion growth and greater uptake of our strategic products also drove higher average deal size in Q1 a multi-quarter trend that continued into Q1 as our average deal size increased to 124,000 this quarter, up from 110,000 in Q1 of 2021. Second, whether due to the great resignation or ongoing digital transformation trends, customers greatly value the automation that makes BlackLine special, being able to automate end-to-end processes across fragmented data enables our customers to quickly and efficiently make sense of complex and historic systems, providing them with valuable transparency and control in their close and accounting process. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open."
