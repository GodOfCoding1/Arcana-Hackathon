    "content": " In the first half of 2022, DTC digital marketing delivered 36 million highly personalized customer context, resulting in 545,000 transactions across our business segments, which generated $76 million in system-wide sales, $37 million in revenue and an ROI of 12x. We ended fiscal 2021 with 0 glass locations in the U.S. And in the first half of 2022 alone, we have grown our U.S. glass business to 120 stores, 350 mobile units and more than 750 employees operating across 27 states, now making us the second largest auto glass replacement business in North America. When you put unit growth and same-store sales growth in the blender and account for our franchise mix, our reported revenue in the quarter was $509 million, an increase of 36% versus the prior year. This nearly $10 million increase versus the prior year was primarily attributable to increased debt levels as we lean into opportunities across our Quick Lube, Car Wash and glass businesses. Chris, thanks for the question. So I think what we said before is like we did with Take 5 Quick Lube, we want to get that business to the place we're happy with it in terms of having the operating model, obviously, having the branding in place and then sort of thinking through, is there a right time to franchise that. Chris, thanks for the question."
