    "content": " As our consolidated business drove strong performance and cash flow, we continue to make significant progress across our key growth levers, quick lube, car wash and glass, leveraging our proven playbook. Given the compelling business model and unit level economics, our pipeline has continued to expand and is now roughly 950 units, giving us a long runway for sustainable and predictable growth, and we're on track for our unit openings for the year. Our greenfield pipeline for openings in the U.S. remains robust and has expanded to over 250 locations in just two years since we entered the car wash business, enabling us to be more selective with M&A. Since entering the highly fragmented $5 billion U.S. auto glass servicing category at the beginning of the year, we have quickly become the second largest player as of the end of the quarter following that same growth playbook we've used in quick lube and car wash. When you put unit growth and same-store sales growth in the blender and account for our franchise mix, our reported revenue in the quarter was $517 million, an increase of 39% versus the prior year. This nearly $10 million increase versus the prior year was primarily attributable to increased debt levels as we lean into opportunities across our quick lube, car wash, and glass businesses. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. But I think when you think about us being an aggressive growth company and the tremendous opportunity in a growing and consolidating environment, subtracting out gross CapEx and then importantly, thinking about that $56 million success fee that we paid in the first quarter when we acquired AGN, you get to a, what I would call an adjusted or normalized free cash flow level, that's actually grown quite nicely. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open."
