    "content": " The statements in today's conference call are not historical facts, including our expectations regarding cash generation, equity returns and future debt levels, our ability to pursue growth opportunities, our expectations or objectives regarding future distribution amounts, capital reserve amounts, distribution coverage, future earnings, capital allocation as well as our expectation regarding market fundamentals and the employment of our vessels, including redelivery dates and charter rates, may be forward-looking statements, as such as defined in Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as amended. Since the end of the second quarter of 2022, we have completed a number of significant transactions for the partnership, including the successful issuance of a \u00e2\u0082\u00ac100 million senior unsecured bond, the completion of the sale of two of our older container vessels, as well as acquisition of the first of four new building vessels we have agreed to acquire with long-term employment in place. The increase was primarily attributable to the net increase in the average number of vessels in our fleet by 17% following the delivery of four LNG carriers during the fourth quarter of 2021, partly offset by the sale of the Adonis in December, 2021 and of the 28,000 container vessels in July of this year. Full year expenses for the quarter increase to 4.4 million compared to three million in the third quarter of 2021, primarily due to the increase in the average size of our fleet and the increase in the voyage expenses incurred by one of the vessels in our fleet employed under voyages charters. And the increase in our total upstanding debt following the issue of the two bonds and the debt assumed following the acquisition of the four LNG carriers during the fourth quarter of 2021, partly offset by the scheduled principal payment during the period, debt prepayments relating to the vessel sales and the full prepayment of two of our credit facilities of a total amount of 95.7 million during the third quarter of 2022. We allocated 29.7 million to the capital reserve as decrease of 1.4 million compared to previous quarter due the decreased debt monetization resulting after the debt repayments and the inclusion in the capital reserve of 3.5 million corresponding to an additional reserve for the bonds issued in July, 2022. Basis current discussions with our lenders with regard to the financing of the new building vessels we have agreed to acquire, we expect fixed rate debts to account for more than 40% of our debt by the time we complete our acquisition program in the second quarter of 2022."
