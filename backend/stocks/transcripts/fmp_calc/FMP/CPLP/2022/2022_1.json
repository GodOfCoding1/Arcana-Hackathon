    "content": "  The statements in today's conference call that are not historical facts, including our expectations regarding cash generation, equity returns and future debt levels, our ability to pursue growth opportunities, our expectations or objectives regarding future distribution amounts, capital reserve amounts, distribution coverage, future earnings, capital allocation as well as our expectations regarding market fundamentals and the employment of our vessels, including re-delivery dates and charter rates, may be forward-looking statements, as such as defined in Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as amended. Interest expense and finance costs increased to $10.3 million from amortization $3.4 million in the first quarter of 2021, due to the increase in the partnership's total outstanding indebtedness. The partnership's recorded net income of $25.1 million for the quarter, compared with net income of $10.9 million for the first quarter of last year, representing an increase of 130% On Slide four, you can see the details of operating surplus calculations that determine the distributions to our unit holders compared to the previous quarter. The increase reflects net income for the quarter and the amortization associated with the equity incentive plan, partly offset by distributions declared and paid during the period, to the total amount of $3 million and the repurchase of the partnership's common units for an aggregate amount of $1.4 million. On Slide nine, we'll review the container market, the container ship charter market continuing to climb to new highs in the first quarter of 2022, with charter rates reaching successive records and freight rates remaining close to all-time highs, The Clarksons Charter Rate index reach an all-time high in March with a three-year time chatter rate for  wide beam 9,000 EU container like the AKADIMOS standing at approximately $95,000 per day for a prompt vessel. In terms of the multiple, I think this is this dictated by a number of things and we have done transactions on the LNG front around 10 times with charters that are in place that with charter duration of five years plus and I think even in an increased rate interest rate environment if you're at the same time are getting longer cash flows, it would be justifiable to transact around the same multiples but, in the end, the criterion is quite robust."
