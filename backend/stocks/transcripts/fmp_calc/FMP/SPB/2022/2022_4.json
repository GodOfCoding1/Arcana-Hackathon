    "content": " We will continue with those measures and refocus our strategy around four core pillars: one, we are streamlining our organizational structure and re-energizing our employee base; two, we are increasing operational efficiencies everywhere and limiting risk; three, we are protecting and deleveraging the balance sheet, strengthening our liquidity; and finally, fourth, we are transforming the company into a pureplay global Pet and Home & Garden business with faster growth and higher margins pro forma. Gross profit decreased $19 million and gross margins of 32% decreased 210 basis points, driven by fixed cost absorption from the lower volume, increased costs from unfavorable impact of foreign currency and continued higher short-term supplier related costs. SG&A expense of $221.9 million decreased 12.8% at 29.6% of net sales, with the decrease driven by the impact of cost reduction initiatives, lower project spend on integration and lower variable incentive and stock compensation, compared to the prior year. The sales performance was driven by poor weather impacting category sales for our Home & Garden business, while Home & Personal Care was impacted by post-pandemic category demand softness during the second half of the year and aggressive inventory reduction actions by retailers in response. Gross profit decreased by $44 million and gross margins of 31.6% decreased 290 basis points, driven by commodity and freight inflation and unfavorable currency impact, partially offset by favorable pricing and improved productivity, pricing lagged inflation during the first half of the year. I think David mentioned in his prepared remarks, that's about $55 million of capitalized variances that are in excess of our current standard costs that sit on the balance sheet that will fluster the P&L, probably about 70% of it in Q1 and most of that in HPC."
