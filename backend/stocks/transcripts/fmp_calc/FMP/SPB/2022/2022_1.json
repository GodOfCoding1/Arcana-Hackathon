    "content": " First, our continuing operations will carry about $20 million higher interest expense in our fiscal '22 than we would expect in fiscal '23, all else being equal, as GAAP accounting for discontinued operations will only allow us to allocate about $40 to $45 million of interest to discontinued operations for the full year, while our actual expected interest expense reduction is about $20 million higher than that on an annual basis after our plan, debt reductions."
