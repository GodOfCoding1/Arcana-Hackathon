Additionally, we expect to generate mid to high single-digit percent sales growth from our recent Fori acquisition, which contributes approximately $200 million in sales to our automation portfolio at a low double-digit percent EBIT margin, which will expand as we integrate the business. Your line is open. As I mentioned in our discussions, we've got a lot more confidence in the trends that we see in our automation business and the trends that we see in our Americas business from a growth perspective, both as we were exiting Q4, as well as what we're seeing at the first part of Q1. One moment for our next question. Your line is open. One moment for our next question. Your line is open. One moment for our next question. Your line is open. Your line is open. One moment for our next question. Your line is open. Well, Steve, I would tell you that as we start to think about the segments on the Americas side and that secular trend that we say in automation, and we see automation being stronger in the Americas piece than the International piece, I mean I, quite frankly, could easily begin to get comfort with the fact that we should see growth within those areas of the portfolio throughout the year, that it shouldn't be certainly front-end loaded versus back-end loaded."
