    "content": " I'm just curious, as volumes ultimately recover, whenever that is, probably late this year or sometime next year because of supply coming on, do you think you can hold sort of these levels in the mid-50s or are we kind of going to drift back, I mean Joe, you may have commented on this, I may have missed it earlier in the call, back to the sort of 60% range plus or minus. So I think what's happening is, you're getting other levers pulled to keep monthly payments in balance, but notwithstanding that, as I said, there's pressure on sub-$20,000 vehicles, which I'm confident the team are very focused on, as I said, to change our mix so that we can mitigate some of the impact on us."
