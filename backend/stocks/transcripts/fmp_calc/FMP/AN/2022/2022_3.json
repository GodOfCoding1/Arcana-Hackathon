    "content": " Revenue for the quarter was $6.7 billion, an increase of 4% as well, driven by higher average selling prices of new and used vehicles, continued consistent growth in our After-Sales and our Customer Financial Services, which more than offset lower sales of new and used vehicles. Mix, however, remains a key focus for us as we continue to see availability issues in the sub-$20,000 price band, where inventory levels year-over-year are approximately 25% lower, which, as a result, despite continued strong demand in this part of the segment, I think, is restricting overall used vehicle volumes. But the real question is, are we going to continue to see a balance that enables reasonable margins, both for us and the OEMs or will we return to a situation that we saw post 2019 where inventory levels significantly were elevated compared to demand, and therefore, you saw as a result of that, the margins that were not just with us, but also with the OEMs and it's a difficult question to answer. And I think what -- because we've seen prolonged period of new vehicle volumes remaining low, the reality is that inventory levels in -- that will impact inventory levels in used and ultimately, it will maintain elevated used values, I think, for a period of time. What I do believe though is, again, as we talked about, if you look at the elements like after sales, if you look at CFS, if you look at the changes we've taken to the cost structure, over time, I think those are significant mitigants and offsets to the new PVR environment that we're currently experiencing and provide us a very stable base of earnings going forward."
