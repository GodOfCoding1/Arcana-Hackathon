    "content": " I'd like to remind everyone that today's conference call contains certain forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, statements regarding financial results for the company's most recently completed fiscal quarter and year, which remains subject to adjustment in connection with the preparation of our Form 10-K as well as comments regarding future events and projections about the future financial performance of Intevac. And that customer partnerships have resulted in is rapidly advancing business opportunities through HAMR upgrade initiatives, and the securing of $70 million in 200 Lean orders which will be delivered over the next four years. The agreement includes a minimum revenue requirement of approximately $100 million over five years, in order for our customer to maintain exclusive access to the TRIO platform for consumer electronics applications. As I mentioned earlier, the $100 million revenue level is merely the minimum required to maintain exclusivity with our first customer, we will continue to pursue additional customers in TRIO and outside of consumer devices. We expect this strong revenue growth the next few years will be driven by upgrades in support of the install base of over 150 systems that will require additional process modules to be HAMR capable, as well as a system backlog today of about $70 million. But that number of the cash down payment, the $22 million had been reflected in our estimations of $105 million to $110 million and when we ended at $113 million, the slightly higher $113 million above our last call guidance was we did security inventory for TRIO that we expected but it came later in the quarter. So you'll likely see inventory continue to go up as we go through the year, but we will still manage cash, you won't see cash go down, let's say to an $80 million or $90 million level right away."
