    "content": " We also had a strong quarter of cash flow generation, primarily as a result of our advanced customer deposits received in support of the record level backlog, and we ended Q3 with total cash and investments of $125 million. In the short-term, this multitude of factors, which include inconsistent components availability, excessive inventory bills, higher cost overseas against a strengthening dollar, a rapid contraction in drive demand from both the client and cloud customers and an overall slowdown in discretionary spending are resulting in an HDD production forecast for the fourth calendar quarter of 2022 that has been nearly halved compared to the levels expected just 6 months ago. Our close collaboration with our customers on their future plans, along with solid backlog of $110 million and growing, provides us with continued confidence in our longer term hard drive revenue forecast and supports our expectation for at least $200 million of HDD revenues through 2025."
