    "content": " We also had another strong bookings quarter for our core HDD business with an additional $22 million of new orders roughly split between systems and upgrades, which together resulted in increased backlog to over $100 million at quarter end. As we discussed last quarter, our $65 million to $70 million forecast for 2023 reflected the amount of systems and upgrades we expected could revenue next year, but the value of shipments was expected to be even higher than that. And as I mentioned at the beginning of my prepared remarks, we have increased confidence that by year-end 2022, balance of cash and investments will be similarly strong as last year's cash position or at least $115 million. At the revenue level, forecasted and expected mix for fiscal 2022, we anticipate gross margins for this year will be around 40% and OpEx for the year to be around $30 million, which includes the $1.5 million for the loss on fixed asset disposals we wrote off in Q1. I think if you looked at 2021 and 2022 and took out the system, that's going to happen in 2022, and we were to pick out the roughly $8 million to $10 million that we get for spares and repairs, the upgrade business has been fairly steady in the low to mid-20s in '21 and '22 at $20 million. We would expect a slight decrease in the upgrades, yes, because if you looked at just giving you three parts of the equation in the total, it's probably going to be somewhere just around $11.5 million to $12 million for Q4 at the run rate of $35 million."
