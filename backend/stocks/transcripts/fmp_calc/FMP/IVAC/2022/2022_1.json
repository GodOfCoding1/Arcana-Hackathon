    "content": " As I mentioned in the last call, I'm happy to confirm we expect HDD revenue in 2022 will be similar to last year at around $35 million. Keep in mind that included in this year is -- our run rate is going to be around $7 million, we're not giving guidance beyond that, we still think there could be some room second half of the year to look at that. And so if you look at the $87 million in backlog at the end of Q1, there's probably closer to around $28 million that's upgrades, field service, and spares. That goes out to -- covers that, as Nigel said, it covers most of 2023, but we still have somewhere around maybe $3 million or $4 million that we're booking in Q2 and Q3 that will result in turns business in the year. And it's probably worth reiterating the comment I made on the last call as well, where we felt that $35 million was the right for this year, 65 next year, but that over the four years that a 200 number was absolutely achievable."
