    "content": " Taking a closer look, revenue from our technology-enabled solutions represented 85% of total revenue and consisted of 48% from clients using our core technology suite of electronic health records or practice management solutions, 15% from clients using 1 or more components of our technology like our business intelligence software and 22% from clients where we are providing IT services, utilizing our technology processes and know-how. If we back into it, it looks like that 22% of professional IT services is about $7.8 million in sales, and that's pretty strong growth, but kind of the 65% coming from the remaining technology driven solution was maybe $22 million and that actually would be a decline year-over-year. Well, it's hard to know how they'll wind up with the earn-outs, although I'd say on a quarterly basis, we always reestimate what we'll pay in terms of the earn-out and as is required by GAAP and by our auditors, Grant Thornton, each quarter, there becomes a small adjustment to the income statement showing either an expense, if you think you're going to pay out more than originally anticipated or a credit if we think we'll pay out a little bit less. When it comes to the Remote, we typically -- similar to how we sell the rest of our packaged services, either it can come as a 1% for the entire package or in some cases, 1 or 2 products can be separately and the services can be separately priced, for example, in some cases, we price credentialing separately because the clients want that to be based on their setup. It could be that the Remote -- the app that we are -- that's part of the overall package, the client might say, okay, so I'm fine paying 5% or 6%, whatever the agreed-upon fee is for all the rest of the services, but this app, for example, we will not be using it more extensive -- we'll be using more extensively."
