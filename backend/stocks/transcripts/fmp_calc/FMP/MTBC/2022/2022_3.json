    "content": " First, to review some high-level financial highlights, we are very pleased to announce our second consecutive quarter of record bookings, driven by a strong initial reception to our Wellness offerings, namely chronic care management and remote patient monitoring. On today's call, I would like to discuss a deeper dive into CareCloud's record bookings that continue to grow due to our newly launched products and heightened focus on organic growth, our innovation and next generation of digital health, including the recent launch of remote patient monitoring, results from the recent class survey, which really put CareCloud on the map with respect to multiple digital health categories and finally, an update on our sales pipeline. Recurring bookings for the third quarter were $7.1 million, up 3x that of a year ago and up 25% sequentially atop the prior record we set last quarter. We are pleased that our pipeline of new customers at the end of Q3 was $28 million, a 40% increase above the $20 million we had in the third quarter of 2021. Taking a look at our results for the first 9 months of 2022, revenue year-to-date was $106.3 million, an increase of 4% compared to $102.1 million in the first 9 months of 2021, with 84% of our revenue generated from our technology-enabled solutions. And the way we are looking at it, this Wellness, chronic care management and remote patient monitoring together, we anticipate from our existing top client base to be able to generate up to $50 million in annualized revenue over the next, let's say, 1 to 2 years' time frame. So if you break it down, the $7 million, so first of all, out of the $7.1 million that we closed in annualized recurring bookings in the third quarter, about 50% of that is coming from Wellness."
