    "content": " We ended the quarter with $108 million of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities on the balance sheet, down $5 million from $113 million in the prior quarter, this was primarily due to higher inventory in the quarter. Tax expense in the first quarter was $2 million or 15% of pretax income, compared to $4 million or 17% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022. Net cash flow from operations was a use of $4 million in the first quarter, due to an increase in inventory, employee incentive payments and the biannual coupon payment on our debt. As a result for the second quarter of fiscal year 2023, revenues are expected between $205 million and $225 million and non-GAAP earnings per diluted shares are expected between $0.05 and $0.25. Our expectations are based on non-GAAP gross margin in a range of 31% to 32%, non-GAAP operating expenses in a range of $48 million to $49 million, temporarily high due to the anticipated R&D milestone payments.
