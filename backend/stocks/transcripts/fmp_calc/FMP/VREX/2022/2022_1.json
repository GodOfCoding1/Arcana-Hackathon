    "content": " Our expectations are based on non-GAAP gross margin in a range of 33% to 34%, non-GAAP operating expenses in the range of $45 million to $46 million, tax rate of about 23% for fiscal 2022, and non-GAAP diluted share count of about 41 million shares. And Larry, I would like to add that, I don\u2019t think we are seeing rest of the quarters or the business for the rest of the year as hamstrung around $200 million a quarter."
