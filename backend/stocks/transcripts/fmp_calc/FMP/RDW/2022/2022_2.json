We assess our 2022 adjusted EBITDA guidance on: one, the analysis concerning revenue guidance already spoke about; and two, our contract mix especially any accretion dilution to actual and forecast gross margins; and three, finally, the investments we made in operating expenses and those trends quarter-over-quarter and what we believe we can achieve in the second half."
