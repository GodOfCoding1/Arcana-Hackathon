    "content": " Customer adversity allows Redwire to absorb these declines in one customer type due to improved performance and another customer type, especially now that our customer types include a larger portion from Europe, but even if it exclude the Space NV contribution from 2022 revenues as if the acquisition had not occurred, Redwire would still have achieved revenues of $148.9 million, well within our full year 2022 revenue guidance of $140 million to $155 million. On the right hand chart, we show our available liquidity as of December 31, 2022, which totaled $53.3 million, a record amount on a quarterly and year-end basis achieved through excellent cash management and the $81.25 million equity financing that both financed the Space NV acquisition and also strengthened our balance sheet with $28.3 million in cash and $25 million in available borrowings under our credit facilities Redwire entered 2022 with a stronger balance sheet and record liquidity."
