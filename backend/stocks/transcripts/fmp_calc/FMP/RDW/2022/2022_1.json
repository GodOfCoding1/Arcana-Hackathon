    "content": " It underscores the nation\u2019s commitment to the critical ISAM technologies that Redwire has been developing, like 3D printing in space and our ISAM program Archinaut, which will demonstrate the first satellite to use ISAM to manufacture and assemble key components once on orbit, as well as our lunar regolith 3D printer that won 2021 Popular Science Award for Innovation and is critical to developing a sustained human presence on the moon. Validating Redwire\u2019s leadership and the long-term potential of in-space manufacturing and assembly of satellites was the White House\u2019s announcement of a national ISAM strategy to encourage the adoption of this technology, but really provides a major tailwind for adoption. So, I think overall, the point that we are just trying to highlight is the potential is tremendous, and we see the demand signals as really strong, but it\u2019s very easy for a key order to move from one quarter to the next, based on some sort of unanticipated change in the forecast of some of our commercial customers."
