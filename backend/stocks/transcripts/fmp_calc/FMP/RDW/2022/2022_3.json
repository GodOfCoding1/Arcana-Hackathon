    "content": " Additionally, early in the fourth quarter, we strengthened our balance sheet with an investment by Bain Capital and AE Industrial Partners, who together made an investment of $80 million in the form of a Series A convertible preferred stock which was used to finance the QinetiQ Space NV acquisition as well as to support Redwire's future growth. The addition of Space NV, a transaction we announced on October 3rd and closed on October 31st, changed our operating scope and scale and will add meaningfully to our improved sequential quarterly performance and total backlog, but also importantly, the acquisition was financed by proven investors in our space, pardon the pun, Bain Capital, a $160 billion leader in multi-asset alternative investment management is joining with us and joining with our existing shareholder, AE Industrial Partners, a leader in aerospace investing, to provide $80 million in capital to fund the acquisition and provide working capital for the growth demonstrated by our record third quarter total backlog."
