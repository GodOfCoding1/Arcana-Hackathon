    "content": " During the month of July, our Canadian flows remain positive, driven by a $139 million in net flows from our Canadian retail business while the rebounding markets helped our firm-wide assets increase to 4.4% to just under $350 million. If you look at the buyback decision and put it in broader context, $60 million would have a very little impact or no impact actually on our leverage ratio on a standalone basis but the impact from an accretion standpoint and what it does for our business is quite profound and that's the tradeoff that we made. On the Wealth Management -- on our wealth business in the U.S. because of the business model, our efforts to integrate we do expect to see expanding margins on that side of the business as well on the Canadian side particularly as we're changing the business mile to act and bring more profits from the advisor advisors on the platform."
