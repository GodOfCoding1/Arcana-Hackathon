    "content": " Due to the overwhelming demand from existing partners for our ownership in CIPW, we made a strategic decision to allow additional unit sales at pricing consistent with the fair market value for that business, which reduced our earnings by 5.5 million, giving us adjusted net income for the quarter of 167 million or $0.85 per share. On the inverse, if you're a U.S. investor, that's looking to take advantage of the strategy that we're pursuing in that marketplace, we're forcing you to take exposure to hundreds of millions of dollars of EBITDA in Canadian asset and wealth management. So I mean, that's the beauty of having the diversification that we now have economically between Canada and the U.S. and asset management and wealth management is they do provide, while they're both market linked businesses and have a lot of strategic synergies, they do provide a nice counterbalance to one another in stressful or accelerating market conditions."
