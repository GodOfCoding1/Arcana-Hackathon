    "content": " Revenue for the fourth quarter was up to $117 million, a 5% increase year-over-year, while net income jumped by 48% year-over-year to $32 million, thanks to new licensing deals and continuing disciplined management of operating expenses. Annual revenue from CE and IoT, including Auto, reached more than $100 million for the first time, with recurring revenue increased 63% year-over-year. That helped push total revenue to $458 million for the year, an increase of 8% from 2021, including almost $404 million recurring revenue, a record setting level, up by 15% year-over-year. Looking ahead in 2023 and beyond, we believe we are well positioned to deliver additional smartphone deals, increased revenue in consumer electronics, close new agreement in the high-growth IoT, including Auto sectors, and make progress in our new licensing opportunities in services."
