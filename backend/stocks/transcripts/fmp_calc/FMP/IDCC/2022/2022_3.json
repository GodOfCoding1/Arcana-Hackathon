    "content": " Increased recurring revenue in consumer electronics, IoT and automobile for the sixth consecutive quarter and entered into a new seven year license agreement with Apple that goes all the way to 2029. In the first three quarters of this year, we are seeing a 37% increase year-over-year in our CE, IoT, auto total revenue and a 60% year-over-year increase in recurring revenue in these markets. As Liren noted, beginning in Q4, we expect to recognize about $134 million a year under this renewal, which represents a 15% increase over the average annual recurring revenue from our prior agreement with Apple. With continued progress toward our annual recurring revenue goal from device licensing of $650 million or more and continued cost management, we believe we can increase our adjusted EBITDA margin to about 60% or more, achieving both our revenue and margin target would equate to roughly $400 million of adjusted EBITDA on an annual basis. Your line is now open. So it's available to folks, but for a long time we've been around 90% or a little bit more of fixed revenue and we see just a lot of growth outside of the smartphones in the consumer electronics IoT auto sector. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. Your line is now open."
