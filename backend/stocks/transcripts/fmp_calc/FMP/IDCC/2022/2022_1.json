We expect to continue to be at the forefront of the technology evolution, and I\u2019m delighted to announce that in the first quarter, 2 of our engineers were upon into leadership role for the next release of 5G Release 18, which is coming in 2023 and will be the first release known but 5G advanced. As we were noted, we continue the momentum we established in 2021 with another quarter of strong financial performance, including our third consecutive quarter with revenue exceeding $100 million, another sequential reduction in expenses and overall strong profitability. We talked about CE kind of closing out the end of 2021, we noted that we added a number of significant agreements that year, a number of agreements, including a top 10 TV manufacturer, and we kind of do it at a \u2013 call it a $25 million run rate, obviously, at $8 million for the Q1 that\u2019s running above that."
