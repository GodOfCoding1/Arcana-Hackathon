    "content": " We have also made considerable progress in Europe, earlier this year we submitted a comprehensive briefing document to the European Medicines Agency or EMA and received very constructive scientific advice from the agency, which will allow us to coordinate the simultaneous development of QRX003 as a single program for both US and EU, which are territories where we intend to start commercialize our products. In addition to building these critical relationships early, it's also important to remember that while we anticipate approval in the US and Europe in 2024, the data from our ongoing clinical study may provide us an opportunity to access a number of these other regions earlier. As mentioned, the highlights of the year include initiating our Netherton Syndrome clinical trial under an open IND, the establishment of a global network of marketing and distribution agreements spanning 60 countries, the in-licensing of two additional rare disease assets to complement our current pipeline, and finally, as Gordon just mentioned, secure sufficient funding for us to take the company into 2024, which is beyond several key inflection points."
