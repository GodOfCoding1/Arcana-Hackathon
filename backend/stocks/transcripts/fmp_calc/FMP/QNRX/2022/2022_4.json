    "content": " As a result of this successful capital raise, Quoin's cash position is at its strongest ever and we now have a financial runway that extends well into the second half of 2024, which is beyond several key inflection points for the company, including the release of clinical data from our ongoing studies. We reported research and development expenses of $600,000 for the fourth quarter and $2.7 million for the year, primarily attributable to expenses related to our Netherton Syndrome clinical trials and associated manufacturing costs as well as our research projects with QUT."
