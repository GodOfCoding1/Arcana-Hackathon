    "date": "2022-11-10 14:38:05",
    "content": " As previously noted, the FDA has indicated that a total of approximately 20 Netherton patients tested would QRX003 at a commercial dose may be sufficient for regulatory approval in the U.S. Based on the positive and constructive feedback we previously received from the EMA, we believe a similar number will also enable us to obtain regulatory approval for QRX003 in Europe. In support of the study, this quarter we launched a dedicated website, www.nethertonsyndromeclinicaltrials.com which provides details of the study design, the location of the clinical site, and survey link for patients interested in participating in this study. During the quarter, we also announced plans to initiate a second clinical trial to evaluate QRX003 in Netherton patients who are currently receiving off-label systemic therapy. Underscoring Quoin's leadership position in the Netherton Syndrome space, we're excited to announce our plans to initiate a second clinical trial that will enable patients who are not eligible for our current study to participate. So patients first go through the survey, then those phone calls, then they come to the site, where they're at their screen, they have to get to genetic testing done, because we want to be sure that every patient who's enrolled in the study, actually has Netherton Syndrome and not some other related disease."
