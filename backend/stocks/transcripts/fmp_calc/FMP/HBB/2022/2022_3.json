    "content": " Net sales decreased 3.8% to $150.8 million compared to $156.7 million, primarily due to lower unit sales, partially offset by price increases, and a favorable product mix. For the 9 months ended September 30, 2022, net cash used for operating activities was $40.2 million compared to $4.1 million in the prior year. We continue to expect full year operating profit to increase significantly compared to 2021, including the $10 million insurance recovery that we recognized in the first quarter of this year. And right now, we still feel good that we're coming -- we'll come down the hill through the end of the year and down to better levels in the first part of next year, kind of sort of maybe late first quarter, sometime in the second quarter."
