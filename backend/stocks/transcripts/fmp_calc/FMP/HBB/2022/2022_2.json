In the second quarter, the improvement in gross profit margin to 21.7% from 18.4% last year, primarily due to a full quarter of price increases that offset higher product and transportation costs. For the 6 months ended June 30, 2022, net cash used for operating activities was $25.5 million compared to cash provided by operating activities of $8.4 million in the prior year. This year, trade receivables provided net cash of $19.8 million compared to $35.2 million in the prior year, due to the timing of collections and decreased sales in 2022. Our inventory position is attributable to several factors, season  late production from , late delivery of some 2021 production, increased ocean transit time, the slight slowing of demand compared to last year's elevated and robust levels and to re-tailor over stocks across the store and related rebalancing programs. At the end of the second quarter, net debt was $126.3 million compared to $98.1 million at the end of last year's second quarter, and $95.7 million at the end of last year.
