    "content": " The company's total revenues for the third quarter were $513 million, a 36% increase from $376.1 million a year-ago. Revenues in Performance Chemicals for the third quarter were $159.7 million, up 20% from last year's $132.8 million. Revenues in Oilfield Services for the quarter were $174.6 million, approximately double the $86.9 million in the third quarter last year, as very strong orders in Production Chemicals and a continued sequential recovery in other segments drove a sharp improvement. We are comparing ourselves against Q3 last year, which was a really strong quarter, and that's a period where we were coming out of the pandemic, and we were experiencing some pretty high volume growth. And it's just a \u00e2\u0080\u0093 it's a strong business that kicks out a lot of cash flow with great technology and our expectations as travel returns and AvTel comes back that we should still be in that single-digit growth, even moving into 2023 with these unpredictable markets. And in 2023, as Patrick said, we will sort of be more moderating that business and it will be slightly ahead of where it was this year for the full-year, but we won't see the same performance that we're going to see in Q3 and Q4. But once that inflation moderates and the business stabilizes in terms of the split between Home Care and Personal Care, I think we'll just then revert to that mid single-digit growth which we expect round about that 4% to 6% in 2023, which will be mainly volume-driven. But as we move into 2023, our expectations are that will be worked more to that sort of Q2, Q3 style business in terms of profitability, and we'll continue to see that mid single-digit volume growth year-over-year."
