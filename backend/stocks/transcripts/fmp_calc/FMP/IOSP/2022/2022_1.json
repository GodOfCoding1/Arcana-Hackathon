    "content": " The company's total revenues for the first quarter were $472.4 million, a 39% increase from $339.6 million a year ago. Revenues in Performance Chemicals for the first quarter were $167.1 million, up 33% from last year's $125.9 million. The only part of our business that has yet to fully recover is the aviation piece in terms of jet travel and that's still probably round about 20% to 25% down year-over-year from where it was, but we've got nice momentum from Q4 into Q1, and we've got good demand going into the second quarter as well, albeit that the winter season is about to come to an end."
