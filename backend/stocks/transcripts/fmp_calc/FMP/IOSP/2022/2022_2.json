    "content": " Turning to Slide 7 in the presentation, the company's total revenues for the second quarter were $467.6 million, a 32% increase from $354.5 million a year ago. Turning to Slide 8 revenues in Performance Chemicals for the second quarter were $169 million, up 32% from last year's $128.2 million. Moving on to Slide 9, revenues in Fuel Specialties for the second quarter were $176.4 million, 23% higher than the $143.1 million reported a year ago. Moving onto Slide 10, revenues in oilfield services for the quarter were $122.2 million, up 47% from $83.2 million in the second quarter last year. Turning to Slide 11, corporate costs for the quarter were $18.5 million compared to $11.6 million a year ago, due mainly to higher personnel related expenses, driven by increased share-based compensation and performance related accruals. Right now, we'd be expect since somewhere between 24% to 25% for the remainder of this year as we add additional volume on that were alluding to earlier that's only going to help with the gross margins and I think it's worth just sort of looking back a number of years and if you go back to probably 2017 when we first did the major acquisition in performance chemicals, our gross margins were in that sort of 18% range and we knew that we could probably get them a lot higher, and we've worked very hard and we've added 5, 6, 7 percentage points on."
