    "content": " As Heyward said, our Retail Pharmacy segment adjusted EBITDA SG&A expenses were $40.5 million or 90 basis points better, as a percent of revenue, than the prior year first quarter due to lower payroll, occupancy and store operating expenses, driven by store closures and our cost reduction initiatives. For our first quarter, Elixir saw revenues decreased $146 million or 7.8% to $1.7 billion due primarily to a planned decrease in Elixir insurance membership and the previously announced client loss, slightly offset by our new rebate partnership, as well as higher utilization of high-cost drugs."
