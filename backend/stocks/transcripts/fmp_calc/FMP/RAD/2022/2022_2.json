While management will not be speaking directly to the slides, these slides are meant to facilitate your review of the company's results and to be used as a reference document following the call. Before we start, I'd like to remind you that today's conference call includes certain forward-looking statements. Also, we will be using certain non-GAAP measures in our release and in the accompanying slides. And I'm encouraged that we're not only exceeding expectations, but also demonstrating that our strategy is gaining momentum. And at Elixir, we're making progress on our competitive positioning, building out our leadership teams and integrating our various assets. This new approach will not only help us attract and retain the best talent in a very competitive labor market, while also providing our associates the flexibility they desire. So while the environment we do business in will continue to be dynamic, and at times, as we've seen very unpredictable, I'm really optimistic about our company's future and excited about the new Rite Aid we're building. As for the second quarter, we grew our revenues 2.2% to $6.1 billion, including a 6.5% increase in our retail segment. Continuing our strong trends in inventory turns from prior quarters, demonstrating that people are really liking our new merchandise. Our results were driven by our vaccine administration, improved profitability at Elixir, and strong results in categories such as vitamins and upper respiratory. We also, importantly, amended and extended our revolving credit facility, successfully pushing maturity out to August 2026, as we continue to enhance our financial flexibility to drive and deliver on our RxEvolution strategy. These results reflect our continuing efforts to serve our customers and communities, especially in this rapidly changing environment when they need us the very most they ever have. We administered nearly 2.5 million COVID vaccines in the quarter, successfully meeting the continued and increasing demand of our customers. In addition, we saw COVID testing demand increased notably during the quarter, and we conducted over 700,000 free PCR tests, with turnaround time still averaging just over two days in spite of the volume. Also, in partnership with Health and Human Services, we supported summer school testing in several school districts to ensure schools are a safe environment for learning. And we believe that our support for testing has the potential to further expand, and we're ready to grow our partnerships to support additional school districts for 2021 and 2022 school years. And we are preparing for increased vaccinations to support workplaces, when it comes to their mandate, and probably boosters, although it's still a little bit undetermined. Laker which is the industry-leading adjudication platform, our own mail order and specialty pharmacies, and a large and growing cash card business, all of which provides the scale to drive increased economic for us and our customers. However, we still have much work to do to modernize and integrate our assets and finalize and launch the next phase of our new clinical and digital solutions."
