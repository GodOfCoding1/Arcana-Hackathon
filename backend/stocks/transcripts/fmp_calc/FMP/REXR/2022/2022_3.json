    "content": " Looking forward Rexford remains well-positioned to continue to deliver substantial NOI growth, we project embedded incremental cash NOI growth of 40% equal to $170 million within our in place portfolio over the next 24 months based on today's market rents and assuming no further acquisitions. Marketed quality assets continue to see multiple offers with some recent closings and accepted offers still occurring at cap rates as low as 3%, a reflection of our market's long term differentiated fundamentals and performance. Please proceed with your question. Please proceed with your question. Please proceed with your question. So, what I mean is, if we're buying something, and we have limited value creation, obviously, the cap rate we're going to require at this point in the cycle is going to be substantially higher than let's say, a near term repositioning that moves us up to some of the yields you've seen us achieving recently, which you look at the current repositioning redevelopment portfolio having a 6.7% stabilized aggregate yield. Please proceed with your question. Please proceed with your question. Great, thank you for that. Great, thank you for that."
