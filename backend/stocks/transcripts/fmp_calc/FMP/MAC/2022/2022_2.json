    "content": " For the quarter, we executed 274 leases, that's a 27% increase over the second quarter of last year and a 42% increase over the pre-COVID quarter of 2Q '19. Third, an $8 million decrease in non-cash straight line of rent income, resulting from the high level of pandemic driven rental assistance that we granted to our tenants last year in the second quarter of 2021. One, an $8 million reduction in interest expense, which resulted primarily from the company's dramatic $1.7 billion or 20% debt reduction during last year. Two, $5 million of net benefit, resulting from a $14 million quarterly reduction in rent abatements, which was offset by a $9 million relative negative change in bad debt expense between the second quarter of last year and the second quarter of this year. Excluding that non-cash straight line of rent impact, FFO is estimated to increase by a little over $30 million this year, roughly 7% growth, which represents an increase of $0.14 per share. But most importantly, given our best-in-class AA+ portfolio, a very strong leasing pipeline of signed new leases still to open this year, next year and even into 2024, together with the depth and breadth of uses that still want to be part of our town centers, I believe we are extremely well positioned to further reimagine and reposition our centers in a way that will continue to attract shoppers, regardless of what lies ahead."
