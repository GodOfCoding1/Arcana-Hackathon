    "content": " If this NIO growth is attainment '22, given the 7.3% growth from last year and 2021, this would represent the second consecutive quarter of greater than 7% same center NOI wide growth, as our core operating business has rebounded extremely well following the pandemic. Other notable leases signed in the third quarter include Louis Vuitton, a Broadway Plaza, Gucci Men and Scottsdale Fashion Square are Terex and Kendra Scott and Tyson's Corner,  Village Corte Madera, Doc Martens and Los Cerritos Three People Movement at Kierland Commons, JD Sports a Country Club Plaza, Lululemon and Lovesac at SanTan village, and Levi's at Washington Square. As I mentioned last quarter, although the future remains unknown, and despite the macroeconomic backdrop and the looming potential of a recession, to-date, we have seen very little pullback from the retailer's, which I think is a result of the healthy retailer environment that exists today, as well as a testament to our best in class portfolio of shopping centers. So I'll just tell you that, we've exercised our ability to secure extensions and refinancings for the last couple years, with very little capital to pay down and I'm not sure that's going to be any dissimilar to what we're doing with Washington Square in Santa Monica, but we can't get into specifics there."
