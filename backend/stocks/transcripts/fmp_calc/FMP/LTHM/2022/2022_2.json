    "content": " As a fully integrated producer of lithium products with predictability around cost and security of supply, Livent is able to build its core business around long-term supply agreements with firm commitments and more predictable pricing, while still retaining the ability to take advantage of higher market prices. Livent is on track to add another 10,000 metric tons of lithium carbonate capacity in Argentina by the end of next year which will nearly double Livent's total available LCEs from 2021 levels. So it's going to look different than Nemaska but I think a lot of what we talked about today and what we've been talking about frankly on calls for a couple of years now, I think Nemaska lends itself very well to finding the right partners, making the commitments and working with them to get them what they need, while at the same time, giving Nemaska what it needs."
