    "content": " At the conclusion of these expansions, Livent expects to reach 100,000 metric tons of total carbonate capacity by the end of 2030 or roughly 5 times today\u2019s levels. We would not be providing the lithium feedstock, as we do with the carbonate-fed units we operate today, and we expect that it would be closely linked to our existing hydroxide customers as an additional service we provide solely to those customers as they look to re-use, where possible, the lithium they already own that resides in end-of-life batteries. I had some data which I thought was, I think really in line with how I think about things, as well as recycling by 2030 could be 10% of total lithium production, which doesn\u2019t sound a lot until you realize demand of probably 3 million tons and 300,000 tons of lithium is going to need to be recycled. But, I think, maybe the best way that I can describe this is, we have certainly seen the lithium -- realized the lithium carbonate pricing in the first quarter was probably higher than some others have announced for us and so because we don\u2019t sell as much."
