    "content": " In Logistics, the year-over-year increase in operating income was due to strength across all lines of business, as we continue to see elevated goods consumption, inventory restocking and favorable supply and demand fundamentals in our core markets. As factories in China resumed production and shipments begin to flow at normal levels, we expect to see an increase in marine traffic and import volume in Southern California thereby adding to the stress at many key points in the infrastructure Lastly, consumption trends remain elevated and inventory replenishment continues to be a challenge for our customers. In Guam, Matson's container volume in the first quarter of 2022 increased 10% year-over-year, primarily due to higher retail related demand. The increase was primarily due to higher contributions from all service lines, as we continued to see elevated goods consumption, inventory restocking and favorable supply and demand fundamentals in our core markets. For the first quarter, consolidated operating income increased $312.4 million year-over-year to $432.6 million with higher contributions from Ocean Transportation and Logistics of 302.1 and $10.3 million respectively. But what I would see is -- what I would say about that is to part of your question about the freight rate, let's say, the Shanghai Containerized Freight Index what is missing at certain times of the year are additional -- this is not for Matson rates, but for others that these freight rates don't include all the add-ons and congestion surcharges, but rather are the base rate indices."
