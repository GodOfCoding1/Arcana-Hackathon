    "content": " Starting on Slide 3, Matson's differentiated over Ocean Services performed well in the third quarter, but we achieved lower year-over-year consolidated operating income as we saw lower demand for expedited Ocean Services in the Transpacific tradelane compared to the high levels of freight demand during the pandemic and the year ago period. Moving to our China service on Slide 7, Matson's volume in the third quarter of 2022 was 15.1% lower year-over-year due to lower demand for our CLX, CLX+ and CCX services and one less sailing. For the third quarter consolidating operating income declined $42.6 million year-over-year to $335.3 million with a lower contribution from Ocean Transportation of $46.7 million, partially offset by a $4.1 million increase from Logistics. The decrease in Ocean Transportation operating income in the third quarter was primarily due to lower volume in China, higher operating costs and expenses primarily in the CLX+ service and higher fuel related expenses partially offset by higher average freight rates in China and a higher contribution from SSAT."
