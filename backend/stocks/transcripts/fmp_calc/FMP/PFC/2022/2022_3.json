    "content": " Total loans including those held for sale increased by $301 million during the quarter, representing 20% annualized growth or 16% year-over-year growth. We also had another good quarter in deposit growth, which increased $146 million or 9% annualized, excluding $70 million of broker deposits. This was primarily due to an increase in average deposit costs, which grew 24 basis points on a linked quarter basis to 0.39%, excluding acquisition marks accretion and broker deposits, as well as continue to increase costs on FHLB borrowings. C&I loan growth has been a significant contributor to our overall loan growth as C&I balances grew during the third quarter by 5.48% or approximately $54.2 million, compared to the second quarter. On a trailing four quarter basis, C&I balance growth was 28.77% or approximately $232.6 million. Consumer loan activity was very good in the third quarter with balances growing 8.61% or $38.5 million, compared to second quarter. Expenses, we're going to stick with our original guidance that we updated last quarter at $163 million for the year and we would see an efficiency ratio still in the 52% range for the full-year."
