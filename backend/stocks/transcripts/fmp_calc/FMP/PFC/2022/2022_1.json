    "content": " For assets, we are pleased to report $132.4 million in core loan growth this quarter or 10.1% annualized led by commercial, which increased $97.4 million or 11% annualized. Next, I'll turn to the income statement, starting with net interest income of $58 million, which is up 2.4% from prior year's first quarter or 7.5% excluding PPP and purchase accounting marks accretion from both periods. Noninterest income was $16.9 million for 1Q, which is down from prior quarter and prior year, primarily due to mortgage banking and security gains. Mortgage gains in 1Q were $2.5 million, down $0.2 million from 4Q and $3.1 million for the first quarter of 2021, primarily due to lower production, compressed margins and lower saleable mix. However, we had a $5.3 million MSR gain in the first quarter of 2021 when the 10-year had a similarly large increase but from a much lower starting point. To wrap up, our first quarter pretax pre-provision income was over $33.7 million, which generated a robust 1.8% ROA. In that first quarter, income was on target for us for the year, but we do feel that on a full year basis, we're likely to be about 10% off the number we posted in '21."
