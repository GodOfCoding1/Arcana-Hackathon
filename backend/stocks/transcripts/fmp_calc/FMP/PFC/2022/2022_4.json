    "content": " Total loans, including those held for sale, increased by $239 million during the quarter, representing a 15% annualized growth or 20.5% year-over-year growth. On a full year basis, net interest income increased $15 million or almost 7% on a tax equivalent basis and $29 million or 14% on a core basis, excluding PPP and marks. On a full year basis, noninterest income declined $17 million with $5 million from security gains and $12 million from mortgage banking, which decreased due to lower production, saleable mix and margins. On a full year basis, expenses increased $7 million or 4.6%, primarily due to compensation and benefits, which increased due to higher staffing levels for our growth initiatives and higher base compensation for annual increases plus one year adjustments that we mentioned previously. Brendan, please go ahead. Your line is open. Michael, please go ahead. Your line is open. Mike, I think your comment on the environment combined with targeted effect will be bought us by design, whereas take the fourth quarter, I think we had targeted that we thought we'd see 1% to 2% growth, let's call double of that and the third and fourth quarters for both quarters, we thought we would see a pullback on the client -- from the clients on business and it just kept coming. Your line is open. So you blend that all together in the $5 billion of those deposits, excluding our broker, and that's a 30% to 40% blend but then you throw in our interest-bearing and we're in the, call it, back down to the 30% range. Brendan, please go ahead. Your line is open. Michael, please go ahead. Your line is open. However, the business that we booked over in '22, the 20% growth clients that we brought on board, the clients we've served, that's going to be with us for the next 7 to 10 years."
