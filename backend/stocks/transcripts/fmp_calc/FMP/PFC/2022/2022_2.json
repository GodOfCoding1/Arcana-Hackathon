    "content": " Total loans, including those held for sale, increased by $494 million during the quarter or 35.7% annualized growth or 8.8% year-over-year growth. And we also had a good quarter in deposit growth, which increased $199 million or 12.6% annualized. Net interest income increased 2.1% on a linked-quarter basis and 4.3% from the prior year, while core margin, excluding PPP and acquisition and market accretion increased 12 basis points from both first quarter 2022 and second quarter 2021. The net effect of lower expenses and higher net interest income, offset partially by lower non-interest income by the 3% linked-quarter increase in pre-tax pre-provision income, $34.4 million and a 1.78% return on average assets. Our commercial business had an outstanding quarter of loan growth, with second quarter growth of approximately $315 million. For the first half of 2022, commercial loan growth was very strong at 11.6% year-to-date or approximately $412 million. While we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t expect the same pace of loan growth in the second half of 2022 that we did in the first, our pipeline levels remain strong and our expectations for the third quarter are similar to what we achieved in the first."
