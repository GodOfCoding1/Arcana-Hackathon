    "content": " Moreover, our near-term pipeline includes sucralfate, an oral suspension product and two additional partnered products, sevoflurane, an inhaled aesthetic product; and Mesalamine Delayed Release Tablets, 1.2 grams, all of which we hope to launch subject to FDA approval by this fiscal 2023 fourth quarter. And third, for a number of products we intend to launch in the coming year, if ultimately approved, we could see higher sales than we have estimated because we assume we are not the next new entrant in these markets. For fiscal 2023, we expect net sales in the range of $275 million to $300 million; adjusted gross margin as a percentage of net sales of approximately 15% to 17%, adjusted R&D expense in the range of $23 million to $25 million, adjusted SG&A expense ranging from $56 million to $59 million, adjusted interest expense of approximately $53 million."
