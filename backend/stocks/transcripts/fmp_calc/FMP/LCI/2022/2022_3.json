    "content": " However, in the third quarter of this year, product returns, which were largely related to sales from more than a year ago, when our sales were higher, approximately doubled to about $12.5 million. Over 10% of our current plant output is dedicated to the sustainable opportunity, which in aggregate will generate about $10 million in sales with margins comfortably above our in line generic products. At March 31, 2022, cash and cash equivalents totaled approximately $106 million, which included proceeds from the sale of our liquid manufacturing plant in Carmel, New York. Adjusted gross margin as a percentage of net sales of approximately 13.5% to 14.5%, from approximately 14% to 15%; adjusted R&D expense in the range of $22 million to $24 million, from $23 million to $26 million; adjusted SG&A expense ranging from $55 million to $57 million, from $55 million to $58 million; adjusted interest expense of approximately $52 million unchanged. And again, the average experience here in such products is much higher for a first cycle review, 60%, 70%, to our knowledge in the biological space, very, very different than what you see in complex generics that don\u2019t have as clear a set of expectations from the FDA."
