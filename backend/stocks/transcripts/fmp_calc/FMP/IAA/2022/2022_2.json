    "content": " That said, we were impacted by several industry headwinds in Q2, including a decline in the percentage of vehicles declared a total loss, driven primarily by high retail or used car prices, as well as lower   weather related volumes, compared to what we normally experience in the second quarter of the year. For Q2 specifically, consolidated revenues increased 16.9% year-over-year to $520.3 million, including $38.2 million from the acquisition of SYNETIQ. Organic consolidated revenue, which excludes the impact of foreign currency and revenue from the Auto Exchange and SYNETIQ acquisitions increased 8.9% to $484.9 million coming from an increase in ARPU of 12.6% and a volume decrease of 3.2%. With respect to volume, we had expected it to decline sequentially in Q2, due to volume loss from one customer and as John reviewed, the period was also negatively impacted by certain macro headwinds, including a decline in the insurance industry total loss ratio, lower non-CAT weather-related volume, and softness in the dealer commercial and consumer-related markets. Adjusted SG&A expenses were $45.4 million, an increase of 4.8%, compared to the prior year, due mainly to the incremental SG&A of SYNETIQ, higher headcount and higher spending on information technology, partially offset by lower incentive compensation expense. Net cash provided by operating activities during the first half of 2022 was $230.3 million, down 8.1% from the prior year, primarily due to the timing of lease and incentive compensation payments, partially offset by increased collections of accounts receivable."
