Organic consolidated revenue, which excludes the impact of foreign currency and revenue from the Auto Exchange and SYNETIQ acquisitions, increased 20.2% to $508.9 million due to an increase in ARPU of 15.1% and a volume increase of 4.4%. Adjusted SG&A expenses were $51.5 million, an increase of 30.7% compared to the prior year due mainly to higher head count, higher IT spend and the inclusion of auto exchange and SYNETIQ."
