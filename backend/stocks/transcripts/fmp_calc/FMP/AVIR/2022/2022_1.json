    "content": " This includes exciting new data for Bemnifosbuvir showing for the first time, clinical benefits in a meaningful number of patients in the Phase 3 MORNINGSKY Trial, and also in the Phase 2 hospitalized study. As you will recall, MORNINGSKY was a randomized, double-blind, multi-center, placebo-controlled Phase 3 trial, evaluating the efficacy, antiviral activity, safety, and pharmacokinetics of Bemnifosbuvir, in adult and adolescent patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 randomized in a 2:1 ratio. Given Bemnifosbuvir\u2019s unique MOA, broad spectrum antiviral activity against all variants of concern, and the new clinical results, we believe that we can deliver a safe, non-mutagenic, non-teratogenic oral antiviral for both mono and potential combination therapy for COVID-19, regardless of the evolving variants."
