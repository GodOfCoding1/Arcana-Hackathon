    "content": " This is our rationale for pursuing in parallel to our late-stage monotherapy trial, a second generation protease inhibitor with an improved profile to be used in combination with bemnifosbuvir in specific patient population. As shown on Slide 14, our HCV combination development plan looks very promising and we believe that there is still room to improve upon the standard of care for Hepatitis C. Our HCV combination profile includes convenient and short treatment duration with the potential for the first ribavirin-free therapy for decompensated disease. On Slide 19, as we look to the balance of the year, we expect to build on this momentum by achieving a number of value-creating milestones including the initiation of our late-stage clinical trial of Bemnifosbuvir for COVID-19 reporting preliminary clinical data from our dengue fever program and the initiation of our Phase 2 combination program in HCV."
