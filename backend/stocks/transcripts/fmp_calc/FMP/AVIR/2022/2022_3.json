    "content": " And so I think here, we really have a good example of the natural biokinetic study of infection in the placebo patients, the potential for protection against infection altogether, but also, I think, a good glimpse of whether 752 is efficacious against the infection. So I think altogether, the two studies together should give us a very good understanding of how 752 performed against the dengue virus and allow us to make the decisions around whether we need further cohorts and what type of dosing we're looking at for those in terms of treatment durations and so forth. First, an interesting question, as I didn't know the answer to it necessarily, I think we're going to learn a lot, as I said, from having both the patients on the placebo group as well as on the active in the prophylactic study."
