    "content": " Third quarter adjusted Advisory Fees of $489 million, or 31% lower year-over-year, reflecting a decrease in the number of fees and the size of fees earned as market volumes remains low. Third quarter adjusted other revenue net was a loss of approximately $1 million reflecting lower performance of our investment funds portfolio, which is used as a hedge for our DCCP  commitment due to overall market decline. Third quarter adjusted non-compensation costs of $91 million, were up 9% versus a year-ago, primarily driven by an increase in Travel and Related expenses as well as higher professional fees. And just given what we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen, we think that is the right approach to thinking about how the year will end up for us, particularly as we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re doing our planning for 2022 and 2023.   comp ratio, for the past 10 years, the fourth quarter has been the largest quarter for us, and hopefully will continue to be the same. And I think that there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a significant amount of business that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s being discussed now whether those actually transition quickly into revenues as another thing, and I think that one is \u00e2\u0080\u0093 a lot of that is going to be the economies and also the financial markets stability. Hi, good morning, John and Celeste. Hi, good morning, John and Celeste."
