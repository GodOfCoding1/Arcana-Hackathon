    "content": " Total revenue was $14.2 million up 15% over the first quarter of 2021, primarily driven by strong capital equipment sales accelerating, new patient starts and solid utilization trends despite the COVID-related headwinds experienced early in the year. As we highlighted on our fourth quarter call, during 2022, we are accelerating our investment into sales and marketing as well as R&D initiatives to support continued growth, but in the near- and long-term for the full year, we continue to expect total operating expenses to be in the range of $86 million to $90 million. Your line is open. Your line is open. First of all, I\u2019d just like to, as we think about the guidance you provided and maybe the momentum in the business, I mean crossing that 5,000 patient threshold, given that January was fairly low, kind of, just trying to triangulate seems like the math on the guidance might be a little conservative. Your line is open. Your line is open."
