As I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve stated previously, our entire organization is committed to these core areas of strategic focus as we continue to advance our SUI clinical development program towards a potential new indication in the U.S. With that, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d now like to discuss some specifics around our fully enrolled U.S. pivotal PURSUIT trial for female SUI. Our goal is to continue to increase awareness of and build upon our body of clinical evidence that supports the safety and efficacy of the Viveve treatment as we advance our program towards a potential new SUI indication in the U.S. During the third quarter of this year, the focus of our entire organization was to continue to advance our SUI clinical development program and successfully execute our core initiatives. Through the remainder of 2022, we intend to successfully complete our landmark PURSUIT trial, expand our installed base in the U.S. and Asia Pacific regions with core medical specialties, support existing and new customers to drive increased treatment tip utilization and sales, and to continue the financial efficiencies we have achieved over the last two years."
