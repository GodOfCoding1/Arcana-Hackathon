    "content": " While I know there has been a lot of commentary over the past several quarters on our gross margin trajectory, given the elevated growth of our international messaging product in particular, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re most focused on the unit economics of our products and ensuring that all new business generates attractive levels of gross profit dollars. And as long as it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the case that we generate continued strong gross profit unit economics, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to continue investing in growing our international messaging business because it obviously provides gross profits that we can reinvest back into the business and as also previously discussed messaging serves as an effective land with new customers."
