    "content": " We attained record fourth quarter and fiscal year net revenues, which are being driven by strong growth in our Prescription business and high single-digit annual growth in our Consumer Health segment. As you saw in today's press release, the $18.7 million in prescription revenues was a new quarterly record for the company and up 28% compared to last year's fourth quarter. Mark will hit a bit more on the numbers, but across the board, we are seeing strong growth in the ADHD products which contributed to $12.2 million in fourth quarter revenues and $42.9 million for the fiscal year. For fiscal '22, net sales were $35.5 million within the Consumer Health segment, an increase of 8% compared to fiscal '21. During the year, we had a consumer segment adjusted EBITDA loss for 4.9 million in this business and a $2.1 million loss in Q4, again noting that Q4 supply chain disruptions lowered our revenue line which in part contributed to this uptick in EBITDA loss. Net revenue for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 was $27.4 million compared to $23.5 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, a 17% increase. For the year, net revenue was $96.7 million compared to $65.6 million for fiscal 2021, a 47% increase. Breaking down the quarter, net revenue from prescription sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 was $18.7 million compared to $14.6 million in the same quarter last year, an increase of 28%. For the fourth quarter of 2022, net revenue from Consumer Health franchise was $8.7 million compared to $8.9 million in the same quarter last year, a decrease of 2%. Looking at the year, net revenue from prescription products for fiscal 2022 was $61.1 million compared to $32.7 million in fiscal 2021, an increase of 87%. Net revenue for fiscal 2022 from the Consumer Health franchise was $35.5 million compared to $33 million last year, an increase of 8%. While the amounts were relatively small in the fourth quarters of both years, they were larger in the context of the full year where sales decreased from $9.4 million in 2021 to $2.2 million in 2022. On the OpEx side for the fourth quarter of 2022, excluding impairment expense and amortization of intangible assets, operating expenses were $21.1 million compared to $25.6 million in the same period a year ago, a decrease of $4.5 million. Looking at the full year, excluding impairment expense and amortization of intangible assets, operating expenses were $84.3 million in fiscal 2022 compared to $69.2 million in fiscal 2021. During the fourth quarter of 2022, net loss was impacted by an impairment of $10.8 million due to the $8.6 million impairment of goodwill associated with our 2020 Innovus acquisition driven by the decline in Aytu's market capitalization, and $2.2 million impairment due to the discontinuation of certain consumer products. Net loss for the fourth quarter of 2022 was $17.7 million, or $0.49 per share, compared to $19 million, or $0.81 per share for the same quarter last year. For the year, net loss was $110.2 million, or $3.75 per share, compared to $58.3 million, or $3.48 per share in fiscal 2021. For the quarter, adjusted EBITDA from our Prescription and Consumer segment was only a negative $961,000 compared to a negative $8.2 million in last year's fourth quarter. Breaking it down by operating segment, Prescription adjusted EBITDA was a positive $1.1 million compared to a negative $5.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2021. For the Consumer Health segment, adjusted EBITDA was a negative $2.1 million for the fourth quarter of '22 compared to a negative $2.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2021."
