    "content": " As outlined in today's press release, quarterly net revenue increased by 14%, compared to the year-ago quarter to $26.3 million, driven by strong performance in our Rx segments. The Rx segment experienced 23% revenue growth to $18 million, due to the continuing execution of our sales force and the leverage we're generating through Aytu RxConnect, our novel and proprietary patient access program, along with some market tailwinds associated with the ADHD stimulant shortages, which we are capitalizing on. All told, adjusted EBITDA for the company was a positive $0.7 million during the second quarter of 2023, which compares to a negative $7.6 million in last year's second quarter, an improvement of more than $8 million. During the quarter, our ADHD products contributed $11.1 million in net revenue, an increase of 2% compared to a year ago period and down 4% sequentially. As mentioned, we experienced 23% revenue growth in the second quarter and generated a positive $3.1 million in adjusted EBITDA, our third consecutive quarter with positive RX segment adjusted EBITDA. Focusing our efforts on a more profitable OTC e-commerce portfolio, which I'll point out were 70% over the year ago quarter, resulted in adjusted EBITDA for this segment improving by 30% or nearly $500,000. Net revenue for the fiscal 2023 second quarter was $26.3 million compared to $23.1 million for the fiscal 2022 second quarter, a 14% increase. Looking at the component parts, net revenue from prescription product sales in the fiscal 2023 second quarter was $18 million compared to $14.6 million in the same quarter last year, an increase of 23%. As Josh noted, ADHD experienced 2% growth in net revenue to $11.1 million in the fiscal 2023 second quarter against $10.9 million during the fiscal 2022 second quarter. For the second quarter of 2023, net revenue from the Consumer Health segment was $8.3 million compared to $8.5 million in the same quarter last year. Adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter was a positive $727,000 compared to a negative $7.6 million a year ago. When you look at the breakdown by segment, adjusted EBITDA for our Prescription segment during the second quarter of fiscal 2023 was a positive $3.1 million compared to a negative $1.9 million in the year ago quarter. In the Consumer Health segment, quarterly adjusted EBITDA was a negative $1.1 million compared to a negative $1.5 million in the year ago period, a 30% improvement year-over-year. Finally, adjusted EBITDA tied to our now suspended R&D pipeline was a negative $1.3 million during the second quarter of fiscal 2023, compared to a negative $4.1 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2022."
