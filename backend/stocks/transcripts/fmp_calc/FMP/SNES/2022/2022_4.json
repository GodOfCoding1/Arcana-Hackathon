    "content": " Following my appointment as CEO just about 4 months ago now, I have taken quick and decisive steps to build off the considerable progress the company made during 2022, highlighted by breaking $1 million in product sales, up 77% from the year ago period, as ContraPest was deployed in a number of key market verticals and the product line extension launch of the unique and innovative Elevate Bait System. We have expanded our field sales organization to 7 reps, each deployed by geography with leadership in both the Eastern and Western half of the U.S. Last year's revenue was largely driven by growth within existing customers, which speaks to having an effective product that delivers value. Sales growth during the year and the fourth quarter led by strong performance in the company's e-commerce platform, which made up approximately 46% of 2022 product sales as well as continued traction within zoos, animal sanctuaries and pest management professionals, which both increased more than 100% during the fourth quarter."
