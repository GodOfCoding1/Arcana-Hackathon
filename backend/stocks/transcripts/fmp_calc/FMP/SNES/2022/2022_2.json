    "quarter": 2,
    "year": 2022,
    "date": "2022-08-11 19:51:08",
    "content": " Sales growth during the quarter was led by increases in our eCommerce solutions, continued traction within zoos and animal sanctuaries segment, deployment of ContraPest at two campuses of a major Silicon Valley technology company, and the launch of our novel Elevate Bait System with ContraPest. The characteristics of ContraPest yield themselves well to the move towards sustainability and with deployments like the one we had this quarter at the large Silicon Valley Campus, where they're increasingly concerned about the impact of poisons, we think this move towards sustainability will be a key factor in the future growth for ContraPest."
