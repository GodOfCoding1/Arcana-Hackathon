    "content": " Stepping back a bit from just our second quarter results versus last year, I think it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s important perspective to look at the first half performance compared to pre-pandemic first half 2019 providing a more normalized assessment of the business. In our largest market, both brands have driven significant share gains in the core men\u00e2\u0080\u0099s denim casual bottoms business over first half \u00e2\u0080\u009819 with Wrangler up 80 points and Lee up 60 points and would be even greater if not for our proactive quality of sales actions to exit certain points of distribution. First, with Lee, the team continues to enhance marketing efforts to elevate brand positioning, particularly within digital spend, integrated seasonal demand creation, including the streaming summer campaign, free your originality by Lee originals, drove holistic digital experiences across consumer touch points supporting 61 million digital media impressions and a 103% year-over-year increase in social media traffic during the quarter. In our previous outlook from last quarter, we mentioned that we expected the first half global revenue to increase in the mid-teens range, with full year global revenue to increase at approximately 10% compared to 2021.
