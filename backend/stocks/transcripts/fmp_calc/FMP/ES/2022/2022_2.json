    "content": " Excluding the acquisition and transition costs I mentioned earlier, the results include after-tax gains on clean energy investments, which increased by $0.02 per share from last year's levels and were largely offset by higher interest costs on long-term and short-term debt. As Joe mentioned, we expect that by 2026, the last year of our current five-year forecast, our incremental investments required to offset the loss of the offshore wind earnings contributions that would have been in place, we estimate that that will be -- we required approximately 3 billion of investments. We have discussed previously that including Park City, there are probably about 500 million of regulated transmission investment needs on Cape Cod to efficiently connect offshore wind that is not reflected in our current $18 billion capital forecast. And then, Andrew, what I would remind you of the 500 million that we've discussed on the call today as it relates to offshore wind interconnection, that's paid by the developer and not socialized."
