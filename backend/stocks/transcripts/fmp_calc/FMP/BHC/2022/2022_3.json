    "content": " We are encouraged with the progress we made this quarter, with consolidated third quarter revenues of $2 billion, up 2% on an organic basis over the same quarter last year. At Bausch Pharma and Solta, third quarter revenues were $1.1 billion, improving from the 4% decline through the first half of the year to a minus 1% on an organic basis this quarter. Salix revenues were $544 million, an increase of 3% versus the third quarter last year, an improvement from the 2% decline in the first half of this year. International revenues were $250 million, an increase of 10% on an organic basis compared with the third quarter of last year, driven by strong performance in Canada and Europe and double-digit growth in a number of key brands. Diversified Products revenues were $238 million, down 17% on an organic basis compared with the third quarter of last year. Lastly, on Slide 12, Bausch + Lomb revenues were $942 million, up 5% organically compared with the third quarter of 2021, with organic growth across all B&L segments led by the Surgical segment. Third quarter consolidated adjusted EBITDA attributable to Bausch Health was $766 million, a decrease of 13% versus last year. For Bausch Pharma and Solta, segment profit was $660 million, a decrease of 5% versus last year, driven by the decline in revenue, which includes $25 million primarily from the Amoun divestiture and $27 million from the impact of foreign exchange. Excluding legacy legal settlements, separation costs, cash provided by Amoun and third-party fees related to our recently completed debt exchange, adjusted cash flow from operations on a consolidated basis was $9 million versus $382 million last year primarily due to operating results and the timing of working capital movements. A total of $5.6 billion of previously issued senior unsecured notes were exchanged for $2.1 billion of new secured \u00e2\u0080\u0093 senior secured notes of Bausch Health and $1 billion of new senior secured notes of a wholly-owned, unrestricted subsidiary that holds approximately 38.6% of outstanding shares of Bausch + Lomb. Our guidance for Bausch Pharma and Solta remains unchanged, with full year revenues of $4.3 billion to $4.42 billion, which is down 3% to flat on an organic basis. As you heard yesterday, Bausch + Lomb has reduced its full year revenue outlook by $50 million to $3.7 billion to $3.75 billion driven by FX, and full year adjusted EBITDA by $25 million to $715 million to $755 million.
