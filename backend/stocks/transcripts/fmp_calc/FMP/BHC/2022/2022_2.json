    "content": " As you can see on Slide 8, second quarter revenues for Bausch Pharma and Solta were $1 billion, down 5% on an organic basis versus the second quarter of last year. On Slide 10, Salix revenues of $501 million improved sequentially versus Q1 2022, but were down 3% versus the second quarter last year. International delivered second quarter revenues of $233 million and organic revenue growth of 2% versus the second quarter of last year driven by solid performance, particularly in Canada and Latin America. Diversified Products revenue was $235 million, down 11% on an organic basis compared to the second quarter of last year, primarily due to declines in neurology and dermatology. The Asia business, excluding China, posted double-digit volume growth, while demand was stable in the U.S. Lastly, on Slide 11, Bausch & Lomb reported revenues were $941 million, up 6% organically compared to the second quarter of 2021. Second quarter consolidated adjusted gross margin was 70.7%, 20 basis points lower compared to the second quarter last year, driven by inflation and shipping costs and partially offset by lower inventory write-offs in the B&L segment. Consolidated adjusted operating expenses for the second quarter were $752 million, an increase of 1% with higher R&D and marketing offset by lower selling and G&A expenses. Consolidated adjusted EBITDA attributable to Bausch Health was $701 million for the second quarter, a decrease of 15% versus the second quarter last year due to lower revenues, the divestment of Amoun and investments in sales, marketing and R&D."
