    "content": " While we continue to see a nearly 100% two-year growth CAGR in both traffic and unit sales in Q1 and into Q2, we've seen a greater-than-anticipated taper of our website traffic levels over the past two months and a slower-than-expected pickup in retail showroom traffic, both of which are important inputs into our forward-looking demand model. For fiscal 2022, we are now forecasting ending Connected Fitness subscriptions of 3.35 million to 3.45 million, implying approximately 1.1 million net ads and representing 46% year-over-year growth and a 77% two-year CAGR for ending subs at the midpoint. For Q2, we expect ending Connected Fitness subscriptions of 2.8 million to 2.85 million, implying 333,000 net ads and representing 69% year-over-year growth and nearly 100% two-year CAGR for ending at the midpoint. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. We know that formula very well, and we - Jill mentioned the new campaign that started today, really pushing the Tread, educating people to John's point about - it's not just running, it's this incredible full body experience, we've got the best instructors in the world. Your line is open. If you look at the price of fitness, which is a massive global market, it's really about 181 million people globally, gym memberships globally and you look at the 6.2 million members that John referenced, and you think about our experience and the convenience of home and the value that we offer engagement, and it's why we're so confident this - if we do our job, continue to do our jobs, it comes to us. Your line is open. We think it's a really critical strategic asset when we bring new products to market, and we talked about the Tread new, and we're going to have other new products in the coming quarters that we're excited about, and they also benefit from the retail footprint."
