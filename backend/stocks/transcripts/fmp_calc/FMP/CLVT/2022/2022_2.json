    "content": "  Second quarter revenue was $687 million, an increase of $241 million compared to the same period last year, driven primarily by inorganic growth from the ProQuest acquisition as well as 4.8% organic growth, both of which were partially offset by a substantial foreign exchange headwind as the U.S. dollar strengthened dramatically against the basket of foreign currencies. The balance, nearly $40 million, assumes the continued traction we see from implementing One Clarivate that was to yield accelerated organic growth on a full year basis compared to last year will be offset by the following factors that have a roughly equal impact: one, our inability to offset the headwind from our decision to suspend operations in Russia; two, lower brand and trademark registrations; three, software consulting services; and four, uncertainty around new subscriptions and other transactional sales in the second half."
