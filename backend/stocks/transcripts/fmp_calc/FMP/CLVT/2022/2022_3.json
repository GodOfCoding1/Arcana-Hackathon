    "content": "  Third quarter revenue was $636 million, an increase of $194 million compared to the same period last year, driven primarily by inorganic growth from the ProQuest acquisition as well as 1.2% organic growth, both of which were partially offset by a substantial foreign exchange translation headwind as the U.S. dollar strengthened significantly against primarily the pound sterling and euro. We anticipate the profit growth of approximately $275 million will be partially offset by higher interest to service the debt used to fund the ProQuest acquisition, higher cash taxes on the profit growth and higher capital requirements as increased capital spending will be partially offset by lower working capital This outlook contemplates that nearly $0.50 of every dollar of profit will convert to adjusted free cash flow."
