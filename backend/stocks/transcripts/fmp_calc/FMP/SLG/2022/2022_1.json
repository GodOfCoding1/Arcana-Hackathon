Your line is open. 24:25 So now with -- I think we move into a phase of transactional company into franchise and platform company, where we can utilize our expertise in this very narrow slice of the market, albeit a very sizable size -- very sizable part of the market to become a provider and co-investor of best-in-class services for excellent real estate, which seems to always be in demand in New York City regardless of market cycle and regardless of interest rate environment. Your line is open. Your line is open. I think if we do additional leasing this year and we can eclipse roughly the 50% mark, we will probably be a little patient with the rest of the leasing, because we'd be dealing with parts of the building that we'd be excited to be showing in marketing once the building is topped off, because there's really no substitute for standing on these floors and taking in these incredible views investors of the park of downtown of some of the surrounding landmarks and the amenities will be further along.
