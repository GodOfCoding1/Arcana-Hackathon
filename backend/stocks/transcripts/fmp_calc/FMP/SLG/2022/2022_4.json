    "content": " So yesterday, we celebrated with the Governor and the MTA Chair, Jane lever, the opening of this incredible terminal that spans over 700,000 square feet from, I'd say, approximately 42nd Street to 48th Street on what must be 1 to 3 different levels dedicated waiting areas, beautiful new retail stores that will be opening and restaurants and a host of other amenities and it's all well done, well executed, well designed, well conceived, and I would urge anybody that hasn't yet taken the time to swing by and check it out that they do so because it's pretty inspiring to see what can be done after all the time and after all the money is spent, you look at the permanent goods that will come of it for the decades and perhaps centuries to come. And it was great to see how quickly the recommendations were developed, how executable they were in their communication and now to see Mayor Adams including much of that in the state of the city, which includes hundreds of millions of dollars of investment in new public spaces and permanent open streets, which we think is great for the city to make CBDs 24/7 cities in Manhattan and all 5 boroughs he reaffirmed his commitment to building more housing and more affordable housing through what he calls the city of yes, by making the necessary modifications to zoning and working with counsel to make that happen and making the incentives in place there for conversion of office to residential as well as new development and other investments in quality of life initiatives in and around the commercial corridors throughout the city, which I think are very much needed and appreciated."
