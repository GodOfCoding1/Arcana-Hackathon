    "content": " Moving to our first quarter results, GRE had another great quarter with $84 million in revenue and over $30 million gain from our operations and adjusted EBITDA, easily the most profitable Q1 in our history. Additionally, when comparing this quarter to the year ago quarter, I want to point out that last year's results reflected the $13 million negative impact of Winter Storm Uri in Texas and losses at Genie Japan which we sold in last May."
