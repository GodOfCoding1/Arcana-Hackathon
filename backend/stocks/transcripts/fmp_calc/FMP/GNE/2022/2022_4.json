    "content": " At GRE, full year revenue decreased 2.5% to $304 million from $312 million as the decrease in electricity meters served was substantially but not wholly offset by higher per unit electricity and gas revenues. Consolidated gross profit in the fourth quarter increased to $35 million from $24 million, powered by a strong increase in per unit electricity margins, driven by our successful efforts to maximize the value of our former commodity positions. Lower spending at Genie Retail was partially offset by higher expenses within Genie Renewables during the fourth quarter, driving a 4.2% decrease in consolidated SG&A to $17.2 million from $17.9 million. And at Renewables, the fourth quarter loss of operations wind to $1 million in 2022 from $439,000 in 2021 as we continue to invest in the people and resources to pursue the robust opportunities within this segment. At GRE, full year income from operations increased to $92.6 million from $34.7 million primarily reflecting the robust margin on electricity and gas sales. At Genie Renewables, the full year loss from operations was $3.5 million compared to income from operations of $251,000 in 2021, again reflecting the investments we are making to accelerate growth opportunities in solar. For the fourth quarter of 2022, net income attributable to Genie common stockholders decreased to $16.2 million from $27.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2021. For the full year 2022, net income attributable to Genie common stockholders increased to $85.9 million from $27.6 million. So when we're talking about the solar farms that we're expecting to own and operate, the ones that are going to be part of our long-term portfolio, so initially, let's say, if we're investing what we expect to be, ultimately, let's say, $2 million worth of equity."
