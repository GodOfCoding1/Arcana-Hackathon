    "content": " Some specific provisions that will have a direct impact to our -- on our business include production to tech squares for renewable or zero carbon electricity and clean hydrogen; investment tax credits for clean electricity and energy projects, including standalone energy storage, biogas, micro grids, and geothermal heating and cooling; clean vehicle and charging infrastructure tech words; as well as carbon capture credits. I think it's a great, great catalyst or valuable assets for us, as we have a great pipeline in development and we've been working on -- we will report as we have in the development pipeline -- development metric, but if you look at our pipeline is substantially higher, but we won't put them into the actual development pool and deal. We've had a variety of different strategies that we're looking at on the hydrogen front that relate to renewable natural gas, there's a lot of really exciting developments there and we like to own the assets so that we can pivot and deploy them in the most accretive way for our shareholders. But like we said earlier, though, the asset part of the business -- because it's a little bit clearer to which way they're going to go, it's moving faster."
