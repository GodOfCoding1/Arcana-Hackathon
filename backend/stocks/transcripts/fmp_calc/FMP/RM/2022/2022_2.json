    "content": " In recognition of a more uncertain economic environment ahead, we've taken a prudent approach of maintaining our allowance for credit losses at 11% of net finance receivables as of the end of the quarter, which includes $15 million of macro-related reserves. Despite a number of credit tightening actions and higher risk segments, branch, digital mail and total originations hit record highs for second quarter as demand remained strong and we focus our efforts on larger, high-quality loans. In the second quarter, despite eliminating one of our higher-risk affiliates, digitally sourced originations ended at a record $54 million, up 49% from the prior year period and representing 33% of our new borrower volumes in the quarter. In the third quarter, we expect to grow our net finance receivables by approximately $100 million or a 24% year-over-year growth rate compared to the second quarter's year-over-year growth rate of 29%. Our 30-plus day delinquency rate as at the quarter end was 6.2%, up 50 basis points sequentially and 260 basis points from a year ago, but still 10 basis points below prepandemic second quarter 2019 levels. Our net credit loss rate in the second quarter came in at 10%, up 260 basis points from the prior year period but still 40 basis points better than the second quarter of 2019. And the impact of just that portfolio of $62 million, 4% of our book was about 50 basis points on our delinquencies in the second quarter and about 90 basis points on our NCL rate in the second quarter, which was still below prepandemic levels."
