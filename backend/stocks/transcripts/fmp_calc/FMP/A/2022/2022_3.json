Thank you, Hannah and welcome everyone to Agilent\u00e2\u0080\u0099s conference call for the third quarter of fiscal year 2022. With me are Mike McMullen, Agilent President and CEO; and Bob McMahon, Agilent Senior Vice President and CFO. Joining in the Q&A after Mike and Bob\u00e2\u0080\u0099s comments will be Jacob Thaysen, President of the Agilent Life Science and Applied Markets Group; Sam Raha, President of the Agilent Diagnostics and Genomics Group; and Padraig McDonnell, President of the Agilent CrossLab Group. The news release for our third quarter financial results, investor presentation and information to supplement today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s discussion along with a recording of this webcast are available on our website at www.investor.agilent.com. Unless otherwise noted, all references to increases or decreases in financial metrics are year-over-year, and references to revenue growth are on a core basis. As previously announced, beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2022, we implemented certain changes to our segment reporting structure. And now, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d like to turn the call over to Mike. Thanks, Parmeet and thanks everyone for joining our call today. In the third quarter, we once again demonstrated the strength of our diversified business and the unstoppable One Agilent team. We delivered an excellent quarter, significantly exceeding our revenue and earnings expectations. Earnings per share of $1.34, up 22%. Our strong results in Q3, coupled with orders continuing to outpace revenues, highlight the ongoing strength of our diversified business. The momentum in our business continues, and we once again raised our outlook for the year. From an end-market perspective, our results were once again led by strength in our two largest markets, pharma and chemical energy. Our largest market, pharma, grew 16% versus 27% a year ago. Within pharma, both the biopharma and small molecule segments grew double-digits. The C&E market is being fueled by demand in chemicals, along with strong secular demand and ongoing investment within the advanced materials space. In our last call, I shared our belief that the business impact of the Shanghai COVID-19 lockdown would be transitory. In Q3, the China delivered 29% growth. These stellar results were driven by continued strong end-market demand, coupled with the faster-than-expected recovery of production and shipment activity following the end of the Shanghai area lockdown. We are also very pleased with its results, which highlights the customer focus, drive and outstanding execution of the Agilent China team. In terms of business unit performance, the Life Science and Applied  revenues of $1.02 billion, up 18% on a core basis. Growth was broad-based but continued strong demand for our LC and LC/MS offerings, where we posted high 20s growth. Chemistries and consumables, cell analysis and our GC business each delivered double-digit growth in the quarter. Our pharma results were driven by strength in the biopharma segment, which grew more than 20%. We had an excellent showing at the recent ASMS conference, introducing several important LC/MS and GC/MS instruments and biopharma workflow solutions. In addition, we introduced an industry-first hydro in net source for GC single-quad and GC Triple-Quad instruments, enabling customers to seamlessly migrate from helium as a supplier gas to lower-cost hydrogen. And rounding out the list of new products announced at ASMS, we introduced the mass Hunter BioConfirm 12.0 software, an integrated compliant workflow, targeted at the fast growing oligo-based therapy development market. Our LSAG business also won some important awards during the quarter, including the 6560c i-Mobility LCT system, winning the Scientist Choice Award for Best New Spectroscopy product. Earlier this month, we also strengthened and broadened our advanced materials and biopharma portfolio with the acquisition of PSS, Polymer Standard Service, a leader in polymer characterization. Growth in services was again broad-based across services contracts, preventive maintenance, compliance, education and informatic enterprise services. The Diagnostic and Genomics Group delivered revenue of $340 million, up 3% core. In addition, the DGG business in China continues to ramp from the COVID-related shutdowns there. As we noted last quarter, Q3 included the impact of a planned shutdown, our oligo manufacturing line in Frederick, Colorado. While we continue to make good progress in the construction of Train B, we have seen some supply chain-related delays and are now targeted a midyear 2023 go-live, a slight delay. In addition to these highlights, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d like to also point the recent release of Agilent\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 2021 ESG report. While we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve always published our progress in sustainability and addressing societal needs, this year, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve taken our approach to the next level. We address these issues a new format that for the first time that looks specifically at our progress in the areas of environmental, social and governance issues. We hope you have a chance to review our progress in ESG by checking out the report on the Agilent website, learning more about how we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re executing our mission to advance the quality of life. We continue to bring innovative, differentiated new offerings in the marketplace. In addition, as we started 2022, we undertook a bold move to create One Agilent commercial organization to further drive customer focus and growth. The strength in our portfolio and the continued strong execution by our One Agilent commercial organization make a powerful combination, and you see it in the results we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re delivering. As a result of our strong Q3 performance and continued momentum, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re once again raising our full year revenue and EPS guidance. In my remarks today, I will provide some additional details on revenue in the quarter and take you through the income statement and other key financial metrics. Unless otherwise noted, my remarks will focus on non-GAAP results. Results were above expectations, and we expect that strength to continue in the fourth quarter. Q3 revenues were $1.72 billion, up 8.4% on a reported basis and up 13.2% core. As we mentioned last quarter, the COVID-related lockdowns in China deferred an estimated $50 million to $55 million in revenue from Q2, and we forecasted that revenue would be recovered during the rest of the calendar year. We estimate over half of that deferred total was delivered in Q3, exceeding our expectations. Given the strong performance, we now expect the remainder will be delivered in Q4, which is an acceleration from our thinking from last quarter. For perspective, we estimate the total business grew double digits, excluding the accelerated recovery. As Mike mentioned, earnings per share of $1.34 were up 22% from a year ago, representing strong incremental flow-through of the better-than-expected revenue growth. Our largest market, pharma, was up 16%, exceeding our expectations. In addition, all 3 business groups grew double digits in the pharma segment. And our LC portfolio continues to perform very well, growing 25% in this important market for us. Chemical and energy continued to show strength, growing 22% during the quarter, driven by the chemicals and advanced materials segment of this market. In the food segment, we achieved growth of 11% on top of 12% growth a year ago. Our environmental and forensics market also grew 11% during the quarter, driven by the Americas and China. In the Americas, we saw increased funding to support PFAS testing, while China experienced faster-than-expected recovery post the Shanghai shutdowns for GC and GC/MS. The academia and government market grew 5% on top of a 12% comparison last year, in line with expectations. And rounding out the review of our end markets, our business in the diagnostics and clinical market grew 2% against a very strong 28% compare versus last year. While not material at the Agilent level, this market did experience some headwinds associated with COVID-related revenues being lower than last year. Excluding this, the growth would have been mid-single digits in this quarter. On a geographic basis, China led the way with 29% growth driven by underlying demand and a faster-than-expected recovery following the COVID-related lockdowns. And looking forward, demand in China continues to be very strong. The Americas grew 11%, another strong showing, and Europe grew 6%, which exceeded expectations. Third quarter gross margin was 56.4%, up 50 basis points from a year ago as pricing actions, volume and productivity helped to offset inflationary pressures tied to ongoing supply chain challenges and higher logistics costs. Operating expense leverage, driven by the strong top line and continued attention to cost management, helped to deliver very healthy margin improvements. Our operating margin was 27.5%, up 150 basis points from last year. Below the line, our tax rate was 14% for the quarter as expected, and we had 299 million diluted shares outstanding. We generated operating cash flow of $326 million in the quarter while investing $82 million in capital expenditures during Q3, driven by our NASD expansion. During the quarter, we also repurchased $323 million worth of shares. We paid out $62 million in dividends in Q3, returning a combined total of $385 million to shareholders in the quarter. Year-to-date, we have purchased over $1 billion of shares. Given the ongoing strength of the business, we believe this is a very good investment. This takes into account our Q3 results and an improved outlook in Q4, partially offset by an additional $40 million headwind associated with the strengthening of the dollar. We are also raising our EPS guidance for the year to a range of $5.06 to $5.08, representing 17% growth year-on-year. Core growth is expected to be in the range of 10.3% to 11.8%, while exchange rates will be a 5-point headwind, and M&A will contribute 0.1 points. In closing out our Q4 guidance, non-GAAP EPS is expected to be in the range of $1.38 to $1.40, up 14% to 16% versus the prior year. The Agilent team once again performed extremely well in Q3, delivering strong results, driving excellent execution and building a strong foundation for the future. Our diversified business and most importantly, our team have put us in an excellent position to again deliver strong results in Q4. And now back to Parmeet, as we take your questions. Hey, good afternoon, Mike and Bob. Thanks for taking the questions. So, I think relative to the strength and why the operating margin was so high is one is, I think we have been \u00e2\u0080\u0093 we rightly benefited from the leverage impact of having those higher-than-expected revenues. But more importantly, we have been working on the pricing side and really ensuring that we are receiving the value for our offerings. And Bob, I think we are well over 3 points of price appreciation overall for the portfolio in LSAG, I believe. And we are \u00e2\u0080\u0093 as you may have picked up in my script, it was across the board a great quarter for LSAG and across all product categories. I think, as we know, we continue to do really well in the LC/MS space, but this quarter is really a spectroscopy that was standing out. We have \u00e2\u0080\u0093 especially in our atomic spectroscopy field we have really seen a lot of momentum based, of course, on the dynamics in the markets, but also the innovation that has been created over the past years. I think it was a real race to see who had the highest growth, right, spectroscopy or LC/MS. And then maybe just as a follow-up, I know Europe \u00e2\u0080\u0093 yes, I just say for a follow-up. Just for a follow-up on Europe, 6% growth. So we posted a 6% growth rate \u00e2\u0080\u0093 core growth in the third quarter, albeit there was actually 2 points of headwind for the containment of our Russian operations. So really it was high single-digit, 8%, on a restated basis. And Europe clearly is a watch area for us, but we haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t seen any significant signals of movement to the downside. I think, Matt, to build on what Mike is saying, I think in particular we continue to see very strong growth in our pharma business and that really is a global phenomenon. And so as Mike mentioned, it is a watch area, but the demand \u00e2\u0080\u0093 from what we are seeing in the health of the order funnel continues to be there. Brandon, we are probably not ready to talk about \u00e2\u0080\u009823, but what I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll leave you with is a couple of thoughts here, which is very clearly the business has momentum and/or even though we had the highest revenue quarter ever for Agilent in this recent third quarter, we still build backlog both globally and also in China. So, our orders that exceeded our revenues in those. So, it sets us up nicely, I think for \u00e2\u0080\u009823, but we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll get to \u00e2\u0080\u009823 guide when we get there. And I think, Brandon, on your core incrementals, I mean, I think that if you look at historically, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s where we have been. Obviously, we do have some startup costs in \u00e2\u0080\u009823 for NASD and we will spell those out when we get to the numbers. And then on the NASD Train B line, Mike, you said it was pushed out a little bit in terms of the launch timeline. I think you got the right timeframe in there, which is a month or two. So, I actually had a chance to see it myself, where you go into a room or you are \u00e2\u0080\u0093 the steel pipe fitters are working and they are getting the area ready. They can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t close things off, because they are missing one valve or something. I think the global supply chains are pretty well publicized, but we thought it was \u00e2\u0080\u0093 we thought we should in the spirit of transparency let you know we are still on track for revenue coming out of the facility in \u00e2\u0080\u009823, but maybe a month or two later than you thought initially. And I think, Brandon, there is one more important piece. I think based on what we know today, we still expect to be at capacity at the exit of FY \u00e2\u0080\u009823 as well in terms of the ramp up. And one maybe on the guidance here, Q4 at the midpoint is 11% organic. And Bob, we didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t use it in our script, but I think the word prudent may apply to our Q4 guide as well. I think, Vijay, if you think about kind of the moving pieces within China, what we did was we pulled forward some of the revenue that was deferred into Q3, but we also pulled Q1 revenue into Q4. So, Q4, I would say we didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have a material change one way or another. And as Mike said, I mean we are not out of the woods, certainly in supply chain challenges and COVID situations. And so we thought at this point in time, a double-digit core growth is very good but also prudent, as Mike said. Maybe one on some of the moving parts for \u00e2\u0080\u009823, Mike and I am not asking for a guidance, but if I look at pricing contribution, I think we started the year at 100 basis points. So I think I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d like to \u00e2\u0080\u0093 the headline here was as way Bob closed off his prepared remarks, we are building a strong foundation for the future. So, we have got \u00e2\u0080\u0093 we had record revenues in Q3 yet we still build backlog. And Bob, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t see that. And Bob, maybe you want to add to... The only thing \u00e2\u0080\u0093 I think you are spot on, Vijay. And if I think about the various pieces there, they certainly set us up for a good momentum going into FY \u00e2\u0080\u009823. Now there is still some unknowns in terms of kind of the macro environment, but we are expecting to have a stronger than normal backlog. And then obviously, pricing is continuing to anniversary and I would expect it to be a higher contributor to growth next year, all things being equal. Hi, Mike and Bob. Thanks for taking the questions. So, first one just LSAG, obviously, a very strong quarter and I mean, obviously, congrats on the quarter here. When you look at the 25% growth that you are seeing in LC overall, the order book being strong, can you maybe just characterize sort of from an end-market perspective, it seems like biopharma continues to do well. Puneet, you packed in a lot in that one question. I was just saying, maybe you want to take that, Bob. I mean both \u00e2\u0080\u0093 I mean clearly, biopharma and pharma, our portfolio is doing really, really well there. And as I mentioned to the team the other day, we just got the most recent auto report, which shows market share movements. It was across the board, but I think it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the same story holds geographically well. I know you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re getting some good C&E growth, right, for \u00e2\u0080\u0093 in the advanced materials, LC/MS. We posted some really good numbers in food and the environmental market, which also are big users of LC and LC/MS. So I think it was really a broad-based story there, if I remember correctly, Jacob. I think we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve really seen good performance across the board, as you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re saying, Mike. I think PFAS is a good example of where we see a lot of interest right now both right now, but also where we see some of the big builds that is coming through in U.S. where PFAS have a prominent exposure. I think, Puneet, just to build on what Mike and Jacob were saying, I think one of the things you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re really seeing come out in Q3 is just the strength and breadth of our portfolio. And why we haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t talked about spectroscopy a lot in the past, it continues to be a very important part of our portfolio and solution set. And the LC and LC/MS get a lot of headlines, but we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re more than just an LC and LC/MS business. Yes, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll \u00e2\u0080\u0093 it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not a material business. But more importantly, I think strategically, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll let Jacob talk about the merits of the portfolio and how we think it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to continue to drive growth for us. And we have a long-standing relationship with PFS, so we knew exactly their strength. And particularly, our interest was intrigued when we also see polymer science going from advanced material into biopharma, where we see a lot of opportunities. So we can really leverage that with the strong presence we have across the globe to really accelerate that business opportunity that has been up over the past decades, really. Hi, thanks for taking the questions and congrats on the nice quarter. The first up on China \u00e2\u0080\u0093 thank you, Mike. In Q2, I think we talked about a greater than 20% order rate. Yes, we still built backlog in the third quarter in China. And Bob, I said that probably does represent a level of upside potentially with things continuing to develop as we hope. But again, our demand really is coming from the core private sector, commercial sector around pharma and C&E. I think you mentioned Q2 kind of order growth rate, and Q3 was in that same range. And so we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re seeing very strong demand and been able to do a fantastic job of ramping up that capacity, and we expect that to continue into Q4. And then last one for me, just on the C&E segment. So 22% growth is quite impressive, and that growth has really continued to accelerate in recent quarters in that end market. Well, we think that the structure of this marketplace has changed over the last few years. And yes, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s still a segment that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tied directly to what happens to the global GDP situation. But we had \u00e2\u0080\u0093 it in my comments, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s secular demand happening here, particularly in advanced materials when there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s investments being made in battery technology, more sustainable materials, semiconductors, onshoring of production. I think \u00e2\u0080\u0093 as you said, I think one of the things that I think is really important, don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t take \u00e2\u0080\u009822 and take \u00e2\u0080\u0093 build it into your model because we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think that, that growth rate is going to continue. And as Mike said, this is an area that we are seeing kind of a renewed sense in some of these areas that we do think that has many years to come in terms of investment. Thanks for the question, Rachel. Thanks for taking the question. Hi, Mike, this is Bob. And so when we take price, it takes some time to get through the backlog. And really, what we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re trying to do is cover our costs. And so we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve taken it across the board, but also recognizing where the costs are higher, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve taken those prices up higher. We haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really heard any pushback, I think, as evidenced by our strong order growth. And then also we look very closely at cancellations or \u00e2\u0080\u0093 within our order book, and that continues to be very low. And I think to date, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been able to actually generate more price than I think we anticipated at the beginning of the year. We think that that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the greatest opportunity, but we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re always out on the lookout for M&A. The dynamic has certainly changed in the last 9 months, particularly on the public market side, and I think there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s some good assets out there. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s probably taken a little longer on the private market side, which is where we tend to focus our efforts. First, Mike, wondered if you could provide more context on the supply chain situation, how supply and cost to track versus your expectations over the last 90 days. So I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll let Bob handle the second question, and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll start with the first one. So supply chain challenges are still out there, but our team continues to do an excellent job navigating them, getting the material that we need for our customers. We continue to have very, very low order cancellation rates is something we watch like a hawk. So I think in the early days of things, we were kind of surprised at what things would cost on the market for chips and others, but I think we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve now found ways to work that and then offset that with some of the pricing actions that we mentioned earlier. So I think if anything, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s probably trending in a more positive direction, albeit is still challenging out there. And I would say \u00e2\u0080\u0093 on the second question, Josh, I would say, first and foremost, demand continues to be very strong in our marketplace. As you know, that typically is one of the larger quarters that we have for our sales organization and certainly for our customers as well. That being said, I would expect maybe some slight degradation in backlog just given, again, the deferral that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re talking about within China. And then kind of along those lines, wondered if the group has any initial thoughts on pharma budget flushing this year given the strength in orders from these accounts. Josh, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m going to pass this call over to Padraig. As you know, he heads up our one commercialization addition to running our ACG services business. No, I think it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pretty steady, Mike. And of course, the team are very focused on key end-market workflows where we have the best chance to meet the customer needs. So the chemical and energy acceleration, my first question is on the chemicals customers. That maybe more regionally specific to Europe, where we did see a level of growth a little bit slower than we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen in the Americas and China. And as we mentioned earlier on the call, Europe remains sort of a watch area for us because of, obviously, obvious challenges in that region right now. I mean, I think \u00e2\u0080\u0093 remember, the chemical piece is going into some of these supply chains as fabs go up and other things. Bob, I know that you and Jacob looked at this a little more closely. I think you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re spot on, Mike. I mean if we looked across the \u00e2\u0080\u0093 all regions grew in C&E as, Mike, you were saying, but Europe was below the average. And so \u00e2\u0080\u0093 but I think over time, that investment in some of these areas, we think, is ongoing demand. But relative to the recent enactment by Congress, we see some real upside for us. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u0093 what we can see there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s some funding in there for PFAS, which will help our LC/MS and GC/MS business and then tied to the chips, both the upstream and downstream side, the semiconductor fabs that play right into spectroscopy strength that that we mentioned as well. And Jacob, perhaps you want to add a few other things. I think, I mean, actually, even though spectroscopy and GC are the big winners in the \u00e2\u0080\u0093 related to the CHIPS Act, we actually see across the board. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s both the mass spec business, also the LC/MS that Mike was mentioning and then, of course, a lot of our consumables also. I think both the CHIP Act, but also the other bill, the \u00e2\u0080\u0093 what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s it called, the...\n Inflation. And the answer to your last question, it was above 30%. So maybe I just didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t catch it, but I know there was the planned shutdown this quarter for NASD. So we had a planned shutdown this quarter, expect return to strong growth in Q4 for NASD. Thanks, Mike, and thanks for the question. I mean, listen, it was a good quarter. For example, you might have seen just the recent news from Alnylam that reported favorable results on their Phase 3 study for patisiran. And as Alnylam\u00e2\u0080\u0099s supplier for the API and patisiran, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re of course, excited. I probably should elaborate a little more, Elizabeth, on the routine. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll make some high-level comments, and then maybe, Jacob, you want to provide some specific as well. And Jacob, I know you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got a lot of interesting things happening there. And we are very interesting in the bioprocessing space, especially from the unlatent perspective, where we truly believe that the \u00e2\u0080\u0093 that instruments will start to move into the manufacturing. Historically, we have had in the small molecule space, the QA/QC sitting in a different lab. And hence, we have decided and we have made collaborations with leaders in that space, Merck being one of them, where we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re developing, of course, based on our individual strength new solutions to address that. But we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re looking at the multiple partnerships in this space here, and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re really bullish around that. Thanks for taking the question. Can you just talk about \u00e2\u0080\u0093 I mean it sounds like things clearly picked up as we went, obviously, on the supply side and you guys kind of got back online. Obviously, you guys are the only ones who have kind of a full July in the quarter. And then again, as we work our way through August here, I mean, it certainly seems like the order growth has been encouraging. It was linear, smooth, no, no big lumpiness and the fact that what we saw in the second quarter as well. So now as you know, the revenue side has been a different story because the ability to get product in and out of China as well as produced in China was affected by the COVID-19 shutdowns. And that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s where we saw maybe a slower start first few weeks of Q3, but then the team\u00e2\u0080\u0099s efforts really started paying off when we were able to get back into our facilities. I mean if you think about the months in our quarters, May was very light. As we talked about, we were ramping up, and I think we exited May at like 25% capacity. And July was very strong as they not only got the production up to full capacity, but then were able to not only satisfy existing demand, but also some of that deferral bring it in. And as I mentioned earlier in my earlier comments, we had teams working a lot of overtime, working in the factories over the weekend. And then, Bob, maybe one for you just on the margin side. Maybe just talk about the give and take on that front in terms of pricing increases, the cost increases and how we should think about kind of that algorithm going forward on the margin piece. I think if you looked at our 150 basis points year-on-year, it was roughly 50 basis points in gross margin and then 100 basis points of leverage on the SG&A OpEx side. And I think if you looked at that, there was some productivity. As I mentioned, price probably would have kept things flat. And Tim, that question brought a smile to Bob\u00e2\u0080\u0099s face. The $1 billion, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve already hit in \u00e2\u0080\u009822 with a quarter left to go. I mean, I think our methodology really hasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t changed. I think what we do is invest for growth first internally, and then we look for value-accreting M&A. But if there isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t anything imminent, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re also not going to keep cash on the books. And if I looked at historically, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve generated roughly 2% of earnings per share growth kind of below the line through share repurchase. But in terms of \u00e2\u0080\u0093 to be very clear, our priorities are investing for growth internally and then M&A before we would do share repurchases. There are no additional questions waiting at this time, so I will turn the call back over to Parmeet for closing remarks. Thanks, Hannah, and thanks, everyone, for joining. With that, we would like to wrap up the call for today."
