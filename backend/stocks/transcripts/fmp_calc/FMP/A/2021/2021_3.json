    "content": " Thanks for the congratulatory comments, Tycho, and we really, actually, continue to feel quite good about our performance in China, as Bob and I mentioned in the call script, I think 8% up on 11% last year, and I think our stack growth is around 19% Q2. And that's -- you know, at the analyst said, I think we've talked about in  that about 70% of our portfolio above that was really focused on Biopharma a so I'm really happy to see that momentum we have right now. So, I think it's still a relatively small part of the overall revenue picture today for Agilent, and we knew that going in, I think is roughly  million, but we would expect really strong growth rates in the coming years and again, we really feel like we're off to a great start with this team. So early days, but feeling good -- pretty good about things and  I don't know if you're saying \n Yeah, I was just going to say the other thing is, obviously, we're just now having more and more conversations with our existing CDx customers and the power of being able to have our established CDx business on the  side coupled with NGS-based technology, I think is going to be a real significant competitive advantage for us going forward. Your line is open. Your line is open. And I think it's probably fair to say that the Pharma market, in particular, the Biopharma market is -- remains very robust, but again, we're sticking with those long-term growth goals at this point in time. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open."
