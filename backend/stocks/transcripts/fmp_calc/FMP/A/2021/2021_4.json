    "content": " First of all, really excited about the new role and I think the unified commercial strategy and organization will really continue to strengthen Agilent\u2019s customer focus and help us to align capabilities for the future where we are going to kind of maximize the connect rate and customer lifetime value. But we\u2019ve also got productivity measures in place and this is where I think the One Agilent approach to our systems and our infrastructure really pays dividends, because we are able to leverage those costs across a larger base and because a lot of that is internal, we don\u2019t have that same level of pressure on cost as we are seeing in some other areas. We just think it\u2019s going to find ways to accelerate our growth, increase our customer satisfaction, and I think as we push more and more of our business because customers want to buy that way through digital, it will have a natural knock-on effect of efficiency gains in the P&L. But the reason that it\u2019s being increased is really to fund that growth and capacity expansion, whether that be Train B and NASD or the capacity expansions in places like genomics and cell analysis and I would say, given our growth trajectory in those areas, I would expect us to continue at probably an elevated level to incorporate that growth."
