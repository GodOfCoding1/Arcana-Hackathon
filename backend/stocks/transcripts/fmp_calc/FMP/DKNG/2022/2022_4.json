Jason, whoever wants to take this one, as you guys think about kind of the structural hold improvements that you're making and you think about kind of the new parlay product, relative to retention and acknowledging, it's early with a lot of this stuff, but you obviously had some growth over the course of 2022 with your addressable TAM, with new states that have come online. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. So, I think lots of comps around really not just the world, but if you look at the U.S. lottery market and other sorts of comparisons, it's just very much a market that I think always has new customers coming into it. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. So I think it's a combination of those two things of states that see the tax opportunity and realize that there's a real way to take something that's happening already, just like sports betting is in the illegal market and bring it into the light and protect consumers and also generate revenue for the state. Your line is open. Your line is open."
