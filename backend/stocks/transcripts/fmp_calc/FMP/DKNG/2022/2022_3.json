    "content": " In terms of financials, our third quarter revenue was $502 million, much higher than expected, supported by favorable sport outcomes as well as the aforementioned excellent execution across product technology, trading, customer service and marketing. Adjusted EBITDA was negative $264 million, also much better than anticipated due to flow-through from higher revenue and expenses shifting out of Q3 into Q4 despite marketing investments into our Kansas launch that had not been included in the expectations that we provided in early August. Adjusted EBITDA in Q3 was negative $264 million, which is $50 million better than the negative $314 million of adjusted EBITDA in the prior year period and significantly outperformed the expectations for Q3 that we provided on our August call primarily due to the higher-than-anticipated revenue. In Q4, we expect to generate about $790 million in revenue based on the midpoint of our 2022 revenue guidance, which represents substantial year-over-year growth and planned reinvestment in customers who have significant unlucky outcomes early in the football season. We are improving the midpoint of our full year 2022 guidance by $10 million to negative $790 million despite now including Kansas, which launched in September as well as investments in expected state launches for Maryland and Ohio. And we feel we're really well positioned for a very strong finish to 2022 and really well set up for 2023 going into 2024, which we expect to be roughly breakeven, potentially our first full profitable year and then, of course, Q4 of 2023, which we expect to be our first quarter of positive adjusted EBITDA."
