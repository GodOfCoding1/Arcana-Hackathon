    "content": " Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements is contained from time to time in the company's SEC filings, including, but not limited to: the company's reports on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021, and of course, on the Form 10-Q for the second quarter of 2022, which we filed last night. Sales of new products, including the PC Charger, the MAX-9 pistol, the LCP MAX pistol and the Marlin 1895 lever-action rifle represented $33.8 million or 11% of firearm sales in the first 6 months of 2022. Several popular firearms that were considered new products in 2021, including the Wrangler revolver, the Ruger-5.7 pistol and the LCP II in .22 LR rifle have now been in production for over 2 years and are no longer included in the new product sales calculation for the first half of 2022. So as we see, looking at their inventory, we make the decision perhaps not to ship what's on back order only because, again, we don't want to get -- burden them and get them in financial trouble if they're already deep in a particular model, a particular SKU, et cetera."
