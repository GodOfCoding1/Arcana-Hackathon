    "content": " Total sales in new products which also include the PC charger, the MAX-9 pistol, the LCP MAX pistol, and the Marlin 1895 SBL and Trapper lever-action rifles, represented $54.9 million or 13% of firearm sales in the first nine months of 2022. Several popular firearms that were considered new products in 2021, including the Wrangler Revolver, the Ruger 5.7 pistol, and the LCP II and 22 Long Rifle have now been in production for over two years and are no longer included in the new product sales calculation for the first nine months of 2022. And one thing I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll note in the Q that we released last night you know when you look at our incoming order rates for Q3, that was you know up to average selling price of the units ordered was up to $421, largely due to the new products I just mentioned, LC Carbine, SFAR and the Marlin Guide Gun, all of which carry a relatively higher price compared to some of our product lines like the 10/22 and the Wrangler, for example. And, of course, the demand for our legacy products remain strong, things like the 10/22s, our Bolt-Action Hunting Rifles, et cetera you know, 1911s and you know single-action and double-action revolvers help us I think weather some of these downturns that are you know focused on certain categories, that \u00e2\u0080\u0093 that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s where the broad range of products that we have in our arsenal I think help us a little bit. Well we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re pretty stable, pretty much between 1800, 1900 folks across the board, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re still you know certain of our factories we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re trying to hire a little more aggressively than others, particularly up in New Hampshire and Newport facility, where we make a lot of our legacy product lines, all of our revolvers, our 10/22s and some of our bolt-action rifles."
