    "content": " The greater reduction in the sell-through of the company's products relative to adjusted NICS background checks may be attributable to the following: more aggressive promotions, discounts, rebates and the extension of payment terms offered by our competitors; an apparent increase in the sale of used firearms at retail, which are included in the adjusted NICS checks but are not distinguished from new gun sales; and decreased retailer inventories, as the anticipation of further discounting may be encouraging cautious buying behavior by retailers."
