    "content": " Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements is contained from time to time in the company's SEC filings including, but not limited to the company's reports on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021, and of course the Form 10-Q for the first quarter of 2022 which we filed just last night. Please note that the reconciliation of GAAP net income to non-GAAP EBITDA can be found in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021 and our Form 10-Q for the first quarter of 2022 both of which are posted to our website. For the first quarter of 2022, net sales were $166.6 million and diluted earnings were $1.70 per share. As overall consumer demand subsided during the first quarter of 2022, our finished goods inventory increased 29,800 units and the distributor inventories of the company's products increased 80,400 units. Sales of new products including the PC Charger, the MAX-9 pistol, LCP MAX pistol and Marlin 1895 lever-action rifle, represented $21.4 million or 13% of firearm sales in the first quarter of 2022. Several popular firearms that were considered new products in 2021 including the regular revolver, the Ruger-5.7 pistol and the LCP II in .22 LR rifle have now been in production for over two years and are no longer included in the new product sales for the first quarter of 2022."
