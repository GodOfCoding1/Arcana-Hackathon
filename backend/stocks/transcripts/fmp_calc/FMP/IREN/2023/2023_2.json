    "content": " Firstly, just in terms of the profitability and cash flow generation associated with the infrastructure we've built, you can really see the step up in mining profitability as we step up from 2 exahash to 5.5 exahash of operating capacity. And just to illustrate, at a $25,000 Bitcoin price, this represents an almost three times increase in mining profits with annualized mining profits stepping up from $33 million to $94 million and we expect this to really support some strong operating cash flow going forward. So as we can see from the economics and the sort of the boxes shaded green, 5.5 exahash of self-mining delivers a far superior mining profit versus a blended self-mining and hosting model And again, just to illustrate a $25,000 Bitcoin price, self-mining the full 5.5 exahash without any additional cash outlay is expected to generate more than $40 million of additional mining profit on an annualized basis. And the reason I say that is, you've got a really natural investment profile for deploying more capacity in this sector, where historically, if you go back over the last four, five, six years, and look at average hardware prices, they're typically priced to deliver the buyer of that hardware on average of 124% return. And in terms of the -- sort of, the runway  from an OpEx perspective, we've seen the numbers in this result, but we're sort of targeting approximately $2 million per month for site and other OpEx. No, that makes sense. No, that makes sense."
