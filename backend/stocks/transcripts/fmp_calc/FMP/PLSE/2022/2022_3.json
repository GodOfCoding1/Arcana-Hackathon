    "content": " At Pulse Biosciences, we have developed a novel and proprietary tissue treatment platform based on Nano-Pulse Stimulation or NPS where ultra fast electrical energy pulses with nanosecond pulse durations from billions up to a millionth of a second are used to stimulate cellular effects that can lead to positive therapeutic outcomes. Non-GAAP research and development expenses decreased by approximately $1.9 million from a year ago to $4.1 million for the three month period ended September 30, 2022 primarily as a result of headcount and expense reductions as part of our restructuring plan. Non-GAAP sales and marketing expenses decreased by approximately $1.4 million from a year ago to $2 million for the three month period ended September 30, 2022 primarily due to our decision to end commercial activities in dermatology. Non-GAAP general and administrative expenses decreased by approximately $592,000, $2.4 million for the three month period ended September 30, 2022 primarily as a result of headcount and expense reductions as part of our restructuring plan."
