    "content": " Building upon our R&D work in cardiology that began several years ago, our top focus is now on developing multiple devices to deliver nanosecond pulse field ablation or nsPFA to cardiac tissue for the treatment of atrial fibrillation. At Pulse Biosciences, we have developed a novel and proprietary tissue treatment platform based on nsPFA where ultrafast electrical energy pulses at nanosecond pulse durations from billions up to millionth of a second are used to stimulate cellular effects that can lead to positive therapeutic outcomes. nsPFA is broadly considered a pulse field technology, but the use of nanosecond duration pulses leads to a highly differentiated cellular mechanism of action that can be applied to a number of important clinical applications with distinct and unique benefits to patients treating MDs and post-care trained staff. Because nsPFA ablation does not impact acellular tissue, such as collagen or cartilage, our technology has the potential to offer significant safety advantages over thermal modalities by allowing surgeons to ablate near and into vessels and valves without safety concerns of permanent damage. Just want to let everyone know that as we move forward, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to be head down in our preclinical and product development throughout the closing quarters, and we will update everyone as our new data and the potential of nsPFA comes out, and the significant progress that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to make, and we will continue to report quarterly and communicate updates in a timely and transparent manner that are materials to the business through public communication, calls and press releases."
