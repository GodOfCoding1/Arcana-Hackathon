    "content": " As Todd mentioned in his opening remarks, our Board of Directors recently had the opportunity to revisit our capital allocation plans in order to address our cash balance, which remained elevated at approximately $780 million as of year-end 2022. Our continued business momentum, supported by the large investments in our strategic growth pillars over the last several years, and our strong liquidity position support a 100% increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.25 per share. Chris, your line is now open. And I do think it will make us a lot more effective, so we can go faster to continue to drive and accelerate the results that we've seen behind our key strategic growth pillars that we've been very focused on the last couple of years. Chris, your line is now open."
