    "content": " Through a combination of strategic acquisitions, targeted investments in EV and a thorough review of  SKU profitability, this group closed '22 with sales up $288 million at a gross margin of 30.5%. With this segment, commercial aerospace revenue closed at $31 million for the year, up 75% over '21, highlighted by a jump in aftermarket revenue as well as continued support on new aircraft production. Further, our Signal Transformer business had an increase in sales of $6.8 million in '22, primary due to price increases taken earlier this year and a higher demand from its medical industrial customers. By product group, Power Solutions and Protection sales were $82.1 million, up 39% from last year's fourth quarter, primarily led by an $11.1 million increase in sales of our front-end power products, $4.1 million of higher sales of industrial power products and $2.8 million of growth in EV sales. Our Power Solutions and Protection group had a book-to-bill ratio of 1.0 during the fourth quarter of '22 and a backlog of orders of $356 million, an increase of 48% from the 2021 year-end. Sales were $47 million, an increase of 8% from last year's fourth quarter, mostly due to the continued rebound of commercial aerospace and strong sales through our distribution channels. The Connectivity Solutions group had a book-to-bill ratio of 1.06 during the fourth quarter of 2022 and a backlog of orders of $119 million at December 31, an increase of 40% from the 2021 year-end. Lastly, our Magnetic Solutions group had Q4 sales of $40.1 million, down 10% from last year's fourth quarter. Our Magnetic Solutions group had a book-to-bill ratio of 0.49 during the fourth quarter of 2022 and finished the quarter with $91 million worth of orders in backlog, down 37% from the 2021 year-end level. Our selling, general and administrative expenses were $25.1 million or 14.8% of sales, up from $21.9 million in the fourth quarter last year, but down slightly as a percentage of total sales. Q4 direct sales into commercial air customers were $8 million, up 55% from Q4 2021, and we expect sales to grow in 2023 to be in the double-digit territory. So e-mobility sales for Q4 were $6 million, and that was up from $3.2 million in last year's fourth quarter. So $6 million for Q4 versus $3.2 million in last year's Q4, and on an annual basis, it was right around $20 million versus $10 million last year. Sorry, Dan, go ahead. Sorry, Dan, go ahead."
