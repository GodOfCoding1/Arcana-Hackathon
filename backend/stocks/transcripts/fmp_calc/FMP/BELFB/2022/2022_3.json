    "content": " Sales into our commercial aerospace customers were $9 million for the quarter, an increase of 140% over last year's third quarter. In addition to Dan's commentary on EV sales and raw material surcharge invoicing, the Power group also benefited from strong sales in our CUI business, which posted an increase of $3 million or 18% from Q3 2021. Turning to our Connectivity Solutions group, sales were $50.3 million, an increase of 25% from last year's third quarter, mostly due to the continued rebound of commercial aerospace and premise wiring end-markets. But also included in that group is our Signal business and a lot of work has been done over the past couple of quarters taking a better look at that business, the profitability there and just kind of a renewed focus and so, that's also contributing to the margin improvement for that business. Please proceed with your question, Robert. We want to do it the right way in this time in this environment, where we're kind of doing this and certainly, one other thing I would offer up is if you look at our profit that has gained in the last four quarters, let's say, for example, EBITDA, if we have to go out there and buy this EBITDA it will cost us a lot more. Please proceed with your question, Robert. Please proceed with your question, Robert."
