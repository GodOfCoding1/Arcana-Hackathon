    "content": " Recently, the American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy featured our KUR-502 program in their online magazine, Nucleus, highlighting the potential for allogeneic CAR-NKT cells to be the Goldilocks of cellular therapies, offering the best of T cells in terms of manufacturing and cryopreservation and the best of NK cells in terms of no risk of graft versus host disease. Importantly, data demonstrating CAR-NKT cells homing to the tumors and expanding in peripheral blood are encouraging and support potential for more robust and durable response as the dose escalates. Collectively these data will provide supporting evidence that our autologous CAR-NKT cells directed against GD2 are safe, can expand post transfer, home to tumor sites, and produce objective responses in high risk neuroblastoma patients. Collectively, our NKT platform continues to support the idea that NKT cells are the Goldilocks of cell therapy, balancing the best of both innate and adaptive immunity and demonstrating excellent safety, promising efficacy, and robust tissue and tumor persistence following treatments and we remain highly encouraged by the promise of our NKT cell platform. In terms of our bar on go, no go decision, since we already saw two out of three responses that at dose level 4 which is 100 million cells per meter square, if we maintain that kind of a response rate at high doses, I think that will give us confidence and conviction that this will be successful in a pivotal study and benefit patients in the long run."
