    "content": " Our per barrel adjusted gross margin for crude oil and NGL assets averaged $2.46, an increase of $0.18 year-over-year, this was primarily due to increased throughput and deficiency fee revenues in the Delaware Basin, which has a higher than average per barrel margin as compared to our other crude oil and NGL assets, a smaller negative impact related to the cumulative catch-up adjustment for certain cost of service contracts at the DJ Basin oil system relative to 2021 and an increase in distributions from Cactus II."
