    "content": " The launch of LumiSpa iO, which is continuing into the fourth quarter, together with continued adoption of ageLOC Meta and Beauty focused Collagen+ helped drive constant currency growth in 4 of our reporting segments, led by double-digit gains in Southeast Asia Pacific as well as more modest growth in the Americas, Japan and our Taiwan, Hong Kong segments. On a more positive note, 4 of our 7 market segments reported constant currency growth, led by Southeast Asia Pacific, which experienced double-digit currency -- excuse me, double-digit constant currency results driven by a strong LumiSpa iO introduction and the ongoing rollout of ageLOC Meta as well as the U.S., which posted another strong quarter and moderate growth in Japan as well as Taiwan and Hong Kong."
