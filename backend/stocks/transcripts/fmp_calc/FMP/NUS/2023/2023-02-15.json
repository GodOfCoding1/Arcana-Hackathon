    "content": " The majority of the year-over-year decline in our business was due to strict COVID-related factors in China, which accounted for approximately $208 million of the revenue shortfall; as well as unfavorable FX, which negatively impacted us by about $150 million; and overall global inflation, which impacted consumer sentiment and global supply chain. We defined 3 distinct strategic imperatives that enable our vision to come to life, which are: number one, EmpowerMe, our personalized beauty and wellness strategy, including smart IoT-connected device systems; number two, the evolution of our go-to-market strategy from traditional direct selling to affiliate-powered social commerce; and number three, the build-out of our integrated digital ecosystem, including the introduction of 2 apps, our Vera consumer app and our Stela affiliate app. In the Americas, our U.S. market grew 4% for the year on top of 32% revenue growth in 2021, attributed to continued social selling momentum and customer subscription enrollment."
