    "content": " Book value per share increased 8% year-over-year and 1% sequentially to $11.94 with a year-over-year increase due primarily to the impact of our common share offering in September of 2021 and higher retained earnings attributable to net income earned in the current period offset partially by the payment of dividends over the same time frame, and the sequential increase being due primarily to higher retained earnings attributable to net income earned in the current quarter, offset partially by the payment of dividends over the same period. Total consolidated revenue increased 17% year-over-year and 2% sequentially to 18.6 million with the increase driven primarily by higher net interest income in our Digital Banking operations, which in turn was driven by strong growth in our loan portfolio."
