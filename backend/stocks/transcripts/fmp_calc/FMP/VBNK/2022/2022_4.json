    "content": " Total consolidated revenue increased 33% year-over-year at 14% sequentially, to a record $24.3 million, with the increase being driven primarily by higher net interest income derived from our digital banking operations, resulting from the strong growth in our loan portfolio that was discussed earlier. Turning to the income statement, for our digital banking operations, net interest margin on loans, that is excluding cash and securities and other assets, decreased 28 basis points or 8% year-over-year, and four basis points or 1% sequentially to 3.03%, due primarily to a shift in the bank's funding mix and rising interest rates over the respective periods, as well as the successful execution of our strategy to grow our POS financing portfolio."
