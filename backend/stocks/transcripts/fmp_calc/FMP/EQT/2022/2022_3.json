    "content": " Turning to the third quarter, it was an active one at EQT as we announced the bolt-on acquisition of Tug Hill and XcL Midstream, as highlighted on our conference call last month, this deal checks all of the boxes of our guiding M&A principles have significant industrial logics given direct offset to our existing lease sold in West Virginia, and brings over 11 years of core inventory that immediately competes for capital inside and in EQT's portfolio. So the benefit of moving wells back in '23, I guess, to argue maybe, Frank, some of the service costs environment we do hope that service costs will abate a little bit, so that could be one of these benefits but right now we'd like have these volumes today, with current price backwards, we're pushing -- the other thing is, if you notice then slide 11 -- ability to pull things back with -- so that was I hope that we were able to beat out that -- cycle time improvement will carry forward with our wells bore. And I think you might have answered part of it in that last set of answers, but it sounds like there's some choppiness in his line that was hard to hear, but just to clarify, it sounds like Tug Hill, you don't anticipate any of these midstream issues to impact Tug Hill once you get that is part of EQT and also as part of that can you give us a sense of how much of the relative well outperformance underlying well outperformance, benefited EQT over the last say quarter or so."
