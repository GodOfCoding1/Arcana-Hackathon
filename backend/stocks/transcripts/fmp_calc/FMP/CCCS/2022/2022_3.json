    "content": " For the third quarter of 2022, CCC's total revenue was $199 million, up 13% year-over-year and ahead of our guidance range. As a result, our solutions have high levels of customer adoption, ROI and renewal, which helps create a powerful and highly scalable business model, maintaining close customer relationships is a key part of CCC's culture and a major driver of our consistent Net Promoter Score of 80. Approximately 10% of our revenue growth in the third quarter was driven by cross-sell and upsell into our installed client base, including continued strong adoption of our digital solutions, about 1 percentage point of the 10% came from the large expansion deals that we closed in the second half of last year that we've been talking about over the last several quarters. So this ability to demonstrate in very tangible terms, immediately, what Estimate-STP can deliver gives our customers a lot of confidence, and we're working at design levels with many of our customers across a much broader STP, which basically starts all the way from consumer, all the way through settlement and takes advantage of the network of customers we have across insurers, repairs, parts providers because you have to bring all of these pieces together to truly pull off straight-through processing."
