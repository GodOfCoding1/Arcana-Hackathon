    "content": " For the fourth quarter of 2022, CCC\u00e2\u0080\u0099s total revenue was $204 million, up 9% year-over-year and ahead of our guidance range. Revenue for the full year 2022 was $782 million, up 14% year-over-year, 2% above the high end of our initial 2022 guidance range. Adjusted EBITDA for the full year 2022 was $305 million, 4% above the high end of our initial guidance range and more than twice our 2018 adjusted EBITDA of $148 million for a compounded annual growth rate of 20%. Today, over 100 of our 300-plus insurance customers are actively using CCC\u00e2\u0080\u0099s AI powered capabilities, application of advanced computer vision AI for claims processing increased 60% year-over-year and a total of over 14 million unique claims have been processed using a CCC AI solution with 2022 at 3 times the level of 2019. Adjusted gross profit in the fiscal year 2022 was $605 million, with an adjusted gross profit margin of 77%, down slightly from 78% in the fiscal year 2021. Adjusted EBITDA for the full year 2022 was $305.4 million, up 17% year-over-year with an adjusted EBITDA margin of 39%. The $400 million that we talked about didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t necessarily play much into this year because we signed it at the end of the year and the onboarding will bleed into next year, but it will be part of our new logo growth in the repair facilities into 2023 and we feel really good about kind of continuing the cadence of adding 1,000 shops a year. We have given further color as you break down the 80% of cross-sell, upsell to the base and we have said over time about half of that will come from existing solutions that have been in the market for the past several years and half of the growth will come from these newer emerging solutions that we have more recently brought into market such as Diagnostics, such as Estimate-STP and subrogation."
