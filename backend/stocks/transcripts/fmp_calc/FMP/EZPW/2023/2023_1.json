    "content": " Pawn loans outstanding, the key driver of our business, was $208.6 million at quarter-end, an 18% year-over-year increase and our highest ever result for Q1, and merchandise sales were up 14% to $161.9 million, a highest ever quarterly sales result. PLO ended the period at $208.6 million, up 18% on a year-over-year basis, which is the highest first quarter in EZCORP\u00e2\u0080\u0099s history. Merchandise sales was up 18% to $161.9 million, our highest quarterly sales results ever, but as expected, margins fell back to 36%, which is within our normal range. As we have suggested in prior quarters, we are likely to continue to see gross margin remain at the lower end of our range of 35% to 38% as we remain focused on strong inventory turns and limited aged general merchandise. Brian, your line is now open. Brian, your line is now open."
