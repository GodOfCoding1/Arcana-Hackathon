    "content": " For the first quarter, we expect ACV plus trailing 12-month royalties of $51.5 million to $55.5 million and revenue of $11 million to $13 million with non-GAAP operating loss margin of 55% to 75% and non-GAAP free cash flow margin of negative 56.7% to negative 81.7%, partly resulting from the $2.5 million early payment from customers in the fourth quarter of 2022 that I mentioned earlier. ACV plus trailing 12-month royalties to exit 2023 at $60.4 million to $65.4 million; non-GAAP operating loss margin of 28.5% to 43.5% and non-GAAP free cash flow margin of negative 9.7% to negative 19.7%, reflecting the concentration of negative free cash flow into the first quarter."
