    "content": " Notably, we sold 337 units of electric commercial vehicles in the first six months of 2022, up 23% from the same period in 2021 and lead to 105% growth in the net revenue to $5 million. The increase was due to both, a 23% growth in sales volume as well as an improvement of average selling price, ASP, from $7,354 in primarily selling Metro Car Kits last year to $14,400 in the improved product mix to include 132 units of LS 200 at a much higher ASP."
