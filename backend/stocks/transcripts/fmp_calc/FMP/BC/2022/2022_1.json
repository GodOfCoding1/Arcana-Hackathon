    "content": " Global boat field inventory levels were 6% lower at the end of the first quarter 2022 than at the same time in 2021, and down 12% in the US, and are likely exaggerated by a slower start to spring in the Northern US and Canada, which is resulting in delayed deliveries and registrations for many retail-sold boats. 10:56 Sales in each segment benefited from higher prices implemented since the first quarter of 2021 and increased sales volumes, partially offset by supply chain inefficiencies and unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates, while each segment's operating earnings continue to be impacted by increasing inflationary pressures and spending on growth-related initiatives. Those channels often are margined up, and so that's -- that will enable a little bit of margin expansion, which is what you're seeing obviously in the back half of the year, certainly in the fourth quarter then into '23 as you looked at our strategic plan, up to 2025."
