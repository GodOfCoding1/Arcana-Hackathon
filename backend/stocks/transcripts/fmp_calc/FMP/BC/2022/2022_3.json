    "content": " Our Propulsion business continues to deliver exceptional results, with 14% top line growth versus third quarter 2021, enabled by higher sales volume resulting from strong global demand, capacity increases and market share gains. Brunswick's retail unit performance in the third quarter was broadly consistent with the overall market performance, with outperformance in recreational fiberglass products and premium pontoons and underperformance in value aluminum, while lower contented value boats, mainly from smaller manufacturers, have regained share lost in 2019 and 2020. All segments delivered sales growth resulting from solid demand, new product performance and pricing implemented since the third quarter of 2021, partially offset by unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates, the impact from Hurricane Ian and supply chain challenges. Revenue increased 14% versus the third quarter of 2021 as higher sales volumes were driven by strong global demand, capacity increases and market share gains around the globe. We thought it would be also helpful to dive a bit further into pipeline levels, focusing on the current availability of fiberglass product versus aluminum product in the U.S. At the end of the third quarter, there were approximately 5,000 units of aluminum product in the hands of U.S. dealers or 19 weeks on hand, which although trending healthier, remains almost 40% lower from the same level in 2019.
