    "content": " In 2022, we generated revenues of 440.5 million, up from 318.7 million in 2021, a growth rate 38%. Total revenue for the 12 months ended December 31, 2022 amounted to 440.5 million representing growth of 38% over total revenue of 318.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. Total revenue for the fourth quarter of 2022 amounted to 108.8 million compared to 121.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2021, which included an estimated 49 million in mass COVID testing revenues. Medical transportation revenue increased significantly to 37 million in Q4 of 2022, nearly doubling from the levels that we saw in the fourth quarter of 2021. The reduction in cash during the fourth quarter was due to several factors, including the timing of payments from high quality credit customers, which resulted in an increase of approximately $8 million in accounts receivable, $3 million in acquisition payments and capital expenditures, and approximately $3.2 million spent on stock buybacks. While this range would represent year-over-year top line growth of about 14% to 16% when removing the 75 million of mass COVID testing from our 2022 revenue baseline and considering that we're not expecting any mass COVID testing revenues in 2023, then we're looking at top line growth of approximately 36% to 40%.
