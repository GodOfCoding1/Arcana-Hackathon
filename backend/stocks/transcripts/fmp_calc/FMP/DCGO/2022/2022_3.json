    "content": " We estimate that mass COVID testing accounted for mid-single digits on a percentage basis of total revenues during the third quarter compared to approximately 35% of revenue in Q3 of 2021, and the last of these contracts concluded in September of this year. Mobile health revenue amounts to 73% of total revenue during Q3 this year versus 79% in the prior year with transportation as the remainder revenue generated by the UK market grew by 15% to 3 million during Q3 of this year, representing approximately 3% of total revenue. Our 2022 guidance provided at the beginning of the year assumes that the average cost per hour of labor would increase by approximately 7% versus the already inflated '21 labor rates, and at the average cost of gas would be $4.30 cents per gallon to leave the third quarter of '22. While the average through cost gallon, which moderated from a Q2 level was significantly higher versus the prior year, but very close to our forecasted rates during Q3 of this year, the negative impact of the increase gas task was approximately by 30 basis points on gross margin compared to the third quarter of '21 with the negative impact of only two basis points versus our assumptions for 2022. The adjusted EBITDA of $7.8 million for the comparable last year income for the nine months end of September '22 amounted to $23.6 million, representing a substantial improvement, the net loss of 1.1 million for the comparable period last year in terms of our 22 outlook to anticipate continued strong demand from our customers for post mobile health and transportation services. And so those kind of models are a lot of what we've seen the growth where we look at our existing customer base and we say, listen, there's revenue that we're not able to capture because we don't have either a competency capability or licensure or maybe all of the above."
