    "content": " Year-to-date, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve placed over US$1.8 billion of assets into service, including our Grand Chenier and Louisiana XPress projects that have increased our market share of LNG feed gas from approximately 25% to 30%. The inclusion of the VNBR and Gillis Access projects has had a moderate impact on our sources and uses of funding that was updated in August, following the announcement of our Southeast Gateway project, our sustainable cash flow growth is expected to drive our de-leveraging and incremental long-term debt and hybrid capacity, while funding accretive growth opportunities To prudently fund our current capital program while maintaining our leverage targets. As Fran\u00c3\u00a7ois noted, following the Columbia Pipeline acquisition in 2016, our debt-to-EBITDA ratio exceeded six times through a series of successful assets sales totaling over $11 billion, we achieved less than five times debt-to-EBITDA exiting 2019, We continue to expect to grow our dividends by 3% to 5% supported by sustainable growth in earnings and cash flow per share in strong coverage ratios. With interest rates rising and cost of financing creeping higher, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m just wondering if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re \u00e2\u0080\u0093 if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve thought about raising the IRR on new projects, historically it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been in the 7% to 9% range, but then I think I heard you say on this call that you could recycle CapEx and invest in kind of the 7 times EBITDA range. So again, despite the fact that we are in a higher interest rate environment today, when I look at our balance maturity profile, when I look at the fact again, that 85% of our debt is fixed rate that again, we are largely immune from rising interest rates that would hit our bottom line when you also factor that about 20% to 25% would flow through in rates to our customers. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re excited to provide solutions for our customers and to further enhance what we view as an irreplaceable pipeline infrastructure with the announcement of our Gillis Access Project today, and again, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a $400 million capital investment about 1.5 Bcf/d of capacity in service in the summer 2024. With our Gillis project and the other projects that we have placed into service or will be placing into service over the next several months and years, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to increase the flowing LNG gas that we have from about 3 Bcf today, which is roughly a 30% market share to over 6 Bcf or 35% market share in 2025."
