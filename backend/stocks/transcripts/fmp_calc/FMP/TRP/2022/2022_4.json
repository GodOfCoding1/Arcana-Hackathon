    "content": " We are reaffirming our 2023 financial outlook with comparable EBITDA expected to be 5% to 7% higher than in 2022, and we've increased our dividend for the 23rd consecutive year. In 2022, we placed $3.2 billion of capacity projects into service, growing our NGTL investment base by 12% year-over-year, and we expect to place approximately $3 billion of additional facilities into service in 2023. We expect our Canadian and Mexico Natural Gas Pipelines businesses to deliver higher comparable EBITDA compared to 2022, largely driven by continued growth on the NGTL system and full year contributions from the BDR North and 2 East pipelines, respectively. Our sustainable cash flow growth will also drive our deleveraging and support incremental long-term debt and hybrid capacity to further fund accretive growth opportunities where our capital spending exceeds our targeted annual range of $5 billion to $7 billion, we will continue to utilize capital rotation without the reliance on common equity. Firstly, maintaining safe and reliable operations is always our number one priority; second, executing and progressing our major projects, such as Coastal GasLink and Southeast Gateway; third, enhancing our balance sheet by actively managing our capital spending and advancing our $5-plus billion asset divestiture program; and then lastly, ensuring operational excellence to drive higher returns on existing assets. But what I will tell you is we are confident in our ability to achieve our $5-plus billion program and even upsizing that program to the extent we see attractive valuations Joel mentioned, we have a near-term target within the next 12 months to achieve 5 times debt-to-EBITDA."
