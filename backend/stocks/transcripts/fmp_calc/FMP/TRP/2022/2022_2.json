    "content": " In recognition of the revised project agreements with LNG Canada and in accordance with a binding commitment subject to the execution of definitive agreements with our Coastal GasLink LP partners, we will make an equity contribution to Coastal GasLink LP of $1.9 billion, which will be paid in installments commencing in August of 2022 with no resulting change to our 35% ownership. Now in terms of 2022 capital spending, we now expect to invest approximately $8.5 billion as a result of increased costs in the NGTL system and our equity contribution associated with Coastal GasLink of approximately $1.3 billion. And therefore, we determined that turning on the DRIP for 4 quarters, and what we're trying to achieve here is about $1.25 billion of common equity based on a 35% historical participation rate at the 2% discount is appropriate to fund our capital program at this point in time. From my perspective, again, this goes back to our asset footprint in Mexico, and we currently deliver about 15% of the gas that's transported today, along with strong demand, strong demand in the context of Mexican imports from the U.S. are going to increase from 8 Bcf to 12 Bcf over the next years."
