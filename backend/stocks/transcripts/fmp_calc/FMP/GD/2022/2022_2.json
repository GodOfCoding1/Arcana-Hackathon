    "content": " Revenue was essentially flat against the second quarter last year, but operating earnings were up $19 million. Revenue was $245 million more than the year ago quarter or 15.1%, largely as a result of higher service center sales at Gulfstream and higher service volume particularly FBOs at Jet Aviation. On a sequential basis, revenue was very similar to the first quarter, but operating earnings were up 7.9% or $18 million on a 110 basis point improvement in operating margin. From an operating cash flow perspective, we generated over $650 million, which following our strong first quarter performance brings us to over $2.6 billion for the first six months of the year. Including capital expenditures, our free cash flow was $435 million for the quarter and $2.3 billion year-to-date, yielding a conversion rate of 151% year-to-date. In Aerospace, we expect an additional $200 million of revenue with an operating margin of around 12.9% which is 10 basis points higher than we previously forecast. If you do some quick checking you'll see that what that's really a function of it that last year, our revenue per quarter was essentially consistent throughout the year, first quarter, second quarter, third quarter, which is really in contrast to the tried and true annual cycle that we see in Combat Systems and we're frankly once again seeing this year which is a sequential ladder, if you will, lowest in the first quarter, rising to the fourth quarter. And so that I think just continues to be supportive of our -- an underpinning of our outlook for the ongoing $400 million to $500 million a year growth in the Marine Systems business, so all positive there."
