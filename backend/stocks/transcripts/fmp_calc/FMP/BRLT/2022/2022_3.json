    "content": " We delivered another quarter of record gross margin at 54.7%, a 430 basis point improvement over the prior year, and we delivered $10 million in adjusted EBITDA, representing an adjusted EBITDA margin of 9%. While we're pleased that we have continued to drive sustainable, profitable growth, as we look to finish the year, macro headwinds and the anticipated promotional environment are more difficult than earlier in the year, causing us to be more cautious about our fourth quarter revenue outlook. As I have said in the past, by nimbly and prudently executing our strategy while optimizing our model to grow the brand, we are well positioned to continue to take share in a fragmented industry to prudently manage our costs and to deliver profitable growth, all while we continue to advance our mission to transform the jewelry industry. The combination of strong revenue and gross margin growth, balanced by strategic investments in the business delivered $10 million in adjusted EBITDA in the third quarter. As a growth company, we will prioritize delivering healthy and sustainable revenue growth, expanding our premium gross margin, making prudent strategic ROI-driven investments to build and scale the business and rigorously managing our costs to deliver sustainable, profitable growth for our shareholders. In terms of Q4, as I mentioned in the remarks and as you pointed out, we do anticipate in our guidance that maybe a more promotional environment set  our strategy of continuing to focus on sustainable, profitable growth has not changed, and we've continued to manage these levers in Q4 as we do in each quarter."
