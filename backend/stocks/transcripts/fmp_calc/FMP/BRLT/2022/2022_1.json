    "content": " you can expect that we will continue to prudently and strategically invest to grow the Brilliant Earth brand and business to expand our showroom and omnichannel footprint and to optimize our huge financial and operating advantage with our asset-light, agile and highly efficient business model, all with an eye on delivering profitable and sustainable near- and long-term growth and on extending our lead as a transformative, modern fine jeweler for today\u2019s consumer. Finally, our strong revenue and gross margin growth, balanced by our strategic investments in the business delivered $8.4 million in adjusted EBITDA in the first quarter, a 29% increase over the prior year. Based on the continuing strength of our gross margin, where we expect modest year-over-year improvements for the balance of the year and our prudent management of investments in spending, but reflecting some of the global macroeconomic uncertainty, we are revising our outlook for full year adjusted EBITDA to $30 million to $40 million or an approximately 7% to 9% adjusted EBITDA margin. Given the sustained strength of our gross margin, the timing and execution of our new showroom openings and the continued growth in our brand reach, we anticipate delivering Q2 adjusted EBITDA of $5 million to $8 million or an approximately 5% to 7% adjusted EBITDA margin."
