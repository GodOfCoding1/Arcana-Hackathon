    "content": " The quality of our earnings growth is translated into strong cash flows, as FY 2022 net cash from operating activities rose 59.3% year-on-year to US$123 million. Korea is a good example of our network expansion that has worked out very well, over the past year, we onboarded three of our existing large clients in Korea successfully growing our business with them from the original geography. Revenue rose 14.2% to US$131 million, driven by growth across the omnichannel CX, sales and digital marketing as well as content, trust and safety service lines. Revenue from Omnichannel CX solutions was up 6% to US$73 million, due mainly to higher business volumes from the travel and hospitality and technology verticals. Revenue from sales and digital marketing services increased by 41% to US$36 million, with the expansion of existing campaigns from our key digital advertising and media clients, as well as additional contributions from new clients in 2022 which are ramping up. Revenue from content, trust and safety services rose by 5% to US$21 million, due to high business service volumes from existing clients. In Q4, 2022, Omnichannel CX made up 56% of our total business, while sales and digital marketing contributed 28% and content, trust and safety at 16% respectively. Employee benefit expenses increased by 29% to US$325 million and 23% with up PSP costs, due mainly to higher employee count to support the business with volume requirement higher reach and other operational costs to cope with inflationary pressure. Another of our key strength in the sales and digital marketing service, which now makes up one-quarter of our business this is core to our clients' business where we are helping to grow their revenues and this segment should continue to be resilient and a bright spot for us."
