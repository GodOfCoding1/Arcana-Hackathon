    "content": " Revenue contribution from high-growth markets such as electric vehicles, green energy and the commercialization of space increased approximately 35% year-on-year to $19 million in fiscal second quarter 2023. Consolidated adjusted operating margin of 15.2% in fiscal second quarter '23 was a 160 basis point increase year-on-year and a 20 basis point improvement sequentially, despite a challenging global environment. Sequentially, we expect revenue in our third fiscal quarter to improve slightly to moderately with strong demand across end markets in North America and increased sales into fast growth markets. On a sequential basis, in the fiscal second quarter of '23, we expect slightly lower revenue and a similar operating margin as productivity actions and lower freight costs are projected to offset volume decline. Revenue of $24 million increased 34% year-on-year, reflecting strong growth across all markets. Second quarter 2023 adjusted operating margin increased 160 basis points year-on-year to 15.2%, our highest in the history of the company, as our adjusted operating income grew approximately 13.3% on a 1.1% consolidated revenue increase year-on-year. Adjusted earnings per share were $1.74 in the second quarter of fiscal 2023 compared to $1.45 a year ago, approximately 20% growth year-on-year. As part of this long-term view, we believe our fast growth market sales will reach 20% or greater of total sales within the next five years, which would represent $200 million plus in sales by fiscal year 2028. We target continued organic growth at a high single digit compounded annual rate over the next five years, reaching greater than $1 billion in sales by fiscal year 2028."
