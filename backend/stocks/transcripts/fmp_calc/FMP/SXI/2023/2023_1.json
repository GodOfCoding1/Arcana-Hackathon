    "content": " Revenue contribution from high-growth markets such as electric vehicles, green energy and the commercialization of space increased approximately 30% year-on-year to $17 million in fiscal first quarter 2023. Operating margin of 24.1% in fiscal first quarter 2023 was flat versus the year ago period, primarily due to organic sales growth and productivity initiatives offsetting the inflationary and currency impact. Operating margin of 16.7% in fiscal first quarter 2023, increased 280 basis points year-on-year due to the realization of previously announced productivity actions in North America and Europe. On a sequential basis, in the fiscal second quarter of '23, we expect slightly higher revenue increase and slightly lower to similar operating margin, primarily due to R&D investments and higher anticipated spend on advertising and trade shows. Specialty Solutions revenue of $35 million increased nearly 37% year-on-year due to price realization, strong market demand in Hydraulics business unit and the favorable year-over-year comparison due to a labor work stoppage in 2 plants during fiscal first quarter '22. First quarter 2023 adjusted operating margin increased 160 basis points year-on-year to 15%, our highest in the history of the company, as our adjusted operating income grew approximately 15.7% on a 2.8% consolidated revenue increase year-on-year. Adjusted earnings per share were $1.60 in the first quarter of fiscal 2023 compared to $1.34 year ago, approximately 19% growth year-on-year."
