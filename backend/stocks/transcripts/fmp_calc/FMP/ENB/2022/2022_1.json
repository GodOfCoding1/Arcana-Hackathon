    "content": " Joining me this morning are Al Monaco, President and Chief Executive Officer; Vern Yu, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Colin Gruending, Executive Vice President, Liquids Pipelines; Cynthia Hansen, Executive Vice President, Gas Transmission and Midstream; Michele Harradence, Senior Vice President and President Gas Distribution Storage; and Matthew Akman, Senior Vice President, Strategy, Power and New Energy Technologies. We will try to keep the call to roughly one hour; and in order to answer as many questions as possible, we\u2019ll be limiting the questions to one plus a single follow-up as necessary. With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Al Monaco. First of all, recent events are very troubling, and we\u2019re all very concerned for the people in Ukraine. Many of our staffs have connections to the region, and we\u2019re supporting them. So, I\u2019ll start off with how we\u2019re thinking about that followed by our business update, and Vern will cover our financial results and outlook. That translated into strong Q1 numbers, and we\u2019re on track to achieve \u201822 guidance. So far in \u201822, we\u2019ve added another $1 billion to our project backlog that will support post \u201824 growth. More broadly, we\u2019re seeing a pickup in customer infrastructure, especially LNG export. Recall, there\u2019s $5 billion to $6 billion a year of conventional and low carbon opportunity enterprise-wide in the hopper. The Russia-Ukraine war has worsened the demand-supply gap, obviously, but it\u2019s also put energy back in the spotlight. Europe\u2019s heavy reliance on Russia is driving this, of course, but the impacts are broader and global, regardless of when this war ends. We\u2019ll need to accelerate low-carbon investments as well to meet demand, achieve emissions goals, and as part of the security buffer. To make that happen, we\u2019ll need to pick up the pace on proven ways to grow low-carbon fields, like RNG, hydrogen and especially carbon capture. And that\u2019ll mean leveraging existing transportation and storage infrastructure more quickly, like ours. Third, North America will play a much larger role in the global energy market, and here\u2019s what. The North American energy advantage that we\u2019ve been talking about is even more evident today, massive low-cost reserves and the technology to produce them with the lowest carbon intensity. And now, that\u2019ll be needed faster. On low-carbon, $25 trillion will need to be invested with renewables, the largest component along with RNG, hydrogen, and again, carbon capture. On the conventional side, we\u2019ll focus on optimizing throughput and modernizing our systems. On low-carbon, we\u2019ll continue to align with the pace of transition and through \u201825, we\u2019ll see over $4 billion of low-carbon opportunities. When you step back from all of this, we believe the two-pronged strategy approach makes even more sense today where energy security is back in the spotlight and where demands are conventional and low-carbon energy supplies will continue to rise. We\u2019re on track to put US$1.2 billion into service this year, that\u2019s on top of the US$2.4 billion last year. And along with our solar self-power projects, we\u2019re lowering emissions. We all know what\u2019s happening with global gas prices, but it\u2019s not pretty for U.S. Northeast consumers either with gas prices at roughly 5x Henry Hub. This situation screams for more infrastructure, especially given increased supply variability from offshore wind that\u2019s coming and more displacement of coal, of course. Building greenfield is tough sledding, of course, these days, but these expansions are executable and cost effective, and there\u2019s more we can do. Plaquemines LNG is now fully contracted and likely going ahead, which will drive $400 million on our Venice Extension project, not in the secured category yet, but we expect it to be shortly. In fact, earlier this week, we saw NextDecade granted a 15-year SPA with ENGIE to support Rio Grande, seeing good momentum then here with both projects potentially reaching FID later this year. You\u2019ve got a world-class liquids-rich resource base that rivals the Marcellus and Haynesville, and operators have done every bit as good job, unlocking reserves. LNG breakevens in Canada at roughly $6 to $8 an MMbtu rivals the U.S. Gulf Coast and looks very favorable if you look at these Asian LNG prices, somewhere in the order of $30 an MMbtu in Q1. Once they reach FID, we\u2019ll need to create new capacity to replace volumes currently moving south. And depending on Woodfibre\u2019s FID timing, we\u2019re targeting a binding open season on T-South for later this year. Now, for either of these to move forward, we\u2019ll need to see a clear path to execution with strong local community support and commercial underpinning. Seasonally, we\u2019ll see a more concentrated maintenance season in Q2 than we usually do, offset by stronger volumes in the back end of the year. But, as we\u2019ve said, we\u2019ll need to see an appropriate return, given the risks we manage under that model. Given it\u2019s often challenging to come to consensus, we\u2019re preparing a cost of service filing, which is a very good alternative for us. In total, we\u2019ve got roughly 400,000 barrels per day of egress opportunity on the Mainline and Express. Downstream, we\u2019re continuing to develop the Houston terminal opportunities. And since we acquired Ingleside, we\u2019ve seen increasing interest on several fronts, which is already proving out the upside. On conventional, we\u2019re progressing a 2 million-barrel storage expansion. There\u2019s also potential emerging for NGL exports, and stay tuned for more on that over the next while. As you saw today, we\u2019re also now developing an integrated solution for blue hydrogen and ammonia production with Humble Oil. So, we\u2019re now validating the geology. Another positive was the federal government\u2019s investment tax credit, 50% on capture and 37.5% on transportation and storage. So, the utility continues to generate about $1 billion to $1.5 billion of ratable annual investment, so it\u2019s a great business and a real gem in our portfolio. We had a strong quarter, exceeding our resource target, so that\u2019s good to see. As you saw earlier, we\u2019re installing turbines at Saint Nazaire, and we\u2019re in the fabrication phase at F\u00e9camp and preconstruction at Calvados and Provence Grand Large. Before I pass it over to Vern, as you heard, we\u2019re seeing lots of positive fundamentals right now, and I\u2019ve covered a variety of opportunities on both, the conventional and low-carbon front. So, he\u2019s going to remind you about our framework and discipline around putting free cash flow to work and maximizing value. In liquids, the Mainline moved about 3 million barrels per day in Q1, up 9% year-over-year, taking advantage of the additional capacity from Line 3. As a reminder, until we finalize the tolling for the Mainline, we\u2019ll be including a provision in our results for that segment. So, it\u2019s been a very solid start to the year. With the strong first quarter, we\u2019re confident we\u2019re on track to achieve full year guidance. Our systems are expected to continue to be highly utilized, including the Mainline, which is on track for 2.95 million barrels per day on average for the year. We\u2019re expecting Energy Services results in Q2 to be comparable to Q1, a slight headwind for the year. Our secured capital has been largely contracted for 2022, which provides good protection against capital cost increases, and we continue to manage our capital programs through active supply chain procurement and fixed price EPC contracts. So, let\u2019s move on to our capital allocation framework. Our priorities remain unchanged, and we\u2019re making good progress in all fronts. That\u2019s the model going forward, ratable dividend growth supplemented where it makes sense with share buybacks. We expect between $3 billion to $4 billion will be deployed to low multiple organic expansions and system optimizations, along with utility rate base and modernization capital in gas transmission. That leaves about $2 billion per year available for more organic growth, asset acquisitions, share buybacks or debt repayment. While we review all of these options as we go through the year to ensure that we continue to maximize shareholder returns, all of these options will need to meet our low-risk business model, exceed risk-adjusted hurdle rates, have a strong strategic fit and align with our emission reduction goals. As always, we will continuously evaluate options to recycle capital where appropriate, to supplement the $5 billion to $6 billion of annual investment capacity. So, let\u2019s move to that. Today, our secured capital program sits at just over $10 billion. And as you just heard now, we\u2019re advancing a number of exciting opportunities across all of our businesses. Before I turn it back to Al, let me spend a minute on how we\u2019re advancing our ESG priorities. We\u2019re making good progress on the emission targets we set in late 2020, and we continue to challenge ourselves to do better. With that, I\u2019m going to turn it back to Al. Finally, we\u2019ll continue to take a disciplined approach and not compromise our low-risk business model. And taken together, we think this provides a great opportunity to grow the business and a solid value proposition for our investors. If I can ask first about the capital allocation priorities for that $2 billion and clearly in the first quarter and you showed that there\u2019s -- it\u2019s not either or, and there\u2019s a number of things going on. But I\u2019m just wondering with some of the changes in the environment, whether that\u2019s the energy security opportunities, energy transition, as well as the higher share price. It\u2019s a good question to start, Robert. Well, first of all, as you heard through those remarks, I think there\u2019s been definitely a positive shift in the fundamentals. Discipline\u2019s going to remain around the balance sheet, the dividend growth, and we\u2019re going to continue to really make sure that we invest wisely. So, in a nutshell, I guess, a lot more opportunity, but we\u2019ll continue to put a pretty strong filter on what we\u2019re doing, and comparing opportunities that we have to invest capital with each other. And so, that\u2019s really how we look at it, Robert, no major change right now, but certainly more opportunity ahead. I just was wondering as part of that, is there maybe a bit more of a bias to reducing debt effectively just for bringing up balance sheet capacity for new projects and a specific project, like interested to get your comment on. It\u2019s just, there\u2019s a lot of stuff going on in B.C., as you highlighted, and especially that T-South expansion\u2019s pretty big. As to the capital allocation implications there and the size of those projects, if you think about it, we\u2019re throwing off, as Vern said, a lot of free cash flow right now, and we will continue to do that over the next 2 to 3 years. So, the projects that we\u2019re talking about are certainly not cash consuming, and let\u2019s just say, in the next couple of years in any material way. So, in a way to get back to your original point, you\u2019re sort of building up some excess capacity here while those projects will come to fruition in the next two, three, four years, capital spending-wise. As far as the balance sheet, Vern can expand on this, but essentially, we\u2019re in very good shape right now. I think, we\u2019ve been pretty clear about the 4.5 to 5. And as we said, we\u2019ll be near the bottom of the range by the end of this year. And going back to what I just said, it\u2019s possible that with free cash flow, the way it is that we could pop below that 4.5 in the next little while. So, in effect, we\u2019ll be building up some capacity for that. Well, I\u2019m going to start and then we\u2019ll get Colin to provide some more details. And just broadly speaking in this region, Jeremy, we\u2019ve got a big gas header along the Gulf. So, it\u2019s naturally helpful for us to grow from this area. So, that\u2019s sort of the big picture here. So, that\u2019s the background in context of how we\u2019re thinking about the region generally. So, think about this project probably with a capital cost of $2 billion to $3 billion. We\u2019re JV-ing, so we have half of that. In terms of commercial construct, of course, we\u2019d like to term this out under a take-or-pay type arrangement. And we\u2019ll be jointly marketing the facilities with our partner, I think, European fertilizer companies, domestic and European power gen with respect to hydrogen. So, that\u2019s the formula and model we\u2019re looking for here. Trans Mountain, there\u2019s delays. So, there\u2019s headwinds there, uncertainty there. But, at the same time, even with oil at $100, we haven\u2019t really seen material FIDs out of the WCSB. I\u2019ll start again, Jeremy. So, maybe I\u2019ll start this way. So, I think fundamentally, we\u2019re very positive on that part. Obviously, we\u2019ve got very high prices right now. We don\u2019t need $100 oil for that to happen, but certainly, clarity on where it\u2019s going longer term. They\u2019re going to be looking at capital efficient solutions, debottlenecking first. And that\u2019s where we come in, which, as we alluded to in the remarks, the Mainline is extremely well positioned for this. The Mainline tolling agreement actually will be important in that we need to see clarity on the commercial underpinning for those projects that we have in the queue here, which Colin can get to, but we need some clarity on that in order for us to continue to incrementally expand. And again, in this environment, incremental expansion, optimizations on the system are ideally suited, I think, for where the basin is and what these producers need to see in order to invest additional capital. So, the basin generally will be probably behind in its ability to react to increasing prices here as we\u2019ve seen compared to, say, the Permian just because of the nature of what we\u2019re talking about in the oil sands, longer-dated investment profiles. So, we\u2019re keeping our Mainline expansion opportunities, ready to go here and advancing long-lead items, enable them to be there. We believe industry will continue to want some egress or some insurance egress having not had any for decades, and we\u2019ll potentially leave that into any commercial arrangement we negotiate here. The timing of those will have to be TBD, but we\u2019re keeping the warm, Jeremy. In the bigger picture here, again, if you think about it, we\u2019ve got what would be two nice pathways through to the Gulf Coast, and that will continue to be an extremely strong market. The thing that\u2019s happened recently here in terms of the security buffer that we\u2019ve been talking about is the export position that we have relative to those two paths, I think it\u2019s going to be ideal in terms of the longer-term future of heavy oil coming out of Western Canada. But now we\u2019ve got this additional opportunity to really generate greater exports out of that region, too. I\u2019ll go quickly, and then Cynthia will chime in. So, that\u2019s the binding open season we\u2019re talking about. So, when those 300 million cubes a day move to Woodfibre, then we\u2019re going to need to come in with some additional supplies. So, that\u2019s why we\u2019ll really have that opportunity to expand T-South when that happens. Well, I think, again, I\u2019ll go first. On the west, I mean, this is really the crux of the advantage, I think here in this particular case, whether you look at the community aspects of building your infrastructure and obviously the indigenous groups that are along the right of way. The fact that we\u2019ve been there for so long, the fact that we have good relationships and the fact that in this particular situation we\u2019re not doing a lot of looping or twining of pipelines here. So, I think in this case, we\u2019re in pretty good position to expand the T-South system, certainly that goes for T-North as well. So, it\u2019s something we can manage. So, I think we\u2019re in reasonable shape these days, as far as you can be in a tough environment, permitting wise and in an inflationary setting. The challenges that everyone is facing, it\u2019s not just in B.C., as we know. On the Ingleside facility, I just wanted to get an update in terms of the interest you\u2019re seeing from customers to potentially export NGLs from this facility. Colin, do you want to take that? We\u2019re looking at various forms of purity, NGL export out of Ingleside. Won\u2019t be too specific, but we\u2019d be sourcing them locally obviously. So, I think I\u2019ll just leave it there for now. So, we\u2019re continuing to have those conversations with the key players or key customers to figure out the best path forward to serve the incremental needs. I\u2019m wondering, if you can discuss, if there\u2019s been, if you feel there\u2019s an understanding by policy makers, especially in the U.S. for the need to get permitting, moving in order to build the infrastructure that\u2019s required to deal with this energy crisis. And just being honest there, there\u2019s a myriad of issues, of course. You\u2019ve got federal versus state jurisdictions, and quite a complex array of permitting agencies and approvals that are required. And so, we\u2019re hopeful. I will add too though that you really have to be skilled in this area these days, regardless of the policy issues that you\u2019re alluding to. In the context of changes in global flows of crude and the Russian production and exports on the crude side currently seems to be rerouted, but certainly some long term uncertainty there, coupled with Mexico\u2019s publicly expressed intention to consume more and more of their domestic production, which is heavy sour in nature. And how Russian volumes get reabsorbed and how flows realign and change, I think that\u2019s yet to be determined. But as I alluded to in the remarks, it\u2019s pretty clear that -- and I\u2019m going to say North America here because well, Canada and the U.S. because of the integrated nature of our systems here in North America, really are in position to fill this gap. I know you didn\u2019t mention gas, but that\u2019s part of it as well. So, we\u2019re probably a little bit early to figure out exactly where the flows get realigned. But for sure, we\u2019re in pretty good position. So, the point you\u2019re making is being alive and well for a while. And I think the points you\u2019re making now even accentuate competitiveness of Canadian crude, and that you didn\u2019t mention Venezuela, but that\u2019s been a structural factor in decline as well into the Gulf. And as Al mentioned, we\u2019re looking at another path down through Cushing as well, all feeding the same phenomenon. We\u2019re taking contracting, our firm service off the table. So, I think we\u2019re probably looking there at about $750 million, Theresa, and probably trending up. Colin, do you want to take that? I think, Al mentioned this more broadly earlier, I think policymakers all around, certain both sides of the boarder, fully get the importance of keeping existing infrastructure flowing, especially in light of recent events globally. So, that\u2019s all encouraging. So, that\u2019s the latest there, Linda. It\u2019s -- Colin is right about the Canadian government\u2019s activity and involvement here, which has been very strong. But, it\u2019s also state governments in the surrounding region of both, Michigan and Wisconsin, who certainly get the criticality of this infrastructure to their states and consumers in the region. So, that\u2019s helped, too. And just sticking in the region, there\u2019s an Ontario provincial election coming up. We\u2019ve been working with the government on a number of initiatives, whether that says we\u2019re looking at funding in RNG or hydrogen. Looking through your slides, so there\u2019s a number of chunky projects, $1 billion to $2 billion, and you guide in the B.C. There may be -- yes, I mean, it\u2019s always possible that that number rises, but on the other hand, I think that the important thing is how we filter the number and ensure that we maintain the discipline that we have been focused on here over the last number of years. So, yes, the hopper may be larger, but we\u2019re going to be very careful about how much we deploy, which has generally been constrained to the amount of free cash availability that we have to invest. I think we talked about this very -- quite a bit at our Investor Day in December, and there\u2019s really no change. So, we\u2019re going to go through and make sure that the highest and most attractive projects get done first. And then, if we have too many opportunities, that\u2019s fortunate some of these won\u2019t just proceed. So, Ridgeline, we\u2019re continuing to progress with that. So, I think that\u2019s the order that needs to happen. I mean, this is -- one of the things we\u2019re talking about with the customers, Colin and his team are in that. Like you said, we\u2019re ready to go on these. And I think it will be really important to provide some additional capacity here given the opportunity that\u2019s in front of the basin in terms of where we\u2019re at fundamentally, which is what we\u2019ve been talking about a lot on the call, very positive. Brian, it\u2019s Colin again. And so, it\u2019s likely those would be considered or concluded together. The downstream legs of that path would be contracted though, maybe that\u2019s your question, whereas the capacity on the Mainline would potentially be more open access, so, but likely to come together all at once. But just curious if you could just talk about how the relationships with DCP and PSX and in addition to the new cracker in the region could ultimately drive success for the projects and ultimately, whether Enbridge were considering JV-ing with the project around NGL\u2026\n I think, this is back to you, Colin. I don\u2019t have specifics here, but yes, we do have obviously a great relationship with the parties you mentioned, and they\u2019ll be in the mix here, Brian."
