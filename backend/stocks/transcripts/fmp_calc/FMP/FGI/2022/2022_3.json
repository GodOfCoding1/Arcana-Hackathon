    "content": " We remain encouraged by our key organic growth programs as evidenced by the continued strong growth in our other product categories during the quarter, which includes our Jetcoat Shower systems and covered bridge custom kitchen cabinetry business. Strong growth in our newer higher margin product lines, continued pricing momentum, and a reduction in the freight costs combined to drive the strong margin performance, with gross margins quickly returning to levels witnessed prior to the supply chain disruptions just over a year ago. End market demand trends held up relatively well across our key product categories during the third quarter, but the inventory destocking weighed on our revenue trends with total revenue decreasing by 24% on year-over-year basis. Revenue totaled $38.5 million during the third quarter 2022, a decrease of 24% compared to the prior year due to volume freight air costs primarily by inventory destocking as well as weakness in the bath furniture market. Gross profit was $8 million during the third quarter 2022, a decrease of 1% compared to prior year period as the revenue decline was largely offset by significantly improved gross margins, which improved to 20.9% during the quarter, up 490 basis points from 16% in the prior year period. The improvement in our gross margin percentage is primarily attributable to solid growth in higher margin product such as the shower system and kitchen cabinetry, continued pricing gains and a reduction in freight costs versus the elevated labor experienced last year."
