    "content": " I will provide more specifics later in my comments but we further ramped key new products programs, expanded existing product categories and launched several brand initiatives during 2022 which should enable us to gain market share, expand our market penetration and drive strong organic growth in the coming quarters and years. Revenue totaled $31.8 million during the first quarter of 2022, a decrease of 39% compared to prior year due primarily to ongoing inventory destocking as well as some softening in customer demand. Gross profit was $7.5 million during the first quarter of 2022, basically flat from last year as the significant progress we made on our margin recovery initiatives largely offset the revenue decline. Excluding $0.3 million in charge during the fourth quarter of 2022, adjusted operating income was $1.3 million, up $0.6 million or 89% from the prior year, driven by the improved gross margin performance and lower selling and distribution expenses, partially offset by the lower revenue. GAAP net income was $0.7 million or $0.07 per diluted share during the fourth quarter of 2022, down from $1 million or $0.15 in the same period last year excluding onetime items in both periods."
