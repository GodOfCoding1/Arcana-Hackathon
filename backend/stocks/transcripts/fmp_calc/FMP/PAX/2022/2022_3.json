    "content": " Now we turn to 24 months after that to today, I think investors are a lot more positive about Brazil and because also on a relative basis, from then 24 months ago to today, I think Mr. Bolsonaro came back and had a more positive stance on COVID, the economy is open again and comes the war and with the Ukraine and the region doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have any geopolitical risks, et cetera, everything that we said over the call, and you did see how the markets reacted to all of this very positively. Number one, next closing is on private equity fund VI and infra fund V. private equity fund VI, we did a couple of closings, I think two or three closings during the third quarter with Brazilian clients, Latin clients and outside of Latin America clients, mainly U.S. And I think as we do the divestments in the fourth quarter, mainly from our infrastructure funds and our private equity funds, I think we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re hitting a very good exchange rates to take the money out and give back U.S. dollars to our investors at BRL5.20, BRL5.14. We should finish the year with BRL1.5 billion, 12 months, 2022, BRL1.5 billion, right on target with where we gave you the expectation that we would commit $1.5 billion from our long-tailed close and funds, private equity and infrastructure."
