    "content": " But that being said, as Jimmy mentioned in the prepared remarks, our focus for fiscal '23 is going to be in terms of capturing first-time guests in this sort of environment, it's only natural that people are going to reduce the frequency of their out-of-home dining occasions, and we've been able to remain one of them for -- remain a dining occasion for our guests. We were very fortunate this year on the wage inflation or in this quarter as we also said in the prepared remarks, I think with the price increases as well as the three initiatives, the technological initiatives that we implemented, which we've mentioned, give us about 50 basis points to 60 basis points of labor leverage. It's going to be more -- we're optimizing -- we're always optimizing our marketing efforts, and we'll be able to reallocate some of those savings towards that targeted marketing, which goes very far in terms of the effectiveness on a dollar basis, and so that would be a high level. But between that and shifting to broad liner and really just looking at all of our contracts, and this is something that I'm doing with G&A, but also I'm asking the purchasing department to do it for our food purchases as well, and I think that there's opportunities to go back to our suppliers and leverage the growth that we're going to be seeing over the next few years. And if we can maybe get into some a little bit longer contracts with some people, where we promise them the growth -- same sort of growth that we're promising out to the street right now, and they can see that there's an opportunity for them to make a lot of money in the future, I think we can leverage some better pricing."
