And as Jimmy mentioned during the opening remarks, I've been sort of alluding to this in past calls, but we are working with DC Comics and that's going to be our first really major mainstream American property and I'm tremendously excited for that. Please proceed with your question. We've been seeing this sort of \u00e2\u0080\u0093 this tremendous growth for the last year or two, but we're really happy to have this ongoing growth for the rewards members. Please proceed with your question. As Jimmy mentioned in the prepared remarks, we have nine restaurants under construction and nine more executed leases, and we need to continue to add that pipeline and we want to make sure that we have the right teams in place in order to keep it as robust as we need it to be in order to continue the growth pattern that we've seen in the number of units and then the other area that we just talked about is regional management. Please proceed with your question. We hired our first Chief Development Officer, who's opened thousands of units, and we aggressively signed leases in places that we would've otherwise been inaccessible to us at that point, like, Westfield, but because we have one to two hour dinner lines, we're great tenants now. Please proceed with your question. Please proceed with your question."
