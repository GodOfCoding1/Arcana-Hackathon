    "content": " The sales momentum we discussed in the previous earnings calls have continued into the new fiscal year, resulting in Q1 comparable sales growth of 19.9% as compared to the pre-pandemic fiscal first quarter 2020. Turning to cost, food and beverage costs as a percentage of sales were 30%, compared to 32.4% in the prior year quarter, due to pricing taken at the start of the quarter and largely normalized performance as sales volume improved. Suffice it to say, we\u2019re very encouraged by, being at 19.5%, only 50 basis points from our historical peak annual margin and what is typically in Q1 a lighter seasonal sales quarter."
