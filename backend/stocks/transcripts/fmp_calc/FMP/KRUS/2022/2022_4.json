    "content": " We continue to see strong sales performance in our fourth quarter with sales of $42 million, a 50% growth over the prior year of $27.9 million, and comparable sales growth of 27.6% as compared to the prior year period. We are exceptionally proud to say that our comparable sales gains are not being driven fully by pricing, and we have seen no discernable traffic growth and demonstrated by the previous mentioned 14.6% of year-over-year profit growth in our fiscal fourth quarter. While this 30.7% figure is still very strong from historical perspective, it was nothing that we saw a 100 basis points increase in COGS relative to our fiscal third quarter due to commodity inflation, which we were not able to fully offset by pricing. Food and beverage costs as a percentage of sales were 30.7% as compared to 30.8% in the prior year quarter due to pricing taken over the course of fiscal year 2022, largely offset by food cost inflation. On an adjusted basis, net income in the fiscal fourth quarter was $2.1 million or $0.21 per diluted share compared to the prior year quarter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s net loss of $1.4 million or negative $0.15 per diluted share."
