    "content": " The renewed sales momentum in the back half of our fiscal second quarter is still going strong with March revenue of $12.5 million, representing month-over-month sequential growth of 22% over February and the new monthly sales record for the Company. Food and beverage costs as a percentage of sales were 30% compared to 35% in the prior year quarter due to pricing taken at the start of the fiscal first quarter, partially offset by food cost inflation and largely normalized performance as sales volume improved. As a reminder, our full year guidance is as follows: We expect total sales between $130 million and $140 million; we expect general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales of approximately 17%; and we expect the opening of 8 to 10 new units with net capital expenditures per unit of $2.1 million."
