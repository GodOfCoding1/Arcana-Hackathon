    "content": " Further, we, as a company anticipate being able to use our platform to position ourselves for the potential obsolescence of our antibodies and believe that what is most important about Invivyd is the expected productivity and efficiency of our overall discovery and development platform rather than the particulars of any one single antibody developed going forward. This reengineering is an important subtlety, as our ability to evolve in Adintrevimab to rescue its activity against Omicron and its sub lineages with relatively few amino acid changes, supports our founding hypothesis, that there are indeed sites on the SARS-COV2 RBD that one can target with a monoclonal or multiple monoclonal and exert broad neutralization before through emerging variants of concern, as well as backwards to prior SARS-COV2 variants, and even more divergent for beta viruses such as SARS-COV2. As David mentioned, our plan is to utilize our integrated discovery platform against the threat of ongoing SARS-COV2 viral evolution, with ongoing novel antibody discovery and engineering, as well as to develop a best in class suite of early stage candidate antibodies that anticipate potential emerging variants. Further, as many of you have dealt with -- the FDA has routinely stopped distribution of antibodies under  based on neutralization potency against changing viral variants, without corresponding clinical data, or evade data represent the first data from a prospective controlled clinical trial of a monoclonal antibody against COVID-19 which provides consideration that a reverse pathway using neutralizing titers has the potential to be a correlative protection."
