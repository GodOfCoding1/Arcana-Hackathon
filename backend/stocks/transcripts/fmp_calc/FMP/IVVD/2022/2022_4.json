    "content": " Forward-looking statements include statements concerning, among other things, the future of the COVID-19 landscape including the expectation of its continued evolution and emergence of new variants and sub-variants, our ongoing research and clinical development plans, including the timing of these plans as well as the technology and resources to develop therapeutic or preventative options for COVID-19 and other infectious diseases our regulatory and commercialization plans and opportunities and our expected cash runway and other statements that are not historical fact. While the bad news is, there are no monoclonal antibodies available for treatment or prevention and an ongoing high burden of disease, the good news is we believe Invivyd uniquely positioned to respond to this need, having generated a pipeline of multiple next-generation engineered antibody candidates for COVID-19 designed to keep pace with viral evolution. And adintrevimab has a robust safety data package and has demonstrated clinically meaningful results in global Phase 3 clinical trials for both the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 during the Delta and Omicron BA.1 waves of SARS-CoV-2, but subsequently lost in-vitro activity against Omicron BA.2. On December 15, 2022, and a joint EMA, FDA workshop entitled, efficacy of monoclonal antibodies in the context of rapidly evolving SARS-CoV-2 variants was held to discuss alternative strategies for the development of novel mAb therapies, including those based on prototype products that have demonstrated safety and efficacy in clinical trials."
