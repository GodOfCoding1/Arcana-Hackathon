    "content": " At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Russell Johnson, Vice President, Treasurer and Investor Relations. Good morning, and welcome to 3D Systems' Third Quarter 2022 Conference Call. With me on today's call are Dr. Jeffrey Graves, President and Chief Executive Officer; Michael Turner, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Andrew Johnson, Executive Vice President and Chief Legal Officer. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in last night's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. In our press release and slides accompanying this webcast, which are both available on our Investor Relations website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. I'll open this morning with a few comments on the current business climate, our position in the markets and a summary of our Q3 performance. After that, I'll turn the call over to our new CFO, Michael Turner, for a more detailed review of our third quarter results. While these macro headwinds are negatively impacting many companies, the good news for our industry is that customers are increasingly adopting additive manufacturing in their production operations in order to reduce supply chain risks, enhance product design flexibility and reduce manufacturing costs. For 3D Systems specifically, we benefited this year from our prior efforts to focus and streamline the company while significantly strengthening our balance sheet. This has allowed us to make important investments in new technology platforms and in operational efficiency initiatives, which are already showing results. Our customers are confident that once recession fears subside, we will emerge from this period stronger than ever with a completely refreshed product lineup and efficient operational footprint and the scale needed to support their growth. In the meantime, we're focusing intently on execution, profitability and cash performance, which is what our customers and our shareholders expect from an industry leader. On behalf of my nearly 2,000 dedicated 3D Systems colleagues around the world, as we finished out the year and look ahead to 2023, I can tell you that we're proud of our leadership role in the additive industry and very confident about the future. Reflecting on our third quarter, we delivered results that were basically in line with our internal expectations and, in some areas, exceeded them. We're taking pricing actions, where possible, to offset these pressures, but there's typically a lag effect that can put a drag on quarterly performance. With regard to our in-sourcing of manufacturing, I'm very pleased with the progress we've made in our Rock Hill, South Carolina production facility, which we took over mid-quarter from a contract manufacturer. In the third quarter, we were pleased to see our production rates increase, our productivity improve and our gross margins begin to expand as the workforce transition to 3D Systems management. For us, this impacts our dental markets and particularly, our orthodontic products. While this is still a great business that we're fully committed to, key customers have slowed their spending, which, while largely anticipated in our previous guidance, can clearly be seen in our financials. Fortunately, we expect this business to strengthen once the economy normalizes, but this may take some time. More to come on our market dynamics in a few moments, but for now, I want to give you a clear understanding of our position in the industry and how our business model works in this volatile climate. As additive manufacturing and production environments becomes widespread, we're very well positioned to enable rapid adoption across virtually all market verticals. With over 20,000 production printers active in the field, consuming almost 5,000 tons of our proprietary materials each year, our customers produce over 1 million parts every day using our technology. This output is greater than the entire rest of the industry combined, giving us unparalleled experience in the management of large fleets of printers and in the integration of complex workflows in our customers' factories around the world. Second, over the last 2.5 years, we've reorganized and restructured our company into 2 market-facing business units, Industrial Solutions and Healthcare Solutions. This enables us to focus on market-specific applications, developing with our customers the most effective manufacturing workflows and then supporting the transfer of these technologies into their factories. This approach has proven highly effective, and we believe it will drive exciting growth for our company in the years ahead. This operational model is one that we increasingly see mimicked by others around our industry, but the key to success is having a full complement of metal and polymer printing technologies supported by software expertise and a wide range of production materials. It is the combination of these elements, to address specific high-value applications, that our customers are looking for in a partner. Today, at 3D Systems, our core technology span, not only the broadest range of metal and polymer systems in the industry, but now also include the unique materials and printing systems that I broadly refer to as biologics. When viewed in total, this unique combination of technologies and application expertise in a company with global scale allows us to assume a leadership position in the additive industry as we now enter true production environments. For the consolidated company, after adjusting for businesses that we divested during 2021, revenue for the third quarter decreased 3.2% year-over-year. However, adjusting for the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, consolidated revenue increased 2.7%, showing the significant negative impact of the strong U.S. dollar. While this growth rate is much lower than we would like, we fully expect to meet our long-term expectations of double-digit organic growth in the years ahead, as consumer spending rebounds and additive manufacturing takes hold in production environments across virtually all market segments. Revenue for our Healthcare Solutions segment decreased 6.6% per year and decreased 3.5% in constant currency, driven by a substantial slowing of our Dental segment due to softer consumer spending. As we saw last quarter, the FX impact on our Industrial Solutions segment was most pronounced due to that segment's exposure to manufacturers and service bureau customers in Europe and Asia Pacific. With that said, the currency impact on Healthcare Solutions sales was also material. In our Industrial Solutions business, we saw regional variations in the third quarter. This is impactful given our Industrial Solutions segment's historically strong market presence in Europe and particularly, in Germany. On the positive side, demand in the Americas remained robust during the third quarter and with strong SLA printer sales into the energy and commercial space verticals. In our Healthcare Solutions business, the third quarter performance varied sharply by market. In our Medical Devices business, we saw significant year-over-year growth in printer sales to customers who manufacture orthopedic and surgical instrumentation. And our industry-leading business of providing virtual surgical planning packages and other personalized health care solutions for doctors, surgeons and hospitals had a strong quarter as well. Within that strong market, 3D system stands out for best-in-class suite of products, strong regulatory infrastructure and our years of experience using additive manufacturing solutions to improve patient outcomes. However, the biggest factor for our Healthcare Solutions business during the quarter was a significant year-over-year decline in dental market sales, particularly in the orthodontic area. And our general results for the third quarter, while disappointing, were roughly in line with our expectations. So despite these ups and downs, we believe we now have good visibility into our broad business performance for the remainder of this year. This is why, as Michael will describe for you in a moment, we're updating our full year 2022 guidance to significantly tighten our revenue range while improving the forecast for operating expenses to reflect strong execution and cost controls. These are not only interesting in isolation, but they also provide valuable insights into the type of core activities that will drive our company's growth in the next 5 years. As I described for you on our last quarter's call, we agreed during the third quarter to acquire dp polar, the Germany-based developer of the industry's first additive manufacturing system designed for true high-speed mass production of customized components. The machine's continuously rotating build platform can print jetted polymer parts up to 5x faster than today's batch process systems, which represents a quantum leap toward true mass production of custom componentry using additive manufacturing. If any of you are planning to be at the upcoming Form Next Trade Show in November, I strongly encourage you to visit the dp polar booth and see this exciting new system for yourself. With our metal printing portfolio, we continue to leverage the unique capabilities of our applications innovation group, along with our strong lineup of metal printing technologies, to drive solution sales to customers in both industrial and health care segments. Our technological advantage is primarily in our atmosphere control system, which is the industry's best for the manufacture of reactive metals such as titanium, nickel and refractory metal alloys. We've been very successful recently with customers in commercial space and medical devices, both of which are extremely well suited to our technology and the type of application-focused customer-specific printing solutions in which 3D Systems is long specialized. During the third quarter, we also announced several significant additions to our Materials portfolio. On the polymer side, we introduced 2 new production-grade materials, tough clear for our Figure 4 projection-based printing platforms, and DuraForm Pax Black for SLS printer line. On the metals front, we introduced new copper nickel alloy, , which is now certified for use on all of our DMP metal printing solutions. However, it's an ideal material for extremely demanding applications in marine systems; chemical processing plants; oil and gas; and of course, rocketry. Turning to Slide 8, and before I hand off to Michael, I want to highlight the tremendous progress we're making on one of my most important goals for 3D Systems, namely the creation of a world-class regenerative medicine business. As I've shared with you previously, our efforts in this area are currently proceeding along 3 primary lines: first, through a long-standing partnership with our biotechnology partner, United Therapeutics. We've achieved remarkable progress toward our goal of 3D printing functional human organs for transplantation, initially targeting lungs, but now with an expanded scope, including livers and kidneys. Second, building on the organ program's technological progress, we've expanded into the adjacent field of printing non-organ human tissue for transplantation and surgical reconstruction applications. In this case, we're leveraging our expertise in creating vascularized human tissue and combining this capability with our polymer printing expertise to develop and manufacture highly differentiated organs on chips for use in drug discovery and development by the pharmaceutical industry. During the third quarter, we marked a major milestone in this initiative with our announcement of the formation of a new wholly-owned biotech company called Systemic Bio. We've committed to support Systemic Bio with an initial seed investment of $15 million, which should sustain the company until it reaches a material level of revenue and profitability. Due to the unique value of the printed products themselves and the sensitivity of this novel technology platform, Systemic Bio will not sell printers and materials, rather it will work with customers to develop organ and disease-specific human models for organs on chips, and then we'll market those chips directly to pharmaceutical and biotech companies engaged in drug discovery. To support the business model, Systemic Bio has invented a novel patent-print pending organ-on-a-chip platform which we call HVIOS. We're producing HVIOS chips daily at our state-of-the-art laboratory in Houston, Texas, where they're being tested by our systemic bios team of scientists to validate their use for modeling specific organ and disease functions in collaboration with key pharma customers. Let me emphasize what differentiates Systemic Bio's technological approach from those in the market today and therefore, why we're so excited about this new business. The 3D bioprinted fully integrated vasculature contained within 3D -- within Systemic Bio's HVIOS chip can closely mimic human organ structures, allowing for active perfusion of blood through the tissue sample, as shown in the lower left image, where you can see blood throw -- flow through the printed structure. You can see the success of this approach in the lower right-hand image on Slide 9, with the green regions being human cells that have thrived in this printed tissue sample for over 28 days. For evaluation using this technology, we believe that the drug development cycle can be shortened, success rates enhanced and the use of animal testing ultimately eliminated over time. From a financial standpoint, our goal is to establish key contracts with the pharmaceutical industry companies over the next year to affirm the technology and incorporate it into drug development protocols. Needless to say, I'm tremendously excited about the potential of this new business, and I'm driving to see early customer validation of our technology. Investors in our company should note that we believe Systemic Bio, given its highly advanced bioprinting and biomaterial capabilities and its business model of selling proprietary, HVIOS chips rather than printing technology, has the potential to achieve profit margins more like a biotech company than a manufacturing technology supplier. Based upon early customer feedback, I believe Systemic Bio could be a $100 million revenue company within 5 years. I'm confident that we'll announce the first agreement with a major pharmaceutical company in the near future, and we look forward to sharing the progress with you. Before I turn the call over to Michael, I'd like to close my remarks by turning to Slide 10 to highlight our software business. 3D Systems has long been an innovator in 3D printing software, offering specialized applications such as Geomagic, 3D Sprint and 3D Experts. We advanced that position significantly in late 2021 by acquiring Oqton, a leading provider of software solutions to utilize AI and machine learning to help manufacturers intelligently automate their entire digital production workflows. The combined suite of Oqton and 3D system software provides, by far, the most complete and feature-rich software offering in the additive industry today, as shown in the comparison table on Slide 10. While customers themselves can put together point solutions for each feature, an approach commonly called do-it-yourself, or DIY, they're hesitant to do so given the cost and complexity of the approach. As just one example of our development road map, optimism partnership discussions with major manufacturing partners that would include joint development of new software functionality in part identification, e-commerce and cataloging. Most importantly, the new integrated Oqton suite of applications not only leads the industry, it has the potential to become a key enabler of true serial scale additive manufacturing that can make an impact on our entire industry. For this reason, we have opened Oqton's availability to the entire additive manufacturing industry. This includes all elements of the new Oqton platform, including the historical 3D Systems printing software, as we believe it will have a tremendous impact on the acceptance of additive manufacturing broadly. To facilitate industry-wide adoption, the Oqton business is run as a stand-alone operation with a high priority on protection of user sensitive data, including externally audited firewalls to ensure security and confidentiality. With this approach, Oqton is gaining traction every day and now has customer wins in the automotive, aerospace, contract manufacturing, health care and dental markets. With growth potential ranging from double to triple digits, we're very excited about the future of this software platform. And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Michael to review our third quarter financial results. Before I start, I'd like to remind everyone that 3D Systems made 3 significant divestitures in 2021. The earnings release that we issued last night contains tables with non-GAAP measures relating to our 2021 results, from which we excluded the impact of the 2021 divested businesses. Likewise, on today's call, any reference that I'll make to our 2021 results will be on that same ex divestiture basis. As Jeff discussed, our revenue results for the quarter were generally in line with our expectations with some bright spots in certain areas that we will highlight to you this morning. As we saw last quarter, the overall business environment during the third quarter remained challenging due to continued FX headwinds, inflationary pressures, recessionary fears, persistent supply chain challenges and geopolitical tensions. However, the biggest headwind we faced during the quarter, which we expected and called out in our revised Q2 guidance, was a significant year-over-year decline in revenues from dental market customers. Revenue for the third quarter was $132.3 million, a decrease of 15.3% versus the prior year. Excluding divestitures and the unfavorable impact of FX, revenue increased by 2.7% compared to the prior year. This top line growth reflects continued solid demand in both our Industrial and Healthcare segments, partially offset by weakness in dental market sales, which, as you know, represents a significant portion of our overall business. Just to quantify the impact on revenue from some of the factors I mentioned earlier, starting with FX. We experienced headwinds of over $8 million related to the sharp appreciation of the U.S. dollar that occurred during the third quarter, which reduced the U.S. dollar value of our international sales made in foreign currencies, which typically represents roughly 40% of our total sales. There may have also been some third quarter international sales that did not materialize because, in some cases, we price our overseas product offerings in U.S. dollars. And in these cases, the customer has to convert more of their local currency earnings into U.S. dollars to pay us, which represents a price increase for them and can therefore result in some lost sales. On our second quarter earnings call, we highlighted 2 additional items that had an adverse impact on our year-over-year revenue growth, one being the Russia-Ukraine conflict and the other being persistent supply chain disruptions. While our second quarter 2021 sales to Russia were relatively material, by the start of the third quarter of 2021, we had largely exited the Russia market. And as a result, our year-over-year revenue comparisons for the third quarter were much less impacted than what we saw in Q2. And on the supply chain front, you'll recall that we commented on the impact of these disruptions, including component shortages as well as inefficiencies and portions of our contract manufacturing network that caused us to get behind on supply to orders. And as a result, we estimate that we had approximately $2 million of firm customer printer orders that we're unable to ship due to supply chain delays. I'm pleased to say that this was, in large part, attributable to our decision earlier last quarter to bring one of our major outsourced printer manufacturing facilities back in-house. This has enabled us to significantly increase the rate of printer production at that facility and thereby work on our backlog of late customer orders, while also having a favorable impact on gross profit margins. And lastly, for consolidated year-to-date revenue, looking back over the first 9 months of the year, we grew revenue, excluding divestitures and the unfavorable impacts of FX, by 7.6%. Despite a very challenging operating environment, we were able to achieve year-over-year revenue growth for the first 9 months of the year in the high single digits. For our Healthcare Solutions segment, revenue, excluding divestitures and the unfavorable impact of FX, decreased by 3.5% as compared to the third quarter of the prior year, while revenue excluding divestitures and the unfavorable impact of FX in our Industrial Solutions segment increased by 9% year-over-year. High inflation, reduced consumer confidence and geopolitical factors are negatively impacting patient demand for such elective procedures, resulting in lower caseloads. At this time, we cannot say with confidence how long the weaker dental demand environment will last, given that it is so heavily dependent on how macroeconomic and other factors evolve over the coming quarters. But starting last quarter, we have incorporated this revised view into our 2022 revenue guidance. Outside of Dental, we saw a healthy growth in some of the other major business lines within our Healthcare Solutions segment, including strong sales to customers at 3D Print various types of medical devices, such as orthopedic implants and surgical guides. Additionally, our sales of virtual surgical planning and point-of-care solutions, the doctors, surgeons and hospitals grew very nicely in the third quarter. As Jeff noted, 3D Systems is recognized as a leader in the surgical planting field with the ability to combine 3D printing services, software and materials to create an integrated end-to-end surgical package in a way that our competitors cannot. Offsetting this were lower sales and automotive applications, largely because of a tough year-over-year comparison provided by some large deals in the third quarter of last year that did not repeat in the current year. As Jeff noted, we are starting to see good sales tractions with our Titan family of printers, which we acquired in 2021. Overall, both of our polymer and metal printers continue to sell well across our Industrial Solutions segment. The decrease in margins is due to multiple factors, including 2021 divestitures of noncore assets, inflationary impacts on input cost and freight and product mix changes, mostly related to selling more printers and less materials than in the prior year. I'd also like to note that while margins are down on a year-over-year basis, we have seen some sequential improvement with 190 basis point increase from Q2, driven by the full run rate impact of price increases announced earlier in the year as well as the early benefit of bringing some of our outsourced printer production back in-house during the quarter. This includes a $9 million increase in legal and other settlement costs, partially offset by decreases in expenditures due to divestitures. On a non-GAAP basis, which excludes nonrecurring charges and divestitures, operating expenses were $58.3 million as compared to $49.3 million from the same period a year ago. The higher non-GAAP operating expenses reflect spending in targeted areas to support future growth, including expenses from acquired businesses, research and development and investments in corporate infrastructure. We did, however, see some sequential improvement in operating expenses as compared to the second quarter of 2022, which reflects our efforts to tighten cost controls in response to the volatile demand conditions that we've experienced this year. Adjusted EBITDA, which is defined as non-GAAP operating profit plus depreciation, was negative $0.3 million for the third quarter of 2022 compared to $11.6 million for the third quarter of 2021. These acquisitions represent important investments by 3D Systems, and we expect to contribute significantly to our revenue growth over the coming years. However, for the time being, these acquired businesses in aggregate have yet to generate meaningful revenue for us. As a result, you should expect our adjusted EBITDA to run below our natural potential for a period of time due to the near-term expense impact of recent acquisitions. And for EPS in the third quarter, we had a fully diluted loss per share of $0.30 compared to income per share of $2.34 in the third quarter of 2021. Excluding charges for stock-based compensation expense and other nonrecurring items, as detailed in the appendix of the earnings release that we posted last night, our non-GAAP loss per share in the third quarter was $0.05 compared to non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.05 in the third quarter of the prior year. Our cash and short-term investments declined approximately $180 million since the end of 2021, driven primarily by $85 million paid for acquisitions and equity investments, cash used in operations of $52 million, capital expenditures of $17 million and other cash used in financing activities of approximately $13 million. As previously stated, we regard 2022 as an investment year, during which we will make additional targeted investments at high potential growth areas of our business and in our corporate infrastructure. While we are always willing to consider M&A opportunities as they arise, we are currently focused on integrating and growing the businesses that we have acquired over the last 1.5 years. And finally, I'll conclude my remarks on Slide 18 with an update on our full year guidance for 2022. As a reminder, we announced a reduction in our 2022 full year guidance during our second quarter earnings call. We took this step because we expect that the challenging macroeconomic and geopolitical environment to put pressure on international Industrial Solutions sales and because we believe that softer demand for elective procedures would negatively impact our Healthcare Solutions segment, particularly in the dental market. And at this point in the year, we now have improved visibility into our likely revenue and operating expenses during the fourth quarter. Based on these factors, we are updating our full year guidance to significantly tighten our expected revenue range while improving our outlook for non-GAAP operating expenses. Pulling it all together, our updated guidance for 2022 is as follows: we expect revenue to be within a range of $535 million to $545 million, we expect non-GAAP gross profit margins to remain unchanged and in the range of 39% to 41%, and we expect non-GAAP operating expenses to be in the range of $240 million to $245 million. This full year 2022 guidance assumes no significant additional changes in the macroeconomic environment that can negatively impact business demand or disrupt our supply chain, such as COVID-19, geopolitical events or continued foreign exchange volatility. Number one, we wanted to drive a real startup mentality in that business, because it is a new business, new technology going to market, it is a different customer base. And we've historically had these customer base there are the pharmaceutical companies largely, and the companies that are testing new drugs for the pharma companies. Also, Troy, it as I mentioned in passing, that business model for the business is different than the rest of the company. We think it'll drive exciting, not only revenue growth, but gross margin performance. We want real clarity on that business model works, and that the technology is proven. So we put that flag out there to say we're going to invest 15 million in this business, to get it to material revenue contribution and profitability. And beyond that, this gives us optionality to continue to invest ourselves or if we want to bring in outside parties to invest with us in that business, if the capital requirements exceed what we can comfortably do. And we're, I, the base plan is we'll put that capital in ourselves, based on the return, we would estimate for it at the time. If that business really requires, because it is a revolutionary technology, if it requires additional capital, we may at some point, entertain outside investment in it as well. So for all those reasons, we wanted to set up as a standalone business. In fact, that's just one last follow-up. Troy, as you might guess, the, with the, with everybody being concerned about where the economy is going capital spending is certainly I think being viewed by our customers are being more conservative in it, which translates to fewer printer sales broadly. And we see some sales pushed off, we see some just hesitation on customers, they want us to make sure that demand is going to be there. So in that scenario, you see materials going up new printer sales decline, the growth rate in it declining. We'll give you that guidance as we get closer, maybe on our next call, or definitely on our next call. And Paul, from a longer-term perspective, Paul, we there were investments we needed to make this year to make sure that basically our back office infrastructure could support our future growth and do so efficiently we would expect in future years to start gaining efficiencies in our G&A, if you will, our back office infrastructure. You're not only in R&D, but in G&A, if you will, to make those critical investments to gain efficiency in the future years, okay, to hit our scale, and you just need to do that. So we'll give you a much better clarity on 2023 as much as any company can, when the year finishes out, Paul. Some of them are tied to the introduction of new technology, new platforms that bring more value to customers. So that all, if there's a lag between your costs going up and cogs and your recovery and pricing. So we saw some pricing improvement in the quarter flowthrough, we expect more of that to come as we go into '23. We've been very careful about not getting out over our skis in advertising, manufacturing cost reductions, which again shows up on the cogs line, but they're real. And we saw the initial benefit as Michael mentioned in Q3 and we had only done it, we had only insourced it in about the mid quarter point. We expect it to be consistently improving, but we can't give you specific guidance, until we get to just went through up, see what the macro-economic outlook is. And then last one on pre-cash, how do we think about it to end the year, it's been, you've seen a usage here for the last four quarters, mostly on lower earnings. But, can we start to see some kind of rebound here in pre-cash as we exit the year and look forward to '23, maybe some moves to insourcing helps, I'm not sure. When people look at the details, it's a big tick up in inventory, and inventory levels and working capital. It's good inventory will burn it down over time, and that'll be a cash source for us. So in terms of free cash flow, we're really not a very capital intensive business. So cash flow operations we get a nice flow through into free cash flow, because we don't spend a lot of capital inherently on organic growth, where we would spend it are on a kind of bolt on acquisitions or other infrastructure changes, but a lot of the infrastructure changes we've already made. And we don't, we wouldn't expect that to be a big cash usage going forward. So as Michael mentioned, we exited the quarter with over $600 million in cash. But other than that, we've got a strong balance sheet and we own the assets we really need to own for the future. If you kind of look at Q3, we had roughly kind of in the range of $15 million to $20 million of outflows and cash related to the in sourcing and manufacturing, strip that out and kind of strip out all the acquisition activity that we've done instead on the face of our cash flow statement. I mean, when you look at the orthodontic business for us, if you will, have been growing strong double-digits, coming into this inflationary environment. And clearly, if you follow that segment of the market, what manufacturers of those products have said is, growth rates have declined from strong double-digit performance to more single-digits to more flattish performance all in a very rapid period of time. So, that's, I fully expect that market will rebound. But for right now, it's in the doldrums and has really declined rapidly during the year. Taking a part and kind of just like a long-term, not really '23 guidance, but just getting back to your long-term goals, gross margin of 50%. I mean, I think that we've seen the full run rate of a price increase in Q3. And in 2023, I mean, we're not going to, like I said, we're not going to comment on specifically, but I'll just say that we'll continue to monitor input costs and make price adjustments where we can. But for now, I think the run rate that you're seeing in Q3 is indicative of where we are for the near-term. If you look at what we've always said from the past, and now is there pricing opportunity on existing products is always a bit tricky, to drive that because it isn't usually a capital item for our customers, at least on the printer side, materials is a little more OpEx for customers. So an opportune time to look at pricing strategy is really when you introduce new products, and we set out at the beginning of '22 through refresh our entire product line over the next two years. So '22 and '23, most of that will happen in '23 and those are always the opportunity to set new pricing points when new products hitting the market. In terms of maybe revenue margin levers and cash flow, maybe if we take a hypothetical case, we've seen revenue compression 10%, not unreasonable in a decelerating environment. But at the same time, investors want to get some sense of comfort around where the trough and potentially margins and cash flows are. Yes, as a backdrop to that answer, Wamsi, I would tell you, it's a marvelous time to have a strong balance sheet. And we had -- because of our divestitures and our other actions in the capital markets in '21, we came into '22 with an excellent cash position, and we've maintained that cash position largely in the year. In terms of flexibility going forward, yes, you never know where the economy is going and what's going to happen on the top line and also with all the currency fluctuations. So you would expect outside of dental and maybe a few procedures that are medically oriented, unless the economy gets really bad, those procedures don't get pushed out. So in terms of revenue impact, it's anybody's guess, but certainly, there is some downside if the economy gets worse, but probably a little bit more modest than many other industries. So you can view that as, yes, we've spent a lot of money on in '22, but that's then all available to us if we need to cut back in '23. Just kind of double back on the strength of our balance sheet and capital structure, I mean, we do have enough liquidity to weather, I think certainly any near-term storm in  levers that Jeff mentioned, I think we're very well positioned. I don't know if this was included in your question, but from a labor standpoint, we're -- given that the company is healthy and we have a strong balance sheet, we've been able to attract really nice talent to the business. But in terms of attracting good labor, it's been a really good situation for us. We now need to execute with those assets, and we're focused on profitability and cash performance. I just had a question with regards to the comments you made about maybe losing some sales due to U.S. dollar strength, which I think, to some extent, plays in the pricing, obviously, given how the currency impacts some of the purchasing decisions overseas. Or just in general, what you're thinking about in terms of elasticity of demand there. So number one, we're always evaluating perfect ways to the price and assessing risk with regards to international sales. It's translated to lower U.S. dollars, and the stuff that you're traditionally pricing in U.S. dollars overseas generates a little more headwinds and may affect your pricing or it may impacted you losing sales, but it's going to have the same kind of net overall impact to us as a business. because what I'm thinking is that those on the call, including myself, are not biotech analysts. So I would say it's probably a little bit qualitative, but we will be as quantitative as we can in terms of contracts that we land. So we're -- we're in discussions with multiple pharmaceutical companies now about demonstrating the model, make sure the models work. How much financial transparency, some of it depends on how much work we want to put into the actual margin reporting on the business. So I would think we can talk about revenue growth, and we'll do as much on margins as we can because we want to be pretty transparent. And we want -- for biotech investor, we want to really amortize what that business is doing and what it could be worth to make sure we get value for our shareholders for it. I'm just -- from a funding perspective, as this grows, I'm wondering how you're thinking. That's fine to get us to a material scale where we can show to internally and externally that this business is a good business, and it's going to grow from there. So we've already had people wanting to come up and invest in it with us, but we don't want to take investment too early because I'm afraid we'll give away future value. If they're really high, we might look at somebody coming in to share the burden with us on the capital investment. But we've set it up to give ourselves optionality on bringing in outside investment if we want it, and that's the way we'll run the business right now. I'm really excited to see the first contracts come in and this model demonstrated because truly, Shannon, nobody else can do this in the world right now. And that's why the failure rate on drug is one reason why the failure rate on drug development is so high, is you test it in mice and sheep in pigs and so forth to work your way up to scale to trust to go into the humans. So if we can demonstrate this in a lab that it works with human cells, there's a chance to shorten the cycle, increase the hit rate and reduce animal testing, which is a win for everybody. And I mean I'm not -- first of all, nobody fully knows what's going to happen in 2023. I mean we're continuing to experience a choppy supply chain environment, and consumer spending is moving in different directions. And I think as you saw in our prepared remarks, right, as it impacts 3D Systems, the primary impact is in the procedures that are more elective than our Healthcare segments within the orthodontic market. And the reason you can still get growth, and this is an industry broad industry comment, is additive manufacturing allows customers to bring in flexibility in their supply chain. But the tailwind we all have in this industry, and I think we're well positioned to leverage this, is customers have -- all of them were stung by these extended supply chains and virtually every industry stung by these extended supply chains into Asia and Eastern Europe and things where we've had pandemics, we've had wars. So most of our customers are saying, well, if I should look at additive in my factory, because I can bring it closer to home, I can have flexibility. So as an industry, and I think we've been leaders in this of introducing new materials for manufacturing production, they say, \"Well, I can make the parts I really want to make now with additive.\" And supply chains, with China shutdowns, open a newspaper and you see China is shutting down periodically, still logistical issues getting parts shipped around the world. So yes, there's a macro headwind from the economy, but there is a tailwind unique to our industry of people adopting additive and production. And that's -- I believe that's going to continue and accelerate, particularly as the economy rebounds and capital spending get loosens up more. But in the longer term, these supply chain issues have opened a real opportunity for this industry that I believe is going to make it a permanent part of the production supply chain in most companies, both industrial and health care around the world. We don't expect -- and honestly, as we sit here today, and it could always happen, we don't expect -- and unless I can throw out a 15 caveats, unless there's a bigger war, unless there's a new outbreak in the pandemic, we don't expect any major changes between now and the end of the year. That's why we could tighten our revenue range down we think that revenue range fully reflects the risk that we have today as we sit here, and we're in mid-November. So between now and the end of the year, unless some catastrophe happens in the world, we don't expect any significant changes. So as we end the year and go into next year, unless there's a major disruption, I think it's kind of steady as you go right now. And that may not be the most exciting environment, but that's what we see right now as we sit here. And then I guess, just in light of that weaker demand environment, slower growth, just how you're thinking about managing and balancing investments. Well, that's the tricky part of it because we do believe this is an exciting growth industry. In spite of having a strong balance sheet, we're going to do that because we think it's prudent. And at the same time, we want to bring those seeds that we've purchased and brought into the company to full mighty oaks, if you will. That's why we stuck with our long-term guidance of double-digit growth, then we hung out there being a $1 billion company in 5 years. And if things return to normal and economies over the next year or two, I think there's no reason in the world we can't see that kind of exciting growth ahead. It's been a pleasure talking to you, and we look forward to updating you with our year-end results on our next call."
