    "content": " At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Russell Johnson , Vice President, Treasurer and Investor Relations. With me on today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s call are Dr. Jeffrey Graves, President and Chief Executive Officer; Wayne Pensky, Interim Chief Financial Officer; and Andrew Johnson, Executive Vice President and Chief Legal Officer. For those who have accessed the streaming portion of the webcast, please be aware that there maybe a few seconds delay and that you will not be able to post questions via the web. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in last night\u00e2\u0080\u0099s press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. In our press release and slides accompanying this webcast, which are both available on our Investor Relations website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. As always, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s my pleasure to have this opportunity to speak with you and share my perspectives on our ongoing efforts to make 3D Systems the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s most innovative and successful provider of additive manufacturing solutions. As I look out on the environment, which 3D Systems is operating today, I see much to be optimistic about, but I also see a complex and volatile mix of business conditions that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s challenging our ability to deliver consistent results during 2022. On one hand, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s clear to me that the underlying trends supporting the broad adoption of additive manufacturing solutions in production environments are both strong and resilient across our diversified economy in applications ranging from the traditional manufacturing shop floor to the biotech laboratory, where life-saving medical treatments are created. As we highlighted in yesterday\u00e2\u0080\u0099s earnings released during the second quarter, 3D Systems, like many other companies encountered a more difficult global business environment that we had anticipated when we exited 2021. Our performance this quarter was impacted negatively by various macroeconomic and geopolitical factors, most notably stubborn supply chain issues, foreign exchange volatility, and our exit from the Russian market. While these factors such as these are often hard to predict or control, the reality is that they generated unexpected headwinds for our business during the second quarter and led to revenue growth and profitability below our internal expectations and no doubt below the expectations of our investors as well. Looking ahead to the second half of the year, we now believe that these factors combined with an expectation of dampened consumer discretionary spending driven by the rapid rise in the price of food, gasoline and other daily necessities will impact our results. As a result, we are taking a more conservative stance on our outlook for the balance of the year and reducing our 2022 guidance. While we hope that these effects will be short lived, I feel it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s important to be prudent to plan for them until the data suggests otherwise. Fortunately, we have the scale, the balance sheet, and then an exceptional customer base, which allows us to weather these short-term headwinds and continue to prudently invest for the strong growth opportunities we see when inevitably these headwinds subside. For today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s call, we will start with my summary comments on the quarter and the full year forecast and then Wayne Pensky will provide more details. For the consolidated company, after adjusting for the significant divestiture program that we completed in 2021, revenue for the second quarter grew 3.2% year-over-year and 7.8% in constant currency. As I mentioned, several exogenous factors have an outsized impact on the second quarter top line. They also include the ongoing tragedy of the war in Ukraine, which led us to exit the Russian market and has since negatively impacted business confidence in the European countries, such as Germany, where 3D Systems and particularly our Industrial segment, has traditionally had a strong presence. So while we are by no means satisfied with our quarterly results, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s important to view them in the light of the very challenging and volatile macro environment we faced during the quarter. To reinforce the message we have stated previously, with the increasing adoption of additive manufacturing and production environments across both our healthcare and industrial customer base, we anticipate delivering solid double-digit annual revenue growth once these shorter term headwinds subside. Turning to our divestiture adjusted segment performance, in the second quarter, revenue for our industrial segment grew 3.8% year-over-year and 11.2% in constant currency, while revenue for our healthcare segment grew 2.9% and 4.7% in constant currency. In healthcare, second quarter revenue came in softer than expected. The slower growth in healthcare was driven largely by a postponement of elective procedures due to both a resurgence of COVID which once again limited patient access to hospitals and to greatly heightened inflationary pressures on consumers, which forced them to prioritize their purchases and postpone optional care, particularly in the dental market. However, to be clear in our updated guidance, we have modeled these conditions as now extending through the year, end of the year. So in short, we are reducing our revenue estimates for the full year assuming that the challenges we saw as we exited the second quarter continue throughout the remainder of the year. These primarily include the impact of currency, inflation and supply chain disruption. In addition to these objective factors, we are also receiving clear signals from selected customers of their visibility into near-term demand trends has diminished. In response, they are slowing their expansion plans and adjusting purchases to more tightly control inventory levels until their visibility into demand improves. Secondly, but not an insignificant factor driving us to be conservative in our forecast at this point, is the potential impact of energy supply constraints on our European customers stemming from increased EU government efforts to reduce their dependency on Russian oil and gas supplies. The net effect of any such effort, which looks increasingly probable, will be further dampening of demand on capital \u00e2\u0080\u0093 or capital investments, particularly in Germany. One obvious area that influences our secondhand forecast is our dental business, which had previously enjoyed very strong double-digit growth in the U.S. and internationally. Given the current geopolitical tensions, the resurgence of COVID in China and the curtailing of consumer discretionary spending throughout Europe and the U.S., we are projecting slower growth in our dental segment in the second half. As we exited the second quarter and evaluated all of these risk factors, we have updated our forecasts and are now taking a more conservative view of our projected full year performance, all of which is reflected in our updated full year guidance that Wayne will discuss in a few moments. Actions we are taking include a variety of steps to optimize our cost structure, improve the efficiency of our operations, and refine our technology portfolio to assure exciting and profitable growth in the years ahead. Reflecting this focus on operational efficiencies, in July, we took a major step forward by transitioning the sourcing and manufacturing activities for much of our polymer-based printers in-house and terminating our agreement with a major contract manufacturer. In sourcing these high-tech, high mix low volume printer platforms took months of planning and required us to incur some upfront exit and inventory costs. But over time, we believe this approach gives us much better control of our critical supply chain elements, resulting in reduced manufacturing costs, improved inventory management, and improved customer-facing metrics such as quality and delivery performance. This step in combination with our new product design efforts is a key element in delivering higher gross margin performance, the goal of which is to exceed 50% in the years ahead. Before I end my remarks and hand over to Wayne, I want to comment on important progress and collaborations between 3D Systems and what I believe are two of the most world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s most innovative technology partners. First, in June, our longtime biotechnology development partner, United Therapeutics, announced that in close partnership with 3D Systems, they have successfully printed the most complex objects ever produced by mankind, a complete human lung scaffold, consisting of over 4,000 kilometers of pulmonary vasculature and airways, with wall thicknesses measured in fractions of the diameter of a human hair. In the first unveiling of this incredible capability, United Therapeutics\u00e2\u0080\u0099 President and CEO, Dr. Martine Rothblatt and 3D Systems\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Founder and Chief Technology Officer for Regenerative Medicine, Chuck Hull, appeared at the CNN-sponsored LIFE ITSELF Conference hosted by Dr. Sanjay Gupta and Marc Hodosh. In her presentation, Dr. Rothblatt declared for the first time publicly, her vision to have these personalized bio-printed lungs cleared for human trial within 5 years. With our team\u00e2\u0080\u0099s increasing momentum earlier this year, we expanded the scope of our collaboration to include the manufacture of human livers and kidneys. With the foundation of progress that we have made in materials, hardware and controlled technologies for printing human organs, which I believe are quite unique in the world, one of my most important goals for 3D Systems has become the building of a world class regenerative medicine business around the emerging science of photopolymer based bio-printing. Building upon the incredible work our teams conducted with United Therapeutics in 2021, we acquired two development companies, Allevi and Volumetric Biotechnologies, in order to bring additional technology and specialized technical skills to our regenerative programs at 3D Systems. Having now integrated these exceptionally talented scientists and engineers, I am extremely pleased with our accelerating progress and committed to this groundbreaking technology, which offers the potential to improve countless lives of people who are suffering from chronic diseases or injuries around the world. The second application field and one that we believe offers exciting and potentially near-term opportunities, is the printing of vascularized tissue for use of drug discovery. With our ability to now print vascularized tissue that enables very precise predetermined blood flow, while accommodating an enormous range of human cells, including both healthy and diseased cells, the effectiveness of developmental drugs, therapies can rapidly be evaluated in the laboratory. Given the ongoing exploratory efforts we have underway with leading pharmaceutical companies, we are excited about the potential of this technology and are now investing in both the people and the infrastructure we will need in order to bring this to commercial operation. In support of these developmental efforts, we are also now putting in place for the first time in our company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s history, a Medical Advisory Board to provide input on each of our regenerative medicine programs. Under the leadership of Dr. Stephen Klasko, a recognized visionary leader in the global healthcare community, in the second quarter, we were pleased and honored to announce the appointment of the honorable Dr. David Shulkin, former Secretary of Veterans Affairs, and more recently, the Honorable Alex Azar, former Secretary of Health and Human Services, and a recognized leader in the pharmaceutical industry. This distinguished group of advisers, along with additional members, soon to be named, will play an important role in our development and commercialization of these remarkable new products. In addition to the progress we are making in regenerative medicine, we were very excited to announce this week an agreement to acquire dp polar, the Germany-based developer of the industry\u00e2\u0080\u0099s first additive manufacturing system, designed for true high-speed mass production of customized components. Among its many unique features, it can embed objects such as sensors, electronics, or magnets into printed parts by using inline robotic pick and place capability, with its ability to achieve production speeds up to 5x higher than traditional batch process printing platforms, which represent the standard in the industry today. We are extremely excited to join forces with dp polar at this pivotal time for additive manufacturing, when interest in production scale applications is rising fast. While their machine is still in beta testing and therefore the acquisition will not benefit our near-term results, dp polar\u00e2\u0080\u0099s technology is an ideal fit with 3D Systems\u00e2\u0080\u0099 broad portfolio of polymer materials and production-focused software systems. In summary, I want to emphasize that despite near-term headwinds that are challenging our results this year, we remain confident in our long-term outlook, the targets we laid out at our Investor Day in May. With a strong balance sheet and a disciplined approach to running our business, we will continue to look for ways to invest strategically for long-term growth with a focus on key healthcare and industrial markets. With that, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d like to turn the call over to Wayne who will describe our second quarter financial results and our 2022 guidance revision in more detail. We had three significant divestitures in 2021 as we discussed the non-GAAP measures from the tables we presented in last night\u00e2\u0080\u0099s earnings release and as was discussed today, we excluded from the 2021 results the impact of the divestitures. As Jeff discussed, revenue for the quarter did not meet our expectations due to three factors: the strengthening of the U.S. dollar, persistent supply chain issues and geopolitical factors such as the Russia-Ukraine war. Revenue for the second quarter was $140 million, a decrease of 13.8% compared to the prior year. Excluding divestitures, revenue increased 3.2% and on a constant currency basis, revenue increased 7.8% compared to the prior year. Just to put dollars behind the three factors, nearly $6 million of this impact was attributable to the sharp appreciation of the U.S. dollar that occurred during the second quarter and reduced the U.S. dollar value of our international sales made in different currencies, which typically represent about 40% of our total sales. In the second quarter of last year, we had approximately $4 million of sales in Russia that did not repeat in the second quarter this year, because we exited the Russian market. If we exclude Russia sales from 2021, then our adjusted growth rate is 11.3%. Finally, supply chain issues in particular component shortages prevented us from filling more than $9 million of firm customer orders. By way of comparison, in the first quarter of 2022, we are unable to ship approximately $7 million of customer orders because of supply chain issues. Looking at the first half of the year, revenue excluding divestitures grew 6.5% year-over-year to $273 million. And on a constant currency basis, first half revenue grew 10.4%. So even in a very challenging operating environment, we were able to achieve double-digit year-over-year growth in the first half of 2022. In the second quarter, we had a loss per share of $0.26 compared to a loss per share of $0.08 in the second quarter of 2021. The year-over-year decline reflects inflationary impacts on input cost \u00e2\u0080\u0093 impacts from acquired businesses as most are in development stage are just beginning commercialization and continued growth-oriented investments in R&D, including to enhance our product portfolio and improve our corporate infrastructure. Our revenue, excluding divestitures on a constant currency basis for our healthcare segment, increased 4.7% and our industrial segment revenue increased by 11.2% as compared to the second quarter of last year. Our industrial revenue growth was driven by continued strength in precision micro casting applications such as jewelry, by demand for production machines for aerospace applications, by continued pull-through materials by our significant installed base of printers. Partially offsetting the sales growth industrials are exited from the Russian market, weaker machine and materials sales in Europe due to macroeconomic concerns and to China due to COVID-related lockdowns and supply chain disruptions. Gross profit margin was lower due to multiple factors, including the 2021 divestitures of non-core assets. As reflected in our revised guidance, we expect gross margins to remain steady as we move through the year through the continued impacts of inflation on input costs. On a non-GAAP basis, operating expenses were $60.9 million as compared to $48.9 million from the same period a year ago. But half this increase is due to expenses from recently acquired businesses, while the remainder reflects increased research and development costs to refresh and enhance their product portfolio and investments to strengthen our corporate infrastructure. Our cash and short-term investments declined approximately $151 million since the end of last year, driven primarily by $83.3 million paid for acquisitions and equity investments cash used in operations of $38.2 million and capital expenditures of $10.4 million. We continue to have a strong balance sheet with sufficient cash to support organic growth, including in regenerative medicine. As previously stated, we regard 2022 as an investment year during which we will make additional targeted investments in high potential growth areas of our business and in our corporate infrastructure as part of our overall strategy to profitably grow revenue in both the healthcare and industrial segments. After we complete the acquisition of dp polar that Jeff discussed, we will likely take a pause in acquisitions to make sure we focus on execution and fully integrate the recent acquisitions we have made. In 2021, we began providing guidance on full year non-GAAP gross profit margins. And in this year, we expanded our guidance to include revenue and non-GAAP operating expenses. Given our lower than expected performance in the second quarter combined with a challenging macroeconomic environment we have received for the second half of the year, we are revising our full year 2022 guidance. We now expect revenue be within a range of $530 million to $570 million, which reflects an estimated $20 million of negative foreign exchange impact for the full year as well as additional negative impacts from reduced spending in selected end markets, such as dental, elective surgeries and international manufacturers caused by the challenging environment. This revised 2022 guidance assumes no significant additional changes in the macroeconomic environment that could negatively impact business demand or disrupt our supply chain, such as COVID, geopolitical events or foreign exchange volatility. Before Wayne and I take your questions, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d like to add one more additional comment. As you likely saw last week, we announced that Michael Turner will join 3D Systems as our new Chief Financial Officer at the end of this month. So, Kevin, I think we can now open up the line for questions. Your line is now live. I wanted to first dig into the guidance a bit, because last quarter when you provided guidance, you talked about demand outstripping your ability to fulfill. So with respect to FX, you are correct that the $20 million is the difference between what we did last guidance versus this guidance. With respect to supply chain, I wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t view that really as a factor in terms of changing our guidance, while we didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t assume any improvement, we didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t assume it was going to get any worse. The rest is really about this slower demand in the end markets, primarily dental and then the rest of if you think about what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s happening in Europe in terms of slowdown of our customers, in terms of their ability to manufacture that everybody is taking a pause, their inventories probably went up in the past, they are probably trying to manage that inventory down and they are much more cautious about their own outlook. Greg, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s very much what you would see in the newspaper everyday. If people are having to spend more money on gas and food and basically, they are cutting back on certainly on discretionary items, which is particularly impacting the dental industry. And again, we view that as temporary that the outlook for that business is quite strong. But undoubtedly, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to \u00e2\u0080\u0093 it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s projected to have an effect in the second half of the year, hopefully with inflation peaking soon that will start rolling back, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s prudent at this point to assume it just lasts throughout the year and we go on. The other effect clearly is with COVID spiking up in different parts of the country in the world, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nudged out the treatment in hospitals for COVID patients has nudged out discretionary operations, especially around orthopedics. So, that outlook has flowed somewhat to and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s much like the initial spike in COVID did back in late \u00e2\u0080\u009820 and early \u00e2\u0080\u009821. So, instead of looking at a quarter by quarter, which we will continue to do, we just assumed this condition lasts throughout the year and we updated our guidance. Yes, I think the demand is going to \u00e2\u0080\u0093 I mean, just my opinion, Greg, demand is going to remain for those products if they are very popular. And I think people are just having to make short-term decisions, with gas and food becoming so expensive and I use that symbolically, I think everything is becoming more expensive. People have had to just put off things that are truly discretionary, but still highly valued. So all the feedback we get is that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s temporary and it will pass the growth outlook back, if you listen to that customer base, which they are public companies, you can listen to them. What they say is, their long-term outlook is still for very strong double-digit growth and the numbers I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve heard are 20% to 30%, they talk about publicly, but for this year, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been ratcheted back to low double-digits, high single-digits and that ripples through the supply chain. And I guess last one I mean just in light of everything going on, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s surprising that you are raising your OpEx guide. No, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s good questions, Greg. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s funny when challenging economic environments hit, I think historically, you see companies do one of two things. But for folks with a stronger balance sheet, I think you see them saying, look, some of the weaker competitors in our space are going to really struggle in this environment. And with our scale and our balance sheet coming into the year, we were very well equipped to deal with a downturn and continue investments. So we are able to pickup talent, we are able to pickup I look at this dp polar group an outstanding group of people that small companies struggle in these environments, because they have to rely on longer term revenue projections and that becomes more variable and they burn through their cash. So in essence, for bigger companies like ours with a strong balance sheet, it gives us an opportunity to really kind of double down and say we are going to come out of this really strong. And when you look at our infrastructure investments, if you make the assumption, you are coming out of the strong you better have the infrastructure to support the growth. If you look at regenerative medicine, which are a really organic investments at this point and you look at this high-speed production process that dp brings us, those types of investments really pay dividends in the long-term if you can maintain them. So, while everybody is struggling, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s our chance now to really kind of kind of push ahead. Your line is now live. Supply constraints, it seems like it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been three or four quarters now that Wayne and Jeff talked about $68 million of demand that you guys can fulfill. But there is no doubt about a backlog\u00e2\u0080\u0099s building, we were able to \u00e2\u0080\u0093 we left more on the table in Q2 than we did on Q1. And we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to use that as an excuse in the second half, because I do think that things are going to plateau and then get better. And at this point, we are going to wait until the data says it is better to really talk about it. So in terms of the durability of orders, when you push orders out, obviously there is a fraction of people that could \u00e2\u0080\u0093 that may choose to cancel. But especially when times get tougher, you just don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get the attention from the contract manufacturers that you want and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s much better to run it in house. Just a follow-up for you Jeff, dp polar, I guess when I think of inkjet, I think more of prototyping. And I think that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s because material properties, I believe these machines need to use acrylic materials. With your background, Troy, particularly appreciate this machine, they have a great \u00e2\u0080\u0093 by the way, if you go to the dp polar website, they have a fantastic YouTube video posted there of the machine. And it demonstrates the technology with their printing technology, their inkjet printing technology it can actually accommodate much more of our current portfolio of materials that are printed. So no, no, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s it is particularly geared toward continuous production and high-speed production of products. And the doubly cool thing when you watch the video is you can use pick and place robots to put all electronics or magnetics within the component is printed, which is really gives you another capability with 3D printing that you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have in the current batch processes. It is just a fantastic technology and one of the key pieces of IP here Troy is the machine intelligence because the spinning platform is spinning base plate is so large, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a big velocity difference between the inner radius and the outer radius. So the intelligence of the machine to be able to uniformly present across broad \u00e2\u0080\u0093 across through multiple printheads, across a broad radius is really exceptional and they have got \u00e2\u0080\u0093 they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been working at it for several years. Well, thank you for that info and good luck on the second half. Hey, guys, good morning, I really appreciate you taking the taking the questions. No, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a concrete false in demand, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d say it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s still positive, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s still demand out there. But it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s definitely a lower rate of demand growth, the second half than we had originally modeled. And what they attribute that to which they pass on to us is, customers are really struggling, their customers are struggling because they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re having to spend more on the basics of life than they are in for example, in improving their smiles, things that are truly optional. And orthopedics were procedures that are labeled optional, are often very painful for patients, and they really would like to take care of them. But I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m tired of waking up every morning saying, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to get better next quarter. And at this point, I think we just said, well, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll project it through the end of the year. But I think it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a good time to be conservative and just say, these, these pressures are going to be for the full year. I mean, investors are going around see the guidance lowered anyway. So it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a wise thing to do Jeff, is to debit balance. So I think, supply chains around the world are trying to catch up. And certainly, if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve gone out to buy a car recently, or even a spare part for a car, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t place a fuel pump the other day, and it had to be shipped from Germany. So there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s really nice demand and with one exception, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll tell you that there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s really nice demand in the industrial environment, because our customers are looking to bring manufacturing closer to home over time. The one area in the world that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s problematic that is Europe and particularly Germany, which is an industrial powerhouse. The outlook they have and the concerns they have around the Russian energy supply has caused the government to send signals to watch industrial production, potentially cut back in certain industries and parts. And if you follow their announcements, the German industrial firms, you are worried about that, because come winter time, they need the energy. And looking forward, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hard to estimate, but we factored it in and said, look, we think Europe could get weaker, not stronger over time, due to energy and the war. Your line is now live. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s actually John, on behalf of Wamsi. I know the full year guide, midpoint around 40% implies slight improvement in the margin trajectory in the second half. I will take the second one, which will be pure speculation. With respect to the margin outlook, that point on 40%, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not terribly different than how we did in the first half of the year. And so I think we need to do a little bit better on one, passing our price increases, and secondly, just in terms of the input costs going up. We came into the year with just the base assumption, I think we were very transparent about this that supply chain issues, which impact our gross margins, were going to be a struggle through the first half of the year, and then they would improve in the second half. I think as we exit Q2, the number of risk issues in the world has probably increased versus the beginning of the year. And as we look at \u00e2\u0080\u0093 in the second half, we just thought, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s prudent not to really speculate on when things will get a lot better. And I do think by \u00e2\u0080\u009823, there is a good chance that supply chains have straightened themselves out. And you would be probably see this in common everyday things of going to restaurants and things that the world is returning towards normal, but there is a lot of training. Within a restaurant this weekend, there is typically a lot of training opportunities for new people that are taken jobs. But at this point, when we are only dealing with \u00e2\u0080\u009822 guidance, we say, let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just assume everything stays as tough as it is now for the rest of the year. And I think that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a prudent position to take, and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what we have done. In the \u00e2\u0080\u0093 it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a very interesting question, actually. I think in the first half, we probably saw people building because they thought the second half was going to be strong. I think in the second half here, we are seeing people be a little bit more prudent, if you would, and managing their inventories or cash position, make sure they don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have too much on hand. So, I would tell you consumables in the second half, we are projecting as probably a bit softer than we are probably \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and Wayne correct me on this. In the first \u00e2\u0080\u0093 yes, that is softer than the first half. And then on the \u00e2\u0080\u0093 but on the capital side, on new printers and things, we see that demand remaining strong, basically across the market. So, that tells you really basically customers are looking through this and saying, I am going to need the printing capacity, but I may not need the consumables right now in the next couple of quarters. But it does encourage you that the long-term you are installing more printers, there is more \u00e2\u0080\u0093 going to be more consumption of consumables including materials and software in the long-term, because the capacity will be out there. So, that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a \u00e2\u0080\u0093 that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a good question and thanks for asking it. Generally speaking, in our forecasts the second half is about the same in sales in the first half. Your line is now live. Typically, Brian, as you know, from falling, there is usually a bump in the fourth quarter. I would just encourage you though to \u00e2\u0080\u0093 if any years going to be watered down, I think this year will be, I wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t expect there to be \u00e2\u0080\u0093 we are not expecting a huge change quarter-to-quarter. If you look in the prior years, fourth quarter had a much more noticeable bump than we are forecasting right now. But again, Brian, we took the approach this time of let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just assume the world just kind of stays like it is now for the rest of the year. So, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s in terms of building a model that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s where our favorite, so \u00e2\u0080\u0093 for this year. And you gave the industrial and healthcare change in revenue year-over-year, I may have missed it. Look, if you look at for the first half dental, for the first half was about the same as the prior year. That really goes back to Jeff\u00e2\u0080\u0099s comments about, a little \u00e2\u0080\u0093 as they are forecasting their own growth. If they over-forecasted previously, and drop it down now, they probably need less printers, and a little bit of consumption of less materials. So, I think they have certainly seen a drop off in their demand due to discretionary spending issues. And they have gone out of their way to assure long-term growth rates are, they are maintaining the same guidance. Your line is now live. So, I was hoping that you could expand a little bit on how you have to respond from a production standpoint, when you have say, a slowdown with a large customer in terms of what you are expecting from demand. And I will give a little color and Wayne maybe you could comment more from a cash perspective, if we can estimate that. No, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been such a difficult time, to just make sure you have all the components to meet demand in these printers. But yes, undoubtedly, there is \u00e2\u0080\u0093 I think we have an opportunity actually in inventory management to generate cash over time, because we have got a lot of inventory. But it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s always a challenge, because there is a lot of volatility, if you will, in demand right now across the platforms. So, the first half inventories went up about $16 million. But as we talked, as Jeff mentioned earlier, we are going to bring some of the manufacturing in-house. And you will see in the 10-Q that was posted this morning that meant in July, we actually bought another $15 million of inventory. So, inventory that previous was on our books now came our books as part of bringing inventory in-house. We have had inventory a lot of extra parts, because you really didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know what was going to hang up your shipments. So, that will work down, the supply chains get smoother and more predictable. So, you will see a bump up and it is listed in the Q, right, see a bump up in the Q, a significant bump up as we took that inventory back on our books from our contract manufacturer. And I think you will slowly see a bleed off over time, which will be a cash generator for us. Your line is now live. There were several, I see you are meeting Kevin\u00e2\u0080\u0099s goal of one question. So, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s very close to our current headquarters, and a lot of our engineers here in town. But in general, I think we will manage those costs. So, I think there will be a \u00e2\u0080\u0093 there should over time be a cost savings there as we drive more efficiency out of that plant, same thing with the inventory. So, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s right here, there is no physical move, frankly, of the production process. An answer to part of your question though, it is a very significant part of our polymer based production. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what our customers want, because they want a large flexibility in solving their application issues. So, we offer and as part of our model, we offer the broadest range of printing technologies in the entire industry, from polymers to metals. And we are bringing manufacturing back in-house, because contract manufacturers notoriously are if they are not as efficient with a low-volume high mix product lines, and high tech product lines. So, by bringing it back in-house, I think we will do a better job of managing that. And when you combine it with the move to modular engineering, I think you will see some significant cost reduction over time in our COGS, just due to efficiency of design and manufacturing. But I would tell you, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a key part of us getting to 50% gross margins, is improving the gross margin on our printer products. Oh, just the CapEx levels, I assume there is going to be a little bit  out there. Now, we will make some CapEx investments in IT infrastructure and things to run the plant better. Your line is now live. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s how to manage those costs down when you see this conflicting thing of short-term headwinds and long-term demand growth and pretty exciting demand growth, you need to come out of it on the other side ready for that. And so, the desire is to maintain continuity in R&D spending, our SG&A we look at because our G&A costs are high right now. So I think you can quite clearly see G&A coming down in future years, but we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got to invest to make sure our foundation is strong, and that we have the platform to support growth, R&D spending, we just \u00e2\u0080\u0093 we \u00e2\u0080\u0093 I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m hoping that we can manage that down over time as well. But I would tell you in this industry, right now, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a disruptive industry. And you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got to watch, how much you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re spending on R&D, because that those production platforms when they hit are going to be very sticky sales. And that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s one reason we invested in dp polar is we picked up years of R&D work that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been done with a machine that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ready to go to beta customers now, to accelerate that whole process. So I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not giving you a crisp answer, I want to be very, very selective about R&D spending and make sure we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re doing it correctly. With the leadership we have in place now, I think there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a really nice opportunity to focus and get more out of our R&D spin with modularity and platforms. In terms of bringing the overall spin down, I really don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to make commitments on that in the long-term, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u0093 as we grow, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re easier to bear. G&A I think we can bring down and even sales efficiency, we can bring down over time with scale, with the scale we have, the G&A particularly I think we can breakdown in future years. Yes, I guess the only thing I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d add, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve with dp polar, that will make our seventh acquisition a little over last year. So, as those guys progressed, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll get a little bit more leverage from those in the interim, we just need to manage them as best we can."
