    "content": " Healthcare growth of approximately of 5% excluding divestitures was softer than we would\u2019ve initially anticipated when we started the year, being driven in part by the introduction of our new DMP 350 Dual, a high productivity version of our well-proven metal printer, the DMP 350, which has been a mainstay for many of our Healthcare customers in recent years. To support the strong engagement and demand that we\u2019re seeing from our customers broadly, we\u2019re continuing to invest in both, our product portfolio and core technologies, as well as in our business infrastructure, including information technology, finance, and accounting, investments that will enable us to efficiently scale for double digit growth that we see ahead.
