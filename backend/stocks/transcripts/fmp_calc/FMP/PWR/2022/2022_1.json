    "content": " On the call today, I will provide operational and strategic commentary, and we\u2019ll then turn it over to Derrick Jensen, Quanta\u2019s Chief Financial Officer, who will provide a review of our first quarter results and full year 2022 financial expectations. Looking through the coming years, we continue to see emerging opportunities for Quanta\u2019s underground utility and infrastructure solution operations playing evolving and increasing role with customers as they increasingly pursue strategies to reduce their carbon footprint and diversify their operations and assets towards greener business opportunities.

I think they made us better to culturally, they\u2019re very much \u2013 you could take a mirror and look and you would see Quanta on the balance of plant renewable solar it\u2019s megawatts, gigawatts and I say dialogue with their clients, flexibility, scale, everything you\u2019d want and our ability to think differently and differentiate in markets that are, in many ways, hype from supply chain as well as regulatory effects."
