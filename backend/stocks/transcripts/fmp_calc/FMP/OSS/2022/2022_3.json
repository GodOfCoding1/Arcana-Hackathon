    "content": " Growth was 18% over the same year ago quarter and our year-to-date revenue of $54.2 million was also a record for the first nine months of any year, with growth over the same period of last year, up 23%. During the third quarter, OSS recognized revenue of $18.8 million, which was up 18% over the prior year quarter. Revenue from our European subsidiary Bressner increased 21%, contributing a record $8.1 million, which was marginalized by a quarterly year-over-year devaluation of the euro of 14%. Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP metric was $955,000 or 5.1% of quarterly revenue, as compared to $1.8 million or 11.3% of quarterly revenue. Also, as John mentioned, we expect significant margin improvement with the resumption of our military product shipments and assuming 19.2% in revenue for Q4, we expect to close the year up more than 18% to a record $73.4 million in revenue.
