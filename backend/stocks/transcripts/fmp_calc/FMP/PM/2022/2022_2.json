    "content": " Pro forma net revenues grew organically by plus 6.2% and by plus 5.3% for total PMI, reflecting both the continued strong growth of IQOS and the ongoing recovery of the combustible business in many markets against a pandemic affected comparison. Despite these typical margin challenges, our robust top line growth and ongoing cost efficiency enable us to deliver plus 5.6% growth in pro forma currency-neutral adjusted diluted EPS ahead of expectation to $1.32 and plus 3.8% growth for total PMI to $1.48, including Russia and Ukraine. Importantly, with an excellent 2021 performance and our strong 2022 outlook, we now expect to comfortably exceed our 2021-2023 minimum CAGR target on a pro forma basis of more than plus 5% in organic net revenue growth and more than plus 5% in currency-neutral adjusted diluted EPS growth."
