    "content": " In our potash business, slower demand led us to temporarily stop production at our Colonsay mine, but we think the current market situation is temporary and expect to restart operations at Colonsay within the first half of 2023. Once we get past the first quarter, distribution margins should be in line with our historical expectations of $30 per ton to $40 per ton, and our production margins will revert to normal stripping margins well once we work through the high cost raw materials. So our expectation is that that will continue and then flatten, so we will continue to decrease for a while and then it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s probably getting close to flattening now where you have got I think urea prices are down in that $300 range and it can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really go that much lower than that or you will start seeing production slow down again. In Brazil, I think the -- because of the long lead time for everything, it will be a little different than that and I think the Brazil market will be more stable throughout the year and we will see the normal pattern of third quarter being our strongest quarter and like we have said here, even the Safrinha season we are starting to see some pretty strong demand signals at least."
