    "content": " Global potash supply remains impacted by the significant reduction in Belarusian exports, which we think will be down 8 million tons in 2022. If I think about 2023, starting with potash, and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been saying this, and with the lack of -- or the lack of sales coming out of Belarus, we do see that the market is going to have to ration supply, which does, as you mentioned, bring up an opportunity for us to potentially move more product. I guess just given consensus seems to be that the market will be short, something like 5 million to 8 million tons of potash next year, curious where you think support level is for pricing for potash in that environment. In terms of is LFP battery a significant use of phosphates, what we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re seeing today, I think, is -- I think we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve gone from 100,000 tons of purified phosphoric acid, this is China alone, moving up in a couple of years to about 400,000 tons of purified phosphoric acid. And then, you said that demand would be 64 million tons next year based on your preliminary guess, up only a couple of million from 2022, assuming -- has a little bit more -- assuming is really  a little bit more, assuming ICL a little bit more, assuming Belarus maybe a little bit out more."
