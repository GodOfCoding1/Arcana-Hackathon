    "content": " This plan and these investments helped us to significantly increase our return on tangible equity from being in negative territory just two years ago to 8%, and at the same time, to reduce our cost/income ratio by 14 percentage points to 73% for the first half of this year. Turning to the quarter more specifically, adjusted costs excluding transformation charges and bank levies, increased by \u00e2\u0082\u00ac70 million or 2% year-on-year but declined by 2% excluding FX effects. Corporate Bank revenues in the second quarter were \u00e2\u0082\u00ac1.6 billion, 26% higher year-on-year. Corporate Treasury Services revenues of \u00e2\u0082\u00ac962 million increased by 30% year-on-year driven by strong operating performance, the improving interest rate environment and increased loan and deposit volumes. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. So I'm just trying to understand a bit more where these investments are going into and how we should measure return on investment, because clearly your 2025 target and that's my second question is 62.5, your cost based on your guidance and revenues of \u00e2\u0082\u00ac30 billion, the cost would be actually lower than what we're going to achieve this year, on a stated basis. But let me also a little bit go to Page 2 of our presentation, because if you see the four businesses and compare that to the targets, which we have given out in the IDD in '20 and in '19, actually, you see that on the investment bank on the private bank in asset management, we are actually after six months from a cost income ratio, there where we wanted to be at the end of the year, where we are not yet fully there is in the corporate bank. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you very much."
