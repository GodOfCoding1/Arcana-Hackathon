    "content": " Momentum was strong in the fourth quarter, with revenues increasing by 30% year on year mainly driven by the improved interest rate environment and solid underlying business performance supported by higher client deposits. Loan volume in the Corporate Bank was \u00e2\u0082\u00ac122 billion, down by \u00e2\u0082\u00ac1 billion compared to the prior year quarter, and down by \u00e2\u0082\u00ac7 billion compared to the previous quarter driven by FX movements and increasing selectiveness of balance sheet deployment towards the year end 2022. Business Banking revenues of \u00e2\u0082\u00ac273 million grew by 51% year on year, reflecting the transition to a positive interest rate environment in Germany. And so with, with the uncertainty, as I say, timing and magnitude, and therefore volatility, we think it's just prudent to hold on to the capital to ensure that we wouldn't be distributing an amount that while by the end of the year, we would have been very comfortable distributing on an interim basis, it might have made us look a little thin and potentially influenced our ability to support balance sheet growth, support clients in this environment. Well, really the tailwind that I can identify, number one, the prospect of perhaps a short shallow recession in the U.S. Inflation is trimming back and we have a prospect of normalization of interest rate rises this year and also the decline of around energy concerns, due to the mild winter to the different measures, consumers have taken and also the Germany's \u00e2\u0082\u00ac200 billion package on energy prices is a key factor."
