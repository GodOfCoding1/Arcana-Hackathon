    "content": " It's an ambition program -- ambitious program for the year close to BRL 500 million in the first quarter, we were slightly below expectations, close to BRL 500 million, and we highlight our distribution with investments close to BRL 3 billion in the year 2022 in our budget. The intense rainfall that happened, especially in Minas Gerais decreased the energy -- the volume of energy distributed that also happened in the first quarter since it rains until February, but that's when we see in the captive market, the drop was higher, the rainfall brought a reduction, especially in the rural category, in irrigation. And as Dr. Reynaldo already said, it's important to note the increase in the injected -- energy injected achieving 5.3% of the energy consumed at Cemig D. Next year is an important year as we said because of tariff reviews and our market will be adjusted. So we see that looking at OpEx since 2020, we've been able to remain underneath the regulatory parameters for OpEx, the main impacts we have in the realizes, the post-employment program that we're working to mitigate the effect of the post-retirement costs in Cemig's balance sheet, we addressed that in the fourth quarter with life insurance. We have many that are related to quality and service, to our customers, operational efficiency, liability management of our bonds, the divestments aspect at Renova and Light that we did in '21 as well as the strengthening of Cemig D's investment program, partially achieved because they're still ongoing as the divestment of nonstrategic assets restructuring of the retirement benefit plans at this time. So we shall have a Cemig day in the third quarter to be able to discuss more about the company's strategy as for investments, and our expectations for future results."
