    "content": " Adjusted net profit of R$1.1 billion, 62% higher quarter-on-quarter comparison and also robust cash generation EBITDA close to R$1 billion, R$1.8 billion is significant variation when compared to the second quarter of 2021, 37% higher. And the fourth topic here, the fourth highlight in the quarter that involves the tax credits on ICMS and because of the Law 14385/22 that was approved our tariff adjustment already paid R$2.8 billion. In GT we have in our strategic planning already approved from R$1 billion to R$2 billion up to 2025, we had this investment in this quarter and we hope that very soon we can bring you good news in terms of distributed generation and centralized generation as well. The second quarter, we were able to invest a lot more than we invested in the first quarter of 2022, but even considering the figures of July that we have just posted here, we will have a second half of the year with higher investments when compared to what we have seen in the first half of the year. And what we already mentioned is that in the second quarter, we posted in our liabilities R$2 billion coming from PIS and Cofins tax credits, higher than the 10 years as we had understood. So what I mentioned before already, we were successful in raising R$1 billion in Cemig D with two debentures series with average tenures of five and seven years, and here our OpEx and regulatory EBITDA, we see that the OpEx we are performing a little bit over the regulatory OpEx. Now about our bonds for 2024, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know if you remember, Andr\u00c3\u00a9 and everyone else as well, of course, is that in 2021, in the first half of 2021 in our Cemig Day, we posted a strategy about the liability management for the bonds when we said that we were going to have an initial tranche where we would buy back 500 million in those bonds, we would have a second one up to 2023."
