    "content": " As we have previously noted, we believe the ability to launch ALLO-501A Phase 2 pivotal trial with cell products that have been manufactured at our intended commercial facility would be a major competitive advantage at the time of BLA submission and launch of ALLO-501A. As we wait for the initiation of our ALLO-501A Phase 2 pivotal trial, we are already thinking about what comes next, including how to expand access of AlloCAR T to earlier lines of therapy and how to bring AlloCAR T products to other patient populations. This study has been going on for over three years and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re fortunate to actually have a very large data set, both with monotherapy across multiple cell doses, as well as lymphodepletion regimens and a lot of translational data that we can mine ourselves as well as together with investigators and experts in the field to try to understand what the optimal lymphodepletion regimen will be."
