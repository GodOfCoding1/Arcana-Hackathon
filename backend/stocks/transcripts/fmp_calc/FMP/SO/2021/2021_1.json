    "content": " I think the biggest risk factor, however, going forward is after HFT to fuel load, there\u2019s two segments of work left that we still have to do and do well. Southern Holdings, I think we\u2019ve divested of a number of assets over the last couple of years, but this is \u2013 Angie, I think our focus is just reduce business complexity focus investment on the things that we think we\u2019re rewarded around. I think the administration gets it, that there needs to be a whole different level of public, private cooperation and collaboration, carrots and sticks, in order to get this done, I will say, talk in the book of nuclear that it\u2019s important for the United States to keep nuclear as a priority. But I would say if you aggregate what we actually issued in the first half, you\u2019d come up with a number that\u2019s almost exactly the same as what we had projected when we met with you last, but we can \u2013 we\u2019re happy to walk you through the table, I think it\u2019s Page 19 or something like that in the earnings packet. So that kind of \u2013 that\u2019s an interesting question, because I guess if you\u2019re talking about the history of Unit 3, it feels like maybe two months, but obviously you got to think about when you\u2019re spending that. So basically I think what you\u2019re saying is you\u2019ve got an estimated 200,000 construction hours from the time you come out of Hot Functional Testing until fuel load. Paul, we\u2019d think about this is that \u2013 we expected a certain reduction in intensity between hot functional test and fuel load and we\u2019ll just have to maintain intensity for a little bit longer to make sure we meet fuel load on a timely basis."
