    "content": " Consistent with the schedule extension of up to six months additional for each unit, Georgia Power\u2019s share of the total project capital cost forecast increased by $480 million largely as a function of time, additional resources to complete the remaining work with the unnecessary focus on quality construction and documentation and the replenishment of contingency. Before turning the call over to Dan for an update on our 2021 financial performance, and our long-term outlook, I\u2019d like to briefly touch on Georgia Power\u2019s triennial Integrated Resource Plan, or IRP, which was filed with the Georgia Public Service Commission late last month."
