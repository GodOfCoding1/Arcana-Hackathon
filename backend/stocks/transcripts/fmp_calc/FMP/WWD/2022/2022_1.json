    "content": " Aerospace segment earnings as a percent of segment net sales are expected to increase over last fiscal year by approximately 200 to 300 basis points primarily due to increased sales volume in both commercial OEM and aftermarket, partially offset by lower guided weapon sales and the anticipated return of annual variable incentive compensation costs. You also heard us mention the COVID-related disruptions that impacted Aerospace, $42 million in the quarter as those abate, and we're able to pick up on that sales volume, that will flow through, which will then, as you mentioned, will be offset partially by the annual incentive compensation coming back into the business. And at this juncture, it seems too early to tell with one quarter in the books, but perhaps the back half of the year points to that commercial aftermarket acceleration and the acceleration of some of the aftermarket business, offsetting some of the impacts we're seeing here. And so that it's really interesting, but... A lot of things -- the way I look at our business is we've got -- if you took our trajectory, put it -- carve out this two-year pandemic pause, we're going to see something on the order of that coming back, and that's what we've communicated, but that's one way to look at it."
