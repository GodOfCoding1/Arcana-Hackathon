    "content": " Fixed fee revenues were $8.6 million, an increase of 10% year-over-year. Variable fee revenues were $4.9 million, a decrease of 16% year-over-year. In the third quarter of 2022, our largest 2 customers, including their related affiliates, comprised 41% and 26% of revenues. As previously mentioned, we have updated our guidance for both revenues and operating expenses such that the net effect is to raise fiscal year 2022 expected income from operations compared to our previous guidance of revenues and operating expenses. Revenues from fixed fee customers other than our largest customers, saw good positive growth in the quarter, further diversifying our customer base. We now expect fiscal year 2022 operating expenses which includes cost of revenue to be in the range of $38.8 million to $40.3 million, less than our guidance last quarter of $42.5 million to $44 million."
