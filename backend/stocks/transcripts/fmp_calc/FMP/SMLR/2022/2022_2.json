    "content": " For the quarter ended June 30, 2022, revenue was $14.8 million, an increase of 4% compared to the corresponding period of 2021 of $14.3 million. Furthermore, we also had a 40% increase in equipment sales to all HRA customers during the quarter, which supports our thesis about seasonality of 2022 compared to 2021. In the second quarter of 2022, our 2 largest customers, including their related affiliates, comprised 38% and 32% of revenues. Operating expenses, which includes the cost of revenue, were $9.6 million, an increase of 23% year-over-year from $7.8 million. And one of the things in particular that we highlighted in our remarks was that the sales for equipment revenue to our HRA customers did increase 40% during the second quarter, which is one of the reasons that it gives us confidence in both our revenue guidance and in thinking that the seasonality this year will be less severe than it was last year."
