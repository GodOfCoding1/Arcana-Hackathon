    "content": " We migrated credit investments upward towards high quality assets with 64% of credit investments in AAA rated assets that achieved a total 18% annualized total return during the third quarter, and we repurchase shares of capital stock that accreted $0.07 per share during the third quarter and $0.27 per share year-to-date to book value. As of quarter end, 11% of the company's credit portfolio consists of a high performing interest only investment in low LTV non-QM residential mortgages, for which the return is principally predicated on rates instead of credit, and the average coupon of the underlying mortgages is approximately 400 basis points out of the money. Having monetized $42 million from our third quarter SFR sale and another expected $29 million from our pending fourth quarter SFR sale for a total of $71 million, Arlington is an attractive investment platform in a strong and flexible position with low leverage, high return assets, sound overall credit quality and substantial liquidity available from our current balance sheet configuration. It's a little early, yet for some of those to take advantage of and as I said, in the meantime we will remain in a capital preservation mode first, and stay with the formula that's derived as value for shareholders over the last year, year and a half, two years, which is keeping leverage modest, keeping liquidity high, reserving capital, staying in high credit quality assets and seeking to drive double digit returns on capital in intelligent investments, and at the same time seeking to use where we can our repurchase authorization, which has obviously been an important emphasis for us now for a good long while."
