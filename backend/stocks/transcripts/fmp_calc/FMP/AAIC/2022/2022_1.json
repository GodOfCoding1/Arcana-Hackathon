    "content": " Set a course to transition the company from a primarily levered agency MBS-oriented strategy to one focused on establishing multiple, high return, non-commodity investment channels in mortgage servicing rights, single-family rental properties and select credit investments that would both diversify investment risk and improve the reliability of returns over time, to reduce leverage and diversified funding sources, including using structural leverage. Double digit returns from its MSR and credit portfolio since the beginning of 2021, including a 53% annualized return from the MSR portfolio and high teens returns from our credit portfolio, significant progress towards building our SFR portfolio, including the opportunity to capture a substantial gain and associated 7% book value pickup during the second quarter. In addition, during the month of April the company's book value per shares remained relatively unchanged that does not include the potential approximate $0.45 per share gain associated with the SFR buck sale, which represents an increase of 7% over first quarter book value. During the first quarter, the company returned capital to shareholders by repurchasing over 3% of outstanding shares that accreted $0.09 per share to book value an equivalent \u2013 and offer an equivalent annualized given and yield of 10.4% based on the average stock price during the quarter. We have strong conviction about Arlington's differentiated strategy, and we believe that the company's diversified investment platform can generate strong returns that will deliver ongoing substantial returns of capital shareholders and growth in book value that the market will recognize and value over time."
