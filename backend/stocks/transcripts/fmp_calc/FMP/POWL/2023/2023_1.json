    "content": " In the first quarter of fiscal 2023, we reported net revenue of $127 million compared to $107 million, or 19%  higher versus the same period in the prior year. This improved orders cadence is generally favorable across most of our reported market sectors, however, was driven in large part this past quarter by the gas markets within the industrial sector, driving the total reported bookings for the first fiscal quarter to nearly a two fold increase or $104 million higher versus the same period one year ago."
