In the third quarter of fiscal 2022, we reported revenue of $135 million, higher by $20 million or 17% versus the same period in the prior year, and higher sequentially by 6%. New orders booked for the third fiscal quarter of 2022 were $202 million, $98 million higher versus the prior year and $51 million higher sequentially. Compared to 1 year ago, domestic revenues were higher by 16% versus the prior year to $103 million, while international revenues were 19% higher compared to the prior year, driven by strong activity across our U.K. and Canadian operations. In the third quarter of fiscal 2022, we reported net income of $9.1 million or $0.76 per diluted share compared to a net loss of $2 million or a loss of $0.17 per diluted share in the third quarter of fiscal 2021. During the third quarter of fiscal 2022, net cash used in operating activities was $15 million as the business continues to build working capital, reflecting the increased orders cadence and higher levels of backlog."
