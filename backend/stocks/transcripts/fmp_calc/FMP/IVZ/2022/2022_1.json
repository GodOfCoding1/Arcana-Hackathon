    "content": " Our Active Fixed Income business remained strong, generating long-term net inflows of $2.5 billion in the first quarter, including $2.2 billion from Greater China. Within Greater China, our JV had net long-term inflows of $3.2 billion in the quarter and our business in China continues to be a source of strength and diversification and we expect continued strong growth in the year -- years ahead, while recognizing the near-term headwinds in China. Given the strong momentum in growth in our business, the Board has also approved a 10% increase in the quarterly dividend and as we look forward we will determine the magnitude first, excuse me, delivering consistent organic growth, together with our disciplined approach to expense management, which should enable us to generate attractive operating margins over the long-term, while at the same time, allowing us to continue investing in growth and the efficiency of our global business. As Marty noted earlier, our diversified platform generated net long-term inflows in the first quarter of $17.2 billion, representing nearly 6% annualized organic growth. The retail channel generated net long-term inflows of $10.4 billion in the first quarter, driven by inflows in the global ETF products. From an asset class perspective, we continue to see broad strength in Fixed Income in the first quarter with net long-term inflows of $4.8 billion. Strength of our alternative platform can be seen through the flows that is generated over the past five quarters, with net long-term inflows totaling nearly $27 billion, representing a 12% organic growth rate over this time, when excluding the impact of the GTR net outflows. Net inflows into Global ETFs over this period were $66 billion, which is a growth rate of 17% and new fees from these flows were $130 million, a 16% increase over the prior 12 months. Your line is open. Your line is open. Then, you look at the passive net revenue yield and some of the declines there and that\u2019s really a more, I\u2019d say, recent impact of some of the really sizable low fee large institutional Index mandates that we put into the AUM mix last year, think IOOF, as well as some of the growth of our ETFs in EMEA and the Innovation Suite, which while the Innovation Suite is fee generating, it will be on the slightly lower end of our passive fee rate. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open."
