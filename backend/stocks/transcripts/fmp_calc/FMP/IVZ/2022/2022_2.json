    "content": " Against this backdrop for the industry and despite seeing the first net long term outflows quarter in two years, our diversified product line has maintained net inflows in key capability areas, notably ETFs, active fixed income, Greater China, where we maintain leadership positions. Despite broad based growth and key capabilities and net outflows and equity strategies were $7.7 billion in this quarter and drove overall net negative outflows in active global equities, in particular, we experienced net outflows in investor preference for risk off trades, led to higher reductions in the quarter, including our developing markets fund, we saw $2.6 billion of net outflows. But I think we've really demonstrated over the last couple of years that we have ample ability to invest in our business and grow our capabilities and really thinking about some of our key growth capabilities like private markets, our fixed income platform, our ETF franchise, our China JV, all the areas where you're really seeing us demonstrate the growth pretty consistently over the last several quarters. If you think about what was driving net revenue yield inside of the quarter, I mean, it is almost entirely explained by the declining equity markets and then secondarily, but also very importantly, the continued growing asset mix shift that we're experiencing towards our passive products. You have some positive offsets in that just in terms of the abatement of money market waivers and an extra day in the quarter, but net revenue yield really is pretty simply explained by the overall declining equity markets and the pressure we experienced in that along with the mix shift in our AUM."
