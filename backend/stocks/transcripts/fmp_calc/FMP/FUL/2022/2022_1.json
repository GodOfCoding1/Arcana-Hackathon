    "content": " Hygiene, Health and Consumable Adhesives first quarter organic sales increased 21% year-over-year with revenue growth in every end market and very strong results in packaging, health and beauty and tapes and labels. Engineering Adhesives top line results continued to be extremely strong in Q1 with organic revenue up over 17% versus last year, reflecting share gains and strong pricing execution. Normalizing for that unfavorable weather impact on our business last year, CA's organic growth still would have exceeded 30%. Construction Adhesives' EBITDA margin of 14.1% is up 600 basis points versus the first quarter of 2021 and driven by significant volume leverage, pricing gains and strong operational execution. Overall, when considering our strategic pricing actions, coupled with the solid volume growth we now expect full year organic revenue growth of between 15% and 20% versus 2021. All 3 GBUs had double-digit organic growth versus 2021 with Construction Adhesives up over 38% year-on-year and HHC and Engineering Adhesives up 21 and 17%, respectively, against what was a very strong first quarter last year for both GBUs. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter of $113 million was up 12% versus the same period last year, and adjusted earnings per share of $0.80 increased 21% versus the first quarter of last year driven by strong volume growth, pricing gain and good cost controls offsetting higher raw material costs. We're really pleased with how that's going, and good, strong growth, really solid bottom line delivery on that business, mostly driven by innovation."
