    "content": " The decline in adjusted EPS, a normalized FFO per share of $0.12 compared with the prior year quarter, primarily resulted from an EBITDA decline of $10.8 million or $0.06 per share due to the earnings disruption at our 3,060-bed La Palma Correctional Center, the second largest facility in our portfolio, as we continue to transition from ICE populations to populations from the state of Arizona, pursuant to a new management contract that commenced in April for up to 2,706 inmates."
