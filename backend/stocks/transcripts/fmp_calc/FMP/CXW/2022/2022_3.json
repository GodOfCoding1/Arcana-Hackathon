    "content": " Moving now to the results of the third quarter of this year, we generated revenue of $464.2 million, which was a decline of only 1.5% compared to the prior year quarter despite the non-renewal of contracts with the United States Marshals Service at our Leavenworth Detention Center and our West Tennessee Detention Facility in 2021 and the non-renewal of a contract with Marion County, Indiana at the managed-only Marion County Jail effective January 31 of this year. The decline in normalized FFO per share of $0.19 compared to the prior year quarter included an EBITDA decline of $11.8 million or $0.08 a share due to the earnings disruption at our 3,060-bed La Palma Correctional Center, the second largest facility in our portfolio, as we continue to transition to populations from the State of Arizona pursuant to a new management contract that commenced in April for up to 2,706 inmates."
