    "content": " As I review and think about our Q2 results, I'm generally happy with the 30-plus percent year-over-year growth in our Platform revenue and the continued growth in our Transaction revenue and the cash flow and EBITDA performance versus the same period last year. Platform revenue increased 31% to $2.1 million, primarily driven by a net increase of Platform deployments over the last 12 months, including 34 net new deployments in the second quarter and upselling of current Platform customers. Annual recurring revenue or ARR, at the end of the quarter stood at $8.8 million, up 5% sequentially and 28% year-over-year, reflecting our continued sales and upselling efforts and low churn of existing Platform customers. Total operating expenses in the quarter were $3.7 million compared to $3.3 million in the prior year quarter, due primarily to higher noncash stock-based compensation costs and higher discretionary sales and marketing spend."
