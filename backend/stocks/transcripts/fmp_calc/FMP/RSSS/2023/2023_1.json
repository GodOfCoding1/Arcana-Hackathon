Total revenue for the first quarter of fiscal 2023 was $8.7 million, a 12% increase from the first quarter of fiscal 2022. We ended the quarter with $8.3 million in annual recurring revenue, up 33% year-over-year and 5% sequentially, reflecting our continued sales and upselling efforts and low churn of existing platform subscribers. All that said, net income for the first fiscal quarter was $215,000 or $0.01 per diluted share compared to a loss of $372,000 or $0.02 per share in the prior year quarter. This is especially significant given that in the first quarter, we paid our executive bonuses for fiscal year 2022, some large commission accelerators related to our strong sales performance at the close of our fiscal year 2022 and also a material amount of publisher royalties."
