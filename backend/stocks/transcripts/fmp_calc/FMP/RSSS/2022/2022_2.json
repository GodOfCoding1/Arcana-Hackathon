    "content": " And good afternoon, everyone. When combined with our low-churn and upselling of renewal customers, we reported a 36% year-over-year increase in ARR, 56 new platforms and 566,000 of net ARR growth, the ladder of two were both records. And good afternoon, everyone. 7:22 Platform revenue increased 31% to $1.6 million, primarily driven by a net increase of platform deployments from last year, including 56 net new deployments in the second quarter, and strong upsells of current platform customers. As a result, annual recurring revenue at the end of the quarter stood at $6.8 million, up 9% sequentially and 36% year-over-year, reflecting our continued sales and upselling efforts and low churn of existing platform customers. So we will continue to have kind of our executive level salespeople that are used to dealing with large accounts, focused on things that are a little larger from a user account perspective, the new team will be brought in to work on the smaller accounts, which will be kind of a lower OTE role, mostly a telemarketing job, and will pursue the 100,000 to 150,000 accounts that we've identified that fall into that segment from a user \u2013 from a number of users perspective. I think the one view that we have is that at some point here, as we add these customers to the platform, we do feel like it has to make a turn, we're just trying to, as Roy said, it's kind of hard to see right now, when that turn is going to happen. But in future versions of our software, we will literally proactively tell the researcher, one of two things, either, hey, here's five other articles that are similar to this search you did and these articles that you acquired or we actually want to get to the point where we can say over the last week, these new articles were released by these publishers that are related to the research project that you're working on."
