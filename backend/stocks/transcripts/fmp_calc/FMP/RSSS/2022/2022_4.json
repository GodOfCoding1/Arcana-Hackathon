I'd like to pass the call over to Bill to walk through our fiscal fourth quarter and 2022 year-end financial results in detail, and then I'll wrap up with some more comments related to our products, strategy and M&A. Our platform subscription revenue increased 32% to $1.9 million primarily driven by a net increase in platform, annual recurring revenue bookings and deployments from last year, including a new company record of $573,000 in incremental ARR bookings in the fourth quarter along with 53 net new deployments. We ended the quarter with $7.9 million in annual recurring revenue, up almost 8% sequentially and 35% year-over-year, reflecting our continued sales and upselling efforts and low churn of existing platform subscribers. As we look towards the first quarter of fiscal year 2023, we are seeing some early signs of growth in the transaction business in addition to our normal growth in the platform business. In addition, our operating expenses will be below the levels we experienced in Q3 and Q4 of last fiscal year 2022, resulting in positive adjusted EBITDA for the quarter and a shot at positive GAAP net income. I don't know if it was 90% or high 90% because what I was trying to think of is if I took this quarter's revenue, and then I took your incremental ARR that you add, and if I assume you recognized half of that quarterly or if you kept that ARR at that same level for four quarters next year, and you recognized half of it as revenue on top of it, I come up with a number of \u00e2\u0080\u0093 for revenue, but then I think I have to reduce it for penetration or customers that you'd lose."
