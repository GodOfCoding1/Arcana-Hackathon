If I could just sneak one last one in just on the CapEx going forward, I understand it's elevated this year as you're opening up these new sites, but in the past call CapEx is kind of spend more in the $30 million to $35 million range. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. All right, thank you. Your line is now open. So if somebody wants to buy a 100 megawatts worth of electricity for MISO in 2023, for the 2023 calendar year, which is June first of 2023 through May 31, 2024, they could come to us and say, right, how are we would like to buy a 100 megawatt capacity from \u00e2\u0080\u0093 here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the terms of that we agreed to. Your line is now open.

Your line is now open. All right, thank you."
