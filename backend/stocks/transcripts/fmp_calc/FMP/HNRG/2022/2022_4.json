Your line is open. Your line is open. And what I mean by that is, so if you looked at in February of 2021 in Texas, when they had the five-day outage was storm Yuri, you saw several power producers who had sold, say, $50 per megawatt power were hit by that storm and couldn't produce and we're forced to cover at $9,000 a megawatt hour in the Texas market, and we're bankrupted pretty quickly. Though you better to lock in margins ahead at, say, $50 per megawatt hour or $40-some per megawatt hour or are you better to have your generator less sold and ramped up and ready to go during these Maxgen events where we're seeing power prices in the hundreds of dollars or sometimes even thousands per megawatt hour.

Your line is open. Your line is open."
