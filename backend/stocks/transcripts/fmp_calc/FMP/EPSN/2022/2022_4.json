    "content": " In Oklahoma, production was up to 2.6 MMcfe per day, a 30% increase over last year as we participated in the drilling of two gross wells, 0.26 net and the completion of three gross wells, 0.7 net for a total capital cost of $4 million net to Epsilon. And it kind of leads me to my second question would be, last year, as you reported, you spent $6 million or $7 million buying back stock, but the number of shares really didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fall hardly at all. Could I also ask, I think, I was waiting, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know if anybody else was to see whether new management would continue or change the dividend policy, and in your press release, you kind of, A, you did do that; and B, in the press release, you kind of you kind of trumpet it a little bit as if it was part of your -- of a steady outlook in terms of the companies going forward in terms of your capital allocation."
