    "content": " Thank you operator and on behalf of the management team, I'd like to welcome all of you to today's conference call to review Epsilon's third quarter 2022 financial and operating results. Year-to-date, we have totaled $41.5 million and adjusted EBITDA up 173% from the same period last year, and $26 million in free cash flow up 189% over the same period last year. We have a debt free balance sheet with a growing cash position, which has allowed us to return $3.1 million to shareholders in the third quarter and $10.7 million year-to-date through quarterly dividends and share repurchases. So our gathering system, we have adequate capacity for any additional activity and in Tennessee, it's a seasonal issue - on terms of takeaway capacity as we get into winter, and in basin demand and Northeastern demand kick in, you're going to see a lot more draw there in October and November. Now, in terms of just a follow-up question about the opportunities you're looking at, when I look in, I think many investors look at natural gas type oriented companies today that are publicly traded the shares seem pretty cheap, even at substantially lower gas prices."
