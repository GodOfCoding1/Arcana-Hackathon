    "content": " Subscription services revenue increased 100% year-over-year in the second quarter, benefiting from our location growth and increased product adoption as both new and existing customers leverage more of our platform. As of the end of Q2, 61% of our Toast locations use four or more products on top of our integrated POS and payment solution, but even a higher percentage of new live customers join the platform with four or more products. With our gross sales team now complementing the e-commerce solution and all those reps selling our full array of products, we have an opportunity to drive deeper adoption of our products like xtraCHEF and Payroll and help customers leverage more of our integrated platform to create value for their business. Looking at our recurring stream, subscription and fintech gross profit totaled $169 million, up 67% year-over-year, driven by our continued location growth and strong ARPU increases across both SaaS and fintech solutions. It starts with xtraCHEF, and that's why we're seeing momentum with xtraCHEF, but it's going to go beyond xtraCHEF with innovations in the back office that help restaurants understand their menu profitability, understand where they're wasting money, understand where they can drive better pricing and better food costs, as I mentioned. And I think the thing that we're most focused on is continue to invest in our go-to-market team and our customer-facing teams because we know that as we increase tenure on the sales reps and we increase market density, that's the number one driver of efficiency and growth in our business."
