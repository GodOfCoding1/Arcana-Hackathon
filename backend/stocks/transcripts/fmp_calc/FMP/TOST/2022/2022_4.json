    "content": " We are still in the early stages of our potential market opportunity even after our growth over the last few years, less than 10% of U.S. restaurant locations around the Toast platform, and our Q4 ARR only represents about 2% of the $55 billion market opportunity, leaving a long runway of growth ahead as we continue to execute. We're still in the early stages of a generational opportunity to be the restaurant industry's trusted technology partner with smart targeted investments in product innovation to continue to expand our industry-leading platform combined with the same consistent disciplined execution we delivered in 2022, we believe we have a long runway of top and bottom line growth ahead. In Q4, we added approximately 5,500 net new locations, increasing the total number of live locations on our platform to approximately 79,000, our differentiated go-to-market approach and the strong execution of our sales team led to consistent strong net location adds throughout the year, enabling us to sustain approximately 40% year-over-year location growth. Subscription revenue and fintech gross profit, the key components of our recurring revenue totaled $232 million in Q4, up 73% year-over-year, driven by our continued location growth and healthy ARPU growth across both SaaS and fintech. Subscription services revenue grew 76% year-over-year in Q4, while total SaaS ARPU increased nearly 20% and is up by more than 50% from 2 years ago as we continue to see new customers join the platform with higher ARPU and existing customers adopt more products. So I think our platform becomes really valuable in tough market conditions, and that's what we're seeing with things like our SaaS ARPU growth and customers using more modules on the platform."
