    "content": " For the first quarter we generated $11.4 million of revenue, an increased $5.7 million or 100% higher than the same period in 2021. We saw steady accelerated growth and during the first quarter our SSP platform processed an average of over 90 billion monthly impressions, which is an increase of 93% over the same period last year, and served approximately 69,000 buyers, which is an increase of 87% over last year's performance. As Mark stated, our revenue doubled to $11.4 million in the first quarter of '22, an increase of $5.7 million or 100% over the $5.7 million in the same period of '21. Operating income increased to $0.6 million for the first quarter of '22, compared to a loss of approximately $26,000 in the same period of '21. Adjusted EBITDA increased 113% to $1.1 million for the first quarter, compared to $0.5 million in the first quarter of '21. As mentioned earlier, we went public in February, and we raised approximately $15.4 million from our IPO proceeds from the issuance of 2.8 million shares, which represents around a 20% public float, and used these proceeds to pay for transaction costs, as well as the necessary redemption of equity units held by the former owner of Orange142 in order to take the company public. In regards to what we're seeing thus far, we're not going to give forward guidance as it relates to the out-quarters, but what we saw in Q1, and what we saw in Q4 was a nice healthy trend from our model that we've set up, adding new publishers and adding new buyers and adding new DSPs that we work with."
