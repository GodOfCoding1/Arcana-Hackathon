    "content": " We delivered on our product roadmap for the year and we've made significant progress with our partner network and we signed a definitive agreement to acquire Apex Crypto, which we believe will enable us to break into new client verticals and tap into a universe of 5 million crypto enabled accounts. We mentioned before the elongation that we see in the decision cycles about when the right time to enter the market is with our platform based partners you mentioned MasterCard, for example, what continues on the integration of our systems on working to develop together with a strong focus on crypto rewards. I think the ability for Caesars Rewards customers to be able to use those rewards to purchase crypto and that gives us access to millions of customers is a good example of this passive acquisition, this new way to earn as something that is still showing relevance in the market."
