    "content": " Apex Crypto has more than 30 Crypto trading clients, including leading fintechs and the addition of these clients to our already robust platform will enable us to scale faster, reach new client segments and offer advanced crypto solutions sooner to earn significant revenue and bolster our path to profitability. Aside from the cash payment of 55 million at closing, the purchase price includes contingent consideration of up to $145 million of back stop and seller notes to Apex FinTech solutions based on achieving financial targets that drive significant incremental revenue to back the transaction of value of this deal is clearly linked to the financial performance of the Apex Crypto business. Apex Crypto already has approximately five million crypto enabled accounts and we expect to continue to add more volume to the platform with future growth potential for BS other products and services To deepen these customer relationships through Apex FinTech solutions, we will jointly target more than 220 clients to grow future revenue together. We ended the third quarter with $273.7 million of available cash in other highly liquid assets, which we believe leaves us with significant liquidity to self-fund our roadmap and financed the cash component of the Apex crypto transaction. As a result, we really don't have the material financial impact from declining crypto prices and as we scale our crypto offerings with the addition of Apex Crypto and new partners coming online, we would expect to see growth in crypto even with some volatility as it's as a revenue opportunity."
