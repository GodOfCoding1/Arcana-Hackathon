    "content": " As crypto shifts from being viewed as an investable asset to more widespread utility across consumers, businesses and institutions, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re excited to work with our partners to unleash its full functionality and utility. With complexity that comes with crypto and an increasing regulatory focus, the Bakkt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s platform continues to grow in relevance to partners that see the staying power of digital assets. By working with our partners and making our capabilities available to their clients, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re better able to drive awareness and adoption of Bakkt crypto products that in turn can reach millions of customers. Well, we're very focused on this, enabling the ability for our partners to allow their consumers to directly deposit and withdraw crypto to the Bakkt platform remains a top priority. So we -- at this point, while not giving guidance beyond 2022 at this point, our longer-term expectation has always been that we can work with this investment to activate our products and activate partnerships to get to an adjusted EBITDA, breakeven EBITDA in year 3, which would basically be 2024, if you look at when that time line began with the transaction."
