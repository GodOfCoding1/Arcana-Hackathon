    "content": " Our dollar-based net retention ticked down to 122%, while our gross renewal rates remain as high as ever, like others in the industry, we're seeing customers take longer to sign new and expansion deals with us. I think it would be very challenging today for somebody to replicate the network that we have, and that network continues to allow us to deliver more and more services, whether that's our traditional application services, the act one products; our Zero Trust services, the act two products or even the super cloud products that we have with brokers, which are our act three products, all of those rely on that network and the efficiency that it has. The fact that we are today somewhere in front of 20% to 25% of the web means that for customers that use our Zero Trust products, if they are going to that 20%, 25% of the web that uses us, then they never have to leave Cloudflare\u00e2\u0080\u0099s network, and we can deliver a much more significant product. And then the second thing that we're seeing is that in our act three products, a lot of times, we're seeing as customers are coming to their partners to say, we're looking to consolidate vendors, we're looking to save money on some of our cloud spend that we're seeing more and more that Cloudflare is a solution that is in the toolkit for people who are trying to figure out how they can save money."
