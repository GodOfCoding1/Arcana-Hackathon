A10's high-throughput low-latency solution, which also supports security encryption across this customer's network infrastructure, ensure the customer's existing revenue streams, while expanding their ability to generate new revenue streams. Third quarter revenue was a record $72.1 million, up 10.2% year-over-year. Product revenue for the quarter was $45.1 million representing 62.6% of total revenue, up 13.3% year-over-year. Revenue from Asia-Pacific including Japan was $24.9 million, up 12.4% compared to $22.1 million in the third quarter last year. Non-GAAP operating expenses in Q3 were $38.3 million compared to $38.1 million in the third quarter last year, reflecting strategic investments in our growth priorities including cybersecurity technology and commercial execution. Non-GAAP net income for the quarter was $15.9 million or $0.20 on a per share basis, up 18% from $0.17 per share in the third quarter of 2021. So when we look at relative to the peer group revenue growth this year, year-over-year as well as if you look at market indices like Gartner IT Spending or CapEx and telcos and things like that we believe that growing at 10% to 12% represents us driving, improving commercial execution and product portfolio that helps us grow faster."
