    "content": " During the course of today's call, management will make forward-looking statements, including statements regarding its projections for future operating results, including potential revenue growth, industry and customer trends, and its focus and investment in go-to-market strategy and infrastructure, our capital allocation strategy, M&A opportunities, supply chain constraints and expectations and positioning, and repurchases and dividend programs and its market share. As Dhrupad mentioned, revenue in the first quarter was $62.7 million, up 14.3% year-over-year. Revenue from Asia, including Japan, was $17.8 million, down 10.8% compared to $20 million in the first quarter last year. Recurring revenue, defined as support and subscription revenue grew 8.9% year-over-year to $27.9 million in the first quarter, which is within our target range of between 45% and 50% of revenue. Non-GAAP operating expenses in Q1 were $38.6 million compared to $32.5 million in the first quarter last year, reflecting increasing investment in our growth priorities, including cybersecurity and commercial execution. So while we get some obviously productivity as well, we also expect with increasing revenue variable sales compensation goes up and on a year-over-year basis, travel and entertainment and event spending goes up on a year-over-year basis, roughly $2 million a year."
