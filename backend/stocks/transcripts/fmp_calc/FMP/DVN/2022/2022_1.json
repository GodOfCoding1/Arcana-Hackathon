With these curtailments back online and more than 80 development wells scheduled to initiate first production, we expect Devon\u2019s volumes to increase by around 3% to nearly 600,000 Boe per day in the upcoming quarter. Overall, this strong cost performance couple with exposure to higher value production expanded Devon\u2019s field level cash margin by 17% quarter-over-quarter to nearly $50 per Boe.
