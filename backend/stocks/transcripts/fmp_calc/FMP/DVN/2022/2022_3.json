    "content": " However, I can confidently say that our Delaware asset will continue to be the focal point of our capital program, and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re focused on designing a plan with consistent activity levels that delivers the right balance between returns, capital efficiencies and free cash flow. Although we could pull back on less efficient rigs when considering the incremental activity we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve recently added in the Delaware, we still expect to experience some additional upward pressure on costs as contracts refresh, especially in the second half of the year, but price discovery is still ongoing and very sensitive to industry activity levels and commodity pricing. Devon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s consistent quarterly performance exemplifies the importance of balancing three things: first, the value of well-communicated, consistent and long-term business strategy; second, a 24-plus month planning process that details out the development schedule, supply chain, the takeaway needs and any potential pinch points; and third, and critically important, near-term execution, AKA getting it done."
