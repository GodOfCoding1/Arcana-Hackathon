    "content": " Notwithstanding, we continued lower volume and pressure from rising costs, Q1 operating income for the legacy Goodyear business is more than 20% above pre-pandemic 2019 levels and including Cooper operating income is up nearly 60% over the same timeframe. Sales from Goodyear's legacy business increased 20%, excluding foreign currency, driven by price/mix improvements and volume growth. Replacement volume increased $2.1 million, reflecting a strong winter tire season as well as continued share gains in our legacy European consumer replacement business. I think, generally speaking, the pricing actions that we took last year, we would have to take pricing actions in similar amounts in order to stay ahead of the raw material costs that we're going to see."
