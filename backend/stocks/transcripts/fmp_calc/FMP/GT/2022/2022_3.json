    "content": " So I think all of those are reasons that I'm pretty optimistic about the setup for the industry and for our ability to recover some of our margins by the time we get out in the middle of next year, which I think is -- I mean, something you've commented on, I think that optimism is there based on the way the -- we expect costs to evolve. So well, the -- I think, if we look out for the free cash flow outlook for next year, I mean, ultimately, they'll be influenced from the economic environment, but we don't expect to use significant cash for working capital next year. And obviously, we've got the non-raw material costs that are going to continue to be there as well, we feel -- based on the comments I made earlier, you can tell, we feel other than the questions around energy costs in Europe, I think we feel good about getting past some of those cost increases. We've taken some actions, and we're going to continue to focus on, not only getting value of the product in the marketplace, but also looking at the cost structure over there as we see some of the changes around energy costs, around what's happening in some of the geographies there to make sure that we're going to use this as an opportunity to set ourselves up for some of the upside that Darren talked about earlier. So when we're moving forward from the second quarter to the third quarter, you effectively see 4 things changing in the financial assumptions that relate to cash flow, 2 of them are more significant in that working capital increased from a use of about $300 million to a range -- or a use of $300 million to $500 million."
