    "content": " Continuing the trend we have seen since inflation began to accelerate at the end of last year, price/mix in the quarter was enough to offset not only higher raw material costs, but most other inflation, captured in two bars in the step chart labeled calculated inflation and efficiency excess inflation and other cost increases. The bar labeled cost triggered by Cooper merger is favorable this quarter, reflecting the non-recurrence of merger-related costs from last year, primarily the $40 million step up in the value of Cooper inventory as part of acquisition accounting. While material costs for the combined company are expected to be up by about $600 million for Q3, including the impact of the stronger dollar and higher transportation and supplier costs, we expect price/mix to continue to exceed raw materials similar to Q1 and Q2. The only nuance that I want to point out there, if we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re comparing Q3 to Q2, in Q2, the variance analysis for raw materials, which was the $419 million that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s shown on Slide 8, that is a good year of legacy business only for the raw material cost increase. I think that as we get to the point where materials and other costs flatten out, and perhaps even see raw materials starting to come back down, then I think that, that will put us in a really good spot to get to that 8% in, call it, the near-term, so the next couple of years. I think we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t like to get back to the \u00e2\u0080\u0093 to more of a historical situation where we \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and for many years, had seen cost inflation in the $30 million to $35 million a quarter. So, I think you can assume that the fourth quarter raw material costs, which if we get $1 billion for the second half and $600 million of it is in the third quarter, then that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s about $400 million."
