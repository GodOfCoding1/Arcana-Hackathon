    "content": " We can give no assurance that the expectations reflected in forward-looking statements will prove correct and various factors could cause results to differ materially from our expectations, including risks and factors identified in Balchem\u2019s Form 10-K. And our adjusted earnings from operations were $44.6 million, up 19.4% versus the prior year quarter. Our Human Nutrition and Health segment also delivered record quarterly earnings from operations of $20.3 million, an increase of $0.6 million or 3.1% compared to the prior year, primarily due to the aforementioned higher sales partially offset by higher manufacturing input costs and distribution costs along with increased compensation related costs within operating expenses. Animal Nutrition and Health deliver record earnings from operations of $11.3 million, an increase of 123.9% from the prior year quarter, primarily due to the aforementioned higher sales partially offset by increased manufacturing input costs and distribution costs due to inflation and higher compensation related costs within operating expenses. So plant nutrition really it has been a business now for the last 2.5 years, I want to say, we have been growing that business at 20% to 30% annually, which we feel really, really good about, and it has been a combination of introducing new products to the market, geographic expansion, and just expanding the number of crops and types of crops that, that we\u2019ve been on."
