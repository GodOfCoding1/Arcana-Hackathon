    "content": " Liquidity as of March 31 was -- March 31, 2022, was $71 million, and it does not include the benefits of the revolver we added in the $51 million revolver, it includes maybe a small portion, but not the entire as we'll make that revolver fully available to us during the course of this year. And our current business that we talk about on a healthcare segment or ITPS or our exchange for builds and payments business or our legal business, the fact that we won $78 million, which is over 130% increase year-over-year. The other part of our business, which is ITPS, if some of -- just for reference, ITPS business is $847 million in total over the last trailing 12 months. So that's another thing we plan to do fix with the help of the government agencies we work for and the business leaders who run that business to see if we can get that business with the backlog it has to start contributing, but at a level that it can produce higher -- much higher profits than it has done in the last several quarters. For reference, last quarter and for the last year, we had indicated modeling assumptions of revenue greater than $1.16 billion, gross profit margin greater than 23%-24% of revenue, adjusted EBITDA margin greater than 15% of revenue, CapEx levels of approximately 1.5% of revenue and working capital trends in line with historic levels. But we plan to add additional similar capacity, not large facilities, but small facilities, maybe $50 million to $100 million so that we could manage movements between equity and debt more efficiently to prepare for takeout of the -- take out of the maturities in 2023 and prepare for with performance, the refinancing of the overall 2026 debt."
