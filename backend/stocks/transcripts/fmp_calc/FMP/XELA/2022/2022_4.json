    "content": "  Our revenue for 2022 came in at $1.077 billion and our EBITDA -- adjusted EBITDA came in at $139.9 million, 7.7% revenue drop, while revenue dropped only 4% if you exclude the impact of rising costs, including inflation, tight job market, business mix, rising dollar, which was very negative against us this past year and onetime event. In closing, we would like to emphasize these 3 key objectives for 2023, which we covered on earlier slides: one, grow revenue and improve adjusted EBITDA; second, maintain growth investments, particularly in our cloud operations while keeping our maintenance CapEx at 1.5% levels; and third, target debt reduction in the range of $250 million to $500 million with strategic actions in progress to improve our liquidity and reduce total debt, thereby reducing cash interest."
