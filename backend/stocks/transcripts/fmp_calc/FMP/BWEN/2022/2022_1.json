    "content": " Our Heavy Fabrication segment saw orders of $34 million, a 64% increase over Q1 2021, while our Gearing segment booked $14 million of orders, a 42% increase year-over-year, following a record Q4 2021 due to continued strength in our energy and mining markets. First quarter sales were $27.3 million, up 20% when compared to $22.8 million in the prior year quarter as Industrial Fabrication throughput increased due to the strong order intake activity in 2021. As a result of this strength, orders totaled $14.1 million in Q1, up 42% from what was booked in the prior year quarter, and we\u2019ve begun to book orders into 2023. In our Heavy Fabrication segment, we\u2019re adding capabilities to improve our plant utilization and reduce costs as we continue to work with customers to sell remaining 2022 capacity in both towers and other industrial fabrication."
