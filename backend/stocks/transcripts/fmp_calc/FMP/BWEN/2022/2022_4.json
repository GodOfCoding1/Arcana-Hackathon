    "content": " In the fourth quarter 2022, we booked $205 million of new orders, an increase of nearly 270% from the prior-year period, with much of this improvement coming from wind. We generated revenue of $40 million in the fourth quarter, a year-over-year increase of 54%, with each Broadwind segment posting gains of 40% or more. We generated $0.2 million of EBITDA in the quarter, an increase of $1.4 million year-over-year, which includes the impact of a lower-margin tower order that we expect to finish during the first quarter 2023. Our Heavy Fabrication segment booked Q4 orders of $184 million, up nearly 500% year-over-year, including the $175 million order received late last year. Our total consolidated backlog at the end of Q4 was $297 million, an increase of 180% versus the prior-year period. Within our Heavy Fabrication segment, Q4 revenue was $24 million, a 61% increase year-over-year with wind towers and other industrial fabrications posting gains of 55% and 73%, respectively. Gearing revenue was $12 million, a 41% increase year-over-year, as customer activity continues to be strong within the energy and industrial sectors. Fourth quarter orders were $184 million, a nearly 500% increase from the prior-year period. Fourth quarter segment sales increased over 40% to $11.7 million versus the prior-year quarter, reflective of the growth we have been experiencing in most end markets. We generated $0.8 million of segment EBITDA in Q4, an increase of $0.6 million versus the prior-year quarter. Fourth quarter segment sales increased to $4.7 million from $3.0 million in the prior-year period, primarily as a result of the strong order intake levels we've been experiencing. EBITDA increased to $0.7 million, consistent with the increased sales volume when compared to the prior-year quarter."
