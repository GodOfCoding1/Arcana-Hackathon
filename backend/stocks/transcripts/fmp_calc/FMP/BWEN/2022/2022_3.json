    "content": " We booked $85 million of new orders in the third quarter, more than double the prior year period, with all segments posting significant increases. We generated revenue of $45 million in the third quarter, a year-over-year increase of 11%, led by growth in our Gearing segment and industrial fabrication product line, posting gains of 35% and 95%, respectively. Our Gearing and Industrial Solutions orders of $15.5 million and $6.1 million, respectively, were each up 34% year-over-year. Our total backlog at the end of Q3 was $132 million, an increase of 73% versus the prior year period. Within our Heavy Fabrication segment, revenue grew 7% to $31 million as non-wind demand offset a reduction in tower sections sold. Within Gearing, revenue was $10 million, a 35% increase year-over-year as customer activity continues to be strong within the energy and industrial sectors. Within the Heavy Fabrication segment, we experienced a nearly 100% increase in industrial fabrication revenue, a result of strong recent order intake and was offset by a 26% decrease in tower sections sold. Third quarter orders were $62.9 million, a 137% increase from the prior year period. Gearing orders were strong in Q3, totaling $15.5 million, up 34% versus the prior year period and nearly 75% sequentially. We generated $1.2 million of segment EBITDA in Q3, an increase of $0.7 million versus the prior year quarter and $1.1 million sequentially. As we look toward the remainder of the year and into 2023, we have increased visibility and stronger backlog across each of our operating segments as we continue to expand in new adjacent clean tech markets, such as solar, clean fuels, power and infrastructure, building on our legacy within wind."
