    "content": " Aside from the price volatility on our investments, we record a net interest income of $17 million during the first quarter, a 24% increase from the prior quarter, resulting from the continued growth in our residential loan portfolio. During the quarter, Arc Home generated after-tax net income of $7 million, driven by a mark-to-market gains on its MSR portfolio due to the rising rate environment, offset by reduced volumes, lower gain on sale margins and income tax expense, as our investment is held within a taxable REIT subsidiary."
