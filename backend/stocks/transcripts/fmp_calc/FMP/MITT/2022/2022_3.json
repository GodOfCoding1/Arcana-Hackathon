    "content": " Despite this, during the quarter, our adjusted book value per share declined 4.2% from $1.15 to $10.68, predominantly due to widening of credit spreads and securitization markets. Before I pass it to Nick to go into further detail on the portfolio, I think it's important to be transparent that given the amount of changes that have occurred this year in terms of interest rates and credit spreads, we are seeing more compelling opportunities in the secondary markets from 4 sellers of recently issued non-agency securities. When thinking ahead with a slower economy and weaker housing market, it's important to note that current LTV is 60% in the 60-day delinquent loan population across the over $4 billion of loans is less than 100 basis points. During the third quarter, book value declined by approximately 4% as a result of recording a GAAP net loss available to common shareholders of approximately $7.5 million or $0.33 per fully diluted share. During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 400,000 shares or 2% of our total outstanding at a weighted average price of $6.08 per share, representing a 43% discount to our September 30 adjusted book value."
