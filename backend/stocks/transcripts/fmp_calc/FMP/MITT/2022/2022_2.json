    "content": " We believe we have ample liquidity given the size of our book and as David mentioned, we used approximately $11 million of capital for share repurchases during the quarter at an average price of $7.70, which represented a 31% discount to our June 30th adjusted book value. This optimism was unfounded as levels experienced toward -- this optimism unfounded as a sell-off and risk free rates continued along with widening of credit spreads, what started primarily as AAA spread widening in the first quarter, expanded into the rest of the IG and non-IG stack ending with a meaningfully steepening of the credit curve. Although, the lengthening out of the non-securitized home loan book into widening spreads has caused significant unrealized losses this quarter, the expansion of the duration of our excess spread certificates on our securitized loans offset the credit spread widening on the retained subordinate certificates. During the second quarter, book value declined by approximately 16% as a result of recording a GAAP net loss available to common shareholders of approximately $53 million or $2.27 per fully diluted share."
