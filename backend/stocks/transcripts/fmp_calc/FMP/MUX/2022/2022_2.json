    "content": " Looking ahead, we expect Gold Bar South to be in production in the fourth quarter of this year, and it will be delivering more ounces, and lowering Gold Bar\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cost per ounce. At the Atlas pit, our highest grade past-producing open pit located 3 miles west of the Gold Bar mine, drilling got underway on three target areas proximal to the historic pit, including following up on hole OGB-010 drilled in 2021 that intersected 3.1 grams per tonne gold over 27 meters or about 90 feet at the East Atlas target. But now we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re also migrating toward looking at a very attractive targets that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been aware of and we have been planning to follow up in the future program, some of those targets will be deeper than have been drilled in the last year, 1.5 years, but also have the potential to \u00e2\u0080\u0093 with success bring meaningful improvement to our resource base, either at Stock or on Grey Fox."
