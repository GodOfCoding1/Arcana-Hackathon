    "content": " In addition, Gold Bar is implementing many actions to reduce cost and CapEx, for instance, the CapEx for the whole road construction and the heap leach expansion will be less than anticipated and our mining contractor is improving the product PBT of drilling and blasting since two months ago, which will certainly improve our cash per ounce going forward. In Q1 2022, McEwen Copper spent $9.8 million to advance the Los Azules Copper project, actively progressing drilling, road construction, technical studies and community engagements. So the $1.7 million spent in the first quarter is generally consistent with what would have been anticipated or what is anticipated based on our 2022 budget, which more or less  throughout the year with the flow through financing that was completed in March, we're now reviewing our program with the view of our plans through to the end of 2023 and that may impact planned spending in 2022 versus the original budget. So the nature of gold deposits are form that we expect mineralization will likely go much deeper and we will have exploration programs in the future to test that, but we've had drill intercepts of 400 meters to 500 meters approaching one gram per tonne at least in one of our holes -- I'm sorry 1% copper, I think it was 0.79% copper."
