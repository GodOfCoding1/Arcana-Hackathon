    "content": " On today's call, after my introductory remarks, Kent will review our ongoing preclinical activities for CB5138-3, our novel peptide for the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, or IPF, as well as our ongoing discovery efforts. We've also made significant progress in developing improved formulations for CB5138-3, and Kent and the team have identified some promising new approaches that we hope may provide further clarity on target engagement for this peptide, which while not essential for moving the program forward, may help inform biomarker selection for our clinical studies. As we move closer to filing the CB5138-3 IND, integrating the clinical strategy and development plans with the preclinical and IND-enabling activity remains a cornerstone of CohBar's approach to developing this product candidate for IPF."
