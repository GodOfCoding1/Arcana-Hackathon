    "content": " As of quarter end, holding all else equal and after considering the impact of income-based fees, we calculated that 100 basis point increase in short-term rates could increase our annual earnings by approximately $0.23 per share, a 14% increase above this quarter's core EPS run rate. A 200 basis point increase in short-term rates could increase our total annual earnings by approximately $0.44 per share, a 26% increase above this quarter's core EPS run rate. Our GAAP earnings per share for the first quarter of 2022 included net realized and unrealized gains on investments of $0.13 offset by a realized loss of $0.10 related to the repayment of our 2022 convertible notes, which were in the money as a result of the significant stock price appreciation and our dividend increases over the five years since the notes were issued. As of March 31, 2022, the weighted average yield on our debt and other income-producing securities at amortized cost was 8.9% and the weighted average yield on total investments at amortized cost was 8.1%, each increasing approximately 20 basis points from last quarter, supported by market interest rate levels as base rates rise. We believe Ivy Hill's success and profitability is also reflected in its $43 million first quarter dividend to ARCC, a $15 million increase from last quarter and the 48th consecutive quarter of Ivy Hill paying a stable or increasing quarterly dividend to Ares Capital. But the last couple of years, we've consisted on a 15-ish kind of percent rate of return coming from Ivy Hill in terms of the dividends at cost and the same underwriting standards and strategic view as to what we're doing here with the NEE portfolio remain in place."
