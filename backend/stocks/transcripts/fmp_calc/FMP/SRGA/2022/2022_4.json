    "content": " In February, we sold the Coflex and CoFix product lines in the United States and worldwide intellectual property rights therein to extend medical holdings for $17 million, a transaction that netted approximately $14.8 million in cash to Surgalign, cash, which was needed to extend our cash runway. Excluded from Q4, non-GAAP operating expense was a gain of approximately $683,000 are related to acquisition contain contingency, asset impairment and abandonment expense of $1.1 million, severance and restructuring costs of $1.1 million, and $1.1 million in non-cash stock-based compensation expense, as well as $18 million in transaction and financing expense. Given that we sold the business at the end of February, we expect to remove approximately $12 million in revenue for this in 2023, thus using $82 million as a starting point to determine 2023 revenue and then removing approximately $30 million for products that have been rationalized out and for Coflex being sold, that brings us to roughly $52 million in sales. As a starting point, we reported non-GAAP gross margin of 72.8% for the full year in 2022, with the Coflex business sale where we expect non-GAAP gross margin to decline in 2023 as it was a high gross margin product line generating about 17% of the our global revenue. As for the balance sheet, we had about $16 million in cash at year-end, netted about $15 million in cash by selling Coflex, and we'll have burned approximately $10 million by the end of Q1, so we'll have about $21 million as of the end of this first quarter of 2023."
