    "content": " On a non-GAAP basis, excluded from Q3 operating expense was a gain of approximately $6.7 million for accounting adjustments to the fair value of milestones, asset impairment, and abandonment in expense of $2.3 million, $1.2 million of noncash stock-based compensation expense and transaction and integration expense of $214,000. Adjusted EBITDA in Q3 was a loss of $11.2 million as compared to an adjusted EBITDA loss of $11.7 million in Q2, a $500,000 improvement primarily due to higher non-GAAP gross margin and lower operating expense. To put this in perspective, our Q3 financial results were roughly in line with Q2 with slightly lower revenue, offset by higher gross margins and lower operating expense on a non-GAAP basis, impacting our ability to grow in Q3 was product availability, hospital staffing shortages, lower procedural volumes and contract delays, but most impactful with the macro environmental issues in Europe."
