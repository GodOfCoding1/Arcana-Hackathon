    "content": " It\u2019s been a little less than two months since we reported our fourth quarter and 2021 annual results and discussed our most recent milestones, our equity investment in Inteneural Networks, which was late Q4 event, an FDA 510(k) clearance for our HOLO Portal surgical guidance system which occurred in the first quarter. Today, I\u2019ll provide more color around the market opportunity related to our Holo Surgical acquisition and Inteneural Networks investment, what we envisioned, what we\u2019ve accomplished and our strategy to bring these revolutionary technologies to the healthcare market. When our HOLO AI platform is integrated into a hospital\u2019s IT environment and leverage by healthcare providers, I believe we can become the first company in the world to deliver predictive outcomes related to the spine. Excluded from Q1 non-GAAP operating expense was approximately $939,000 in asset charges related to the impairment of instruments during the quarter, $916,000 in transactions and integration expenses related to issuance costs associated with newly issued warrants, non-cash stock based compensation expense of $1.4 million and a gain of $8.5 million for accounting adjustments to the fair value of milestones."
