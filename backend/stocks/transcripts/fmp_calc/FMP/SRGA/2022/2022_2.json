    "content": " We've made significant progress since our Q1 results with respect to innovation and new products brought to market, the early stage commercialization of our HOLO Portal surgical guidance system and other initiatives around the HOLO AI platform. We are confident that barring any unexpected macro environmental issues, the new slate of products along with the continued demand for CervAlign solutions, including the HOLO Portal system will lead to improvements in the second half of the year with Q4 being the strongest. The relaunch of CervAlign, our partnership with PRIA Healthcare for both Coflex and SImmetry grows from ortho-biologic products by ViBone Moldable and FibreX, which were launched in Q4 of last year, and revenue from our HOLO portal surgical guidance system."
