    "content": " On the bottom-line, our near-term performance sought further pressure from several gross margin factors, including higher inbound freight costs, a shift in product and channel mix towards our lower gross margin coolers, and equipment and wholesale business as we continue to support the channel sell through and build back of inventory. When we look at where the strength is -- we're incredibly pleased with our retention efforts and you think about the acquisition we've done over the last four, five years as we've grown our D2C business and really accelerated over the last two years, we're really pleased with the growth we've seen in the retention and the quality of that customer. As we said, we're still below pre-pandemic levels from an inventory position in the channel, as we continue to distribute innovation that we launched in Q2 through the channel for the rest of the year and continue to stay in front of the consumer, what I think happens and what we've seen in in the past happens is more challenging times, we have found that our wholesale partners get behind brands that turn and things that flow. As we go into the back half of the year, our expectation is that we're going to continue focus heavily on deploying our advanced analytics team and our dynamic marketing and performance marketing to go after acquisition, while also taking care of that incredibly valuable, incredibly powerful cohorts of customers that we've retained. And I think that's where you're really going to see and have seen this year that the power of the diversity of our channels to market really plays in YETI's favor, which allows us to drive high-teens growth in a market that I think could be qualify as uncertain."
