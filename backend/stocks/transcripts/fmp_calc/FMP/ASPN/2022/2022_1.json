    "content": " Our energy industrial revenues were up 10% year-over-year from $27.9 million in the same quarter last year, to $30.7 million in Q1 of this year, reflecting the industry's need to increase capacity while enabling alternate value chains. I think also both Ricardo and I use the phrase that these activities, and what you cited, Alex, give us the momentum and the confidence to make the statement that we feel that we're positioned to meet or exceed our $145 million to $155 million of outlook - revenue outlook.

Thanks so much, guys."
