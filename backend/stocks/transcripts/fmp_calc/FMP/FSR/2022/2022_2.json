    "content": " Fisker brand launches which we previously refer to as experience centers will offer prospective customers the opportunity to see and experience the Company's vehicles as well as speak with product experts on hand, depending on state loss, some Fisker Lounges showrooms will also offer test drives. We are not quite ready to announce that yet, but it's something that we clearly are planning for with or without that legislation, because making 250,000 vehicles in Ohio, you're going to need to have battery manufacturing in the U.S. And then just on the ATM 350 million ATM equity offering is there expiration to that tranche? I know we have a lot of investors on the call and I'm sure there's also a lot of people who has maybe ordered an ultra or even some investors that are audited and ultra, but ultimately, we are a business and what we are seeing right now is a very healthy demand for the extreme and the Ocean One."
