    "content": " While our third quarter revenues of $4.9 million were slightly softer than we had predicted due to orders moving to the right, we believe that this sets the stage for our better than expected fourth quarters during which we anticipate returning to profitability. As Rob mentioned earlier, revenues from continuing operations totaled $4.9 million in the quarter, a 41% decrease when compared to the $8.3 million in the same period a year ago. If you look ahead to our fourth quarter, based on our backlog and current delivery schedules, we expect to generate revenue of between $12 million and $14 million during the quarter, that level of revenue we expect to generate positive earnings from continuing operations. Just a quick way to view Q3 and Q4, should we really look at these as a composite, take them together as kind of a second half story and where you are as a company, which would imply kind of you are at a $9 million to $10 million per quarter rate. You have said you are going to be $100 million revenue run rate business, even with the projections of the fourth quarter, which I assume is picking up $3 million, $4 million, $5 million from the third quarter."
