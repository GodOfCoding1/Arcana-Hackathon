    "content": " As Rob mentioned earlier, revenues from continuing operations totaled $3.8 million in the quarter, resulting in a decrease of about 41% versus the $6.4 million reported in the same period a year ago. So any incremental orders or bookings, is this going to accentuate that growth year-over-year, the current end markets probably as strong as tailwind as you\u2019ve seen in the past 10 years, maybe in the past decade, as far as both defense and with oil being as high as it is. And given your anticipation of these orders coming in and building your working capital in expectation of that growth, that $23.5 million, is that obviously stuff that you anticipate getting delivered converting this year with incremental as we go through the year on that side of it?"
