    "content": " Specifically, excluding the impact of foreign exchange, we delivered constant currency growth across our key brands with Levi's plus 6% and Dockers plus 13%. Fourth, our direct-to-consumer business continued to deliver outsized growth of plus 8% in constant currency, which, by the way, Harmit and I will continue to refer to in the balance of our remarks, driven by increases across our stores and e-commerce business. Total company DTC channel grew 8%, owned and operated mainline and outlet stores grew in the third quarter mid-single digits with traffic and AURs, both up versus prior year. Direct-to-consumer channel net revenue grew 8%, driven by positive comp store sales across our mainline and outlet stores, including in the US due to increased traffic, higher AURs and  (ph). Adjusted gross margin in reported dollars was 56.9%, up more than 390 basis points versus 2019, yet contracting 60 basis points year-over-year, due to a 30 basis points unfavorable currency exchange rate impact, as well as the impact of higher product costs and lower full price sales, particularly in the US relative to last year, partially offset by price increases and a favorable channel mix. By focusing on what we can control, while building this business for the longer term, we have managed to offset nearly 75% of this downside We expect our full-year adjusted gross margin slightly down versus last years 57.9%, nearly 400 basis points higher than 2019. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open."
