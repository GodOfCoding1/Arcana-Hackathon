    "content": " Selling, general and administrative SG&A expenses were $45.2 million and $39.8 million for the quarters ended March 31, 2022 and March 31, 2021 which is consistent with the prior quarter and represents a fully burdened quarter as the company's not have approval until late January of 2021. And to put that into perspective, the top tier docs have, in some cases, 10 to 12 times the number of patients and we're talking a small number of patients per doc, but then the average lower decile, and our penetration there has continued to grow as we get, over the next couple of quarters we'll continue to share more as to what our both our depth and breadth of prescribers look like. If you believe 70% of patients honor at six months and make an assumption on where they are at 12 months, you carry a prescription start form right into the quarter and figure back what an attrition rate could look like in a quarter what our growth in PSS has to be."
