    "content": " Regarding our professional services revenue, which was $3.3 million versus $4.4 million in the first quarter of 2021 and as we stated in our earnings call in February related to our 2022 financial guidance, we assumed an intentional reduction in professional services revenue to better align with our current backlog and to drive a higher rate of net cash flow in alignment with the shift in our strategic business plan. Given this performance, free cash flow, defined as the net change in cash from December 31st 2021 to March 31st 2022, excluding the payment of our dividend of $6.5 million in March was a negative $6.7 million for the first quarter of 2022, compared with a negative $4.4 million in the same quarter of 2021. As such, given the material changes pursuant to our new strategic business plan, it is important to understand the pro forma cash impact to the negative $6.7 million in free cash flow just mentioned for the first quarter. Had these strategic changes been made as of January 1st 2022, including the cash impact for terminated employees of approximately $5.5 million and non-payroll Spok Go costs of approximately $1.1 million, there would have been an incremental $6.6 million cash benefit to free cash flow in the first quarter of 2022 resulting in essentially breakeven free cash flow. And additionally from a free cash flow perspective, Spok's cash outlays for year-end accruals made in the first quarter each year for 2022 totaled approximately $5.5 million."
