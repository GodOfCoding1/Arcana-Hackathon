    "content": " In addition to the highlights listed on the slide, other noteworthy fourth quarter performance included: a nearly 17% annual increase in year-over-year software operations bookings; next, we ended the year with a $44 million software backlog, up from the prior year and build our success in software operations bookings; third, quarterly unit erosion of our wireless pagers averaged less than 1%, resulting in a full year unit erosion of 3.5%, down 80 basis points from the prior year; next, we were able to implement a 28% reduction in year-over-year adjusted operating expenses, primarily through phased-in actions I outlined previously with respect to our strategic pivot; and as a result, we generated $5.6 million of adjusted EBITDA."
