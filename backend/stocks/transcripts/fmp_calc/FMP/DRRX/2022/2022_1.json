    "content": " At the pace of enrollment achieved in the first quarter of 2022, we would complete dosing the last patient in the AHFIRM trial in the mid of 2023. As with the Phase IIa trial, patients in the AHFIRM trial receive an infusion of larsucosterol or a placebo on Day 1, and if they are still in the hospital on Day 4 they receive a second infusion. The average hospitalization cost for an AH patient is approximately $56,000 for patients who survive the first 9 days and approximately $151,000 for those who do not survive. In addition to the clinical trial results, we also have supporting data from numerous in vivo animal models that demonstrates larsucosterol's activity against multi-organ failure, which can occur in AH patients. Given the high unmet need for hospitalized AH patients, the lack of current treatment options and the high mortality rates, we believe a robust survival benefit in the AHFIRM trial would support an NDA filing. We've completed a Phase Ia and Ib trial in more than 70 NASH patients that demonstrated reduced liver enzymes, fibrosis markers and liver fat stiffness and elasticity; reduced circulating fats, including triglycerides; reduced cell death markers; improved insulin resistance; and a good safety profile. At the pace of enrollment achieved in the first quarter of 2022, we would complete dosing the last patient in the AHFIRM trial in the middle of 2023."
