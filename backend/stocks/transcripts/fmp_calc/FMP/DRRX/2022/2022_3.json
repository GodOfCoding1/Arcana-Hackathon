    "content": " This is important to highlight as multi-organ failure is not only the primary driver of mortality in AH patients, but also reflects larsucosterol's potential to provide a benefit in multiple indications in addition to AH. So I think it certainly is a -- there's a substantial unmet need out there and we're looking to position ourselves to be able to get to these patients and help them, and obviously also help the local healthcare systems and turn our shareholders by bringing this to market internationally. That's a great question, and I think I think I'd like to hear both from Norman and from then follow up with Keith on this, but certainly we have looked to expand this to thoughts where initially where we had relationships with thought leaders and then spreading out to where the patients were and across not only the United States, but obviously in Australia, Europe, and the UK. Our side effect profile as we've seen the Phase IIA is fairly straightforward that we feel like because of those attributes and because AH is diagnosed anywhere, it's not just referrals to tertiary care centers, that there is the opportunity that any hospital that admits patients with AH, could potentially be prescribers and treaters with larsucosterol following positive top line results. Well I'll let definitely Norman speak mostly to this, but it really is in looking at the world today because what's happened is there are more livers available now for AH patients that weren't available back when hepatitis C was raging as hot as it was."
