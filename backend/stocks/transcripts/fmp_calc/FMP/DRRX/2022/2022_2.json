    "content": " As I mentioned, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re primarily focused on completing enrollment in our Phase IIb AHFIRM trial for larsucosterol in hospitalized patients with severe AH. We believe this primary endpoint, which now includes liver transplantation, in addition to mortality, better reflects the ability of a therapeutic such as larsucosterol to improve upon the current state-of-care for AH patients. Even so there are fewer than 10,000 liver transplants performed annually in the United States, with the majority going to patients with other ailments, meaning that only a small fraction of the 137,000 AH patients who are hospitalized annually in the United States are able to receive a liver transplant. In addition to the clinical trial results, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve generated supporting preclinical data from numerous in vivo animal models that demonstrates larsucosterol protection against the multi-organ failure, which is the primary driver of mortality in AH patients. And I should also let you know that, in the United States, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s more common practice to do this transplant, this trial we are conducting globally and in Europe, there are many fewer of these patients transferred, even though in the United States, not many of these patients get transplant anyway, just because the availability of livers and the cost of all this thing."
