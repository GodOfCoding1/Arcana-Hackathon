    "content": " It really, I think it's really seeing the benefit of the go-to-market improvements that Paula has made in the last -- really in the last year, really showing execution across the board, elevating the discussions with customers, senior executives and just driving bigger deals with a much stronger enterprise traction, I think the enhanced portfolio it gives us more to talk about, but I would say that the business with Trifacta is still very much rounding error at this point. So, as we talked about last quarter, going into the year, the areas of investment can continue to be within the go-to-market, in particular, building out the global organization, the global teams, I would like to call out that we've continued to invest prudently, if you will, in customer success, as we continue to put resources around our largest customers to ensure that they're getting value and continuing to identify areas to expand with the acquisition of Trifecta, and the cloud efforts were continuing to put investments into product engineering, and that's a key area of focus."
