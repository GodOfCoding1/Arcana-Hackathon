    "content": " We delivered $159 million of adjusted EBITDA in the first quarter, 64% more than last year, and 41% more than what we delivered in 2019. Weekend RevPAR exceeded 2019 levels by 10%, and we did not see any meaningful impact from rising gasoline costs as occupancy for our select service brands remained steady at about 96% of 2019 levels in the weeks before and after the gas price increase in March. We generated fee-related and other revenues of $316 million, a year-over-year increase of 36% reflecting global RevPAR growth of 39% on a constant currency basis. In the U.S., RevPAR grew 38% year-over-year to 104% of 2019 levels, led again by our economy brands and materially driven by ADR, though occupancy also exceeded 2019 levels now for four consecutive quarters. Adjusted EBITDA was $159 million in the first quarter, up 64% versus a year ago, which includes a $14 million timing benefit from the marketing fund. It's been a big piece of why we've actually been able to grow our RevPAR index more in the midweek this quarter, I think 440 basis points versus 2019 because of the traction that we are getting from these everyday business travelers, over half of our negotiated corporate business accounts that we signed in the first quarter were infrastructure related."
