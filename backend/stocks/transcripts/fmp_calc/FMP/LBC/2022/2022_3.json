    "content": " Although loan production fell by $203 million during the quarter, both single-family and income property residential loan prepayment speeds notably declined due to higher market rates, which yielded net loan growth for the quarter that was, on a percentage basis, similar to the linked quarter. Growth in our loan portfolio for the quarter was funded primarily by wholesale sources, including FHLB advances and brokered deposits, which grew by $247 million and $217 million, respectively, from the linked quarter. This increase was primarily due to an increase in compensation expense of $1.6 million as compared to the linked quarter, which related to a lower amount of capitalized loan origination costs due to a 28% decline in loan origination volume, which I previously mentioned. Total assets grew by 5% from the prior quarter and 10% on a year-to-date basis and totaled $7.9 billion at September 30, driven primarily by our net loan growth and funded by wholesale deposits and FHLB advances as we previously discussed. Our capital position during the third quarter benefited from our net earnings of $21 million, but was partially offset by $10.5 million of unrealized losses on our available-for-sale securities portfolio net of tax as a result of the rising interest rate environment. Although retail deposits declined during the third quarter, we generated approximately $200 million this quarter in new money from our advertising campaigns, of which 36% was from customers new to the bank. So we do expect, and Laura, I think, we both commented on that our run rate will be about $16 million for the fourth quarter in terms of noninterest expense, and that's partly because we'll have lower levels of capitalized salaries because of our lower loan production levels."
