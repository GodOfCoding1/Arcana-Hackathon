    "content": " While our net interest income increased by $2.4 million and our noninterest expense decreased by $2.2 million, these 2 positive trends were more than offset by a $5 million fluctuation in the provision for loan losses between the first and second quarters of the year. Interest income grew $4 million from the prior quarter, primarily as a result of increases in the average balance of the loan portfolio and rising interest rates as well as improved earnings on certain of our interest rate swaps. Interest expense also rose during the second quarter but to a lesser extent of $1.5 million as compared to the linked quarter, also chiefly attributed to rising market interest rates impacting the cost of deposits and borrowings. Although the federal funds rate increased by 150 basis points during the first half of this year, our average cost of interest-bearing deposits originally decreased by 4 basis points in the first quarter and then increased by 5 basis points during the second quarter, yielding a year-to-date increase of only 2 basis points. Strong loan volume increased our level of capitalized salaries by $1.2 million as compared to the linked quarter, while higher long-term interest rates reduced our post-retirement benefit liability by $1.4 million during the second quarter. Our capital position during the second quarter benefited from our net earnings of $22.6 million, but was partially offset by $9.3 million of unrealized losses on our available-for-sale security portfolio net of tax, as a result of the interest rate environment. As Simone noted earlier, our second quarter expenses benefited from a $1.4 million retirement liability decrease due to higher long-term interest rates, and our compensation expense was $1.2 million less than the linked quarter related, primarily to record high pace of loan volume for the quarter."
