    "content": " Our strong earnings power, combined with the actions we took during the first quarter to mitigate the impact of rising rates on our investment portfolio resulted in growth in tangible book value per share this quarter, excluding the impact of the Deepstack acquisition and even as we continue to implement our stock repurchase program. While this resulted in a pipeline slowing in our overall loan fundings coming in below the level we had experienced in the first half of the year, our loan production was at higher rates and the repricing on our variable rate loans resulted in a 19 basis point increase in our average loan yields compared to the prior quarter. While this had the effect of increasing our cost of funds in the third quarter, we were still able to keep our net interest margin consistent with the prior quarter, and we believe it puts us in a better position to realize margin expansion over the next year as we expect to see higher earning asset yields and noninterest-bearing deposit growth. The increase in our average cost of deposits was primarily driven by rate increases in our money market and interest-bearing checking accounts, as well as the CDs that were added to lock in some longer-term funding, offset by the positive impact of maintaining average noninterest-bearing deposits at 38% for the linked quarters. And so that's our focus.\\ You can't control the balances within your clients account, but if you're continuing to bring new relationships to the company, which hopefully that demonstrates we've been doing it very successfully over a very long period of time, that you know, our overall, we expect our deposit analysis to grow."
