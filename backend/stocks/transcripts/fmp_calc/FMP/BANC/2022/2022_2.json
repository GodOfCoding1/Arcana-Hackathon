    "quarter": 2,
    "year": 2022,
    "date": "2022-07-21 16:07:10",
    "content": " Importantly, we continue to drive growth in our targeted areas of the portfolio, most notably commercial loans excluding warehouse, commercial real-estate loans and multi-family loans, all of which increased at double digit annualized rates during the second quarter. The portion of our loan fundings in the second quarter were loans that were priced prior to the recent rate increases, so we have not yet seen the full impact of higher rates on our average loan yields or the benefit to our net interest margin. Our total deposit costs increased during the second quarter consistent with our expectations, but the overall asset sensitivity of our balance sheet resulted in an increase in our net interest margin, even with most of the second quarter loan production not reflecting the higher rates that we now seen in our loan pipeline. Starting in the third quarter, we expect our new loan production to start to reflect this current rate environment and support further expansion in our net interest margin, and we are effectively managing expenses, which should enable us to continue to expand operating leverage as we grow the balance sheet and generate higher revenue. You know the two people that we announced this quarter were two of many talented people that we brought to the bank, and you know I think this is becoming a place that people want to be, and they want to work around other talented people and we have great benefits and a great culture, and we have an event this afternoon that's focused on senior women at Banc of California and women in leadership, and just a lot of great things are going on here, so it just hasn't been an issue."
