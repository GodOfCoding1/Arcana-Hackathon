    "content": " We had a great start to the year with many positive trends in actions that have continued to drive our financial performance forward high quality loan growth, solid inflows of noninterest-bearing deposits, margin expansion, higher levels of noninterest income and strong asset quality. These new relationships helped to drive a $170 million or 6% sequential increase in noninterest bearing deposits, which brought noninterest-bearing to 40% of total deposits at the end of the quarter. Fourth quarter results included on a pretax basis to $31.5 million reversal of provision for credit losses, of which $31.3 million related to a recovery from the settlement of a loan previously charged off in 2019, and the $3.7 million after-tax expense related to the preferred stock redemption. Our earning asset yield increased to 3.87% due to a favorable shift in the mix of our earning assets as we deployed our excess liquidity and increased average loans, both from the impact of including PMB's balance sheet for a full quarter and our own net loan growth. Our adjusted expenses increased $1.3 million from the prior quarter, which was primarily due to including PMB's operations for a full quarter, the seasonally higher salaries and benefits expense that are typical of the beginning of each year, and the additions we have made to our banking teams to support our continued balance sheet growth. The growth in the first quarter included $968 million in fundings, including $364 million in SFR loan purchases, as we continue to opportunistically leverage our relationships with mortgage warehouse clients to add high quality earning assets. Our allowance for credit losses at the end of the first quarter totaled $98.6 million and our allowance to total loans coverage ratio stood at 1.32%, which is lower than at the end of the prior quarter as we continue to see positive trends in asset quality. We see many catalysts for driving higher earnings and returns as we move through the year, continued growth in earning assets from our business development efforts, additional margin expansion as the Fed increases the interest rates and continued focus on growing noninterest-bearing deposits, realizing more operating leverage as we continue to effectively manage expenses while growing revenue and the additional earnings resulting from the redemption of the Series E preferred stock and share repurchases. It's one of the things I think we're - as I mentioned in the call, we're most proud of is, is getting to that 40% and it could go down any given quarter and then go back up, but it will continue to grow as a percent of overall deposits. So, we do expect our deposits to grow as our loan balances grow faster than our deposit growth, which could happen, then obviously we will need to rely, make sure that we stay close to our target of 95% to 100% loan to deposit and not get too hot and make sure that we're funding appropriately and matching duration with the loan portfolio, which means we could - we hardly have any broker deposits to speak up. And I'm looking at our company as a growth company with an expanding margin with 40% noninterest-bearing deposits and one of the best markets in the country with 12 plus consecutive quarters of doing what we said we would do, probably better than people thought we would do it including ourselves."
