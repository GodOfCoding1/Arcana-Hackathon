    "content": " With over 2.3 million square feet leased in our warehouse/distribution portfolio during the quarter, we increased base and cash base rents 28% and 18% on average, respectively, and we successfully negotiated average annual escalators of 3.3%, well above our historical results. We believe our average annual industrial rental escalations of 2.5% should increase, as many new leases in our markets are being signed with 3% or higher annual escalators, further improving our internal growth prospects. Subsequent to quarter end, we sold approximately $55 million of assets, including one office property for $7.8 million and two industrial properties in Shreveport, Louisiana, which were outside of our target markets. Moving to Phoenix, we executed a 334,000 square foot lease for five years at an initial rental rate of $7.44 per square foot 9% above our underwriting assumptions with 3.5% annual escalations. Lastly in Central Florida, we leased a substantial portion of our 510,000 square foot shell building at an initial rate of $5.65 per square foot approximately 9% above our underwriting assumptions with 3.5% annual bumps. At quarter end, approximately 96% of our industrial portfolio leases had escalations with an average annual rate of 2.5%. I think there is an interest in assets that are extremely, extremely sensitive to inflation and our portfolio is better positioned for growth it ever has been as reflected in the annual escalations, structure of our leases, how we're doing on new leases with respect to escalations where we're marketing rents and the implied mark-to-market, but in our case it just takes a little bit more time."
