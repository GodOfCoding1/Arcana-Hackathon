    "content": " We completed approximately 1 million square feet of new leases and lease extensions during the quarter in our warehouse distribution portfolio, resulting in strong base and cash based rental increases of 21% and 19% respectively, with average annual escalations of 3%. Based on the independent brokers' estimates, our industrial portfolio cash rents today are forecasted to grow on average approximately 47% for lease expirations through 2028 or 36%, when adjusted for rent escalations. We purchased one stabilized industrial asset in the Phoenix market for $59 million during the quarter, bringing year-to-date acquisition activity to $131 million at average stabilized GAAP and cash cap rates of 4.5% and 4% respectively. As we mentioned on last quarter's call, we've addressed all 2022 industrial lease expirations to-date and are focused on leasing vacant space in our development and purchase portfolios, as well as select 2023 and 2024 expirations. During the quarter, we sold $55 million of assets including one office asset and two industrial assets outside of our target market for GAAP and cash cap rate of 6.2% and 6.7% respectively. John, your line is live. John, your line is live. John, your line is live."
