    "content": " Given the strength of our performance through the first 3 quarters, the successful implementation of pricing in Europe and the overall health of demand trends in our business, we now expect, for the full year: organic net revenue to grow 10%-plus versus our prior outlook of 8%-plus; adjusted EPS to increase 10%-plus versus our previous outlook of mid- to high single digit; and free cash flow of $3 billion-plus, which includes the $300 million of expenses related to the Clif ease-up, which would indicate stronger underlying results."
