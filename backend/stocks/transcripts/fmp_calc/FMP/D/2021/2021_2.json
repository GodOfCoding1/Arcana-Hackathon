    "content": " While Q3 guidance is roughly in line with weather normal results from a year ago, we will see a multitude of small year-over-year helps in Q4, such as normal course regulated rider growth, the impact of the South Carolina electric rate settlement, strengthening sales, modest margin help including from Millstone, continued expense management and tax timing that combined will help us to deliver solid second half results. At Dominion Energy South Carolina, our ability to work in close partnership with state and local officials combined with our commitment to meet an aggressive time line for electric and gas service delivery were key to attracting a new $400 million brewery to the state last year."
