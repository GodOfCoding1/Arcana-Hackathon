    "content": " Other assumptions factored into our guidance include; first, we have a very strong order bank as Jim mentioned for our new iconic products such as Bronco, Bronco Sport, Maverick along with a robust EV lineup Mustang Mach-E, E-Transit, F-150 Lightning now in production as well; second, pent-up demand beyond our order bank, a continued strong pricing environment including the benefit of pricing actions taken in the first quarter and improved mix. Thanks for taking my question. Thanks for taking my question. Thanks for taking my question. And then my second question is just as we think about the costs that are coming online, I think you've discussed in the past that really in your re-org that Blue is going to be what fund Model E. So in a good market, it's very easy to see how incremental profits from the core combustion business are funding your EV growth. Thanks for taking my question. I think that when you look at the walk relative to what we had provided last time, most of the inflationary pressures that we're seeing are being offset by a combination of additional cost reductions, pricing and mix that's flowing through, but it's not as large as that as what you had just indicated."
