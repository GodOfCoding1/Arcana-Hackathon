    "content": " In October 2022, we completed the sale-leaseback transaction of our headquarters here in Germany, with the gross proceeds of approximately EUR 26.5 million. In Services, our on-demand 3D printing segment, we saw another strong quarter with continued high demand for our products and quarterly revenues grew 11% from an already strong fourth quarter in the previous year. Looking at order backlog for 3D printers, I would like to highlight, we ended the business year 2022, not only with the new record high for full revenue -- full year revenue, but also with a new record high for fourth quarter order backlog of 3D printers. We also delivered positive EBITDA in the fourth quarter of 2022, with the successful completion of the sale and leaseback transaction, the repayment of all debt in the 2 successful rounds of financing and the solid backlog of printer orders, we believe we are well prepared for the fiscal year 2023. On Slide 21, revenues from our Systems segment, which includes revenues from selling 3D printers, consumables and spare parts, as well as maintenance decreased 4.4% to EUR 8.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2022 from EUR 8.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2021. On Slide 22, Services revenue increased 10.6% to EUR 2.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2022 compared to EUR 2.4 million in the same quarter 2021."
