    "content": " At this time, I'll turn the conference over to Johannes Pesch, Director of Investor Relations and Business Development. With me today are Dr. Ingo Ederer, voxeljet's Chief Executive Officer; and Rudi Franz, voxeljet's Chief Financial Officer. Yesterday, after the market closed, voxeljet issued a press release announcing its second quarter financial results for the period ended June 30, 2022. During our call, we may make certain forward-looking statements about the Company's performance, including expectations and results from our current quarter backlog. For additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ from those discussed in our forward-looking statements, you should refer to the cautionary statements contained in our press release as well as the risk factors contained in the Company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. With that, I would now like to turn the call over to Ingo, Chief Executive Officer of voxeljet. In the context of a hidden project, initial 3D printing tests were performed at the Technical University of Munich. I co-founded the Company on May 5, 1999 as a spinoff from the University with a clear vision in mind to establish new manufacturing standards. Today, we provide our customers a strategic competitive advantage by upgrading their existing conventional production methods to additive manufacturing solutions. Let's turn to Slide 5, where we describe our technology. In the additive manufacturing market, there are likely more than 10 different technologies each with its specialized field of application. With our VJET X technology, we are pushing new boundaries. On Slide 6, you can find a high-level overview of our company, including recently achieved milestones. In recent months, we have probably seen some of the best order inflow for 3D printers we have ever had. Now, the focus is on delivering these printers on time. On Slide 7, you can see pictures of our production facilities in Germany, the U.S. and China. As you might have seen from the press release, last week, we have entered into as a leaseback transaction for our headquarters here in Germany. In the services segment top left side of this slide, we operate our own 3D printers in free facilities around the world to offer affordable on demand access to our technology. Demand in this segment has been outstanding in recent months in Europe and in the U.S., and we were basically at or over capacity for the whole time. Customers come from various industries including automotive aerospace, general engineering, as well as art and architecture. In the U.S., one of our largest on demand printing client is a supplier to a leading space exploration company. In our Systems segment, we manufacture and sell industrial-grade, high-speed, large-format 3D printing systems geared towards mass production of complex models, molds and direct parts. Systems revenue also includes recurring revenue from the sale of consumables, maintenance contracts, upgrades and other after sales activities. They are all seriously looking at adopting our technology for well-chosen applications, and this interest is translating into orders. In recent months, we have seen some of the best order inflow for our 3D printers ever. To give you some examples, there is for instance an innovative U.S. yacht company producing several thousands of advanced propellers with our technology. There is a leading university in Z\u00c3\u00bcrich, Switzerland, the ETH using our technology to make the most amazing concrete structures. As you can see, all of associates projects growth to accelerate over the next years. Our technology has evolved significantly over the last years in terms of speed, accuracy and the degree of automation of the whole process chain. As you can see, we have reached an established position in all major markets in Europe, U.S. as well as Asia. For example, we offer at least 1000 3D printer for the printing of highly accurate sandcasting molds for ceramics or as a plastic polymerization printer. On the bottom right side of the slide, you can see some of our new products. With these new printers, we believe we can increase our total addressable market considerably. We can target new applications within existing customer groups, for example, with VJET X. With high-speed sintering, we can address both new and existing markets, like, for example, audio equipment, automotive interiors and exterior ceilings, gaskets, walls, grippers and other consumer products. Very recently, we signed an order for two printers, worth over \u00e2\u0082\u00ac2 million with a client in Germany. With the current designs number of orders for 3D printers, we have already achieved our target for 2022. Now, we are working hard to make this deliveries and installations on time to be able to provide revenue for these orders in 2022. Similar to many other companies we continue to see some delays with our suppliers, especially for electrical components. As mentioned earlier, it is great to see that this growth comes from a wide variety of application, projects for space exploration and yachts in U.S., large orders from the art and architectural sector herein Germany, components for cooling of parts in electric vehicles in the UK, and so on. Looking at the right side of the slide in gross margins, we are very pleased with high gross profit and gross profit margins in our Services segment of roughly 40%. Utilization is key and as it was the case in the first quarter, we had more orders than printing capacity. In our System segment, gross profit margin from the sale of 3D printers slightly increased. The overall segments saw a decline in gross profit margin as a result of change of valuation allowance for inventories, falling in our inventory reserve policy. And the left side of the slide, you can see a standard propeller and the corresponding turbulences, it creates underwater. In the center of the slide, you can see the new propeller which creates significantly less turbulence and tip cavitation and waters. On the right side of this slide, you can see the 3D printed pattern and the cast the propeller in a closer. On the bottom left side of the slide, we have included a link to a video of these propellers in action. On Slide 15, we have provided a quick update on our high-speed sintering technology called Greyscale printing. On the right side of this slide, you can see the results from this grey scaling effect. On Slide 16, you can see some parts printed on the big high-speed sintering printer and an overview of the topics we have been working on. In the lower half of this slide, you can see some of the parts we have been printing with printed an air duct for student built racing car. In the coming years, we believe there will be a lot of demand for this inorganic process because it creates no harmful emissions during casting and is fully environmentally friendly. Regarding materials and high-speed sintering, we are currently exploring the use of PBT. This is a thermoplastic engineering polymer that can be used as an insulator in the electrical and electronics industries for housing, in electrical engineering and automotive construction as plug connectors, and in household applications like showerheads or irons. Just recently, we have put commercially available concrete powder from a local stock now VX200, and we were able to print part of good quality. Slide 17 breaks down order backlog by quarters, revenue by a geographic, and operating expenses by category then looking at revenue by a geographic region with targeting even distribution across the three regions to hedge against risk from local events. As mentioned earlier, we were able to win major orders for 3D printers in recent months. To sum up the recent months, excellent growth rates and exciting projects in our on demand printing segment, one of the best order inflows for our 3D printers and good progress in key R&D projects. As mentioned in previous calls, it's our target to deliver long-term value for our shareholders through attractive growth, strong margins and optimal deployment of capital. Last week, we entered into a sale and leaseback transaction of our headquarters in Friedberg. As we continue on our path towards profitability, the sale and leaseback transaction alliances our objective to source non-dilutive financing wherever possible and focus on our main business, which is developing, manufacturing and selling high-tech industrial 3D printers. Turning to Slide 19, total revenues increased 35.4% to \u00e2\u0082\u00ac6.7 million for the second quarter of 2022 as compared to \u00e2\u0082\u00ac4.9 million for the last year second quarter. System segment of Slide 20, we were able to collect major orders for 3D printers, especially in recent months. Turning to Slide 21, revenue from our 3D parts production centers summarizing the service segments. The second quarter was one of the best quarters we ever had in the April to June period and our demands part production service revenues increased 35.8% to \u00e2\u0082\u00ac3.1 million for the second quarter 2022 compared to \u00e2\u0082\u00ac32.3 million for the same quarter of 2021. Assets gross profit almost doubled to \u00e2\u0082\u00ac1.2 million for this year, second quarter for more than \u00e2\u0082\u00ac7 million for the same quarter of last year. Distribution expenses like shipping and packaging our main driver of selling expenses in the end not only depend on the amount of revenue but also the quantities and types of products sold, as well as destination to which those goods are being delivered. Therefore, distribution expenses can vary from quarter to quarter. This expenses are usually driven by individual projects, especially through the consumption of material as well as the demand of external services may vary significantly from quarter to quarter. Improvement was mainly due to a positive net impact of other operating income, higher gross margin, and lower administrative expenses. We've provided the same presentation for the first half period ended June 30, 2022 on Slide 23 through 26. At June 30, 2022, the Company had free cash of roughly \u00e2\u0082\u00ac13 million. Total debt at June 30, 2022, was approximately \u00e2\u0082\u00ac27.5 million. As mentioned at the beginning, we plan to repay the debt with the proceeds from the sales and leaseback transaction and expect the closing of this transaction towards the end of the third quarter of 2022. Moving now on to Slide 28 and our financial guidance for the full year 2022, which remains unchanged. Please proceed with your question. What I can say is there is the five printers sold to all new customers, Chevron Marine was named in this presentation where we gave as well some more insights. The industries are as said, Chevron Marine business more or less engine technology, automotive, renewable energy things. So every, I would say almost every system customer was or is still a service customer. So, the Service segment is faster real cash flow positive marketing tool because initially we don't have to oversell clients can send us data sets, and we print goods for them, which is a real good showcase. And the Service segment, that's what we currently see as well the high demand very likely, comes from the geopolitical challenges all of us are facing and supply chain issues. We assume that those, we see those volume 2023 and another drivers for sure that the industry is really seeing additive manufacturing or what we do, as a standard process, meanwhile, in slowly start ordering high volume. And then I think in the press release you mentioned the challenges of the supply chain, which I assume is sourcing components for you and your focus is on getting these built in delivered. High level, we manage it very good, our team is focused and very close with our suppliers, critical components, and I'm sure you hear this everywhere, our electrical components, microchips, I think we getting closer and we get the parts. But it's still a challenge and we have to order a lot earlier and accordingly, we have to accept higher inventory. The critical path that the electrical components in the electrical cabinet, but the suppliers really helping us like we are chasing them and then we get to parts, that's the delay but we will get them swiftly. Please proceed with your question. Maybe just touching on gross margin in the Systems segment, it looks like they were down just slightly year-over-year. As mentioned in the presentation, the decrease or the lower gross profit is primarily related to a one-time effect where we adjusted or where we had to adjust our inventory, which went through this, if you would, that was a non-cash item, if you would exclude this gross margin would look very different. So overall, we are previous booking, we were very happy with the gross profit. As you're right, the gross profit margin is fluctuating. But in this specific quarter, there is a good reason for aspect support system booking of inventory. And then maybe just revenue in Asia, it looked like it was up basically sequentially and year-over-year. As mentioned, I think our clients are really seeing this technology as a standard technology and they build their own production plans against it. That product is designed for using a production process, which is called additive manufacturing. And we believe that in the call that going forward, we will see a lot more growth, because that technology is meanwhile really an accepted and very, very robust technology where you really can start building production capacity against. Is it may be fair to say that the \u00e2\u0082\u00ac1.5 million from Asia this quarter was mostly services revenue, but it could potentially lead to some additional systems revenue? No, I think we signed off on one system and the rest is for sure service activities and aftermarket business components that be signed off on big printer in Q2. We are pushing ahead with full speed and are very excited about the opportunities in front of us for the employees, one of the best we ever had. Have a great summer and we look forward to speaking with you in our next earnings call, which we expect to take place in November with results for the third quarter of 2022. Have a good weekend. Have a good weekend."
