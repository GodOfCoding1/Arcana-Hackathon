    "content": " We are very happy with our performance over the last month as we continue to collect large orders for our 3D printers, made progress in key R&D projects and we're extremely busy in our on-demand 3D printing segment. It is great to see that the systems related revenue significantly increased in the third quarter year-over-year, reflecting the higher installed base of our 3D printers in the market. Regarding order backlog, I would like to highlight, we mentioned in our earlier conference calls that on-demand printing revenue is a good leading indicator for future sales of 3D printers. This is exactly what we have seen in recent months, order inflow for 3D printers was one of the best we ever had so far and order backlog for 3D printers was at EUR13.7 million at the end of September 2022. To sum up, the recent months excellent growth rates and exciting projects in our on-demand printing segment, one of the best order inflows for our 3D printers, good progress in the key R&D projects and full focus on execution."
