    "content": " In addition to that, we introduce our Cliq that is a new OFDM mobile transmitter that is used for many use cases, including drones, body worn cameras, helmet worn cameras in some cases, but it gives a lot of flexibility both in nil gov markets as well as in live sports and entertainment to create again those real, immersive and clever shots that can bring a whole new perspective to the event or also bring information to make decisions with. So on the live event production side, we saw our revenues grow 42% quarter-on-quarter from prior year, that is because of our new products that we have introduced over the last year as well as live events coming back in a bigger way and new event, new types of sports. We are seeing a great uptick in business, potential business with government first responders, particularly because we have just introduced our new AeroLink product, so that AeroLink product is being embraced very well by the customer base and we expect a very strong sales front with that and our other products in 2023."
