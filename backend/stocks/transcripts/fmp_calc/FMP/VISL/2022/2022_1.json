    "content": " We're spending a lot of time working with these customers, whether it's on live production, or on first responder military, of understanding the challenges the problems are trying to solve and how our technology can best help them. Obviously, with interest rates going up, there's concern, possibly, but from what we're seeing two things are evident one, on the live production side, the consumer is spending their discretionary income on consuming content, all types of content, we've seen incredible amounts of very unique types of content. It has slightly, again, the pandemic had a deciding, significant effect on our live production business last year, as Mickey said, and what we've seen in some of the shows that we've attended, and some of the customer responses that we're getting, is that people feel that the COVID pandemic has been put behind us substantially, there are parts of the world that are still shut down, mostly in Asia. But we are seeing a lot of places come back online, we're seeing that the customers that we have the big producers of live events, coming back and saying that they see a need and a necessity for even more, immersive content, and therefore they're upgrading and continually adding more equipment to their portfolio in their repertoire in order to provide that type of content. And we're also seeing again, this idea that there's an emphasis on various aspects of first responder and military spending that fit very neatly into the things that we do both standing off in surveillance and observation of things, capturing video and transporting that wirelessly to an area where you can utilize it or monetize it. So we think we're very well positioned as the world comes out of the pandemic, to really to benefit from all the various areas where we think there's going to be increased business and increased activity."
