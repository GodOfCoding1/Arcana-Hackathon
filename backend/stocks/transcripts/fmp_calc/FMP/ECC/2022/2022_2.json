    "content": " We had strong recurring cash flows from our portfolio in the second quarter, and we received $47.8 million or $1.12 per share, which was $0.43 per share above our total expenses and common -- regular common distributions paid during the quarter. Our adviser and its investment team are deeply experienced and cycle-tested and with our portfolio of strong CLO equity weighted average remaining reinvestment period, strong cash flows, low defaults, lack of repricings, we're quite confident in the continued earnings potential for our portfolio and believe the company is well situated to continue generating strong NII in the back half of the year and beyond. For the second quarter of 2022, the company recorded net investment income and realized gains of approximately $18.5 million or $0.43 per share, which is above our second quarter regular common distribution level. The -- while CLO equity billions of dollars trade every single month, the ability for us to move up and down in quality or tiering or portfolio style while keeping majority blocks in the secondary market, let's say, I wanted to get rid of 5 of the riskiest guys and buy 5 more of our favorite conservative guys, unfortunately, the market doesn't really allow us to do that. That said, going back to the better part of how you started your question, when loans were at $0.92 on the dollar, if you just use $0.50 recovery, which is very low for loans, that's a very conservative number, that suggests 8 points -- that would suggest the market was kind of pricing in 16% defaults over the next 2 years."
