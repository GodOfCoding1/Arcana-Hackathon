As of the end of Q2, our RPO was $534 million, an increase of approximately $20 million from the end of Q1. Your line is open. And the second one is the backlog conversion issues and both of them are related to the budget cuts and macroeconomic slowdown and still we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re able to increase our backlog in Q2, as you mentioned then in Q3, and in Q3 actually \u00e2\u0080\u0093 so in Q2, it was increased by approximately $20 million of RPO. In terms of Q4, we had some orders deployments that were shifted from Q2 to Q3 and the backlog entry point in Q4 seems to be stronger than previous quarters, and that's the reason we believe Q4 will be better than Q3. Given the current situation, focusing on areas where we see the opportunities more mature and customers being able to fund, and the other area is to discuss with our customers and   the deployment schedule and their readiness, either it's readiness of   or payments in order for us to be able to convert the backlog in a more efficient way. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open."
