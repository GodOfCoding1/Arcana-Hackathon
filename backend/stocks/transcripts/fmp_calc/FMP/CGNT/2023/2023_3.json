    "content": " Excluding SIS non-GAAP revenue, we are currently expecting Q4 revenue in the range of $63 million to $72 million, up from $61 million in Q3. On this basis, we expect revenue for the year ending January 2023 to be in the range of $275 million to $294 million. Total revenue came in at $22 million, a significant decline from last year, reflecting backlog conversion delays as Elad explained. Despite the improvement in OpEx, the lower revenue level in Q3 resulted in a non-GAAP operating loss of $22 million for the quarter. Turning to Q4, we are currently expecting revenue to increase from $61.5 million in Q3 and be in the range of $63 million to $72 million in Q4. And if you look at the short-term RPO after the discussion with our customers, it stands on about $250 million, which is more or less 50% of the total RPO, but also reflects more than 80% of the outlook for next year. We do think that, overall, Q4 OpEx will be around $55 million, and we will continue to benefit from our cost saving initiative over the next year."
