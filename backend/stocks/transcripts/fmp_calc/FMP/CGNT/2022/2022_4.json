    "content": " For a more detailed discussion of how these and other risks and uncertainties could cause Cognyte's actual results to differ materially from those indicated in these forward-looking statements, please see our annual report on Form 20-F for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021, filed with the SEC on April 29, 2021, and other filings we make with the SEC, including our annual report on Form 20-F for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2022, which we expect to file shortly. Non-GAAP revenue for Q4 came in at $125.3 million, up slightly from the previous year, but below our expectations due to the issues we experienced in the quarter that Elad discussed earlier. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open."
