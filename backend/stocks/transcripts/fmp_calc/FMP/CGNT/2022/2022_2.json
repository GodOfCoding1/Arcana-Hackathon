    "content": " Many customers recognize that the homegrown solutions can no longer keep pace with these evolving security challenges, and have increasingly sought open analytics platform that can support multiple use cases, solutions that can fuse data at scale from different sources and generate high quality insights faster to mitigate a wide range of security threats before they unfold. For the current year, we expect approximately 12% gross profit growth on 10% revenue growth, and are pleased to be in a position to raise our annual outlook for EBITDA and annual guidance for non-GAAP EPS due to the successful execution of our software strategy. In the first half of the year, over 50% of our revenue was recurring and 89% of our revenue came from software, up 200 basis points year-over-year, reflecting the adoption of our analytics platform and the reduction of hardware reselling and professional services. Starting with revenue, our outlook for FY \u201822 is $490 million of non-GAAP revenue with a range of plus or minus 2%, reflecting approximately 10% year-over-year growth. When looking at our backlog and the timing of our customer deployment, we expect Q3 revenue in the range of $112 million to $117 million and to finish the year with our typical strong fourth quarter. As David mentioned, we started this strong, we do have good visibility for H2, driven by our recurring business, which is about 50% of the repeat business from existing customers, which is about 9% and the strong RPO of $0.5 billion that David just mentioned."
