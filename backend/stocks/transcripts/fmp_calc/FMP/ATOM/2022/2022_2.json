    "content": " Yes, well it's inevitable, we've been working in the industry for a while, if you're working at one customer, and you're bringing them a big potential solution for their problem, there's going to be a number of engineers in that company that know about it, they might change companies, they might have friends, they might go to trade shows, they might actually see our presentations and start just chatting among them in a specialty that certain engineers will have chat rooms and things set up around. But what, as I was saying on the call, it, if our customers fab is completely full, it's very hard for them to run any R&D wafers, we are starting to see that loosen, but more so in the older nodes and the legacy nodes. And some people in the industry can be skeptical of the results that you get on TCAD, it's such a complicated process that typically process engineers that work in the factories, they say, let me just run wafers and look at the results. Because I've sort of observed the dynamic that we've seen recently and that we talked about in the release, and on the call about our TCAD, you may have a situation where a customer feeling marginal about the cost benefit of doing another set of wafers, particularly recent times when capacity is tight, and it's difficult to justify R&D runs. I think it's helped us to gain a lot more credibility with customers around trying other experiments with MST than they would have previously so they are seeing, they'll always want to see it validated in silicon but that dynamic helps to, helps our engagement with customers a lot. All right, thank you, Scott. All right, thank you, Scott."
