    "content": " One of the things I've talked about in the past, but I'd like to really reiterate now is, a lot of times you work with a big customer, you get results that look really good, but they don't immediately move forward with it, because they just aren't funded to do an R&D pass or make a new process technology come out that year. The fact that we've been very sparing and what we've done, like I said, only active in the month of November, you know, over the last six months, We're obviously optimistic not only in terms of planning to spend more money and hire people this year, but also in feeling that we didn't need to load up on additional cash, when the stock and overall the equity markets, and particularly the, growth stocks and tech stocks were particularly doing poorly in the last six months. But I definitely would say, I think there's no doubt if you look at our customer pipeline over the last couple of years, we've had good traction with customers, we've been working with customers, but everything has been slowed down by this capacity crunch, the industry was in the -- I think we talked about a JDA customer taking nine months to get a sample. Because reason we don't pre-announce is that any decision by them that they want to do one more wafer run can take nine to 12 months more, but we've got a lot of shots on net here with all the customers in our pipeline, and we're hopeful that some of them come up with licenses in the near future. We don't a technicality when we run TCAD, we don't run a transistor on TCAD, we run areas that are even smaller than a transistors, but we've done a lot of simulations on how you would use MST in a gate-all-around 3-nanometer or smaller device so that we can go into customers and show them that type of thing."
