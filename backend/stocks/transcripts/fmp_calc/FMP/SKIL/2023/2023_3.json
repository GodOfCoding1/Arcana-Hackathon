    "content": " During our first five quarters as a public company, we've made much progress transforming Skillsoft into a business that can deliver growth and margin expansion over the long-term. Bookings for the total company for the third quarter were $133 million, down 13% and down 9% on a constant currency basis, which is due largely to declines in our lower-margin transactional business and the downgrade of a large customer that Jeff referenced in his comments. Content bookings in the third quarter were $85 million, down 6% and down 4% in constant currency due to the aforementioned downgrade of one larger account. Your line is now live. Your line is now live. Your line is now live. Your line is now live. Your line is now live. Those career journeys blend all of our capabilities to deliver a really immersive experience, really transformative experience to our learners and an experience that's aligned with the strategies of our customers regardless of what the topic area is, whether it's business skills, leadership, technology, all of the above and leveraging all of our modalities, including ILT, and we see that as a source of future growth. Your line is now live."
