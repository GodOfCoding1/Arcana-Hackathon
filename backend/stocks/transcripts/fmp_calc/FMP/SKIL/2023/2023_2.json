Bookings for Global Knowledge in Q2 were $46 million, down 27% and down 21% in constant currency. Adjusted gross revenue in the quarter was down $148 million, down 5% and down 2% on a constant currency basis. Adjusted revenue for the Skillsoft Content segment in Q2 was $99 million, up 3% and up 5% in constant currency.

Q2 adjusted EBITDA was $33 million, down $2 million, a decrease of 5% compared to last year, and up 1% constant currency.
