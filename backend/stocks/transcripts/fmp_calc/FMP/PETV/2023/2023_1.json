    "content": " Before we begin, I would like to remind everyone that comments made during this conference call by PetVivo executives may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, and are subject to risks and uncertainties. And as John mentioned, we've opened our awareness -- the sales and marketing -- our investment in sales and marketing has been paying off with opening these accounts, and we continue to use the net proceeds from our initial public offering to expand our sales and marketing efforts, and also clinical studies to gain PetVivo acceptance and increase our revenues from the sale of Spryng."
