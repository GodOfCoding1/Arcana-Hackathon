    "content": " Exits and repayments for the period however came in at a total of $51 million, so net originations were a negative $40 million for the period; however, investments which closed after the end of the quarter made up much of this runoff which I'll cover later. Other income increased to $4.3 million for the period, which was up $1 million over the last quarter with the NetFortris proceeds and supported the 7% increase in total investment income to $17.3 million. Borrowing costs were unchanged and administrative costs also largely unchanged; however, net management fees rose by $1.7 million to $4.3 million as the new deal closing fees remitted to the management company and credited against the base management fees declined materially compared to the December quarter. While the increase in total expenses outpaced the higher investment income, net investment income came in at a strong $8.7 million or just over $0.25 per share or 130% of the distributions for the period. With LIBOR expected to rise above the average LIBOR floor in the portfolio this quarter, and as outlined on page 60 of our 10-Q, we are anticipating net interest income to increase by approximately $5.2 million per year or $0.15 per share, for a - should LIBOR rise 200 basis points over the 45 basis points applicable as of March 31. Since our last call, I'm sure you've all noted the announcement of the increase in our annual dividend to $0.81 per share per year, and while the increase is well supported by recent earnings results, we will continue to assess the outlook for portfolio growth and net interest income increases to sustain any future increases to the shareholder distributions. Net investment income for the March 31 quarter was $8.7 million, which was a decline of $500,000 compared to the prior quarter or $0.25 per share and covered 130% of shareholder distributions."
