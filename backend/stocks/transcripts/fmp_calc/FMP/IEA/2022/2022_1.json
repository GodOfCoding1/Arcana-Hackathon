    "content": " During the first quarter, the price volatility on many of these materials, especially higher fuel costs, and continued supply chain challenges resulted in compressing the forecast project margins that will be realized over the year as our projects progress towards completion. At the end of the first quarter, we reported total backlog of $2.9 million, up 10% from the same period last year. Unfortunately, at $3.8 million in the first quarter, companywide gross profit was down from $16.5 million last year, and the gross profit margin for the first quarter 2022 was 1.1%, down from 6% in the same period last year. But in the first quarter of 2022, that change would lead to a reduction in our margin of $12.9 million, approximately two-thirds of that amount impacted renewables margins, and one-third impacted Specialty Civil margins in the quarter. SG&A expense is $34.9 million during the first quarter of 2022, up from $24.8 million in the same period last year. Interest expense for the quarter totaled $6.0 million down from $14.4 million in the first quarter of 2021 primarily from the benefit of last year's recapitalization transactions, which provide an annual reduction of approximately $20 million and interest expense and cash interest payments. Well, without making you into a cost accounting specialist, we had about $12.9 million of margin hits that we took in the first quarter for projects that were in progress at the start of the quarter. Unfortunately, you are also going to make your margin on those projects lower as you go forward to recognize the added cost, but I'd say $12.9 million was an immediate hit to the quarter."
