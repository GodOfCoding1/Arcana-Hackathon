Relevant factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those forward-looking statements are contained in our earnings release and in our SEC filings, including our most recent Form 10-K. During the call, we will also discuss the non-GAAP financial measures included in our earnings release. Net income for the year was $280 million or $27.77 per share compared to net income of $191 million or $17.71 per share for the full year 2021. Petroleum additives sales for the fourth quarter were $680 million and reached $2.8 billion for 2022 compared to $2.3 billion for 2021. And for 2022, it was $378 million compared to $281 million for 2021. For the year, the operating profit increase was mainly due to increased selling prices, partially offset by higher raw material and operating costs. During the year, working capital increased $204 million. In 2023, we expect to see capital investment in the $70 million to $80 million range. The last three years have been characterized by unprecedented factors, including the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, worldwide supply chain disruptions, inflation and war. Petroleum additives sales in 2022 were $578 million higher than in 2019, an increase of 26%. Petroleum additives operating profit in 2022 was $19 million higher, an increase of 5% over 2019, and shipments in 2022 were 2.8% higher than 2019. While our efforts to resolve supply chain issues to better meet our customers' growing needs have shown improvement, we are still challenged by the inflationary environment and rising operating costs that we expect to continue into 2023."
