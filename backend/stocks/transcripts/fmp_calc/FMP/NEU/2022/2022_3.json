    "content": "  Operator: Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the NewMarket Corporation Conference Call and Webcast to review Third Quarter 2022 Financial Results. Relevant factors that could cause results to differ materially from those forward-looking statements are contained in our earnings release in our SEC filings, including our most recent Form 10-K. During this call, I may also discuss the non-GAAP financial measure included in our earnings release. Petroleum additives operating profit for the quarter was $83 million, higher than the third quarter operating profit of $72 million last year. The profit increase was mainly due to increased selling prices, partially offset by higher raw material costs, decreased shipments and higher operating costs. Shipments between quarterly periods were down 8.5%, with decreases in both lubricant additives and fuel additives shipments across all regions, except Latin America, which reported an increase in fuel additive shipments. Year-to-date, shipments decreased 1.3% between periods, with decreases in both lubricant additive and fuel additive shipments. During the quarter, working capital increased $84 million. We also funded capital expenditures of $13 million, and paid our dividends of $21 million, with our net debt-to-EBITDA ending the quarter at 2.4x. For 2022, we expect to see our capital expenditures in the $55 million to $65 million range."
