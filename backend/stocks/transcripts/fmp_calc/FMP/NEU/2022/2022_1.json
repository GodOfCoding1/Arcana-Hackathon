Relevant factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those forward-looking statements are contained in our earnings release and in our SEC filings, including our most recent Form 10-K. During this call, I may also discuss the non-GAAP financial measure included in our earnings release. Net income was $59.3 million or $5.75 a share compared to the net income of $69.7 million or $6.38 a share for the first quarter of last year. Petroleum additives net sales for the first three months of 2022 were a record $660.3 million, compared to $564.9 million for the same period in 2021, or an increase of 16.9%. Sales increased $95.4 million, mainly due to increased selling prices and increased shipments. Shipments increased 2.3% between periods with increases in both lubricant additives and fuel additive shipments across all regions, except Asia-Pacific, which reported decreases in both lubricant additive and fuel additive shipments. Petroleum additives operating profit for the quarter was $86.9 million lower than the first quarter operating profit of last year of $94.1 million. While operating profit and margin were below last year's first quarter, they both showed significant improvements over last quarter, the fourth quarter of 2021. During the quarter, we funded capital expenditures of $12.6 million and paying dividends of $21.6 million. We also prepaid our $350 million 10 year bonds, which were due in this December, reducing our debt and interest costs. With those bonds paid off, the weighted average cost of our $650 million and fixed debt is 3.1%. For the full year 2022, we expect to see capital expenditures in the $65 million to $75 million range."
