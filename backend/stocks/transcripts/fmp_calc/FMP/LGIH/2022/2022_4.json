    "content": " Starting with the fourth quarter, our revenue was $488.3 million, a decrease of 39% year-over-year, primarily due to a 42.7% decrease in closings to 1,448 homes and partially offset by a 6.3% increase in our average selling price to $337,198. Gross margin as a percentage of sales in the fourth quarter was 20.7%, compared to 26.4% in the same period last year. General and administrative expenses totaled $26.9 million or 5.5% of revenue in the fourth quarter, compared to $27.9 million or 3.5% of revenue in the same period last year. Highlighting a few full-year 2022 results, revenue was $2.3 billion, a decline of 24.4%, primarily due to a 36.6% decrease in closings, offset by a 19.2% increase in our full-year average sales price to $348,052.

I mean, it varies, you know, by community, obviously, where the sales price is, and the amount of incentives is community by community as well, but generally speaking, if we pick a standard community entry-level across the country, one of the metrics we've been using is for a monthly payment that somebody has to qualify with their taxes and insurance and everything all in, kind of pre-pandemic, that number is about $1,800 a month, and you need to make about 5,400 a month to qualify for that mortgage, about 3x the payment."
