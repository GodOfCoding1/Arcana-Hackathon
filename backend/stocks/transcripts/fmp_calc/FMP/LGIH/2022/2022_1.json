    "content": " Our revenue in the first quarter was $546.1 million, a decline of 22.7% resulting from fewer closings and partially offset by higher average selling prices, compared to the same period last year. Gross margin this quarter came in at 29%, a 210 basis point improvement over the same period last year and a new company record. Our adjusted gross margin this quarter was also a new company record at 30.3%, a 180 basis point improvement over the same period last year. EBITDA for the quarter was $104.4 million or 19.1% of revenue, a 10 basis point improvement over the same period last year and a new first quarter record. Based on our results to date, visibility into our backlog and outlook for the rest of the year, we now expect selling prices for the full year to be in a range between $335,000 and $350,000, gross margins between 27% and 29%, and adjusted gross margins between 28.5% and 30.5%. The industry\u2019s inventory overall, the public builders is up about 25% and about 65% in units since that same March 2020 backlog period, and rates are going up, I know demand is very strong and deep as it relates to institutional investors. We don\u2019t think that\u2019s \u2013 that will continue long term either because our adjusted gross margin every year, pre-pandemic and pre last quarters between 25% and 28%."
