During the second quarter, we reported several key positive developments related to our CTP-543 program in alopecia areata, led by outstanding Phase III top line data from the THRIVE-AA1 study. We're extremely pleased that our THRIVE-AA2 study, released earlier this week, produced similarly impressive top line results confirming and underscoring the rapid high level of efficacy observed with CTP-543 in the treatment of moderate-to-severe alopecia areata."
