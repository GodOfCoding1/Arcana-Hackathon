    "content": " Among the JAK inhibitors being developed for the treatment of alopecia areata, our Phase II results of CTP-543 appear to have a highly competitive profile, and we're working to bring it to patients as quickly as possible. I also think that what we're seeing is for medical affairs, there's obviously going to be education of patients and education of other dermatology experts who are in the hair space. So I think we're doing our best to make sure that we are answering all the questions and checking all the boxes, including for some of the supportive studies, you'll see in our clinicaltrial.gov listing that we've done, DDI studies and things like that, that are also important for the filing as well. So I think that the long-term exposure is really being looked at very carefully in terms of safety and efficacy and I think we continue to see the similar profile that we saw and reported on from our Phase II trials, but I think that's really where we are with the open-label extension."
