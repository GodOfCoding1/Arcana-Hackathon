And because of that and because of the success that we've had and the turmoil that was occurring in the beginning or the latter part of the first half of this year, we strategically pulled back on our acquisition commitments to understand what our cost of capital is from debt equity, and to allow the market to adjust to what we think is higher yields that would be necessary for us to continue to make acquisition investments.
