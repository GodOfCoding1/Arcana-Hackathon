    "content": " But overall, improving drybulk market fundamentals, timely expansion of our fleet, and an early winter  resulted in another strong quarter to start 2022, led by market strength, pushed by our business plan and our people, navigating sanctions, operating challenges and trade lane disruptions caused by the war in Ukraine. Charter expenses paid to third-party ship-owners increased to $77.7 million from $53.6 million, a 45% increase due to increases in market rates to chartering vessels. Collectively, we are encouraged by the steps we've taken to strengthen our financial position and return value to shareholders as we have increased our quarterly dividend by 50% to $7.5 for the June payment date, our second increase this year, and our sixth consecutive dividend payments."
