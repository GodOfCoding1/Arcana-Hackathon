    "content": " In commercial lines, written premium growth for the year was driven by strong exposure growth, pricing increases, higher policy retention, and continued strong new business. Underneath, U.S. Standard commercial lines renewal written pricing, excluding workers' compensation accelerated from the third quarter to 7.9%, up 1 point primarily driven by auto and property lines. Moving to personal lines, pricing is accelerated across auto and home, resulting in written premium growth of 4% for the fourth quarter and 2% for the full-year. In Homeowners, we have kept pace with loss cost trends through net rate and insured value increases reflected in renewal written pricing of 10.7% for the year and 13.3% for the fourth quarter. The underlying combined ratio was 96.2, reflecting continued auto liability and physical damage severity pressure driven by elevated repair costs, as well as increased bodily injury trends and includes 2 points of losses related to prior quarters in 2022. One, our 2022 financial results demonstrate the effectiveness of our strategy and the benefits of continued investments in our businesses, resulting in strong growth in margins in commercial line, group benefits operating at targeted returns, and a personal lines business tracking back to target margins."
