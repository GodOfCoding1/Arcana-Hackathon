    "content": " All forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, those relating to our operating trends and future financial performance, expense management, expectations for hiring, and growth in our organization, physician training and adoption, market opportunity and penetration, commercial and international expansion, regulatory approvals, reimbursement, competition and product development are based upon our current estimates and various assumptions. First and foremost, we drove strong TCAR adoption marked by $33.2 million in revenues and 4,700 procedures for the quarter, reflecting 25% and 29% year-over-year growth respectively. Based on our strong first half U.S. TCAR procedure growth and our outlook over the remainder of the year, we are pleased to raise our 2022 revenue guidance to $128 million to $133 million, reflecting year-over-year growth of 29% at the midpoint of the range. With a continued drumbeat of compelling clinical evidence, broad FDA labeling and medicare coverage, compelling, economic value proposition and increasingly tenured trained physician base and a world-class commercial organization, we are well equipped and laser-focused on driving procedures per physician growth as we established TCAR as the standard of care. And look, we've got some great anecdotes and a little bit of data points around the impact of standard surgical risk, not just for that patient population, but for kind of leading into TCAR more broadly, whether you're a new physician or kind of middle of the road in your experience or deeply adopt at this point."
