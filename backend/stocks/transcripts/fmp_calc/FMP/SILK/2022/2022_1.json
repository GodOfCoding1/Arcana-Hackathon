    "content": " All forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, those relating to our operating trends and future financial performance, the impact of COVID-19 on our business and prospects for recovery, expense management, expectations for hiring, physician training and adoption, growth in our organization and reimbursement, market opportunity, commercial and international expansion, regulatory approvals and product development are based upon our current estimates and various assumptions. Beyond our first quarter performance, we are tremendously excited to highlight that just in the past few days, we received FDA approval for the expanded indication of our ENROUTE Transcarotid Stent System to include patients at standard risk for adverse events from carotid endarterectomy. The FDA's decision was based on compelling real-world outcomes data on over 20,000 standard surgical risk patients showing that TCAR had statistically equivalent stroke and death outcomes compared to CEA, while showing a ninefold reduction in cranial nerve injury, CNI. We expect operating expenses to increase sequentially by approximately 10% in the second quarter, primarily due to an increase in noncash stock-based compensation expectations and as we continue to balance pipeline and infrastructure investments to drive U.S. TCAR adoption with other investments secured towards the international and new disease state market opportunities. So on 2022, look, I think it's safe to say that the approval for standard surgical risk label expansion came in line with our expectations, and therefore, we kind of already thought through the impact for the year."
