    "content": " All forward-looking statements including without limitation, those relating to our operating trends and future financial performance, expense management, expectations for hiring and growth in our organization, physician training and adoption, market opportunity and penetration, commercial and international expansion, regulatory approvals, reimbursement, competition and product development are based upon our current estimates and various assumptions. As pre-announced, we achieved revenue of $37.4 million in the third quarter buoyed by over 5,250 TCAR procedures representing 51% and 55% year-over-year growth, respectively. We estimate this to be over 430,000 diagnoses and approximately 170,000 procedures annually representing a $3.2 billion opportunity in the U.S. Our expanded label supported by robust clinical evidence now in the tens of thousands of patients offers physicians a minimally invasive approach for all of their eligible patients who may benefit. After adjusting for baseline demographic and clinical characteristics, the odds of perioperative stroke as well as combined stroke and death were lower for TCAR versus carotid endarterectomy in high surgical risk patients and similar in standard surgical risk patients. We are raising our full year 2022 revenue expectations to a range of $134 million to $137 million and we now expect to exceed 19,000 total TCAR procedures performed this year, which would represent over 11% procedure share in the U.S. market."
