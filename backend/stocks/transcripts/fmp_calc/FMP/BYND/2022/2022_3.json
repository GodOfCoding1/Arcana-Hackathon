    "content": "  To reiterate, the three main pillars we are using to advance positive cash flow and implement a sustainable growth model are, one, continued reduction in OpEx and a narrowing of focus on key strategic partner, foodservice and retail opportunities, while making further efficiency gains through lean value streams across our beef, pork and poultry platforms; two, emphasizing cash flow accretive management of our inventory with a focus on margin dollars versus maximizing margin percent and concurrently rationalizing our production network in the context of more moderate volume assumptions; three, narrowing our sales and marketing focus to a core set of activities that we believe strike the right balance between restoring near-term growth and nurturing our most valuable long-term opportunities I look forward to returning to our call in the New Year to update you on our progress across this critically important pivot and plan With that, I will turn it over to Lubi, our new Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer, to walk us through our third quarter financial results in greater detail and reiterate our outlook."
