    "content": " As a reminder, these are as follows: first, the implementation of lean value streams across our beef, pork and poultry platforms with a laser focus on margin expansion and OpEx reduction; second, an emphasis on cash flow accretive inventory management with a near-term focus on profit dollars versus maximizing percent margin; and third, a focus on opportunities to support near-term growth and consumer trial and adoption, particularly in our core SKUs, appropriately balanced against streamlined activities in support of our most valuable long-term opportunities. Finally, capital expenditures are expected to be in the range of $30 million to $35 million for the full year, down from $70.5 million in 2022, and we continue to target the achievement of positive free cash flow defined as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures within the second half of 2023. Generally speaking, as opposed to focusing on outright growth, our 2023 outlook reflects our renewed focus on stabilizing our core business, prioritizing only those new product innovations which we believe will be most accretive to long-term growth, rightsizing our operations and reducing operating expenses in support of near-term margin expansion and ultimately, better positioning our company for more sustainable long-term profitable growth.
