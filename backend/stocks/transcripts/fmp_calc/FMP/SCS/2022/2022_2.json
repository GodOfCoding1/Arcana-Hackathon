    "content": " The sequential comparison of gross margin was impacted by approximately $11 million of higher inflation, net of pricing benefits in the second quarter, plus higher freight cost inefficiencies associated with the supply chain challenges. First, our consolidated backlog at the end of the second quarter was 22% higher than the prior year on an organic basis and 15% or approximately $90 million higher than at the end of the first quarter, driven in part by the supply chain challenges, which pushed shipments that would have otherwise shipped in the second quarter into the third quarter. Taking this range of revenue into consideration, we expect to report earnings per share within a range of $0.07 to $0.11 for the third quarter of fiscal '22, which includes our expectations of inflation net of pricing benefits to increase sequentially from the second quarter by approximately $8 million, which equates to an expected year-over-year impact of approximately $28 million."
