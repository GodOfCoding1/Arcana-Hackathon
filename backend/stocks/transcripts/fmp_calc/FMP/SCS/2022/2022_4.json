    "content": " Operating cash flow included a $61 million increase in working capital, driven by revenue growth and increased inventory to adjust to extended supplier lead times, especially for our long distance supply chains, as well as prepare for the strong summer seasonality of Smith System. But broadly, the increase in operating expenses is a little bit, more than half, driven by employee-related costs, global merits, health care, variable compensation, which was very low this year, as you can imagine, given our overall financial performance driven by the inflation and supply chain disruptions, and driven by the significant improvement in profitability, we'll see higher variable compensation."
