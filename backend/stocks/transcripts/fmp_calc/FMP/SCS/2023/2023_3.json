    "content": " With respect to operating expenses, we implemented the previously announced actions to reduce headcount in the Americas and corporate functions, which resulted in approximately $11 million of restructuring costs in the quarter and is expected to lower our cost structure by approximately $19 million on an annualized basis. In addition to the projected range of revenue, the earnings estimate includes gross margin of approximately 29%, which is nearly 300 basis points higher than the prior year and includes projected year-over-year pricing benefits net of inflation of approximately $65 million. I think this year, when you take our fourth quarter guidance and you reverse engineer it to get to adjusted operating income, you can kind of conclude that we're targeting in an $80 million range of adjusted operating income this year."
