    "content": " Adjusted EPS growth of 9% is excellent, especially given costs related to our strategic talent investments, the rebound of T&E, and 32% growth in the third quarter of 2021. Adjusted EPS of $1.18 is up 9% versus a year ago, which is impressive on top of 32% growth in the third quarter of 2021. For the first nine months of 2022, underlying revenue growth was 9%, our adjusted operating income rose 11% to $3.7 billion, our adjusted operating margin increased 60 basis points to 25.6%, and our adjusted EPS increased 12% to $5.38. Looking at Risk & Insurance Services, third quarter revenue was $2.8 billion, up 6% compared with the year ago or 9% on an underlying basis. First nine months of the year, Marsh's revenue was 7.8 billion, underlying growth of 9%. Guy Carpenter's third quarter revenue was 328 million , up 7% on an underlying basis, reflecting solid production and retention. In the Consulting segment, revenue of 2 billion was up 1% from a year ago or 8% on an underlying basis, building on 12% in the third quarter of 2021. Adjusted operating income for the first nine months of the year increased 5% to 1.1 billion, the adjusted operating margin was 19.6%, flat versus the third quarter of 2021. Mercer's revenue was $1.3 billion in the third quarter, up 5% on an underlying basis, which is impressive given the impact of market declines on our investments. Our assets under management was $318 billion at the end of the third quarter, down 8% sequentially and 20% from the third quarter of last year, due entirely to market declines and foreign exchange. And we've broken out -- we will be breaking out cyber especially this year, which is showing rate increases of 53%, and that's down a little bit from rate increases in the prior quarter, but still very strong rate increases."
