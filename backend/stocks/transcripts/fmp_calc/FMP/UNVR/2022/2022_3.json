    "content": " Consequently, our estimated net free cash flow for 2022 is $400 million, which is approximately a 38% conversion from adjusted EBITDA. And in 2022, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll deliver over $1 billion in adjusted EBITDA with sustained positive net free cash flow, which we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve used to opportunistically buy back shares. And whilst not giving firm guidance, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve since stated our intention to deliver on those financial goals a full year ahead of schedule, including the 2023 adjusted EBITDA of $960 million and 50% net free cash flow conversion. In addition, based on our projected organic growth, our share buyback program plans and our expectations for opportunistic M&A, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re targeting an adjusted EPS greater than $4.50 in 2025. Through 2025, we continue to believe in our ability to deliver an adjusted EBITDA margin greater than 9%, with 50% net free cash flow conversion, ROIC of greater than 20%, and expect to deliver greater than $4.50 of adjusted EPS in 2025. I mean, I think, first of all, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re really proud of what we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve done over the last 3 years to put this company in a position that it is, and the way we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve transformed this company into a real high-performing service provider, which gives us the resilience and robustness to survive to whatever the macro, we think."
