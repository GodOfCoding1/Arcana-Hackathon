    "content": " In the second quarter, we continued our trend of outpacing the prior year, thanks in large part to the lasting customer relationships we're building through technical differentiation and supply chain solutions as well as the contribution from new supplier authorizations. Our food ingredients offering which is now known as Foodology, recently opened a new innovation kitchen, where we're helping customers create recipes to meet the latest market trends as well as reformulating in response to supply shortages such as sunflower oil. Accordingly, for Q3 2022, we estimate an adjusted EBITDA guidance of $240 million to $260 million and increase our guidance for the full year 2022 to $1.04 billion to $1.08 billion, with resulting strong cash flows. Looking further ahead to 2023, we continue to expect to achieve the financial targets inclusive of our target of $960 million of adjusted EBITDA laid out at last November's Analyst Day delivering a full year ahead of schedule. These ratios are net of a further $81 million of cash returned to shareholders during the second quarter through our share repurchase program, totaling just over $155 million since last quarter -- last year's Q4. Although the second half of the year poses uncertainties, we're confident in our strategy, execution and operating agility and have increased our expected 2022 full year adjusted EBITDA guidance in the range of $1.04 billion to $1.08 billion, with resulting net free cash flow between $400 million to $450 million."
