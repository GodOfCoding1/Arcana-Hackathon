    "content": " Strength in our nonresort urban portfolio has carried forward into October, which is on pace to post ADR growth and generate 5% greater EBITDA than October of 2019 on a same-store basis. In the more leisure-heavy third quarter, our resort portfolio continued to outperform, generating 24% RevPAR growth through the third quarter of 2019 driven by ADR growth of 29.5%. In what is typically a seasonally slower quarter, our South Florida portfolio posted nearly 35% RevPAR growth to 2019 driven by 25% ADR growth. The comparable portfolio generated just under $31 million in EBITDA for the quarter, an increase of over 8% from 2019. The Boston Envoy led the way for the portfolio for the second straight quarter with $4.1 million in EBITDA, a 4.7 increase -- a 4.7% increase to 2019 and a nearly 54% gain to 2021. And in New York City, the Hyatt Union Square produced over $2 million in EBITDA, a 4% increase to the third quarter of 2019 with an EBITDA margin of 34.9%, representing an increase of 495 basis points to 2019. In total, our New York urban portfolio produced just under $10 million in EBITDA for the quarter, the highest contribution of any market, and achieved an EBITDA margin of 38.1%, was an increase of 180 basis points to 2019. Excluding our Holiday Inn Express Chelsea, which will have a subset of rooms offline for renovation throughout the year's end, we project RevPAR and EBITDA growth to 2019 in each month of the fourth quarter for this New York urban portfolio. The hotel generated $2.6 million in EBITDA for the quarter, second highest contribution in the entire portfolio, nearly 55% greater than 2019 and 5% above the record-setting 2021. On the West Coast, the Sanctuary Beach Resort in Monterey continued to demonstrate its pricing power as the resort's third quarter ADR of $709.97 drove RevPAR of $490, a nearly 23% increase to 2019, generated $1.8 million of EBITDA for the quarter, a 36.5% increase to '19 and an EBITDA margin for the quarter of 42.2%. These robust pricing conditions, in tandem with our continued focus on efficient operations and strategic asset management initiatives, resulted in another quarter of very strong profitability as the comparable hotel portfolio generated just under $31 million in EBITDA, an increase of 8.4% to third quarter 2019. Despite ongoing recoveries still taking place in the business transient, small group and international travel segment, our nonresort portfolio was able to achieve 71 basis points of EBITDA margin growth in the third quarter. In Boston, the Envoy and Boxer grew EBITDA margin by 327 basis points and 153 basis points, respectively, while the Boxer's EBITDA of just under $750,000 was 6.2% greater than the third quarter of 2019. Hyatt Union Square generated over $2 million in EBITDA, 4% greater than 2019, with 495 basis points of margin growth to nearly 35%. In White Plains, our Hyatt House generated EBITDA of approximately $1.5 million, a 25% increase to 2019 with EBITDA margins of 44.7%, an increase of 346 basis points. In total, our resort portfolio generated over $11 million of EBITDA for the quarter with EBITDA margins just under 31%, an increase of 704 basis points to 2019. The strong performance has accelerated into October with our resorts expected to generate over $5 million of EBITDA in the month alone with EBITDA margins above 35%, over 1,000 basis points higher than 2019."
