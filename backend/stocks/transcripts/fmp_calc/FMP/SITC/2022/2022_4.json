    "content": "  The fourth quarter concluded a very productive year for SITE Centers with results ahead of budget, another quarter of elevated leasing volume despite having less available space, the opportunistic sale of three wholly-owned properties with pricing well inside of where we repurchased stock, and a balance sheet that remains in great shape with full availability on our line of credit, minimal near-term maturities and debt to EBITDA in the low 5s, which remains well ahead of the peer group and the sector overall."
