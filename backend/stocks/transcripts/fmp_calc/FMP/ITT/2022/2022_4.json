    "content": " It was your efforts that drove the record performance we are presenting today, including 12% organic orders growth following 13% growth in Q3, over 17% organic revenue growth in all businesses delivering double-digit growth, a record segment margin of 18.6%, 22% EPS growth after 21% in Q3 and over $130 million of free cash flow up 58% versus prior year. We're continuing the push on shop floor improvements as demonstrated by IP's margin of 22.9%, up 700 basis points year-over-year, even excluding roughly 120 basis points of onetime items, IP's margin was still above 21%. For the first quarter, we expect to deliver mid- to high single-digit organic growth led by industrial process followed by CCT, more than 100 basis points of margin expansion at the midpoint, led by IP and CCT with MT approximately in line with its Q4 2022 margin rate and adjusted EPS growth of over 15% year-over-year. So Jeff, in terms of margin trajectory, I think that if you think about IP and CCT, as Luca mentioning, they are in a different dynamic than MT, where if you think about IT, we probably closed from a sustainable margin performance in IP at around 18% in 2022. And so in terms of outperformance versus all the different regions, we expect that we're going to have first overall global an outperformance in the market in '23, that's going to be a little higher than what we've seen in '22. I guess following up on the frictional outperformance question, it sounds like step up a little bit relative to the 400 basis point run rate at least globally that's certainly below the 900 that we've grown accustomed to over the years, but it makes sense given the share gain trajectory that you've been on for so long."
