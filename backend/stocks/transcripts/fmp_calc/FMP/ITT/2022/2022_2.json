    "content": " Because of our solid first half performance, the large backlog we have accumulated, the pricing capture we are executing and the performance momentum especially at IP and CCT, we are raising our organic sales guidance to a new range of 10% to 12% and we are also tightening our adjusted EPS guidance to a new range of 435 to 465 and maintaining the prior midpoint. Today we are raising our organic sales growth outlook to 10% to 12%, given our strong first half performance, the strong demand and backlog growth in IP and CCT and the pricing we are relating.

Your line is open. Your line is open."
