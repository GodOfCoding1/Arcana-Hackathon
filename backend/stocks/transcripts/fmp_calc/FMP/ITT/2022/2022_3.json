    "content": " This was driven by short cycle and pump project growth in Industrial Process, share gains in Connectors and over 30% growth in aerospace components in CCT, friction share gains, especially in Europe and North America and pricing recovery actions across all segments. MT margin will be approximately flat to Q3 and given the firming of our pricing benefits, offset by persistent inflation and lower aftermarket volumes while both IP and CCT will expand sequentially in Q4 to exit the year above 20%."
