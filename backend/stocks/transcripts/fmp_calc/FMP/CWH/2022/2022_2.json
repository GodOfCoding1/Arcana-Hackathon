    "content": " And while we don't want to chase opportunities and overpay for product, we have really started, and I think Karin has helped us with that, really prepared to build a lot of cash going into the third and fourth quarter to start to build that used inventory. Well, first and foremost, I never \u00e2\u0080\u0093 as you guys know, never want to complement manufacturers because they have a purpose of selling inventory, but I will say that when we rang the bell to the market back with all of you in February and talked about the inventory concerns we saw coming, and we mentioned it again in our first quarter call that we saw that and we had many, many, many calls and meetings with the manufacturers, we are pleased with their what we consider very prudent choice to cut production, cut days supply because they know that a glut of inventory isn't good for anybody. I want to clear up one thing that hasn't been asked, but in case it will be asked interest rate rises have a moderate effect on our business, but because we finance anywhere between 180 and 240 months and our average financing is around $40,000, average sale price is around $40,000, the numbers move, but they don't take people out of the lifestyle, especially when you're comparing it to airline travel, hotel travel, theme parks, professional sports eating out at night, doing a lot of other things."
