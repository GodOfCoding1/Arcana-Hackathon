    "content": "  These remarks may include statements regarding our business goals, plans, abilities and opportunities; our strategic initiatives, acquisitions and planned capital expenditures; anticipated uses of capital; anticipated cost reduction initiatives and related cost savings; industry and customer trends; the expected impact of inflation, interest rates and market conditions; the expected impact of the subsidiary LLC conversions on our ongoing income tax expense and tax distribution requirements; future dividend payments; and anticipated financial performance. We're encouraging to have the manufacturers find items to eliminate that don't necessarily take away value for the customer; technology trinkets that may add value in the long term, but don't add margin in the short term; association fees that pay into associations that may provide value in the long term, but don't provide value in the short term; look for the intangible things that are attached to the cost of goods on those units that don't take value away from the end consumer."
