    "content": " And when we look at any time we go into a headwind period and I've been doing this for 20 years, you have to contract your SG&A, contract your headcount, contract all of your initiatives and get hyper focused on primarily three categories; the used business because of the margin profile and its uniqueness in the marketplace; the service business because there's over 11.5 million RVers already in the marketplace and growing; and our Good Sam business because it services that. I really do believe that it's prudent for our company to reduce its headcount, control its cash and its SG&A and its CapEx as if there's a possibility of the shipment data going down not from 400 which is what I've seen published, but it could go down as low as 360 to 370. but I'm not going to allow this business to have any excess waste, any excess headcount, any excess SG&A or any new initiatives during this period because my job is to protect the investors from any downside that I possibly can and to put our capital where we think we're going to get the greatest return."
