    "content": " And so however much people want to read through those lines, I'll make it more clear than that, we are not going to be keeping our inventory levels where they're at today as we go through the balance of the year because we recognize the risk associated with inventory and the importance of the disciplines that have made us a lot of money in the last several years and are not going to give that up at anybody's expense -- at our own expense. We're doing everything we can to replace that missed opportunity with finding either first-time buyers through our funnel that we haven't met before, which is probably why we performed slightly better than the marketplace, and our used business as an alternative, based on people's payment preference or value proposition as well. If you're looking at this industry and you're sensitizing your models based on it dropping 10% or 20% or 30%, the hedge for our company, not the manufacturers, not other dealers, is different because so much of our gross profit comes from service, parts and other, from used, from our Good Sam business, from our finance business, from all those other things. And furthermore, as we continue to put that emphasis on used units, which the ASP on used is going to be lower than a new unit, we think that's relatively sustainable here for the next quarter, where we don't see much of a material change from quarter-to-quarter. So you're in that range with that 20% suggestion of invoice price increases year-over-year, which we've seen that quarter-to-quarter, that ASP, as well as if you start to back into the same-store new unit versus some of the other factors in the supplemental data, you'll see the average rough COGS associated with these assets has also continued to go up that same amount."
