    "content": " Our quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year AUM benefited from strong inflows to our physical trusts, in particular our physical uranium, gold and silver trusts as well as the onboarding of new commitment fee generating private strategy LPs and $1 billion of AUM from the URNM acquisition in the second quarter. Just moving to Slide 8, our net flows for the quarter were $128 million, and I think, it's fair to say that in sharp contrast to most asset managers around the world, we had very strong results for the calendar year 2022 with $2 billion in net flows. As Whitney mentioned, we also launched an actively managed energy transition strategy in mid-2022, which is targeted a high net worth family office and institutional investors."
