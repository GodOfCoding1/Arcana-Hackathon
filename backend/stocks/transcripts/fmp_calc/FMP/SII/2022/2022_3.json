    "content": " But on a nine-month ended year-over-year basis, our cumulative market value declines were more than offset by strong inflows to our physical trusts, in particular, our uranium and gold trusts, the onboarding of new commitment fee generating private strategy LPs and $1 billion of AUM onboarding from the URNM acquisition. I guess the other overarching factor besides the price being a lot lower on the base that was amortized in the past and the amortization period being shorter is also the fact that the amortization method that was used from 2017 through to 2021 under IFRS 2 was called the graded vesting method, which takes bigger amortization amounts in the early years of the program and very small ones in the latter years."
