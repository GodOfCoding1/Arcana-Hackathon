    "content": " But now in my new role from January, where Arnold has to do all earnings calls and I'm going to have time -- to spend more time in Japan and still as a board member at CPB, as advisors that Arnold, and Arnold's requested me to really do some rainmaking in Japan, I'm going to have a lot more time to focus on that market. As far as the targets for next year, it's very difficult to say, I think what we've always said, Laurie is, we're not going to accelerate growth unless we find a sweet spot, a strategy that leads to profitable swell customers and swell CPB and Elevate are all aligned in that objective."
