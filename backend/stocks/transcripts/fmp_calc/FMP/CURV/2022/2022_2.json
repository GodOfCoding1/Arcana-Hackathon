    "content": " Net sales grew 2% to $341 million compared to $333 million last year, and comparable sales in the quarter were up 1%. This compares to $150 million, or 45% of net sales in the second quarter of last year. As a percentage of sales SG&A decreased to 19.3% from 53.8% compared to the second quarter of last year, due to lower share based compensation and higher private label credit card income. Net income for the quarter was $23 million, or $0.22 per share versus net income of $39 million, or $0.35 per share for the same period last year. We had no adjustment to net income in the second quarter of 2022, but for comparison purposes, adjusted net income last year was $39 million or $0.36 per share. Adjusted EBITDA came in at $52 million or 15.3% of net sales, compared to $87 million, or 26% of net sales in the second quarter of 2021. That's pretty much baked in at this point, I think the opportunity for the back half of the year, and we don't have a lot baked into our model, let's be honest about it, because we are a little bit of a wait and see at this point as we make sure that she responds appropriately and the way that we expect her to the new inventory levels as well as assortment."
