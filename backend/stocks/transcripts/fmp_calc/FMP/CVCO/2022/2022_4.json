Before we begin, we\u2019d like to remind you that the comments made during this conference call by management may contain forward-looking statements under the provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including statements of expectations or assumptions about Cavco\u2019s financial and operational performance, revenues, earnings per share, cash flow or use, cost savings, operational efficiencies, current or future volatility in the credit markets or future market conditions. All forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, which could affect Cavco\u2019s actual results and could cause its actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of Cavco. I encourage you to review Cavco\u2019s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including without limitation, the Company\u2019s most recent Forms 10-K and 10-Q, which identify specific factors that may cause actual results or events to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements. Each of the last several years as we\u2019ve turned the corner, we\u2019ve been facing a different set of challenges, which makes it particularly gratifying to be able to report record results. The year before last fiscal \u201821, our revenue and earnings gains were both in the 4% to 5% range. The acquisition of Commodore had a significant impact, but even without that edition, we would\u2019ve grown the top line by about 15% and profit by well over a 100%. It\u2019s tempting to attribute these results solely to market forces, given the strong demand and significant price increases, but underpinning our financial performance was an improvement in capacity utilization from approximately 75% in the fourth quarter a year ago to over 80% this past quarter, which is above pre-pandemic levels. Despite continuing labor and supply issues, we\u2019re making about 11% or 1,600 more homes than we were before the pandemic. And the work they\u2019ve been doing to reduce product complexity has been paying off with more homes, which is what our customers have needed the most. On a same plant basis, production was up 14% compared to last year\u2019s fourth quarter. Over the past few years, it was clearly a question of COVID\u2019s impact on economic activity. And stating the obvious, the rate increases we\u2019ve already seen dramatically increase monthly payments, thereby decreasing affordability. We know that over the past couple of years, the price increases have left many hopeful buyers without the ability to own a new home in the near-term. While we aren\u2019t able to specifically quantify it, the movement of buyers from site build into the manufactured housing is real. And of course, we\u2019ll be watching closely. I\u2019m very confident, the increasing role manufactured housing will play in solving the deficit of housing over any strategic planning timeframe. So, we remain optimistic and I have extreme confidence in this organization\u2019s ability to successfully monitor and adjust to any shift in market dynamics as I\u2019ve seen our people do time and again. With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Allison to discuss the quarterly results in more detail. Net revenue for the period was $505.5 million, up 64.9%, compared to $306.5 million during the prior fiscal year\u2019s fourth quarter. Sequentially, from the third quarter of fiscal 2022, net revenue increased 17.1%, mostly driven by an increase in units shipped, resulting from higher factory utilization. Within the factory built housing market, net revenue increased 69.5% to $488.3 million from $288 million in the prior year quarter. We\u2019re pleased to report that factory utilization exceeded 80% during the quarter, slightly higher than pre-pandemic levels. Financial services segment net revenue decreased 7.2% to $17.2 million from $18.5 million due to lower interest income earned on the acquired consumer loan portfolio, lower unrealized gain on marketable equity securities and lower home loan sales income. Consolidated gross profit in the fourth fiscal quarter as a percentage of net revenue was 25.6%, up from 23.1% in the same period last year. The increase is mainly the results of the factory built housing segment, increasing to 24.5% in Q4 2022 versus 20.6% in Q4 of 2021. Material costs increased from third quarter levels, resulting in a lower gross margin sequentially from 25.2% in Q3 of 2022. During the process of working our way through the price protected backlog, we expect the legacy Commodore gross margins to continue to negatively impact our consolidated margins for the next couple of quarters, but improve after that. Gross margin as a percentage of revenue in financial services decreased to 58.5% in Q4 2022, from 61.9% in Q4 of 2021 from greater weather-related events, and lower realized and unrealized gain on marketable equity securities. Selling, general and administrative expenses in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 were $59.7 million, or 11.8% of net revenue, compared to $44 million or 14.3% of net revenue during the same quarter last year. This decrease is primarily driven by unrealized losses on marketable equity securities, partially offset by higher interest income earned on our commercial loan balances, which increased as a result of the Commodore Homes acquisition. The effective interest tax rate was 22.1% for the fourth fiscal quarter, compared to 15.2% in the same period last year. This increased tax rate is due to a lower level of tax benefit from exercise stock options in the current year, compared to the same quarter last year. Now, I\u2019ll turn it over to Paul to discuss the balance sheet. So, I\u2019ll be covering changes in the April 2, 2022 balance sheet compared to the April 3, 2021 amounts. The cash balance was $244.2 million, down 24.2% from $322.3 million a year ago. Uses of cash during the year include the acquisition of Commodore and Craftsman  Homes, repurchases of common stock, higher inventory balances and purchases of property, plant and equipment. The acquisition of Commodore and Craftsman Homes resulted in increases in primarily all assets and liabilities, including accounts receivable, commercial loans receivable, inventories, property, plant and equipment, goodwill and intangibles, accounts payable and accrued expenses. Lastly, stockholders\u2019 equity was approximately $830.5 million as of April 2, 2022, up $146.9 million from $683.6 million as of April 3, 2021. With that, I\u2019ll turn it back to Mark. We don\u2019t have any specific targets, but we\u2019ve got some real momentum with us on productivity. And if you think about it, we\u2019ve had long backlogs. So, even when you decide and you kind of simplify your product mix at a plant, you\u2019ve got to work through a lot of orders that you\u2019re committed to delivering to get to that simpler product mix. So, I really do think there\u2019s upside from there. I don\u2019t have the ability right now to try to quantify it for you there, Dan. But every time a different material becomes a challenge, it\u2019s a new -- it is a new thing to solve. And as I think folks know, I\u2019d say that -- well, generally the supply problem has been very persistent, it\u2019s transitioned to a lot more driven by logistics and trucking more recently. I\u2019ve not talked to anyone that has been able to give me any insight into when it\u2019ll light up, but we\u2019re expecting it to be persistent going forward for a while. But I\u2019ll tell you, to really back up and look at what we\u2019ve been seeing. And again, I hope this isn\u2019t a complex answer. The last several months, we\u2019ve seen pricing, particularly the end of the calendar year, early this year, as much as it was going up before, it almost accelerated. And so, I\u2019ve almost described it as like a swirling or a shifting going on. The dynamic has largely been though that if a deal falls through for a retailer on a retail sold unit, there\u2019s very likely another buyer there that can pick up that unit. So, there\u2019s been a lot of shifting, but it\u2019s not necessarily an indication of underlying demand. Traffic is still high and we\u2019re still getting deposits, seeing in our retail as well as our independence. So, we really haven\u2019t seen a tail off of demand, but we\u2019ve definitely seen a bit more chaos, because of the really rapidly accelerating monthly payments that people are facing. I really don\u2019t think we\u2019ve seen indications of a drop-off at this point, but we\u2019ve seen a lot of disturbance in the market, as I described. So what\u2019s going in our favor is we face, this is the flow down from site build into manufacturing that I alluded to. So, not trying to paint either a rosy or pessimistic picture, but I think we\u2019re looking for indications of demand at a time when really what\u2019s going on is a bit of a reaction to that pricing and interest rate shock. Now, rather than confusing, that\u2019s actually extremely helpful. I\u2019m just curious if you can talk about whether it\u2019s pretty consistent across the board from all channels, i.e. both retail and community, and whether you\u2019re seeing any differences in terms of, pockets of geographies where maybe quarter-to-date demand, whether that\u2019s measured by traffic orders, quotes, whether it\u2019s significantly different across various geographies. And the community, the interest of community operators, particularly the larger REIT type community operators, their growth plans and their demand, they\u2019re still talking to us about can we get as many houses as you can make. And that doesn\u2019t mean -- again, I don\u2019t know that I\u2019m predicting a big retail drop-off. I\u2019m just seeing communities, which some of us will remember several years ago, they were driving the growth of this industry. So, it does feel like that\u2019s a little stronger to me right now. If there is any area that I think we\u2019re queued in a little bit more, it\u2019s probably the southeast. But I wouldn\u2019t describe that in a way that we\u2019re seeing markedly different dynamics, it just seems like there\u2019s a little more of that swirl going on in the southeast, potentially. I mean, we\u2019ve been seeing for quite a while and the product mix, just a little bit of a steady shift toward multi-section. And I think there\u2019s logic behind that and all the dynamics we\u2019ve talked about, because -- and this is a little bit feel, I guess, Greg. So, there\u2019s some logic behind this kind of continual shift toward multi-section. But I don\u2019t think in recent quarters, we\u2019ve really noted any dramatic change, and what\u2019s in the backlog. And as far as options, that\u2019s a little bit of a tough question, too, because our product simplification includes reducing options. So, if we really dissected the backlog, we\u2019d probably be seeing more driven by our offering than by any indication of what people are interested in buying. I\u2019m just trying to get a sense of whether this is a longer term journey that maybe suggests that these production efficiencies, as you talk about, can continue to increase for a while. My comment earlier was that with the backlogs that we have, if you decide today on new offerings, you\u2019re not going to have as many floor plans or as many options, you\u2019re still going to have to make what\u2019s in your backlog for a while. But I think, we\u2019re well into that. But, it\u2019s a major factor and I think our plants have been pretty aggressive about it, but they\u2019ve done it in a way that we believe that working with our dealer customers, for example, we\u2019re still providing products that are really matched to the market. So, I think there\u2019s more to go, as I answered the earlier question. And no, it\u2019s not only us increasing our utilization is not only going to come from simplification, it\u2019s going to come from continuing to get our staffing up and our retention up and building the skills of the team, kind of in the middle of all that. So, I think that\u2019s been a bit of a governor. Last couple of years, it\u2019s been more about inputs. So, I think that\u2019s created a governor, but obviously, we\u2019re adding a couple and I know of others that are adding here and there as well. First part, I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve seen really any pickup in delinquencies, people -- or buyers throughout, while some of them have gotten priced out by the time they get to the time they would have gotten their homes, the people that are qualified for getting those homes. So, I haven\u2019t seen any issue there. We\u2019ve been saying for a while that at the beginning -- I always relate everything to the pandemic, because that\u2019s when seems like everything got a little crazy. But the interesting thing at the beginning that we\u2019ve talked about in the past is that home only rates that were in maybe the 7.5% range actually dropped down to the in some cases below 5%, let\u2019s say, 5% to 5.5% range. And now, they\u2019ve really started to move up. I\u2019d like to turn the call back over to Bill Boor, President and CEO for any closing remarks. Cavco is recognized with our industry association\u2019s Community Impact Award this year, due to the Martinsville plant\u2019s outstanding work on the project. And I bring it up partly because I think they deserve some recognition, but it\u2019s also, everything we\u2019re talking about, about affordability and the impact of pricing and rate shifts. So, it\u2019s important work. I think, the business results have been outstanding, but we\u2019re still really connected to this cause of trying to have an impact, like the Martinsville plant has had recently. Ladies and gentlemen, this conclude today\u2019s presentation."
