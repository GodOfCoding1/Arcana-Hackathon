    "content": " First, revenues were delivered at the high end of the guidance range of $2.3 million, which is over 100% year-over-year growth. We're also working with a top digital media company to optimize their office space utilization as well as improved in-store experiences and conversion rates, which we believe could potentially represent a $30 million revenue opportunity over 2 years. We ended the third quarter with trailing 12-month bookings of $10.8 million, representing a year-over-year growth of 154%. For the third quarter, our revenue was $2.3 million, which represents an increase of 104% from the year prior period and a 92% increase sequentially. As such, our non-GAAP operating expenses increased to $12.6 million for the quarter, up from $6.5 million for the same period last year and $35.1 million for the 9 months of this year, up from about $20.5 million in the year prior period."
