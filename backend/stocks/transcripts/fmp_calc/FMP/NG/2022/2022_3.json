    "content": " Donlin Gold's 2022 expenditures are estimated to be about $64 million of which NOVAGOLD's share is 50% As shown on Slide 5, the drill program included tight spaced grid drilling in structural domains, in pit, and below pit exploration in sparsely drilled areas, platform mapping to confirm mineralization continuity and key geologic controls in several areas of deposit, waste rock facility condemnation drilling, and 13 geotechnical drill holes for the Alaska Dam Safety certificates. We reported a net loss of $16.1 million in the third quarter, an increase of $4.2 million from the prior year quarter, of which $2.7 million was due to the expanded Donlin Gold work program and $1.6 million from the increase in other expenses including increased interest expense on the direct loan, a decrease in the fair value of marketable securities, foreign exchange movements, and lower accretion income due to the maturity of the $75 million Newmont note last year. As shown on the bar chart on Slide 18, with almost 40 million ounces of resources, Donlin Gold is by far the largest among the development projects. With exceptional grade at 2.25 grams or twice the industry average for an open-pit project that's shown on Slide 20, this advantage enables Donlin to be predicted to be one of the lowest cost producers in the gold space."
