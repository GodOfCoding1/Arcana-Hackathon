    "content": " But as I mentioned, we expect marketing costs to increase in the back half as we increase investment in casino markets and head into football season for the first time in many markets, but that could also be accompanied by a nice increase in revenue. Your line is live. And then Mexico is a new addition for us since last quarter, but we just want to make sure that people realize that's going to be a more modest investment, not a big impact on revenue and expenses out of the gate here, and we'll take our time to build that market, but we're really excited about it. Your line is live. Sure, I'll take that one. Your line is live. Your line is live. Your line is live. Your line is live. Your line is live. And maybe I'll just throw one more on top of there that probably seems relatively obvious, but there's a very clear pattern for us that as markets become more mature, we're spending less marketing dollars as a percentage of the revenue that's being generated. Sure, I'll take that one. Your line is live. Obviously, you've got football season starting, but putting investment into casino -- like casino markets that we think we can get really strong returns from. But, it certainly -- at this point in time, it's certainly in that market -- the key for that market wasn't just showing up one day market opening but really spending the year before trying to secure the right marketing assets that are relatively limited in that market in terms of the mainstream marketing assets to reach those consumers in a meaningful way. Your line is live."
