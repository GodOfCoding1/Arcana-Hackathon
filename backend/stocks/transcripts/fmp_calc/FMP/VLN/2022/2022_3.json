Thank you, and welcome, everyone, to Valens Semiconductor's Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. As a reminder, today's earnings call may include forward-looking statements and projections, which do not guarantee future events or performance. Please refer to our annual report on Form 20 filed with the SEC on March 2, 2022, for a discussion of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied. We will be discussing certain non-GAAP measures on this call, which we believe are relevant in assessing the financial performance of the business, and you can find reconciliations of these metrics within our earnings release. Q3 2022 revenues were a record of $23.1 million, up 21% compared with Q3 2021. Demand for our high-speed uncompressed multimedia distribution solutions was strong, and our audio-video business continued expanding into new applications and verticals from corporate, education, government, industrial, to medical and more. The trend of educational entities using hybrid models to enable students and staff to switch between on-site and remote learning is here to stay, and we are seeing more and more classrooms around the world equipped with video collaboration systems. In the corporate sector, the opportunity across industries and geographies is substantial for audio-video connectivity technology, such as ours and video conferencing technology is increasingly essential for the office space, video meeting and remote work. I'm also proud to share that earlier this year, Valens Semiconductor chip set embedding Panasonic 4K HD Suite for video products were used to enhance the experience of athletes and spectators from around the world at the  winter games. All in all, our audio-video business grew on the top line and generated strong margins with a healthy mix of customers, industries, and geographies. In Q3, we also continued to sell our automotive VA6000 chip set in  applications for audio-video use. I believe that going forward, we will see additional revenue contribution in the audio-video business by repurposing our automotive products. The VA7000 chip set family, our non-symmetric product was the first in the industry to comply with MIPI A-PHY standard. It addresses the growing need for high-speed video productivity for automotive applications, such as Advanced Driver Assistance Systems known as ADAS, which is projected to run towards an $8 billion to $10 billion market in the coming years. Valens Semiconductor's nonsymmetric DSP-based connectivity technology is the foundation for the MIPI A-PHY standard, which aims to replace the legacy analog solution existing to date in car. Valens, the VA7000 product family features outstanding resilience to electromagnetic interference known as EMI, making it an ideal connectivity solution for  high-resolution sensors that significantly improved object detection and classification. Speaking on  specifically, it is becoming clear that in addition to camera sensors, radar are essential to meet our automotive OEM and Tier 1 ADAS requirements. In our previous calls, we communicated of our expectations regarding the pace of adoption of our VA7000 solutions. I am pleased to share with you, we have already received initial RFIs from potential customers for our MIPI A-PHY-compliant VA7000 chip sets. In line with our strategic plan, the growing MIPI A-PHY ecosystem continues to gain a submission and is well-positioned for large-scale implementation by automotive OEMs around the world. An important pillar is solidifying the ecosystem , which shares  Board of Directors and determined that MIPI A-PHY is the most cutting-edge high-speed connectivity technology in the automotive industry. In Q3, we announced a collaboration with Intel foundry services to support the development of MIPI A-PHY compliance offering for their automotive customers. In the third quarter, we announced the successful completion of the industry's first joint interoperability test between a Valens Semiconductor VA7000 chip on the receiver side and Sony Semiconductor Solutions prototypes of integrated sensor and transmitter chip set on the other side. Last month, we conducted the webinar with Sony Semiconductor Solutions in  in association of Japanese automotive OEMs and Tier 1s such as Toyota, Nissan, Honda, Mazda, Suzuki, and Denso on how automotive companies can advance ADAS in autonomous driving with MIPI A-PHY. Hundreds of participants from the Japanese automotive industry joined the webinar to hear speakers from  Toyota next-generation high-speed network group, Sony Semiconductor Solutions automotive development and Valens Semiconductor discuss the progress of MIPI A-PHY and growing importance of electromagnetic compatibility known as EMC in cars. Technologies, which delivered advanced design and validation solution is addressing the growing market demand for high-speed digital interfaces for next-generation in-vehicle networks. In September, they announced their partnership with several companies, including Valens Semiconductor to develop a MIPI A-PHY-compliance tech solution that ensures data transmission quality and broad scale interoperability. Since going public, we have made significant progress executing against our business plan and growth strategy, which is supported by our solid balance sheet. In the near term, we will continue to monitor the macro environment and in particular, items that could impact our business during 2023 such as lead times,  partner, and demand levels across industries. We will continue to focus on our best opportunities, which we believe will drive sustainable growth and profitability for the company. I'll now turn it over to Dror Heldenberg, our CFO, to review our Q3 2022 financial results and provide our financial outlook. We exceeded the high end of our revenue, gross margin, and adjusted EBITDA guidance. We achieved record quarterly revenues of $23.1 million, an increase of 21.3% from the third quarter of 2021. Third quarter 2022 gross margin came in at 69.7% compared to last year's 72.4%, reflecting another portion of revenue coming from our automotive business, which carries lower gross margins  video. Operating expenses were $21.3 million in Q3 2022, down 3.4% from $22 million in Q3 last year. This reflects our continued investment in developing product offerings to address the new business opportunities ahead of us in both automotive and audio video while taking into account our realigned and optimized automotive R&D efforts, which match our prospective customers and partners road map. Q3 GAAP net loss was $5.3 million compared to $8.5 million loss in Q3 of 2021, and we exceeded our guidance for adjusted EBITDA, reporting an adjusted EBITDA loss of $1.7 million. The rescheduling of certain R&D expenses from Q3 to later this year and early 2023 and the strength of the U.S. dollar, which positively impacted expenses paid in Israeli  mainly for compensation to employees based in Israel. GAAP loss per share for Q3 2022 was $0.05, calculated as the net loss divided by 98.1 million shares. This compares to Q3 2021 GAAP loss per share of $0.94, which is calculated as a net loss of $8.5 million and accrued dividend related to preferred shares in the amount of $3.9 million, totaling $12.3 million divided by 13.2 million shares. The non-GAAP loss per share for Q3 2022 was $0.02, which is calculated as a non-GAAP net loss of $1.5 million, divided by the 98.1 million shares. This compares to Q3 2021 non-GAAP loss per share of $0.23, which is calculated as a net loss of $3 million divided by the 13.2 million shares. Cash, cash equivalents and short-term deposits totaled $152.9 million, and we had no debt. Furthermore, looking at working capital, -- we ended the third quarter with a balance of $166.6 million compared to $168.3 million at the end of Q2 2022. This difference of $1.7 million is mainly due to the loss during Q3 2022 after reconciling the non cash expenses such as equity-based compensation, depreciation, and adjustment of the fair market value of the future shares. Our inventory as of September 30, 2022, was $21.9 million, an increase of $4.6 million from the end of Q2 2020. Second, as we have discussed in previous calls, in order to secure production capacity with vendors in  constrained supply environment, we place longer-term purchase orders. This level of inventory is needed to meet the demand from customers we see ahead of us in the next 12 months, especially in automotive, where we intend to double our revenues from 2022 to 2023. Although we continue to face cost increases from some of our supply chain vendors, we expect supply constraints to start easing and lead time to start normalizing in the second half of 2023. For the fourth quarter of 2022, we expect revenues in the range of $23.1 million to $23.2 million. In the fourth quarter, we are planning  of our automotive VA7000 family chip sets. To be able to deliver to our potential customers, reach a feature set and better performance in line with market expectations. At the same time, in alignment with our current road map, we are  adjusted EBITDA loss is expected to be in the range of $9.7 million to $9 million as we record  costs in our income statement as they occur. As of September 30, 2022, shares outstanding totaled $98.4 million. We are raising our guidance for the full year 2022, largely due to the fact that we exceeded the high end of our revenue, gross margin, and adjusted EBITDA guidance for Q3 2020. We now expect revenues to range between 90.3 and $90.4 million, up from 89.1 and $89.8 million provided in August. Given the ongoing expansion of our automotive revenues, we continue to expect to essentially double this part of the business in 2022 compared to 2021. We are also substantially improving our projected adjusted EBITDA loss to now be between 20 and $19.3 million for the full year, significantly better than the prior range of $25.7 million to $24.3 million. This improvement in adjusted EBITDA is driven mainly by aligning our product road map to our customers' needs, also supported by the expected benefit from the strong U.S. dollar on our  based expenses. We remain on track to reach adjusted EBITDA break even by the end of 2023, which means that in 2024, we believe the company should reach cash flow profitability. Further, our automotive business continues to evolve, and we expect revenues from the first-generation products, the VA6000 to grow further, and this will be used in more car models. Second, we are receiving positive feedback from prospective customers and partners that are evaluating the VA7000. The initial RFIs that we received are an important milestone towards adoption of A5 products by automotive OEMs,  we continue to see new opportunities in various verticals for our high-margin and diversified audio video business in corporate, education, medical, and  industrial among others. Fourth, even in today's challenging economics and the constrained supply environment, we successfully managed to meet all our customers' demand in a timely manner. Finally, during the past quarter, we released our fresh sustainability report, less than a year after being listed as a public company. At Valens, we constantly strive for excellence and innovative ways to ensure our products and solutions meet the highest standard of our customers and provide society the connectivity required in an ever-evolving environment. However, if we analyze our business, and let's start with the automotive, I think that what we're seeing today, we're starting to see indications that our automotive business is expected to double its revenue in 2023 from 2022. So in that respect, we feel that the automotive business is quite resilient. With respect to the  business, so I would say that the audio-video business is probably more correlated to some of the global macro trends that we see today. So we assume that at least during the first part of '23, customers will mainly consume inventories that they accrued in the challenging supply demand environment. Having said that, -- when we analyze the audio-video segment in 2023, we still see the following opportunities. And we see this product in designs of many industry-leading companies, and we expect to see more revenue contribution from these chip sets in next year in 2023. In addition, our other solutions are now being evaluated, as Gideon mentioned in his prepared remarks, for new applications, and we assume that at least some of them will mature into mass-production products during '23. So I would say maybe to summarize, while we anticipate a more moderate growth rate for this part of the business compared to the projected 2022 year-over-year growth rate -- we still believe that we will continue to see an annual growth in audio-video. With respect to the last part of your question about some cancellations or push outs, I would say that these are tough days for our customers as well. However, those push outs were offset by  requests by other customers, and this resulted in the improved guidance that we shared with you today in this call. I think you've talked in the past about sort of the low mid-60s, but I didn't know if there was any update on sort of gross margin, I guess. Obviously, as we refreshed the inventory -- in this environment -- inflation environment, it comes with higher costs. In terms of our gross margin going forward, again, today, we provide you the gross margin we anticipate for Q4 and the full year. And every quarter, we see the strength in other areas of the business. It's a very encouraging sign for us with respect to the penetration of this new product, which, by the way, comes with higher ASP to customers. Like you know that Valens is not exposed to some of the very sensitive markets today, and we're exposed more to a market  hybrid education and hybrid learning and conference rooms, which are left to even zero impacted from the atmosphere, -- of course, not everything is exact, but this is one of the reasons that we keep seeing the growth in the company and -- the growth in the company, and this is one of the reasons for the heads up for next year. So I think that as we indicated in the past, the project with Stoneridge continues to progress, and we are not changing our previous guidance that we anticipate mass production and ramp up of this business next year in 2023. So I think that this is something that we've already mentioned last time, we mentioned that after we started to ship the first samples of the A-PHY product, the VA7000 engineering samples to customers, obviously, we worked with our prospective customers very closely to better understand their road map and their schedule. And based on all these close relationships and joint work with the OEMs and some of the Tier 1s, we realize that we need to realign a bit and adjust our product road map development. And now based on the input that we receive from customers, what is more important to them, what is less important and when they need more new devices, we realize that we need to adjust our road map. I think that the focus today of customers is to make sure that the VA7000 can reach to mass production according to their schedule, they are -- I think that the next generation can wait a bit. I think that today, the customers are very focused on the benefits that the VA7000 brings. Just to name few them, it's the better EMC, it's the bandwidth, the total system cost -- it's the -- it's a set of advantages that I think that they recognize. It's a set of benefits, and we need to make sure that we help them to get to much production as soon as they can. And actually, this is, I would say, almost the mastermind of the transmitting a part of the MIPI A-PHY and the collaboration with Sony gives several advantages. First of all Sony has a very, very strong, almost 50% was market share in sensors and growing market share sensors for automotive. And once they embedded the transmitter as part of their  sensor, they give them advantage both in the price, in the quality, in the simplicity, in the space on the board, in power, like it's an all-win game. And this is a kind of collaboration, which we are very proud of and very proud to be a partner with respectful companies like Sony Semiconductors. The Intel Foundry is a very important collaboration and they would boost the automotive MIPI A-PHY implementations by allowing companies actually to compete with us, but we are very happy with this because this is what will drive the market. Maybe just to add to what Gideon mentioned, it's the press release and the collaboration that we have with Keysight. We are starting to see companies that develop test equipment only when they realize and they estimate that they are talking about a market that is going to grow, a market that is going to be matured very fast. And the fact that the company, an established company like Keysight understands that they need to develop -- already develop test equipment that is going, obviously, to serve not just Valens but other players in this market. It's another indication for the developed ecosystem and the fact that they anticipate that they're going to see business, significant business for companies that will develop  solutions."
