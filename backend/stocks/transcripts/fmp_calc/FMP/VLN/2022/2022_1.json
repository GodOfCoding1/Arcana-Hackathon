    "content": " We reported the company's highest ever quarterly revenues of $21.6 million, 62% higher from Q1 2021. Beginning with our first quarter 2022 results, we topped our revenue guidance, achieving record total revenues of $21.6 million, an increase of 61.8% from the first quarter of 2021. We also exceeded our adjusted EBITDA guidance, with our first quarter 2022 adjusted EBITDA loss coming in at $4.1 million, compared to the loss of $4.3 million in the first quarter of 2021. Our Q1, 2022 adjusted EBITDA was $6.1 million better than the midpoint of our guidance of a $10.2 million loss due to our higher than expected revenues and gross margins, as well as the fact that most of the better than internally projected operating expenses were related to certain R&D expenses that will differ from Q1 into subsequent quarters in 2022."
