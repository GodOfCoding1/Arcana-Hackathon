    "content": " We exceeded our guidance reporting second quarter 2022 adjusted EBITDA loss of $4.5 million, compared to the midpoint of our guidance range, which was $9.3 million. Q2 GAAP net loss was $10 million and included $3.6 million of financial expenses mainly related to the valuation of Israeli shekel based cash and short term deposit compared to U.S. dollar, offset by $1.5 million of income related to the valuation of differed value of the full feature shares included in our balance sheet. GAAP loss per share for Q2 2022 was $0.10, calculated as the net loss divided by 97.4 million shares. The non-GAAP loss per share for Q2 2022 was $0.08, which is calculated as a non-GAAP net loss of $8.1 million divided by the 97.4 million shares. This difference of $8.1 million is comprised of the adjusted EBITDA loss of $4.5 million and net financial expenses of $3.6 million, primarily from devaluation of Israeli shekel related cash balance. And fourth, as Gideon mentioned earlier, our decision to focus our automotive R&D for the next two years on products, supporting sensor to ECU connectivity will allow us to slow the pace of new employee hiring, and reduce our investment in R&D compared with our original plan for 2022 without impacting revenue opportunities or changing our longer-term technology roadmap. So, first, if it's -- if you watch the if you review the PR that we released in the morning, you noticed that our inventory bylines increased by something like $5 million compared to the end of Q1 2022."
