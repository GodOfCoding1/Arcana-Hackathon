    "content": " Looking at the most recent quarter Q4, 2022 the trend of growth continued, and the revenues reached a record of $23.5 million, up 13% from Q4, 2021. Starting with the fourth quarter 2022 results, we achieved record quarterly revenues of $23.5 million, an increase of $2.7 million or 13.2% from the fourth quarter of 2021 and 1.4% from Q3 2022. Automotive revenues reached a record $16.2 million, up 105% from $7.9 million in 2021, driven primarily by the expansion of our products into additional Mercedes Benz cars. Okay, so with respect to the company in general, I think that I refer to that point, I think the combination of the fact that we expect to see slightly steeper revenue growth in the second half of the year, and the fact that in the second half of the year, the portion of the audio-video revenue is expected to be a bit higher, as we expect customers, the audio-video customers to consume their inventory that we just discussed."
