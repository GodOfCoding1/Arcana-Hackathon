    "content": " In the second quarter, we received $19.8 million in customer purchase orders from existing Fortune 500 and new customers an increase of 51% from the first quarter of fiscal 2022 and over 200% from the same period a year ago. As we put our fiscal Q2 results in perspective, for the full year of 2021, the December ending quarter reflected the impact of the global supply chain disruption everybody\u2019s familiar with, increased shipping delays of key parts throughout the year, triggered delays in production and increasing purchase orders from growing customer demand, as I\u2019ve alluded too. The inventory of $19.6 million, how much of that is finished goods inventory and what proportion of that is the inventory that you\u2019re experienced in supply chain problems, for example, the electronics and the chips, can you give us that?"
