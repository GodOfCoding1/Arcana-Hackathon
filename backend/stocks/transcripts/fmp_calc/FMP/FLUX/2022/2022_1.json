    "content": " Our target audience, the Fortune 500 companies, really do their due diligence on who they're going to have as a vendor because they're committing millions of dollars of business to managing these very large fleets, and they have just regular cadence of ordering new packs, packs for new forklifts and also replacement, and our packs due just drop in for replacement. And our ongoing cost reduction actions that include the larger battery packs for higher margin, we've got design cost reductions and vendor volume pricing, those were largely offset by the supply chain disruption we're seeing, which, as you may know, higher cost on steel, electronic parts and these common off-the-shelf parts as well as inbound shipping costs. I think to add to that is even in this last quarter, had it not been for steel increases -- it's not that this would have happened with the supply chain issues, we were back to our normal pricing from six months, a year ago, we would certainly be closer to that 30% today. So I don't think it's a huge leap for us to get to 30% if things would kind of level back out on the supply chain side with what we've got out there today, if that makes sense."
