For the fourth quarter, our customer order backlog decreased to $35 million as of June 30, 2022, helped by improvement in sourcing actions to mitigate part shortages, which bodes well for increased confidence - in future supplier performance. To that end, shipments increased to $15.2 million as of June 30, 2022, compared to $8.3 million -- as of June 30, 2021, and $13.3 million as of March 31, 2022. continued strong customer demand, reflecting not only order flow from our relationships with our installed base but new customer acquisitions. Approximately 90% of our forecasted revenue for this fiscal year 2023, we're in is now identified and reflects shipments we've already made a letter of intent we've received and customer input to order packs for their scheduling with their new forklift purchases. As supply chain disruptions have improved, as I mentioned earlier, customer backlog in the fourth quarter declined to $35 million from a record of $38.6 million as of March 31, 2022, and is due to improvement in sourcing actions to mitigate parts shortages.
