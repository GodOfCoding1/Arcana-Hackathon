    "content": " We believe that the value of our shares do not reflect one of the best growth rates in the renewable energy industry combined with equity returns that are among the highest in the world, so much so that we have already brought about $60 million of our own stock which represents over 15% of the fees load  in only the last 10 months or so. Also, carbon credit sales of around INR 1 billion that we expected to be realized this fiscal year are now likely to slip into early next fiscal year, given the backlog of projects that are in the process for registration at various carbon exchanges. But I think the other thing I should also say is that because of the experience of wind in the last two to three years, we've already become very conservative in our forecast for wind in the future as well, not just for our existing assets but also the assets that we're going to build in the future."
