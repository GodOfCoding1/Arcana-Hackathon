    "content": " We have already pre-funded about 80% of debt maturing in the next 2 years and the remaining $140 million should easily be refinanced and is also amply covered by internal approvals as well as $850 million of cash on our balance sheet currently, even if the refinancing market unexpectedly closes, which we certainly do not expect it to at this point in time. In first quarter, we refinanced about $600 million of high cost debt at an interest rate which was 8.2% or about 200 basis points lower than the previous interest rate on that debt."
