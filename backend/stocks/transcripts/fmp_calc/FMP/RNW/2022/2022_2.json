    "content": " As a result, we continue to expect our FY22 adjusted EBITDA, excluding the impact of weather, which was approximately $40 million in the first half of this fiscal year so far, to be approximately $810 million, and we will have approximately 8.2 gigawatts operational by the end of this fiscal year. The Indian Prime Minister at the recent COP26 summit in Glasgow, outlined a fivefold strategy, which included getting India\u2019s non-fossil energy capacity to 500 gigawatts by 2030; two, 50% of India\u2019s energy requirements will be met by renewable energy by 2030; three, India to reduce its committed carbon emissions by 1 billion tons by 2030; and four, carbon intensity will fall by 45% by 2030, and India to achieve net zero by 2030. Whilst there has been some increase in costs relative to budget for the projects we are delivering for the remainder of the year, but after considering the lower financing costs that we are realizing in the market today, we continue to expect that our projects under construction will deliver an equity IRR within our targeted range of 16% to 20%."
