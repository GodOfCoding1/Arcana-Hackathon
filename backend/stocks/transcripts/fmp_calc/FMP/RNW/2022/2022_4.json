    "content": " Also, the government of India has begun the journey of promoting green hydrogen, which considering government targets to increase the required renewable energy installations by another 100 gigawatts above the 500 gigawatts by 2030 renewable energy targets. The 49% minority sell to Mitsui of our 400 megawatt RTC project, which by the way requires about 1,300 megawatts of renewable energy capacity for $200 million, plus about $70 million for EPC created considerable value. And a larger proportion of those bids now really is around the clock intelligent energy solutions, because most of the states are really moving in the direction of wanting that kind of thermal power, as are the Indian railways, which as I mentioned also is the single largest customer for power in the country currently for almost 5% of total power consumption in India. So, as far as you know, the total debt required for the near term CapEx is somewhere around $1.3 billion in the next 12-month period of time largely for the RTC project and the peak power project, which will see a lot of construction activity in the current fiscal year."
