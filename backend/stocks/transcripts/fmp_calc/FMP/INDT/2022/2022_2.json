    "content": " Michael, I appreciate the comments both talking about how you recognize the capital markets have changed since the beginning of the year, and then also how -- I think a more targeted strategy really focusing on land. As I mentioned, industrial land sites are really hard to find and there's chances or you just made or find good ones in certain markets you're looking at versus we feel with buildings -- over time buildings come up for sale and get resold once the land site is bought and developed on, it's no longer a land site. And so, we look at opportunities, but as I commented, even the things we see that are trading the few ones that do get treated are get awarded, typically the price it has been higher, cap rates are lower than kind of we would have anticipated if so, and said, what do you think this is going to trade for in today's market. So we are looking, but I'd say there aren't tons of great opportunities out there that we found that we just say, let's write the check and buy this at this price because it -- we just don't think the pricing has corrected a lot, but, obviously, if we see something that we think has really good rent growth potential, whether it's an existing mark-to-market that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s significant or just a really unique location or asset. So we, obviously, there is debt capital, which is as Jon talked about we've kind of fixed at about 4.1$, 5% on the incremental borrowings on the term loan, which kind of really hasn't moved from really where our debt's been for the last couple of years. Yeah, I mean I think it's -- I want to -- because we're -- to your point, we're not so big that we really can look at things pretty granularly and project-by-project and market-by-market and roll it up to see what's our capital, what do we think a prudent amount to have, what's the different delivery schedules and what're we doing across markets."
