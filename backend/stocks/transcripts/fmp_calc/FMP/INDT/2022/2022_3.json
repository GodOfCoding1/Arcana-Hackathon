    "content": " I know I think you quote a 5.1% to 5.5% average underwritten yield, I am wondering what that might be on today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rents, but also kind of your comfort with stepping more into land acquisitions or forward purchases, just kind of given where the capital markets are? And as we think about development going forward, if you take kind of even that low- to mid-6% range today, if that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what we are targeting for future land sites. Again, the land and development is going to be a much more longer tailed, but we think we have capacity to add incremental acquisitions today, if we find the right opportunities, and again, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s kind of an interesting market. And then other than that, we have a little bit, probably, not a whole lot that comes up in 2023, but even just having one vacancy that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s less than 1% of our portfolio is still going to impact same-property NOI when we were 100% in the same-property pool, I think, for the last five quarters or four quarters or five quarters."
