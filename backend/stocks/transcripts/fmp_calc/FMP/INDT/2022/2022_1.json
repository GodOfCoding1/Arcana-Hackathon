    "content": " All the markets are short space, all have low vacancy, we think that growth is going to sustain for the next couple of quarters, as I alluded to, I think there's a big pipeline of deliveries, but I think timing of those based on the comment you just made about even our own forward pipeline, those continue to get pushed out for certain projects. I think in one thing I'd say, and I think all our peers obviously had their earnings a couple of weeks ago, but I think we all had seen Amazon slowing and frankly pulled way back earlier in kind of the quarter earlier; so the first quarter, everyone has sort of seen Amazon pull back, and demand was really, really strong from a whole variety of tenants. So we think there's all the other players catching up to what Amazon has kind of built and done over the last couple of years, continues to be a really strong driver. So you're really working to find good opportunities to do that, but you kind of hit it on the first part, a lot of towns are pushing back or have been pushing back in Lehigh Valley, I think it's been five- or six-year evolution of increasingly more difficult and restrictive zoning requirements. And so we think there are just many levers that will continue to provide underlying demand, whether 15%-20% rent growth, it's probably not sustainable for five years in a row, but it feels pretty good for the next couple of quarters for sure."
