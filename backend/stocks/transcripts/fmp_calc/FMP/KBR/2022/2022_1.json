    "content": " I mean that business -- I mean, it did grow 2% in the quarter but there's a plethora of things in the pipeline waiting for award that have been, I guess, waiting for several months now to come through the system. So with the cadence of awards, if that starts to come through now that the budget is clear, I think that -- and given our low recompete position and given our commitment in STS and the double-digit growth, I think that obviously, we're confident of meeting what we've set out. I think obviously, what's happening in the world today, you would expect that there would be an uptick in bookings and really, awards as we move through the course of the year."
