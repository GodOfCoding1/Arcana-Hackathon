    "content": " Our book-to-bill reflects that but we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got great work under coverage, and we expect to produce the growth that we talked about towards the low end of our range on the long-term targets for 2023, given that condition but the atmospherics in spending in this area and our positioning are really right for the long-term, and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s why we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re so comfortable with the long-term targets. And I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll just use the opportunity on that question because of the progressive growth of STS and its economy of scale dynamic the profit mix for 2023 is about 45-55 split first half, second half, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a little bit more back-end weighted than we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen in the past, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s because of the growth trajectory of STS and the margins that come with that. And obviously, the cash generated, which really is part of our story, and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve talked about that many, many times and which gives us great confidence around our capital deployment strategy, how we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to deal with the convertible this year and how we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re actually moving forward towards that $475 million mark."
