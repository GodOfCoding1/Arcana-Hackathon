As you know, we're not really -- I mean, from an inflationary point of view, we did a midyear review across the business in terms of salaries and things, and that's all built into the numbers today. And this is the time where people need to actually think about that and understand why we've done what we've done and really the resiliency around that and the length of tenure, not for one year, but I think the average tenure is 10 years and our contracts portfolio is extremely, extremely important at providing, I think, our shareholders and our people with confidence around the resiliency of the business. Hey, good morning guys."
