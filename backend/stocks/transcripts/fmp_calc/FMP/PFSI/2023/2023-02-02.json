    "content": " I am pleased to report that we ended the quarter with a servicing portfolio of $552 billion, or approximately 4.1% of all residential mortgage debt in the U.S. Prepayment speeds have slowed meaningfully given higher mortgage rates. Pretax income excluding valuation-related items for the servicing segment was $79 million, up from the prior quarter as higher realization of MSR cash flows, interest expense, and lower EBO-related income was more than offset by higher loan servicing revenue, higher earnings on custodial balances and deposits, and lower operating expenses."
