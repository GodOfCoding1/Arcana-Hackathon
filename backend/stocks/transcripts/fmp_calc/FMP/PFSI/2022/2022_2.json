    "content": " This quarter total loan acquisition and origination volume of $27 billion, more than offset $18 billion in runoff and we ended the quarter with a servicing portfolio of 2.2 million customers, representing nearly $530 billion in unpaid principal balance, up from $519 billion at March 31st and $473 billion at June 30th, 2021. The UPB of completed modifications was $4.2 billion and the UPB of EBO loan volume totaled $572 million, both down from the prior quarter as opportunities have declined due to lower delinquency levels and higher mortgage rates. Operating revenues increased from the prior quarter as loan servicing fees grew by $11 million, primarily due to growth in our servicing portfolio and earnings on custodial balances and deposits increased by $8 million due to higher short-term interest rates."
