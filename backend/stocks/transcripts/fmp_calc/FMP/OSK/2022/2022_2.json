    "content": " We delivered strong sequential improvement in the second quarter at access equipment with revenue growth of 10.6% and a 630 basis point improvement in operating margin versus the first quarter, largely driven by increased price realization and volume. The consolidated sales decline was largely driven by a $171 million decline in Defense segment sales due to lower tactical wheeled vehicle volumes and lower Fire & Emergency sales volume as a result of the supply chain disruptions we are facing, partially offset by the benefit of increased pricing. So that's one area we're watching closely as well as our LIFO reserves with LIFO, it's sort of the last thing you're receiving in the year that, obviously, we hadn't necessarily place the orders for those yet or there's still some movement there that can impact LIFO. I would say, again, from a cost price dynamics, we talked about holistically, cost price gets -- we saw about $200 million of headwinds in the first half of the year that's about $50 million in the back half of the year for a total of $250 million."
