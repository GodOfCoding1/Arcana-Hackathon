    "content": " Green Dot delivered a strong first quarter, highlighted by margin expansion across our businesses with non-GAAP revenue up 4% and adjusted EBITDA increasing 23% driven by 360 basis points of margin expansion. In Consumer Services, our efforts to strengthen our customer base continue bearing fruit as our revenue per average active increased 9% versus the prior year and is up 26% compared to the first quarter of 2020. Our adjusted EBITDA of $90 million increased 23% and our adjusted EBITDA margin expanded to 22.9%, up approximately 360 basis points from the prior year quarter. Our B2B Services segment revenue increased $28 million or 26% to $134 million due to continued growth in our BaaS programs, both existing and new and our employer programs. Money Movement revenue increased $7 million or 8% to $97 million as our tax business benefited from a more normalized filing season, driving a 29% increase in tax refunds processed versus the prior year period. Our business continues to produce strong cash flow, generating $116 million of operating cash flow during the quarter, an increase of $35 million versus the prior year. With respect to the second quarter, as compared to the equivalent prior year quarter, we anticipate revenue to be approximately flat, our adjusted EBITDA margin to be approximately between 15% and 16%, with non-GAAP EPS expected to be in the range of $0.52 to $0.56 per share. I'll let George comment on the margins but just in terms of just that business segment, as I've said, I think, now for a couple of years, that's what we really see is our really tremendous growth engine potential with the sizable partners that we have there."
