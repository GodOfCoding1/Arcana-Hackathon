    "content": " Despite this significant headwind, we were able to minimize the impact on a year-over-year basis with gains and average revenue per account and growth in our B2B segment driven by the growth of a large BaaS partner and consistent performance from our PayCard business. As it relates to our segment results and key trends, our Consumer Services segment revenue declined about $31 million or 17% as stimulus programs in the prior year period resulted in significant headwinds to our key metrics. Due to this improvement in revenue per account along with cost management, segment profit increased by about $4.5 million or more than 8% to $60 million and a margin of 40% which is the highest margin we have seen in over two years despite the decline in year-over-year revenue. Segment profit of just under $23 million increased about $4.5 million or 25%, just slightly below our revenue growth, resulting in margins of 15.9%, which were down approximately 25 basis points versus last year. With respect to the third quarter, as compared to the equivalent prior year quarter, we anticipate revenue to be approximately flat, our adjusted EBITDA margin to be approximately between 12% and 13% with non-GAAP EPS expected to be in the range of $0.34 to $0.38 per share."
