    "content": " Growth of one of our large BaaS customers continues to power the top line in the BaaS channel, while the remaining portion of the business is still lapping the deconversion of a customer in early 2022, which also accounts for the bulk of the year-over-year decline in active accounts. Overall revenue in the segment was down year-over-year from the decline in cash transfer volume to the Green Dot Network, principally from the impact of a decline in active accounts in our other segments, while tax revenue was very modest in the quarter due to the seasonal nature of the business. From a margin perspective, we believe the first three quarters could have notable declines and the fourth quarter roughly flat, the impact of our reduced marketing in the first half of 2022 and subsequent investment in the second half will play a part in margin mix across the year, particularly in the second quarter of 2023."
