Regarding our efforts and resources over the near term, we continue to be focused on a number of critical SER-109-related activities which include continuing to ramp up manufacturing operations for commercial supply internally and with our partner, Recipharm, including building up SER-109 commercial inventory, as well as expanding longer-term SER-109 product supply capacity through our Bacthera collaboration and in conjunction with Nestl\u00c3\u00a9, continuing and accelerating launch readiness activities. Thanks for the question. Thanks for the question. Thanks for the question. Thanks for the question."
