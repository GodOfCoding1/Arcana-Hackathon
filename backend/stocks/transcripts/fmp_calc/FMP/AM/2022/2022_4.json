    "content": " Despite the inflationary environment, we delivered capital expenditures below guidance and EBITDA at the high-end of guidance We completed two bolt-on, free cash flow accretive, strategic acquisitions that extended our dedicated underlying inventory to over two decades. Slide 7, titled EBITDA growth and declining capital, illustrates our 2023 outlook, which is a truly pivotal year for Antero Midstream. After out spending cash flow during the high growth era of the shale revolution, we transitioned to a more sustainable business model that has been approximately free cash flow breakeven after dividends for the last 2 years. Looking ahead, we expect our free cash flow after dividends to more than double in 2024, driven by organic growth expiration of the fee rebate program, and a further decline in capital. Importantly over the five-year period from 2023 through 2027, we are now targeting 3.15 to 3.45 billion of free cash flow before dividends and 1 to 1.3 billion of free cash flow after dividends assuming a flat 90 cent dividend on an annual basis. Our de-risked organic growth model, along with highly strategic bolt-on acquisitions position us to deliver this expanding free cash flow story making AM one of the most unique investments in the midstream industry. And as we get into '23, do expect to generate nice free cash flow before dividends of over $500 million and after dividends of over $100 million as we move forward through the years, do continue to expect capital to decline and further EBITDA growth."
