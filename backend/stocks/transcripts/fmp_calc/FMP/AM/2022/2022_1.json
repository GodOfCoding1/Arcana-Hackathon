Good morning, and thank you for joining us for Antero Midstream's First Quarter Investor Conference Call. I would also like to direct you to the homepage of our website at www.anteromidstream.com, where we have provided a separate earnings call presentation that will be reviewed during today's call. Before we start our comments, I would first like to remind you that during this call, Antero management will make forward-looking statements. Such statements are based on our current judgments regarding factors that will impact the future performance of Antero Resources and Antero Midstream and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond Antero's control. Joining me on the call today are Paul Rady, Chairman and CEO of Antero Resources and Antero Midstream; Brendan Krueger, CFO of Antero Midstream; and Michael Kennedy, CFO of Antero Resources and Director of Antero Midstream. In my comments today, I will discuss AM's unique position in the LNG value chain, also our derisked business model and our efforts to minimize the impacts of inflation and tight supply chains. Given the recent geopolitical events, it is clear that there will be a significant call on safe and reliable natural gas and LNG from the U.S. AM's custom-built, irreplaceable and integrated gathering and processing infrastructure is the critical first step in transporting natural gas to LNG facilities. As depicted on the left-hand side of the page, AM's infrastructure directly connects AR's production to one of the largest firm transportation hubs in Appalachia at the Sherwood and Smithburg processing complex. First, Appalachia is the lowest-cost natural gas basin in the U.S. Finding and development or F&D costs for AR are approximately $0.30 per Mcfe. This is particularly important during times like today, where there's tight labor and supply markets in many parts of the U.S. We continue to believe that Antero's business model with lower capital intensity, repeatable results and a prolific resource base is well positioned for the years ahead and decades to come. First, as depicted on the left-hand side of the page, our EBITDA margins are over 85%. With a low-cost structure, even a 10% increase in cost due to inflation only impacts our margins by less than 1.5%. Moving to the right-hand side of the page, we've also managed our capital budget to limit the impacts of inflation. Looking ahead, even in a scenario of persistent inflationary and supply chain pressures, our capital budgets will continue to decline for the next several years. In summary, AM's business model as the critical first link to supplying LNG is well positioned in today's environment. With AR's 20-plus years of drilling inventory plus global demand for U.S. LNG, the runway for AM's throughput volumes has become clearer for much longer. Antero Midstream's connectivity to growing demand, along with our high visibility into AR's development plan derisks our growth outlook for the next several years and beyond. During the first quarter, AM's low pressure gathering volumes were 2.9 Bcf a day, a 3% increase year-over-year. Compression volumes were 2.8 Bcf a day, a 4% increase year-over-year, and joint venture processing volumes were 1.5 Bcf a day, which reflects a 6% increase year-over-year. Looking ahead, we expect throughput to be approximately flat in the second quarter as compared to the first quarter, and then are expecting an increase in throughput in the back half of 2022. As Paul mentioned, we have derisked this growth profile through our visibility into AR's development plan and integrated business model, acting as the first step in the LNG value chain. Fresh water delivery volumes in the first quarter averaged 87,000 barrels per day with 21 wells serviced. These 21 wells serviced include 7 wells on a pad that was utilizing simultaneous completions in late March, resulting in wells that started completion operations in the first quarter, but will have water volumes primarily delivered in the second quarter. Our organic business model has resulted in consistent EBITDA growth since our IPO in 2014, despite the volatility in commodity prices during the high-growth shale era. While the industry and AR have transitioned to maintenance capital programs, we still expect to generate attractive low to mid-single-digit EBITDA growth over the next 5 years as a result of volume growth from the drilling partnership and the fee rebates from AR rolling off after 2023. AM's organic approach, not relying on third-party business or competitive projects, further derisks our ability to achieve this growth profile. The bottom half of the slide illustrates our historical return on invested capital, which has averaged 15% since 2015. Looking ahead, we expect our volumetric and EBITDA growth combined with lower capital budgets to result in flat to increasing returns in the high teens over the next 5 years. As we discussed last quarter, in 2021 and 2022, we will be approximately free cash flow breakeven due to growth capital investments supporting the drilling partnership. However, with the first quarter outspend behind us and declining quarterly capital throughout the year, we are now transitioning to generating free cash flow after dividends as we enter the second half of the year. As you can see on the right-hand side of the page, we expect increasing free cash flow after dividends in 2023 and further growth into 2024 and beyond as capital declines and EBITDA increases. In total, we are targeting $700 million to $800 million of free cash flow after dividends from 2022 through 2026, which remains unchanged. As Paul touched on in his remarks, we believe we have one of the most derisked business profiles in the midstream space with high visibility to attractive volume and cash flow growth, and the ability to generate sustainable free cash flow for the years ahead. I think the quick answer is there's no change, I think, to the guidance and targets we put out there previously. And then I think we've highlighted on previous quarterly calls, we do have a couple of projects in 2022, particularly a high-pressure line. So as we look forward to 2023, we'd expect that to be more in the $200 million to $225 million of capital at AM. In the release, there's also a comment though around starting water again back up in the Utica and some higher costs around that. I think we -- just a reminder, the 3x target, we do expect to hit that in the, call it, 2024 period. I think as we sit here today, and we've talked about this in the past, share buyback certainly look attractive just given the valuation of AM today on a number of different factors, whether that be relative valuation. And then so I think as most importantly, as Paul touched on earlier, I mean, AM has such an irreplaceable asset base in terms of being the first link to this growing LNG demand on the global scale. And if you look at what makes sense today from a return of capital, share buybacks certainly look very attractive to us. I guess, it's kind of a 2-part question on the Veolia lawsuit. And I don't know if you'll quantify it, it seems like it's like around $10 million of annual cost. And then as you think about costs, we'd expect going forward, at least this year, about $500,000 to $1 million per quarter in overall costs as we move forward related to that facility. Thanks, everyone, for joining us today on today's call."
