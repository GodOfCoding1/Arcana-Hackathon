    "content": " AM is well positioned as the first leg customized midstream solution for a producer with the greatest exposure to LNG export facilities in the U.S. With a significant role U.S. LNG is expected to play in the world over the coming years and decades and the step change expected in Antero Midstream's free cash flow position in the near to medium term, we believe Antero Midstream offers one of the most attractive risk-reward opportunities in the midstream space."
