    "content": " Our strong revenue growth led to around $55 million year-over-year improvement in both OIBDA and AFFO during the quarter, which grew to $125 million and $93 million, respectively. While both parts of the business continue to be extremely healthy, national growth outpaced local again this quarter, up 37% year-over-year compared to local's 28%. Slide 7 illustrates our impressive U.S. billboard yield growth, which grew 23% year-over-year to just over $2,700. Slide 8 highlights our strong digital performance with revenue growing 63% in the quarter and representing 29% of total revenue, up from 24% last year. Transit franchise expense is typically a revenue share expense and was up 40% due to higher revenues, but also due to the contractual step-up of minimum annual guarantee payments to the New York MTA as well as the payment of the amortized deferred MAG per our 2020 amendment. Lastly, as mentioned, total expenses grew 20% year-over-year but fell over 7 percentage points as a percent of revenue, reflecting the operating leverage in our business. On Slide 10, you can see our OIBDA for the quarter is up $55 million from last year and represents a margin of nearly 28%, up from 20.5% in 2021. Based on our trends as today, with the vast majority of the quarter already booked, we currently estimate that Q3 total revenues will grow in the low teens percentage range with transit up about 20% versus last year."
