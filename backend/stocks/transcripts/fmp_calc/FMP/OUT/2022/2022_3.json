    "content": " On Slide 10, you can see our OIBDA for the quarter is up $15 million from last year and represents a margin of 27%, which is relatively flat up 10 basis points versus last year. U.S. billboard OIBDA grew 11% to $128 million and billboard OIBDA margin was 38%, down 40 basis points versus a year ago, but up nearly 150 basis points versus 2019. Looking at AFO on Slide 13, you can see our Q3 AFFO of $87 million improve by $8 million year-over-year as our OIBDA growth, which partially offset by the higher maintenance CapEx, cash interest and other below the line items."
