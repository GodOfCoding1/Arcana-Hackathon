    "content": " Our revenue shortfall is almost entirely attributable to the U.S. market, as evidenced by U.S. sales revenue falling to 37% of consolidated sales in the second quarter of fiscal year '22 from 46% in the first quarter of fiscal year '22. We're proud to say that our sales and manufacturing teams have risen to the challenge, delivering a Q2 fiscal year '22 gross margin of 46.3% even as revenue declined as expected from both the first quarter and the prior year periods. Quarterly revenues for HPW exceeded $1 million for the first time and were up about 10% sequentially from the first quarter of this fiscal year, while nearly doubling from last year second quarter. On a consolidated basis for the second quarter of fiscal 2022. domestic sales were 10.1 million, or 37% of total revenues and international sales were 17.3 million, or 63% of total revenues. Efforts to improve gross margins have shown durability, even as our revenues have shifted, gross profit of 12.4 million for fiscal 2022 second quarter decreased 28% from 17.3 million for the same period of the prior year. As compared with fiscal 2020 quarter gross margin, we improved from 37.9% on 27.5 million in sales in that period to 46.3% this year. Operating margins were 13.1% for the three months ended July 31 2021, down from 28% for the first quarter of the prior fiscal year. Income tax expense consists of federal, state and foreign income taxes within an effective income tax rate of approximately 34.8% in second quarter fiscal '22, our income tax expense was approximately 1.4 million."
