    "content": " Importantly, while these revenues have declined on a quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year basis, as expected, the business has maintained its profitability in the face of multiple supply chain and inflationary constraints as evidenced by our ability to deliver gross margin performance this quarter that was largely in line with our long-term stated goal of greater than 40%. Further, we expect to be able to grow these results at or above market trend growth rate on average by around 100 basis points to 200 basis points per year due to key aspects of our strategy and positioning, including our manufacturing footprint capabilities, product focus, customer service performance, and financial strength."
