    "content": " Forward-looking statements are based on current assumptions and analysis made by the company in light of its experience and its perception of historical trends, current conditions, including business affairs, pertaining to the COVID-19 pandemic, expect future developments and other factors that believes are appropriate under circumstances. In fact, while there's no question that COVID-19 pandemic had a positive impact on our performance through the entirety of fiscal year 2021 and into the first quarter of fiscal year 2022, we believe it has also largely masked the value we derive from the significant operational and process improvements we have made. From a financial results perspective, fiscal 2022 first quarter showed consistency based on the progress made to improve our performance as key measures, track to expectations and our balance sheet strength improved. We reiterate that our fiscal year 2022 revenue will not decline proportionally to declines in COVID-19 sales by focusing on the industrial market early on and throughout the pandemic, we believe we have set the stage to emerge post COVID-19 well-positioned with a larger book of business that targets a much larger and faster growing overall market. As we have already rapidly emerge from the COVID impacted sales periods, one of our more recent garment lines known as high-performance ware grew last year and was up nearly 200% in the first quarter of fiscal 2022, as compared to the prior year period. At nearly 900,000 in the first quarter 2022 sales, revenues were more than half of all high-performance wear sales in fiscal 2021, $1.7 million, and fiscal 2020, $1.6 million."
