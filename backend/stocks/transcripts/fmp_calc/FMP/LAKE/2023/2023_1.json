    "content": " While we have yet to see order rates returned to pre-pandemic levels in some of our important industrial markets, specifically the oil and gas segment, as we discussed in last quarter's call, we are beginning to see refinery turnaround scheduling for the second half of the year in Europe, and have been advised that activity in the U.S. market will also increase in the second half. Looking ahead, I remain extremely confident in our team's ability to deliver on our long-term financial targets, which as a reminder include mid to high single-digit annual revenue growth on average in our core markets, gross margin levels in the low 40s, and EBITDA margin levels in the high teens to low 20s leading to strong and growing levels of free cash flow generation to further support our growth plans and priorities over the long-term."
