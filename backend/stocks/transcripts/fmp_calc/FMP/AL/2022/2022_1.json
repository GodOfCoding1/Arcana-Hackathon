    "content": " Our composite cost of funds at the end of the first quarter of '22 was 2.77%, the lowest in our company's history, and we remain well positioned for further increases in interest rates, as 95% of our funding is fixed rate, and we expect that our strong balance sheet and credit metrics will allow us to continue funding ourselves at competitive rates as compared to our customer base, which should further support demand for leasing versus other forms of financing. The interest rate escalators built in the majority of our leases, which provide for a onetime upward lease of rate adjustment at the time of delivery of the aircraft, upside to lease rates as benchmark interest rates rise, and we are already beginning to see this benefit us as new aircraft are delivered. We have the largest combined order book of Airbus and Boeing aircraft in the industry, and demand remains robust for both new aircraft as well as lease financing, which, along with our strong balance sheet and unmatched customer relationships, positions us well for continued success for this foreseeable future."
