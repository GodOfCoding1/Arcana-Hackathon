    "content": " We are pleased that we generated a large increase in our FFO on a year-over-year basis, accelerated leasing activity, made significant progress on our value-add assets, and we continue to add to our development pipeline. So overall, we're very pleased with the direction of the Company, given improving earnings, increased leasing activity, progress made on our value-add assets and a compelling pipeline of growth. Our office segment NOI increased to $7.9 million from $7.6 million primarily due to income from our unconsolidated joint venture entity, which we invested in during February 2022, and which owns 100,000 square foot office property and a multifamily development site in Los Angeles, California."
