    "content": " Some highlights from the quarter: First, we had continued strong leasing activity, which is positioning us well for next year; second, we made significant progress on our value-add and development pipeline; third, we took steps to improve our liquidity and balance sheet, and this is extremely important in the current rising interest rate environment where we expect future acquisition opportunities; and fourth, we accretively deployed capital through both common and preferred share repurchases. Also, in the third quarter, we repurchased approximately $67 million of Series L preferred stock at a 3.4% discount stated value. While the NOI in our same-store office properties remain relatively constant at $6.7 million compared to $6.8 million in the prior year quarterly period, the NOI attributable to our non-same-store properties had a reduction of around $900,000. Also of note is that the office segment reduction included a loss from our JV investment acquired in February this year of around $200,000 for the third quarter of 2022. Third, our hotel segment NOI increased to $2.4 million from around $900,000 in the prior year comparable period. Finally, we generated around $57 million of cash proceeds from preferred stock issued in the third quarter, which is the largest quarterly amount since the Series A prefers have been offered, and momentum continuing into the fourth quarter with proceeds of $38 million in October, giving us additional financial flexibility."
