    "content": " The yield on interest-earning assets improved to 3.58% in the first quarter, up 24 basis points from 3.34% in the linked quarter due primarily to the recognition of $2.9 million of income from tax refund advance loans which contributed 30 basis points to the increase in average loan yields, partially offset by significantly lower loan fees. Excluding $1.5 million of net charge offs related to tax refund advance loans, net recoveries of $1.1 million were recognized during the first quarter, resulting in net recoveries to average loans of 16 basis points."
