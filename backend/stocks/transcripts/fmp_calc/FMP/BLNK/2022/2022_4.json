Product sales in the fourth quarter of 2022 were $15.8 million, an increase of 176% over the same period in 2021 as customers purchase greater volumes of our commercial chargers, DC fast chargers and residential chargers. Fourth quarter 2022 service revenues, which consists of charging service revenues, network fees and ride-sharing revenues were $5.7 million increase of 213% compared to the fourth quarter of 2021. The year-over-year growth was primarily driven by greater utilization of our chargers, the increased number of chargers on Blink's networks, revenues associated with the Blink mobility ride-share program and incremental service revenues from acquisitions. We drove strong results in 2022 with our visibility today and our optimism around the opportunities we're seeing in the marketplace, we are targeting 2023 revenues in the range of $100 million to $110 million and targeting gross profit in excess of 30% for full year 2023."
