    "content": " First quarter results reflect year-over-year revenue growth but operating profit decline as we continue to operate in a volatile and inflationary supply chain environment, and we begin lapping last year's record performance within HDFS as a result of the lower loss rates and reserve allowance release. Setting aside the tough comps to 2021 and looking at the HDFS base business, retail originations in Q1 were up 13% versus last year, behind strong new and used motorcycle origination volume. HDFS' retail credit loss ratio of 1.8% is a 60 basis point increase versus 2021, as credit performance continues to revert back to historical norm and we move past the benefits provided to individuals under the federal stimulus package of last year.
