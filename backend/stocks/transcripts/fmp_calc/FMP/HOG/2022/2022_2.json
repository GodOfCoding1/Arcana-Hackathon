    "content": " We continue to see strong pricing dynamics for both new and used motorcycles in Q2 as we did in Q1 and throughout 2021, specifically, within the U.S., due to new motorcycle transaction prices came in over 1% above MSRP, which is within the desirability threshold of plus or minus 2 percentage points. There are some pretty good indicators that confirm that -- Gina already mentioned a few with 23 days of a model being on the dealer's floor, strong dynamics in the new and used motorcycle with MSRP being up 1.3% overall and -- including our entry price products, which are even up higher. I think as you look at some of those international markets, we're very pleased with the performance in APAC, which despite those same challenges in terms of motorcycle availability, we had a very important quarter in terms of growth, and that is notwithstanding some of the impacts, like, for example, the COVID shutdowns in China, which certainly created a bit of a backlog on the retail despite the availability of the wholesales."
