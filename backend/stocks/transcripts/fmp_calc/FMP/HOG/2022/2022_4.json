    "content": " This strategy contributed significantly to the increase in our margin to 13.9% at HDMC excluding LiveWire, compared to 7.6% in 2019 with a three-point margin expansion and a much more effective and efficient allocation of our resources, leading to an EPS growth of 18% to $4.96 despite all the supply challenges that we had to face throughout the year. Looking at our financial results in the fourth quarter, total consolidated revenue of $1.14 billion was 12% higher than last year, with growth within HDMC and HDFS, and a decline in the LiveWire segment. Turning to full year 2022 results; total consolidated revenue of $5.8 billion was 8% higher compared to last year, and total operating income of $909 million was 10% higher. Your line is open.
