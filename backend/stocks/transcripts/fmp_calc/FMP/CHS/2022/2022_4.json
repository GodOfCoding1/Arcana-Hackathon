    "content": " According to NPD, during the last 12 months, Chico's and White House Black Market grew 4 times fast than the market average for apparel customers over 45 years of age with household income of over $100,000. The new customers we are attracting to our brands are younger than existing customers, by 10 years at Chico's, three years at White House Black Market and four years at Soma. Fourth quarter total sales of $524 million were up 5.6% over last year and 6% on a comparable sales basis, driven by higher full price selling, AUR an average dollar sale, complemented by both higher in- store and online traffic. Looking at the brands, apparel was once again the leading performer for the quarter with Chico's posting a 16% comparable sales increase and White House Black Market generating a 2% comparable sales gain. Our year-over-year operating income more than doubled to $142 million or 6.6% of sales for the fiscal year, resulting from our strong sales performance 240 basis points of gross margin expansion and 50 basis points of SG&A expense leverage. We also generated just over $185 million of EBITDA in fiscal 2022, an increase of over 50% from last year, a clear indication of the continued strengthening of our operating model which focuses on both sales and earnings growth."
