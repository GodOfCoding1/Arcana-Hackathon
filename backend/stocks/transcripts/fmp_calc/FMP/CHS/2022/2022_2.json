    "content": " We posted another quarter of outstanding operating income in our highest ever second quarter EPS, driven by both digital and store sales growth, and meaningful year-over-year gross margin rate expansion. Compared to the second quarter of 2019, White House Black Market delivered comparable sales gain of 25% and generated higher AUR and more full-price sales. Compared to the second quarter of 2019, Chico's delivered a comparable sales gain of 11% and also generated higher AUR and more full-price sales. While Soma posted a second quarter 9% decrease in comparable sales versus last year's second quarter, driven largely by the slowdown in lounge and cozy category. Second quarter gross margin rate rose to 41.4%, exceeding last year's second quarter by 300 basis points and 2019 by 820 basis points. Our nearly 20% sales growth and 300 basis point margin expansion delivered an operating margin of more than 10%, well above last year's second quarter operating margin of 7.5%. Comparable sales for the quarter increased nearly 20%, driven by greater year-over-year breadth and depth of product, combined with enhanced marketing efforts that drove full-price selling. For the quarter, Soma\u00e2\u0080\u0099s comparable sales declined by 9% from last year's second quarter, but relative to 2019, were up nearly 24%. SG&A expenses for the quarter totaled $173 million or 31% of sales, just slightly higher than last year's second quarter of 30.9%, reflecting higher marketing investments to drive customer growth as well as elevated labor costs, partially offset by ongoing expense management. Our higher sales and gross margin expansion produced an operating margin of over 10%, well above last year's margin of 7.5%, clear evidence of the strength of our powerful portfolio and business model, which focuses equally on sales, earnings growth and cash flow."
