    "content": " We're very pleased to report another quarter of good news driven by strong occupancy gains, double-digit revenue growth and continued discipline in managing community operating expenses, all of which resulted in sequential margin expansion and EBITDAR growth. On a same-store basis, which excludes the 2 Indiana assets we purchased earlier this year, we are just 50 basis points from our pre-pandemic occupancy, reporting 83.2% occupancy for the second quarter of 2022, up 510 basis points compared to the prior year quarter and 90 basis points higher than the first quarter of this year. And the only piece that I would just add to that, Steve, as well is if you think about where we are occupancy-wise versus where we were last year with occupancy season in the early part of 2021 and 2/3 of our communities above the 85% mark, that gives us additional pricing power when we've got higher occupancy in so many of our communities."
