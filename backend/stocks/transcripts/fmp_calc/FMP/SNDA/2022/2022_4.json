    "content": " The health of our residents, the stability of our leadership and care teams and the continued delivery of high quality care and wellness services all contributed to occupancy and rate improvement in Q4 and stable occupancy through the first two months of Q1. Just as important is the strength of in-place resident rate increases and re-leasing spreads, which exceeded 8% in December, January and February and support margin improvement expectations in the early part of the year. I referenced the strength that we are seeing on the rate front in terms of our re-leasing spreads and our in-place rent increases in December, January and February at 8%, which if you kind of go back and look at our 3.6% increase in 2022, we really are pleased with where we are running in the beginning part of the year and that carries forward, as you know. And so, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d say that, we are very focused on continuing with the plans that we have in place to deliver incremental and accelerated improvement on the margin front and I think our teams are excited about 2023 and especially coming out of a winter where we were able to hold occupancy and not see the impact of the traditional seasonal impact on senior leaving."
