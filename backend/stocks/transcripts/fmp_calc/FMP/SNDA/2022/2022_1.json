    "content": " Same store resident revenue increased 12% compared to the same quarter last year due to the strong occupancy increase, as well as solid performance on rate growth. As Kim referenced, we are pleased with both sequential revenue growth of 2.2% as well as year-over-year revenue improvement of more than $5 million, or 12% for the first quarter of 2022. Our goals for 2022 remain consistent across all communities, deliver excellent resident care and services through a dedicated stable team of employees, achieve revenue growth driven by continued occupancy improvement and ongoing REVPOR increase and improve margin through creative stable staffing models, and strong and expense management practices in this high inflation environment. In terms of what we're looking for, we want to make sure that if we do acquire another, community or communities, that the fundamentals are there that we can layer on our platform that we've developed here over the last couple of years, and really see that improvement in the operations similar to what Brandon referenced for the Indiana communities with their nine percentage point increase in occupancy just in the first couple of months that they've been with us and on our platform."
