    "content": " I am confident the combination of high-quality resident programming, capital improvements to refresh our physical plants and occupancy rates exceeding 80% across more than three-fourth of our portfolio will support accelerated growth in our market rates in 2023. And then I'd also say that as we have achieved the occupancy levels that we're at pre-pandemic, we now have the opportunity to see greater flow through without the need to add additional labor hours because we've reached kind of just below that 85% mark that, ultimately, gives you a lot more operating flexibility in running the business without adding labor."
