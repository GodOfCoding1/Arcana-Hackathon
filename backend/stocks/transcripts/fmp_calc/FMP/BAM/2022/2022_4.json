    "content": " Our growth for the next 2 years is quite visible and is expected to be driven by: first, significant contribution from the latest vintages of our flagship funds that we have either started fundraising for or ones that we expect to launch in the first half of 2023; second, growth that we should continue to see from the continued expansion of our various perpetual strategies, most notably our Super-Core Infrastructure strategy that has been very successful to-date and where demand from investors continues to be strong; third, a significant step up in our credit business, where we expect to have a record year of fundraising in addition to growth fueled by our growing insurance solutions business."
