    "content": " Overall net sales were a second quarter record of $74.4 million, up 29% compared to $57.6 million in 2021. Net sales in the North American wholesale segment were a second quarter record of $59 million, up 41% from net sales of $41.9 million in 2021. Wholesale operating earnings rose to $4.2 million in the second quarter of 2022, up 58% from $2.7 million last year, mainly due to higher sales volumes and gross margin. Net sales of the North American retail segment were a second quarter record of $7.4 million, up 20% from $6.2 million in the second quarter of 2021. Retail gross earnings as a percent of net sales were 67.4% and 65.6% in the second quarters of 2022 and 2021, respectively. Retail operating earnings were $1.1 million for the quarter, down 5% compared to $1.2 million last year. Other net sales for the second quarter totaled $8 million, down 16% compared to $9.5 million in the second quarter of 2021. The weakening of the Australian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar led to this decrease as Florsheim Australia's net sales in local currency were actually up 4% for the quarter due to higher sales in its retail businesses, partially offset by lower sales in its wholesale division."
