    "content": " Overall, net sales were a third quarter record of $97 million, up 57% compared to $61.8 million in 2021. Consolidated gross earnings increased to 40.6% of net sales, compared to 40% of net sales in last year's third quarter due mainly to higher gross margins in our North American wholesale segment. Quarterly operating earnings were a record $14.2 million, more than double last year's third quarter operating earnings of $6.7 million. Quarterly net earnings were a record $10.8 million or $1.12 per diluted share, up more than 100% from $5.1 million or 52% per diluted share last year. Net sales in our North American wholesale segment reached a record $81.6 million, up 63% compared to $50.2 million in the third quarter of 2021. While part of this increase was due to strong consumer demand and higher selling prices, last year's third quarter sales were abnormally low due to supply chain delays, which caused some third quarter orders to ship in the fourth quarter. Additionally, last year's third quarter expenses were reduced by $1.9 million in government wage subsidies. Wholesale operating earnings rose to $12.9 million in the third quarter of 2022, up 114% from $6 million last year due to higher sales and gross margins. Net sales of the North American retail segment were a third quarter record of $7.1 million, up 13% from $6.3 million in the third quarter of 2021. Other net sales for the third quarter totaled $8.2 million, up 54% compared to $5.3 million in the third quarter of 2021 due to higher sales at Florsheim Australia."
