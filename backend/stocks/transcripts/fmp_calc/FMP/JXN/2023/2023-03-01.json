    "content": " Net income for the full year 2022 was $5.7 billion, primarily due to adjusted operating earnings and the benefits of higher interest rates throughout the year. Total adjusted capital was $7 billion, representing a $400 million increase from year-end 2021 after remitting $600 million to the holding company in early 2022. Additionally, there were positive market-related impacts to DAC amortization expense in the fourth quarter of 2022 of $109 million on a pretax basis when comparing the fourth quarter of 2022 to the prior year period. Adjusting for both the notable items and the minimal tax rate difference, earnings per share were down 17% from the prior year's fourth quarter, primarily due to the reduced fee income resulting from lower average AUM. Lastly, our Closed Life and Annuity Blocks segment reported a fourth quarter decline in adjusted operating earnings compared to the prior year, reflecting lower levels of limited partnership income, partially offset by lower death and other policy benefits resulting from the continued decrease in the size of the closed blocks. Pro forma for the $600 million expected remittance from the operating company, we expect to have more than $1 billion of excess liquidity above our minimum buffer at the holding company and a year-end operating company RBC ratio, adjusting for the remittance of nearly 500%. So yes, we did indicate that if we looked at our year-end position pro forma for the $600 million distribution out of the operating company, including the related impact to the DTA, we would be close to the 500% level at the operating company."
