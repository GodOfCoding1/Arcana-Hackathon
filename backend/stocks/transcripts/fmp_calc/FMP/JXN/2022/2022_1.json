    "content": " Total Retail Annuity assets of $242 billion were up slightly from the first quarter of 2021, but down 7% since year-end due to poor equity market performance in this year's first quarter. As a result, the market-driven DAC effect was a net negative impact of $111 million on a pretax basis when comparing the current first quarter to the prior year first quarter. But if I look at, at least so far what's happened quarter-to-date into 2Q, I would imagine the equity hedge gain component would outweigh the interest rate negative mark, just looking at this, the magnitude of the equity market decline, and I would expect that whole issue with floored out reserves would actually become a positive in 2Q. So I think kind of what you outlined make some sense there in the sense that we would expect with the markets down, that would benefit us on the hedging perspective from our equity hedge position, whereas the continued increase in rates for -- so far into the second quarter would continue to kind of repeat some of what we saw in the first quarter around negative marks on interest rate hedges. I think all considered, we would probably anticipate some additional pressure on the RBC in the second quarter, but I know as we've remarked on earlier that we see some tailwinds that will catch up more in the second half of the year around the effects of Fed actions and what that does to the rates on the short end of the curve and the benefits that will play out there in terms of our overall hedge spend."
