    "content": " Coupled with certain cost reduction actions, the impact on second half EBITDA should be $30 million to $35 million, roughly doubling the EBITDA margin compared to the first half of the year. Over the past 4 quarters, the cumulative gap between inflation and price was a negative $25 million or so at Clean Earth, or about 3 points of EBITDA margin. Harsco's second quarter revenues from continuing operations increased 3% compared with the prior year quarter to $481 million, including a 4% headwind from FX translation. Compared to the second quarter of 2021, revenues increased 4% including the impact of price, while adjusted EBITDA decreased $14 million year-on-year. The $150 million would -- is pulled forward, and then it's a continuation of ongoing operating cash flow that would drive our free cash flow next year. You may refer to on the -- in our Soils and Dredge business, we do expect the second half of this year to be a good bit stronger than the first half because many of these projects that we've been tracking are being released, and so we're processing a lot of that material as we speak. Well, I think when you consider the annualized effect of what we're doing with respect to price and cost and look at where the run rate will be coming out of the year into 2023, clearly, we expect at this point for the EBITDA in Clean Earth in 2023 to be substantially higher than in this year."
