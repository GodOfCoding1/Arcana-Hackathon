    "content": " We expect these headwinds to be mitigated in 2023 by cost reduction actions we are putting in place and the impact of annual price escalators next year, which together, we believe may lead to EBITDA cash flow and margin growth even in a mild recessionary environment. Nevertheless, we fully expect the cash flow and balance sheet profile of Harsco to improve over the next few years, driven by EBITDA to cash flow conversion in Clean Earth, modest capital spending, improved working capital in Harsco Environmental, lower cash interest as leverage falls and declining pension costs. Compared to the prior-year, Harsco's third quarter revenues from continuing operations increased 4% to $487 million despite a 5% headwind from foreign exchange translation. So it's difficult to estimate at this point, but I do believe that we'll have several million of additional earnings in Harsco Environmental next year as a result of new business that stems from that. And so we're hopeful that by the end of this year, we will have -- will be on the threshold of stepping into a handful of contracts here in the U.S. And just kind of in Clean Earth, it seems like you guys have done a really good job in price this quarter."
