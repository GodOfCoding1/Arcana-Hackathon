    "content": " Meanwhile, Clean Earth results were impacted by increased inflation pressures related mainly to fuel with diesel increasing approximately 40%, driven by the Russia-Ukraine conflict, also driver availability, including the impact of Omicron earlier in the quarter impacted volume. Our adjusted EBITDA is now expected to be within a range of $250 million to $265 million, with the change versus our February guidance entirely attributable to inflationary factors in Clean Earth, with the cost price timing mismatch in the first half. And I know Clean Earth, I think, had 1 -- I think maybe right before you acquired a couple of quarters before had a couple of projects all the stars aligned, I think they did a few million of EBITDA in 1 quarter, maybe half a year on the on the PFAS side. So if you really start thinking of price increases, the $10 million that Nick mentioned that was uncovered is really in the first half of the year."
