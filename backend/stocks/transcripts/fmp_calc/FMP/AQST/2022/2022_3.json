    "content": " Under the terms of the license agreement, Aquestive will receive a $6 million milestone payment within 30-days of notice from the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office of allowance for an additional patent application for Sympazan and payment of related allowance fees, both of which were completed on October 27, 2022. The licensing of Sympazan will bring in near-term non-dilutive capital of $15 million to support company operations, eliminate the cash burn of Sympazan being a standalone product without the benefit of Libervant U.S. market access, reduce our commercial headcount, while retaining payer and distribution expertise for AQST-109 and allow us to focus on our most important value drivers. Your line is open. Your line is open. So first, I just want to point out and I will hand it over to Ken Marshall, our Chief Commercial Officer in a second year, but I do want to point out one of the benefits of the deal we announced last week where we're out licensing Sympazan as I now get to watch Ken Marshall and his management team that the expertise we've kept in-house move their significant experience and bring power from Sympazan onto 109. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open."
