    "content": " On today\u2019s call, I\u2019m joined by Keith Kendall, Chief Executive Officer and Ernie Toth, Chief Financial Officer, who are going to provide an overview of recent business developments and performance in the first quarter 2022, followed by a Q&A session. In summary, our 2022 guidance for full-year non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA loss reflects a lower projected revenue base from Suboxone as compared to 2021, partially offset by steady growth and Sympazan and significant additional focused R&D investment related to the advancement of AQST-109. If in that end of Phase II meeting the FDA agrees with where we are in our plan, as you mentioned in your question, we will move forward with a pivotal PK study and we would at this time, expect that to read out in the first half of 2023. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. Your line is now open."
