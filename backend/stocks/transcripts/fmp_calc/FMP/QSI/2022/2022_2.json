    "content": " While other proteomics technologies primarily affinity-based protein or Aptamer arrays only look to confirm the presence of a pre-determined set of proteins, Quantum-Si\u00e2\u0080\u0099s next-generation protein sequencing decodes the sequence of amino acids and interrogates post-translational modifications to help identify proteins and elucidate the role of protein variations in biology and disease. These 15 amino acids represent a path to enable over 70% coverage of the human proteome and the identification of up to 90% of the 20,000 proteins in the human body and the millions of variations as a result of post-translational modifications. Based on this technology progress, we believe that Quantum-Si is well ahead of the competition and well-positioned to be the first company to launch a system that enables digital next-generation protein sequencing at amino acid resolution and a general tool for elucidating their modifications, sometimes down to a level of single atoms. While proteins undergo modifications resulting in over 1 million protein variants or proteoforms, Quantum-Si\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proprietary semiconductor enabled time domain sequencing method increases the resolution, scope and convenience at which we can understand the proteome by measuring specific changes at the amino acid level to detect protein variants, including post-translational modifications, or PTMs, that are not coded in the human genome or detected in the RNA. So, we are launching on Moore\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Law, with a technology that directly can potentially interrogate 70% of the proteome, indirectly interrogate 90% of the protein, and do it in a convenient way, where you can see single atom or up to single atom changes in those proteoforms, which represent over a million variations of those 20,000 proteins."
