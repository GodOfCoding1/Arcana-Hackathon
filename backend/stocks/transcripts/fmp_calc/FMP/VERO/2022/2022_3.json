    "content": " Excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates versus the U.S. dollar, total Revenue and international revenue on a constant currency basis decreased 9% and 15% respectively, compared to the third quarter of 2021. Gross profit decreased 3.9 million or 23% to 13.4 million, gross margin was 62% compared to 70.5% of revenue in the third quarter 2021 The change in gross profit was driven primarily by the year-over-year decline in revenue, as well as a 1.4 million write down of end of life devices and parts inventory, and a 0.8 million impact from changes in foreign currencies which depreciated relative to the U.S. dollar in the period. Third quarter of 2022 GAAP general and administrative expenses include 0.6 million in SOX related expenses we incurred in preparation for being SOX 404(b) compliant, 2.4 million of bad debt expenses, and 0.7 million of severance payments associated with a workforce reduction in Venus Spain and Venus Canada. The improvement in cash used in operations was driven by improvements in working capital and the benefits of cash flow generation as a result of our initiative to focus on cash system sales, which increased 30% year-over-year in Q3, representing approximately 59% of total systems and subscriptions revenue compared to 39% in the prior year period. First, as we continue to target sequential improvement and our adjusted EBITDA loss in the fourth quarter, this adjusted EBITDA target in Q4 continues to assume total GAAP operating expenses for full year 2022 of approximately 99 million, representing growth of approximately 11% year-over-year."
