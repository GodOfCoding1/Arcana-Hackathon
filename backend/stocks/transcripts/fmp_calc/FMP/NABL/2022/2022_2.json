    "content": " Our financial performance in Q2 exceeded the high end of our outlook, with GAAP revenue growing year-over-year by 7% or 13% on a constant currency basis to $91.6 million, demonstrating success in our multi-product sales approach with particularly strong growth in our security offerings and data-protection-as-a-service. For decades, the N-able team has served MSPs regardless of size or stage from highly specialized market-specific service providers to large global generalists who serve SMEs around the world, all the way down to start up MSPs serving their customers from the proverbial garage to build on our mission to meet our partners with AR and their journey, we recently announced a new offering called N-sight designed to help early growth MSPs jump start their business. As John mentioned, we finished the second quarter ahead of our outlook with total revenue of $91.6 million, representing 7% year-over-year reported growth or 13% on a constant currency basis. While the global macro environment remains uncertain and FX rates may continue to fluctuate, based on our current FX assumptions, we expect our third quarter of 2022 total revenue in the range of $92.5 million to $93 million, representing approximately 5% year-over-year growth or approximately 11% to 12% on a constant currency basis. Therefore, given the factors I mentioned, including the FX-driven revenue reduction, some expected headwinds due to macro environment uncertainty and the expense impact of the Spinpanel acquisition, we are now expecting full year adjusted EBITDA in the range of $107 million to $109 million, equating to approximately 29% margin at the midpoint."
