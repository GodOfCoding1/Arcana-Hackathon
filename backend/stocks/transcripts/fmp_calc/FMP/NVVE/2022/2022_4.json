    "content": " Through commercial opportunities such as Circle K partnerships and other similar agreements we are pursuing, we believe there is a possible pathway to significant growth in megawatts under management in 2023 and for a solid improvement in grid services, remain hesitant to guide on grid service revenue as it can be very tough to predict, especially in these early days, but I wanted to be sure we express our optimism around making some real gains in 2023. In addition, margins also benefited this year from grid service revenues being a higher mix of total revenues in the fourth quarter of 2022 compared with the prior year quarter. For the full year 2022, we generated total revenues of $5.4 million compared to $4.2 million in 2021, representing a 28% increase. In addition to this growth, with our expanded megawatts under management reaching 17.4% at the end of 2022 and growing further in 2023, we are now at the early stages of reaping incremental benefits of recurring grid service revenues generated by our platform. As we look out past the first quarter, we will start to realize the revenues from EPA grants awarded last year and the benefits of new grid service revenues coming online, both through V1G services in Europe that we have already announced and expanded participation in V2G services in North America."
