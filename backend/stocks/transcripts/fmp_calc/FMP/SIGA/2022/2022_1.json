    "content": " For the three months ended March 31st 2022, SIGA's revenue was approximately $11 million, of which approximately $7 million relates to the first sales of IV TPOXX to the U.S. government under the 19C BARDA contract. With strong 2020 and 2021 financial performance, a solid balance sheet and $300 million of procurement options remaining on our BARDA contract that we currently expect to be exercised in the 2022 to 2024 time period, we believe it is an appropriate time to declare a special cash dividend. But there's no question that since most appropriations from governments are annual, we see people thinking about a stockpile not as a large initial order, but rather something that they want to build over a period of time, recognize the shelf life so that it becomes simply an annual purchase, which is exactly the way we're hopefully moving to the US government as we have these conversations and think about a 10-year contract where you're able to have predictability for your supply chain, for your annual budget on the government side and for us in being able to plan manufacturing and finances. But again, I think we've demonstrated a discipline to make sure that if we deploy cash through share buybacks, through forms of dividends, certainly the Board and the company is very focused on being efficient and disciplined as we approach that and we will continue to evaluate all options, as we go into what is essentially kind of the second half of the BARDA 19C contract with as we said over $300 million in options remaining on it."
