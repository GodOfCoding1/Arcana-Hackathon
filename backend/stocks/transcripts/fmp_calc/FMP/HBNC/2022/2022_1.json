    "content": " As a result of the rising interest rates and lower production, our gain on sale of mortgage loans for the first quarter was reported at $2 million, down 51% over linked quarters, resulting in a 3.75% gain on sold mortgage loans for the quarter. As noted on Slide 28 and given our first quarter production results, current strong loan pipelines, low unemployment rates and pent-up consumer demand, we are adjusting two of our full year 2022 loan growth goals upward and increasing our return on average assets outlook."
