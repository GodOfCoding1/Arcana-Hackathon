    "content": " Horizon is pleased to report record earnings for 2022 in fourth quarter that continues our momentum into 2023 with strong commercial and consumer loan growth, efficiencies gained from closing seven offices and effective expense control. Given the size of our balance sheet, efficient operation, talented workforce and solid additions to our team, Horizon is well positioned to capitalize on significant organic loan growth as we focus on shifting our balance sheet to higher yielding assets and continue our disciplined approach to expense control. In the fourth quarter, adjusted net interest margin decreased 16 basis points and adjusted net interest income decreased by $2.6 million, primarily due to $1.2 million in lower loan fee income and $490,000 higher amortization of the dealer reserve asset compared to the third quarter. The increasing betas and some deposit flow from lower cost to higher cost products has increased funding costs, but they still provide a strong spread to the earning asset yield of 3.88% for the quarter with a total cost of deposits of 71 basis points. The combination of Horizon's historical solid returns in average assets and average equity, our ability to increase market share in our top 10 markets and weather varying economic cycles, our diversified balance sheet and current high dividend yield offer support that we have an attractive long term investment."
