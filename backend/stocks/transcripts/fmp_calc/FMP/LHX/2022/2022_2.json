    "content": " Good morning, and welcome to our second quarter 2022 earnings call. We published our investor letter after the market closed yesterday, a streamlined format that we're pleased to continue, given the positive feedback. Joining me for the call are Chris Kubasik, our CEO; and Michelle Turner, our CFO. Forward-looking statements involve risks, assumptions and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For more information, please see our investor letter and SEC filings. A reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to comparable GAAP measures is included in the Investor Relations section of our website, which is l3harris.com, where a replay of this call will also be available. With that, Chris, I'll turn it over to you for some brief comments. Thank you, Rajeev, and good morning, everyone. We're investing in targeted capabilities in and outside of the company, and we've had over $1 billion of notable prime awards this month alone. The threats are evident, and there's growing urgency to support defense spending in the U.S., NATO and elsewhere. This is a stark contrast to a couple of years ago, where budgets were expected to be flat at best. At the same time, there are factors outside of our control, such as supply chain, inflation and labor markets tightening that are offsetting and masking our progress as well as the opportunities ahead. Our results, however, highlight that we're working to mitigate these challenges. Our second quarter results are consistent with prior commentary of a back half weighted year for revenues, margins and cash. Nonetheless, we kept EPS relatively stable year-over-year and our free cash flow stepped back from breakeven last quarter to more than $700 million. In addition, while we're reiterating our guide, we're now pointing to the low end of the range across the board. Based on the timing of some key awards, including protest activity and a prolonged supply chain recovery, we decided to take a more measured approach, especially given the macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainties that are somewhat unpredictable. So despite the noise, we continue to execute on our strategy. With that, Rob, let's open the line for questions. And then bigger picture, the investor letter did a great job of highlighting the budget upside that came through in '22 and the plus ups could look likely in '23. Usually, I give a long answer and list all the components that we're involved with, but it really comes down to the ICP, the integrated core processor. So today, I think I'm going to give you a shorter answer because we actually completed the safety of flight certification, and the first flight systems were delivered to Lockheed Martin last month. So great news relative to TR3 and meeting that delivery, a little late, but nonetheless, it's progressing. So our last 15 hardware starts getting delivered later this year, and the whole focus here is to support Lockheed to enable their 2023 aircraft delivery. And your financial numbers remain accurate, based on what we've told you before. Relative to the strategy, I think it's working. We've talked about this trusted disruptor strategy with more innovation, more prime and more international. So when I look at the innovation, this quarter, we made a small investment in a free space optic company called Minarik. The goal to prime more has been great last year with an earlier this year, significant wins in ISR and MUSV, HBTSS. And of course, we've been winning a majority of the share on the radio modernization program. I mentioned, so far this year, SDA tracking Tranche 1 was a big win. And here in the month of July, we were also awarded CEC, which is a Cooperative Engagement Capability, really a pillar of the JADC2 initiative for the Navy, which I'm quite excited about. And another program we're priming called EAGL, which is the Expeditionary Advanced Ground Link, again, tied to free space optics. And then internationally, at a high level, we've had mid-single-digit growth the past couple of years. And just last month, we added Poland and Italy to our focus country program, given the opportunities over in Europe. So whether the base budget or the markup, we're very well positioned, including some of the news coming out of the Senate earlier this week. So I'm guessing '23, when the awards are made, we'll start to see industry and L3Harris benefit. Yes, I'll take the first shot, and then maybe ask Michelle to give a little more color on the sector. If you recall, we won Tranche 0 for 4 satellites. And again, it's an example where we're priming. We have the payload capabilities, and that's ultimately where the value resides. So as a reminder, $700 million award, 14 satellites, and it really ties into our responsive satellite strategy. A couple of years ago, it was nonexistent. Now we have satellites in low earth orbit, medium earth orbit and geosynchronous orbit. I think at the date of the merger, we had no business with the Missile Defense Agency. I think the other day, Michelle and I were looking, we have about a $20 billion pipeline in space alone. And when you look at our capabilities in missile defense, weather, like I mentioned, all orbits and even ground capabilities, it's quite exciting. From a Mission Avionics perspective, this is the ramp that we talked about on F-35. So as we head into production, you'll see that come in the second half. Our classified business is continuing to grow as well, and we'll expect to see that ramp in the second half as well. Just at a high level, I think at least at L3Harris, I think the whole industry has now realized there's a new norm in supply chain. In the past, the whole focus was just-in-time inventory, inventory reductions, single sources. And I think we're doing a pretty good job in the short term, trying to mitigate and avoid the disruptions, but we're also looking how we revamp our supply chain resiliency for the long term. So I've mentioned in the past, we've invested in tools to get end-to-end visibility beyond Tier 1. We're investing in critical materials, smart inventory, safety stock, which I understand builds our inventory balance. You'll see that on our balance sheet, but I think it's the right business decision. So a complete turnaround, almost a 180, from where we were 3 years ago. So coming into the year, we anticipated that we would see a first half impact, particularly within electronic components. Additionally, we also talked about seeing sequential quarter-over-year improvement. We are seeing that from Q4 into Q1, additionally from Q1 into Q2. So when you look at our guidance update, pointing to the low end of the range, part of that is, to Chris' point, this elongation of the supply chain impacts that we're seeing out of '22 and into 2023. I'd also highlight the risk mitigations that Chris talked about, in particular in terms of how those are working. So I thought you might comment on the SOCOM Armed Overwatch program, where you're competing with Textron. Right, Rich, let me take Armed Overwatch, and Michelle will talk to you about aviation. So yes, this is a program that goes back into late '19 and early 2020. It's clearly a couple of billion dollar opportunity here domestically and even more, internationally. We've had discussions with countries in Africa, the Middle East. I think, it is where the initial potential is, whether it's border protection or maritime operations, light strike, ISR, pretty flexible, pretty affordable program. Hopefully, something comes out in the next week or 2. And I think it's a key one to watch, in my opinion. I know it's important to our company, and it really would validate our strategy and the thesis for the merger because we invested in the innovation. It's another opportunity to be a prime integrator, it has international potential. And it also has pull-through of our products, Wescam turrets, radios, weapon carriages and EW capabilities. And maybe with that, we'll go to Michelle. When you look at our overall ISR business, this is part of our expectations in terms of growth, particularly around these aircraft missionization. So we're chasing 3 to 5 programs here, this is one of them. And so to Chris' point, we're excited about seeing this come online and hearing about a potential win. The first half of the year, our overall commercial businesses, which also includes our Public Safety, was up double digits. And we anticipate that, that's going to continue through the end of 2022. Chris, circling back a little bit to David's question on the budget. No, I appreciate the question, Peter. Clearly, we have opportunities in Europe. We've talked about some ISR capabilities that we've been -- we've already won in the past, where we continue to add aircraft, and we have a path to get to 8 aircraft for this particular country. Clearly, with Ukraine, I think we have a core competency and a lot of experience working with the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative, the USAI money, that's always been in the budget. So clearly, the radios, the night vision goggles, even some ISR capabilities, position us well there. And as I mentioned, we're going to open offices in Europe, the NATO countries. Poland is a big opportunity, where we've submitted a few a few bids, again, with comms, resilient comms, SATCOM, at a high level. You've had a rising backlog, but at the same time you've been constrained with supply chain issues. And then along with that, we've seen you keep your margins. Margins have held pretty well, even though we've got a lot of inflation exposure and you've got the supply chain issues. Let me make a few points, and then Michelle will give you the numbers. I mean, you're absolutely right. There's high demand for our radios, and I think that's one thing that the conflict in Ukraine has highlighted, the importance of resilient comms. So we have opportunities in Australia, 300 million for what's called Deltic Phase 2 with the Australian Defense Force. That's over 6,000 radios. The first 4,000 or so cleared congressional notification. And in August, we're going to have our first article acceptance up in Rochester, and they've ordered a couple of thousand more. In the U.K., the Morpheus program, again, $100 million award approximately. So all those things are building the backlog, as you say. I will highlight that I think it was last year, we knew there was a supply chain shortage and we'd have to serve. Michelle will give you the numbers, but we can clearly do better and grow without any constraints. Last year, we had about 20 suppliers on our red list, and now we're down to 5 that we're watching carefully. And obviously, we need all the parts, but that's been pretty helpful. The last thing I'll mention before giving to Michelle, I've talked in the past how we reengineer and redesign our products or our components, based on availability. And just this week, I was looking at our data, we've actually redesigned over 1,000 component parts in our products, whether it's radios, night vision goggles, WESCAM balls to be able to make these commitments and continue to deliver our products. So Doug, so just to your point, in the first half, we did -- consistent with our expectations, we did see our Tactical Communications down low double digits, really driven by the electronic component constraints. As we go into second half, we expect that, that's going to grow in the high double digits. So to your point, we expect that, that starts to ease from a capacity perspective. We do have an elevated backlog, to your point. And additionally, I'd note to the international question, the international book-to-bill within Tactical Communcations is 1.15 within the quarter. And so this really speaks to the overall conflict environment, Ukraine opportunities that we're seeing. And we expect that, that will be a benefit for us as we go into 2023, but a lot of these orders are also being considered over a couple of years. And so you should think about it in terms of 2023, 2024 and into 2025. I would say, clearly, relative to our M&A pipeline, we're looking at opportunities all the time, looking for game-changing solutions that are going to help us with our customers. So yes, we're looking at a handful. So I'd say, we have a healthy process. We look at things all the time, and I don't see us in a position to announce anything in the next quarter or 2, but we'll continue to look. Relative to NSO, we're fully aligned with the U.S. national security leadership on this matter. And I think all the reporting out there made it clear that no deal is going to happen, at least with us. So maybe someone else is talking to them, but not me. Chris, something you're probably super frustrated about, but this next-gen jammer, low-band ongoing protest. Well, Pete, I don't really get frustrated about much, but this has taken a longer time than anybody wanted. And I would think, in mid-2023, hopefully earlier, 2023, that maybe we'll make a selection and we'll move on. And we'll -- we respect the process to allow people to protest, and I think there's been 4 or 5 different judges and reviews and such, but it's progressing. We like our solution, and we'll wait for the Navy to select us again, hopefully. Yes, I'll jump in, and then Chris, you can feel free to complement. So in the second half, to your point, in terms of the drivers, it's really 3 components. And so as I noted earlier, we had an assumption that we'd have a pretty healthy hockey stick going into the back half of the year. As we're seeing the supply chain environment elongate into 2023, we've mitigated that a bit in terms of the change in the guide to the lower end of the range, although we still do have a hockey stick going into the second half. I will note, though, that as we're sitting here in Q3, we have similar challenges to what we had in Q1 and Q2. Chris mentioned SDA, along with SPEIR. And so the back half, we will be accelerating as those programs come online. We expect those awards to happen within Q3, with a ramp happening in Q4. And Noah, to your point, between Q3 and Q4, I would say, it's fairly consistent. So hitting expectations in Q3 is what we're focused on now, with that expected to continue into the fourth quarter. I'll just chime in, Noah. At a higher level, the approach we've taken, and we talked to the leadership team, is let's just control the controllables. There's a lot of frustration, I think, out there in the system. And we're kind of taking the approach that -- the last 2 years have clearly been unprecedented, whether it's pandemic, Ukraine, inflation, supply chain, all the stuff we know. So when we give the guidance for the second half that Michelle laid out, we want to let you know it's kind of hard -- it's harder than it has been in the last several decades to predict the future and the visibility, given the uncertainty and the volatility that changes literally on a daily basis. And the next day, someone shows up a week early. I mean, it's really very, very dynamic. Sometimes they take longer to get awarded and sometimes they slip, but we're looking forward to the new norm and some of these uncertainties dissipating. And Noah, just to go back to your question in terms of cash. The expectation for the second half is really split between Q3 and Q4, more like a 30-70 split. The next question is from the line of Morgan Stanley, at Kristine Liwag with Morgan Stanley. No, that's a great, great question. We started investing in weapons, I think, going back 4 or 5 years. I think it's -- when you look at the budget, you look at the threats, you look at our capabilities, I think we're in really good shape here. We're investing in our in our Seekers, which I think is unique and has great capabilities. Like anything, it starts out a little slow. And sometime in August, we'll get the Gate 2 award. And I think in 2023, early '23, they'll probably down select to 2, and then the fly offs and the fund begin. Our next question comes from the line of George Shapiro, Shapiro Research. I was wondering on the cash flow, your inventories are up like 260 million in the first half. Thanks for the question, George. So when you look at our first half versus second half, you're absolutely right. Most of our cash generation is in the second half, with a healthy amount of that coming from working capital reduction assumptions. And so to your point about the inventories, clearly, we are building in anticipation of that second half ramp. And so when you look at our product-based revenues, which is about 25% of our overall portfolio, that is a key driver in terms of our sales uptick within the second half. The other piece I would note is within our ISR missionization business, to the extent that we are buying aircraft in anticipation of those programs coming online in the second half, that also sits within the inventory. Chris, I wanted to extrapolate on some of these prior questions about hockey sticks and recovery. In other words, you don't necessarily capture in the back half of this year, but then we have sort of a monster year in '23 or '24. And to answer the first one, I mean, you kind of got to it. So I'd love a monster year, whenever that is. But no, the capacity, I don't see as being an issue. We have a world-class factory, if you will, out in Salt Lake City for the Broadband Communication Systems business. They've had a great couple of months here with the win of CEC, the Cooperative Engagement Capability I mentioned earlier, which is JADC2, the EAGL program. Of course, they'll hopefully get next-gen jammer. We've invested in a new facility for WESCAM, where we're seeing the surge in the turret. So for the product quick turn businesses, I think we have the capability. If we get the supply chain turnaround, I think we'll be okay. We've hired over 4,000 people so far this year. I think it's a company that people find interesting and exciting, and we're getting literally hundreds of thousands of resumes to come work for us. Relative to '23, we're actually going through our strategic planning process now. We talk about low to mid-single-digit growth, but some of the stuff is pretty lumpy. So in regards to the question on CR, our guide assumes that there is some level of a CR in the second -- in Q4 of this year. Thanks for the question, Michael. So consistent with what we shared back in our last call, we anticipate about $100 million of gross inflationary impacts within the year. And to your point about our overall program mix, about 50% of our portfolio is fixed price. But we anticipate that through the middle of next year to probably Q3, Q4. So before ending the call, I want to take a moment to recognize our 47,000 strong L3Harris teammates around the globe. And thank you for remaining focus on creating value for all of our stakeholders, particularly in support of meeting our customers' critical missions. Thanks, everyone, for your time today, and have a great weekend."
