    "content": " As Billy mentioned earlier, solid loan growth continued throughout the year as we ended 2022 with quarter-over-quarter net organic loan and lease growth at a 17% annualized pace excluding PPP loans. For the full 2022 year, the bank saw total loans and leases outstanding grow a little under 20% over year end 2021 with diversification in the types of loans generated, as well as solid geographic dispersion of that growth. Improved interest rates on new loan production and renewals as the year progressed generated gradual increases in portfolio yield with our largest increase happening in Q4, pushing that average yield up 46 basis points quarter-over-quarter, just over 5%. At quarter end our tangible book value was $19.09 per share; however, excluding the temporary impact of our unrealized security losses, our tangible book value per share was $21.18, representing a quarter-over-quarter increase of 3.7% and a five-year compound annualized growth rate of almost 9%. Hey, good morning everyone. Yes Brett, I'm going to let Rhett kind of dive into that, but just kind of anecdotally, I mean, it's something we talk about a lot and then we've been watching and obviously do quarterly reviews, annual reviews for clients looking at that, during some shocks, and we still feel extremely comfortable about the quality of our loan portfolio, even with a little high rate environment. Hey, good morning everyone. Hey, good morning guys. If you see demand for loans and growth surpass that guidance maybe into the 10% range or low double digits, would you expect the margin to remain in that 3.30% to 3.35% range you talked about or do you think that incremental funding pressures may push out a little bit lower? Hey, good morning guys."
