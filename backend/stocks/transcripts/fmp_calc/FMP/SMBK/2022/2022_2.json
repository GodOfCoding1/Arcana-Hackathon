    "content": " We reported $10.3 million in operating earnings or $0.61 per share, strong organic growth on both sides of the balance sheet for the quarter 30% annualized growth on loans and 9% annualized on deposits, highlighted by a 14% annualized number on our non-maturity deposits. This equates to a 30% increase in annualized quarter-over-quarter loan growth ending the halfway mark for the year with just under $3 billion in loans and leases outstanding, while the loan portfolio average yield held steady to Q1 levels. But right now, we feel good about continuing to grow the loans as Miller alluded to in his opening comments, and Rhett mentioned and the markets that we're in we're still seeing the population inflow the growth. And then the fourth quarter, we're looking to be pretty much closer to historical at 30%, that's kind of what we're modeling at this point. We do have timing differences by the time term seats are out and we commit by the time it closes, we're starting to see the reaction on the loans for June and for the first quarter -- excuse me, from the second quarter rate impacts really starting to charge up the third quarter results. The outlook for more moderate pace of loan growth, is that just more coming off a very, very strong quarter, or is it more of a proactive stance to not be growing as quickly going into a potential downturn or what you're seeing from customers or a little of all the above."
