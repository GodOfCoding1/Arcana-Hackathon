    "content": " We remain confident in our expectation our cost per ounce will drop in the second half relative to the first half, given the planned increases in grade and production across our portfolio. As we indicated in our press release yesterday, our costs are tracking above our previous guidance range, and we're now expecting full year cost of sales to be approximately $900 per ounce and are all-in sustaining cost to be approximately $1,240 per ounce. We expect free cash flow to increase further in the second half, particularly in Q4, as our production increases and cost decrease subject to future gold prices. As Paul mentioned, we repaid $120 million of debt in the second quarter with another $100 million paid down in July and plans for continued repaying going forward. Looking forward, we remain on track to ramp production up in the second half of the year, driven by planned higher grades and throughput levels across the portfolio. Tasiast delivered a good second quarter with $129,000 ounce produced, head grades remain strong in Q2, and we're encouraged by the ongoing throughput ramp-up regularly achieving more than 21,000 tonnes per day. We're expecting a production increase of at least 30% from Tasiast in the second half of the year, largely driven by sustained throughput of 21,000 tonnes a day and increasing grades coming out of West Branch 4, where we are mining now."
