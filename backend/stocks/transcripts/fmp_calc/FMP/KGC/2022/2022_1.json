    "content": " In the current gold price environment, we expect to continue with our baseline dividend and share buyback plans returning approximately $300 million per year to shareholders. With respect to CapEx, we have right sized our CapEx profile and now plan to spend $850 million in 2022 and expect CapEx to remain in the range of $750 million over the following 2 years, before factoring in additional inflation beyond this year and potential additional growth projects. Your line is open. So what we've established here is that we're going to open pit mine the next couple of Phases of W and then Phase S. And then the second half of our optimization study, which we're working on in the balance of this year will determine whether the third and fourth Phases of W and then X, what their configuration is open pit versus underground. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open."
