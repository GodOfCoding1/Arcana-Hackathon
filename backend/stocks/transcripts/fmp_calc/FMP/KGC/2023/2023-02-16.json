    "content": " For next year, we're expecting production in the range of 2.1 million ounces, cash cost of $970 per ounce, and all-in-sustaining costs of $1,320 per ounce. Q1 of this year is expected to be a particularly low production quarter, as a result of seasonality of Paracatu and the US heap leach operations as well as planned operational shutdowns at Tasiast and La Coipa, Claude will elaborate on the operational shutdown. As such, throughput in the first quarter of this year is expected to average around 17,000 tonnes a day and based on the schedule for shutdowns and ramp-ups, we are targeting average throughput between 20,000 tonnes and 21,000 tonnes a day in 2023 to produce our plan 610,000 ounces. Tasiast 24,000 construction is progressing well and the project remains on schedule to initially reach throughput of 24,000 tons a day by mid-2023, followed by a ramp-up period before sustaining that level At La Coipa, we saw substantial progress in the fourth quarter with production of 68,000 ounces. And then so just \u00e2\u0080\u0093 just to be clear on the \u00e2\u0080\u0093 on the sustaining CapEx, it's about $510 million that you're expecting this year plus minus 5%, obviously, and then that that would drop to $425 half of the $850 million."
