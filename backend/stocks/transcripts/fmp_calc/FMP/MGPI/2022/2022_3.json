    "content": " Consolidated sales for the quarter increased 14% to $201.2 million, while gross profit increased 3% to $59.1 million, representing 29.4% of sales. Sales of premium beverage alcohol increased 22%, while brown goods sales increased 34% from last year due to higher new distillate and aged whiskey sales. For the quarter 2022, consolidated sales increased 14% to $201.2 million as a result of record third quarter sales across all three business segments. Operating income for the third quarter increased 3% to $33.9 million, primarily due to the previously mentioned increase in gross profit and reduction in SG&A. Adjusted operating income increased 2% from $33.2 million in the prior year period, which was adjusted for the aforementioned acquisition costs. Net income for the third quarter of 2022 decreased slightly from the year ago period to $23.6 million, while adjusted net income decreased 1% from $23.9 million. Our increased guidance for the full fiscal 2022 year assumes the following: sales projected to be in the range of $765 million to $780 million, adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $162 million to $167 million and adjusted basic earnings per common share in the range of $4.62 to $4.80 per share."
