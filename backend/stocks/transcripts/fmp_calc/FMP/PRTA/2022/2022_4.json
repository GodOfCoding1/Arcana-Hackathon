    "content": " For our Alzheimer's programs in 2022, we advanced both PRX012 and PRX005 into the clinic and expect to report top line Phase 1 multiple ascending dose data from both programs this year. Notably, developments include the presentation last November at the clinical trials on Alzheimer's disease or CTAD conference of statistically significant and clinically meaningful results across the primary endpoint and all key secondary endpoints from Eisai and Biogen's confirmatory Phase 3 Clarity AD trial for lecanemab, an antibody that targets immunoterminus of Abeta in patients with Alzheimer's disease to both clear plaques and neutralize soluble proto. The results from Clarity AD plus the accelerated approval of lecanemab continues to support the Abeta treatment pathway in Alzheimer's disease and we believe paved the path for the next generation of plaque clearing anti Abeta antibodies, including PRX012 a potential best-in-class subcutaneous treatment for Alzheimer's disease. We then successfully initiated a randomized double blind placebo controlled Phase 1 single study dose study evaluating the safety, tolerability, immunogenicity, and pharmacokinetics of PRX012 in healthy volunteers and in patients with Alzheimer's disease. In December at the American Society of Hematology 2022 Conference, we reported clinical data from the completed Phase 3 VITAL study, which demonstrated in a post analysis of patients with Mayo Stage IV AL Amyloidosis, a statistically significant survival benefit of 74% in patients taking birtamimab versus 49% of patients on placebo at nine months. Third, the Phase 1 multiple ascending dose study for PRX005 is ongoing with top line data expected by year-end 2023, further elucidating the potential of targeting the MTBR tau in treating Alzheimer's."
