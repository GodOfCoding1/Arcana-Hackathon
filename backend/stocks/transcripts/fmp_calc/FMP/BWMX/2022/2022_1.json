    "content": " With me on today\u2019s call for Betterware\u2019s Executive Chairman, Luis Campos; Chief Executive Officer, Andres Campos; and Corporate Chief Financial Officer, Carlos Doormann. Before we get started, I would like to remind you that this call include forward-looking statements, which are subject to various risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations. A reconciliation of the information regarding non-GAAP financial measures discussed on the call can be found in the earnings release issued yesterday, as well as Investor sections of the company\u2019s website. And its asset-light and agile business model which has allowed us to successfully navigate through an uncertain environment, both locally and globally, of high inflation, supply chain disruptions and changing consumer trends, and to recover our profitability levels after the extraordinary expenses experienced during the fourth quarter of last year. Compared to the preceding quarter, our gross and EBITDA margins expanded 993 and 1003 basis points, respectively, which demonstrates the flexibility of our business to adapt promptly to different market conditions. While we are operating in a dynamic and challenging environment, we remain focused on our long-term growth strategy and the opportunities ahead as we have in the last 20 years. Later in the call, Andres will discuss some of these strategies in detail, which are based on our three strategic pillars of product innovation, technology and business intelligence and will pave the way for future growth. Carlos will discuss our quarterly financial results, our expectations for the rest of the year, and the financial strength of our business. As announced on April 7, we are very pleased to complete the acquisition of Jafra\u2019s operations in Mexico and in the US, along with Jafra\u2019s trademark rights worldwide, funded primarily by debt, taking advantage of our current low leverage ratio. As previously mentioned, each company\u2019s management team will operate as an independent subsidiary, remaining fully focused on its operations and growth strategies. The COVID period from 2020 to 2022 brought about an abnormal expansion of the market with the consequent very positive impacts on our revenues, which have now adjusted to back to normal conditions. The latest study of May 2021 showed that with 1.2 million associates, we reached almost 24% of Mexican households on a regular basis or approximately 7 million households had purchased Betterware products in their prior 12 months. First, as we have mentioned before, we have deconstructed our complete product portfolio, reorganizing our product categories by functionality, rather than by areas of the home, elevating thus our innovation capabilities. Within these functional categories, we have identified more than 200 product concepts that we offer to the consumer, which will allow us to increase our growth opportunity going forward. At the same time, we will roll out the first version of our Natural Language Processing technology within our service BOT, but during the second quarter of \u201822. Finally, regarding the Business Intelligence pillar, we have overhauled our rewards programs to continue motivating market penetration and sales force growth. Overall, as we mentioned before, we see COVID and post-COVID period, meaning, 2020 through 2022 as an abnormal period within our long-term focus on market penetration. We believe that there are still strong secular trends on which we can act to continue growing in the years to come, as we have done for the past 20 years before COVID. Thus, we\u2019re fully confident of our long-term target of reaching 40% market penetration remains valid. First, I would like to highlight that the first quarter of 2021 was the strongest quarter in the history of the company in terms of net revenue, EBITDA, and the size of our associates and distributors\u2019 network, resulting in an extremely difficult comparison base for this year. That said, during the first quarter of this year, we experienced additional headwinds in our business. Net revenues were 36% lower than comparable net revenues of the first quarter of 2021, given the extremely difficult comparison base following a 205% growth relative to the first quarter of 2020. Efficient cost management and the 12% product price increase announced at the beginning of the year were key to expand our gross margin by 610 basis points, compared to first quarter of 2021 and 993 basis points compared to fourth quarter of 2021. EBITDA for the quarter was 41% lower than the EBITDA for the first quarter of 2021, which was in turn 287% higher than the EBITDA of the first quarter of 2020. Our EBITDA margin was 29.3%, which represents 1003 basis points expansion quarter-on-quarter, mainly due to the gross margin expansion and the absence of extraordinary expenses similar in the fourth quarter of 2021, which clearly reflects that our expenses are under control. Net income, which includes unrealized loss in mark-to-market of financial derivative instruments was 58% lower than the first quarter of 2021. Excluding the MXN 99.4 million negative impact due to the unrealized loss mark-to-market valuation of derivative instruments, which does not affect the company\u2019s cash flow or operating income. First, the flexibility of our asset-light business model, and a relatively low fixed cost base allows us to quickly adapt to market conditions and changes in trends as shown in our margin recovery for fourth quarter 2021 to first quarter 2022. Second, our cash conversion cycle stands strong at negative 16 days due to favorable conditions with our suppliers and distributors, as well as an effective inventory management, allowing us to fully fund our working capital needs as we grow. And finally, our leverage ratio remains at an extremely conservative level of 0.4 times net debt to EBITDA, as of the closing of the first quarter of 2022. As mentioned in our earnings release yesterday, we proposed the payment of a MXN 350 million dividend or MXN 9.38]  per share, which was approved at the Ordinary General Shareholders\u2019 Meeting held on April 28th, 2022. Regarding our full year expectations, at this point, we anticipate on the one hand, net revenues to be slightly below, and on the other hand, EBITDA to be close to the previous guidance. We look forward to providing guidance for Jafra within our Q2 report, once we have more visibility into the external situation and have properly assessed Jafra\u2019s synergies and its accretive impact within Betterware. For now, we can gladly share 2021 Jafra\u2019s preliminary figures of net revenues at MXN 5.8 billion and EBITDA of MXN 0.9 billion, pending the release of audited financials from the external auditor and IFRS adoption. In the longer-term, we remain confident in our ability to seize growth opportunities in the years to come, which will lead us to reach our target of household penetration and expand our geographic reach starting with the expansion to the United States by the end of 2023. I wanted to start if you can share some color on the \u2013 your expectations for 2022, the revision in the press release as for sales to be you know slightly below the prior guidance for flat and EBITDA slightly below I guess flat year-over-year. If you remember, during the last conference in regarding the fourth quarter results, we were very clear regarding, we will have a progressive comparisons along the year beginning with a very, very extremely hard comparison in the first quarter, okay, since we grew 205% at the first quarter of last year as compared to 2020. Which means very clearly that we would be below last year in the first two quarters, okay and begin growing sometime in the second half. Then what I can tell you is that, we are happy to see that our results in the first quarter are pretty much in line with our projections, okay. This is the reason why we want to be conservative and say, slightly below and \u2013 in terms of sales and close to, in the case of EBITDA, okay, because if everything under our control internally, we have been taking care of it, okay. And we prefer to be conservative and say, slightly below, okay, because we don\u2019t know whether or not these inflationary pressures will \u2013 could modify, elevate our projections. Ours \u2013 our expectation with the review of our commercial strategies is that, this could neutralize the external factors but \u2013 our internal strategies, but we still have to see the second quarter will be \u2013 we will see how our strategies are working and what the external factors or the way external factors are improving or worsening, okay. I mean, obviously there is this short-term pressure with inflation and all this happening, but we believe that if we have the strategies in place as we have done in the past, we will continue to achieve the long-term secular trends and be able to act on them and achieve this long-term growth. But it\u2019s very important, we believe to keep our focus and our target also in these long-term trends that we have been able to capture in the past, and we will continue to capture in the future. The technology we have for the sales force, okay, which will also allow them to focus more on the sales force in Jafra Mexico and the US to focus more on attracting people and improving sales. Also, we already begun working on strengthening the Business Intelligence area on both Mexico and the US, which will also help to better focus on those concepts that will drive or accelerate growth. Then all these together, we expect that will be very favorable for Jafra\u2019s growth in the near, mid and long-term future, okay. I would like to comment that along with the synergies estimated in the $5 million to $10 million range, which we previously announced in January, we have identified additional opportunities which will allow us to improve their costing structure and margins in the short-term. But additionally, we have already as part of our work and there was an integration of Jafra identified opportunities to divest several of Jafra\u2019s unproductive assets, which once completed, will release cash flow for \u2013 cash flow for their use. So we \u2013 Cristina, we tell him in our report that the 2021 before adapting to \u2013 IFRS and before we received a report from the external auditors, the EBITDA last year was like a little bit more than MXN 900 million, which is more or less 16% EBITDA margin. Well, thank you for joining us today and we look forward to speaking with you when we report our next quarter results and meeting with many of you at the upcoming investor conferences."
