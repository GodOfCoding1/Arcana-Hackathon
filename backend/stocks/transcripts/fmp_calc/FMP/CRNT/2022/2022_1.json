    "content": " Improvement in our gross margin is expected only during the second half of the year, assuming gradual improvement in our supply chain and shipping constrains and costs. Gross profit for the first quarter on a non-GAAP basis was $19.5 million, giving us a non-GAAP gross margin of 27.7%, lower by almost 2% than the first quarter of 2021. Improvement in our gross margin is expected only during the second half of the year, assuming gradual improvement in our supply chain and shipping constrains and costs. But we do think that we're -- we're taking the right decisions because we know in this market, the cost of gaining new customers is by far higher than maintaining customers and with our Tier 1 long standing customers relationship, we thought that this quarter that it's the right decision to pay these expedite fees in order to maintain our market share in these customers. But it's not a walk in the park because let's not forget 70% of our business is coming from Tier 1 operators and Tier 2 operators which are by far a bigger and their leverage in a commercial power over Ceragon, not only Ceragon, its big and obviously the competition is waiting aside and I've not seen a very intensive price increase coming from the competition."
