    "content": " Our strongest regions in terms of revenues for the quarter were India and North America with $22.1 million and $21.6 million respectively, reflecting ongoing deliveries for our main customers and in line with the strong demand we see in this region. Gross profit for the third quarter on a non-GAAP basis was $28 million, giving us a non-GAAP gross margin of 35.5% compared to 31% in Q3, 2021 and 30.5% in Q2 2022. General and Administrative expenses for the third quarter on a non-GAAP basis were $6.1 million compared to $4.6 million in Q3 2021 and $4.6 million in Q2, 2022. Our inventory at the end of Q3, 2022 was $64.2 million, up from $60.7 million at the end of Q2, 2022, still reflecting our need to stock long lead-time and strategic items as a combined result of increased customer orders, the ongoing component shortages, and the impact resulting from replacing one of our contract manufacturers which we discussed last quarter. Given only a slight improvement in supply chain issues, which continue to impact our ability to convert our strong backlog into revenues, we now expect to finish the year with a revenue range of $296 million to $304 million. For me, I would say that hopefully we have finished the period in which our gross margins are significantly below 30% and if you ask me, pending obviously the revenue mix per quarter, the numbers can vary between a little bit above 30% and all the way up to 35%, once again pending on the original mix and the software upgrade portion in that particular quarter."
