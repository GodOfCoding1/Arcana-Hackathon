    "content": " Labor costs, as a percentage of revenue, increased approximately 140 basis points to 29.7%, primarily due to hourly labor rate inflation of approximately 13% as comparable restaurants as well as an improvement in hourly staffing levels as compared to last year. With the lingering labor challenges, we expect hourly labor inflation to remain that elevated levels of approximately 10% to 12% for the second quarter of 2022 as compared to 2021, in addition to continuation of the year-over-year staffing increase. And so that wouldn\u2019t be -- we don\u2019t have those price increases in quarter two and then when you\u2019re looking at -- I think we said on our prepared remarks, as far as commodities, we\u2019re looking at about mid 20% increase in commodity and I believe 10% to 12% from a labor standpoint."
