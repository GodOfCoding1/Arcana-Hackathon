    "content": " Labor costs as a percentage of revenue increased approximately 110 basis points to 29.1%, primarily due to hourly labor rate inflation of approximately 11% at comparable restaurants as well as an improvement in our hourly staffing levels as compared to last year. As we look to the back half of the year, we expect our hourly labor inflation to remain at elevated levels of approximately 10% for the third quarter of 2022 and 6% to 8% for the fourth quarter of 2022 as compared to 2021, in addition to a continuation of the year-over-year increases in staffing levels. General and administrative expenses decreased to $6.5 million in the second quarter from $6.7 million in the same period last year, driven by lower performance-based bonuses and professional fees, partially offset by an increase in travel related and other expenses. In summary, net income for the second quarter of 2022 was $7.9 million or $0.41 per diluted share compared to $11.5 million or $0.57 per diluted share in the same period last year. During the second quarter of 2022, we incurred $0.7 million or $0.03 per diluted share in impairment, closed restaurant and other costs compared to $1.4 million or $0.05 per diluted share in the same period last year. Taking that into account, adjusted net income for the second quarter of 2022 was $8.4 million or $0.44 per diluted share compared to $12.6 million or $0.62 per diluted share in the same period last year.
