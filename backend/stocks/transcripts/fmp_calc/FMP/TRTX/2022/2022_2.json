    "content": " Regarding our existing loan portfolio, during the quarter, we received loan repayments of a total of $757 million, which is comprised primarily of 35% office, 23% multifamily 22% hotel, and the remaining amounts are split between lifestyles and mixed use. To provide one highlight on the range of outcomes with respect to loan resolutions in today's market, one of the loans repaid in Q2 was a $165 million four rated loan on a convention centre hotel. Furthermore, since the quarter ended, and during the month of July, we increased our origination velocity meaningfully with another $386 million of loans closed and another $171 million of loans under executed term sheet. First, book value per common share declined quarter-over-quarter by $0.38 per share to $16.03 from $16.41, primarily because the increase in our CECL reserve outpaced the sum of our operating earnings and the $13.3 million gain on sale that we realized on that land parcel on the Las Vegas Strip."
