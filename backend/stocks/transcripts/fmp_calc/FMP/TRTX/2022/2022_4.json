    "content": " While we continue to acknowledge the dislocation of lending markets and pressure on value within certain sectors and geographies, particularly office properties, you can see it from our quarter-over-quarter seasonal reserve reduction of approximately $11 million and stable portfolio risk ratings, that we have anticipated these challenges and are actively working to address their impact on our portfolio. For the full year we arranged $1.8 billion of non-mark-to-market term debt capital, including $1.1 billion of CLO funding via our 5th CLO, $726.3 million of non-CLO term financing, which was a mix of note-on-note syndicated senior loans or A-note financing, and included several new counterparties. But to speak generally, you know, four risk rated loans typically are assets where we either have some concern over the performance of the collateral or there could be a technical default, but the really overarching principle is that we don't view there to be a significant risk of principal loss, whereas within the five rated bucket is where we do acknowledge that there is risk of principal loss, and so I think those really are the two kind of guide posts. So I think that's like a pretty good proxy for \u00e2\u0080\u0093 you know fours are not necessarily earmarked as kind of headed towards the five, and recent data suggests that two of our last three four rated loans that were resolved is paid off in-part, and that was one hotel loan and that was one office loan, one of which that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s paid off in Q4 and the other which was just paid off in Q1."
