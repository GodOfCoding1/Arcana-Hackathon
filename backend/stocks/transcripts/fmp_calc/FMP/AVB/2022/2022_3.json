    "content": " The other two significant drivers are further margin improvement from our operating model initiatives, which we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve targeted for $50 million of NOI uplift and expect to have delivered about 40% or $20 million of this NOI uplift to our bottom line by year-end and the return on our structured investment program as we build that book of business up to $300 million to $500 million. Our strong Q3 revenue growth of 11.8% was primarily driven by higher lease rates, which increased 9.5% year-over-year, the reduced impact of concessions, which contributed 240 basis points and other more modest contributions from other rental revenue and underlying bad debt trends. Beginning with chart 1, given the very strong rent change we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve experienced this year, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll likely start in 2023 with built-in revenue growth of roughly 4%, the second highest level in our history, and more than 100 basis points stronger than our starting point of roughly 2.5% entering 2022. So for the full year 2022, we expect our reported net bad debt to be roughly 1.7% which includes the benefit of our estimation of $36 million to $37 million in rent relief that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve recognized or will recognize throughout the full calendar year."
