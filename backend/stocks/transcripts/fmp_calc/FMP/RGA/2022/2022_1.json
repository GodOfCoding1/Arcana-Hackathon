    "content": " RGA reported pretax adjusted operating income of $59 million for the quarter and adjusted operating EPS of $0.47 per share, which includes a negative COVID-19 impact of $3.48 per share. The U.S. and Latin America Traditional segment included approximately $272 million of COVID-19 claim costs, $260 million of which was in our U.S. individual mortality business with the majority of the balance in our U.S. group business. In the Europe, Middle East and Africa segment, the Traditional business results reflected COVID-19 claim cost of $10 million in total, with most of that in the U.K. We also saw some non-COVID-19 excess large mortality claims in the U.K., which we attribute to normal quarterly volatility. Our COVID-19 mortality claim costs of $260 million were material given the high level of population deaths, but we saw a reduction in our claim cost per 10,000 general population deaths as compared to Q3 and Q4 of 2021. Turning to Canada, and as shown on Slide 15, estimated COVID-19 mortality claims were $20 million or approximately double the prior quarter. So far, in Q2, COVID-19 general population deaths in the U.S. and other key markets have remained at relatively low levels when compared to Q1, and we are cautiously optimistic that future impacts will continue to decline in severity due to higher population immunity from vaccination and prior infection as well as increasing access to more effective treatments. And I think that's what we would continue to -- that's what we continue to expect to do is look on the horizon and see what potential transaction activity there is and then balance out the overall management of the capital base as well as I think you've seen, we're also looking at alternative forms of capital as well as beyond equity and debt from the holding company. So as we go forward and we get back to more, I'll call it, more normal times when most of the impact of the pandemic is behind us and we're more confident with the capital generation and as we continue to execute on these alternative forms of capital, I mentioned a minute ago, we would be comfortable coming down below that $1 billion of excess capital once we are confident that we can replenish the capital fairly quickly through earnings and alternative forum."
