    "content": " So it is shown on slide 12, in our presentation, and as we've discussed in the past, and we follow up, we view as very balanced approach to capital management over time, looking at deployment in the business opportunities and the transactions that we really like the shareholder dividend and also share buybacks. Yes, thanks for the question. You've also mentioned that COVID losses should become more limited, so I am wondering if you're considering a new threshold to call out unfavorable or favorable mortality in any given quarter as the $0.12 EPS impact from COVID held in comparison of your favorable mortality experience. So when I look at that, and then I layer on our global footprint, where we have very strong local teams, they have extensive local market knowledge, they have strong local client relationships, that -- what that does is it enables us to quickly leverage good ideas between markets, and I've shared in the past, it's the new ideas or being early to new market opportunities that generally come with stronger margins, or they come with exclusive arrangements where you're not competing against others. But it looks like after backing out the impact of COVID, that mortality is actually slightly more favorable than what has been sort of a historic run rate based on the CDC reporting so that helps, I think, support our belief that most of the general population excess mortality that we've been seeing over the course of the pandemic is directly or indirectly related to COVID-19. Yes, thanks for the question."
