    "content": " The U.S. and Latin America Traditional segment results were very strong, reflecting both favorable Individual Mortality experience and modest COVID-19 claims that totaled approximately $52 million. Turning to our Asia-Pacific Traditional business, Asia results reflected favorable underwriting experience across the region, absorbing COVID-19 claim costs of $7 million, primarily in Japan. The Asia-Pacific Financial Solutions business results were impacted in the quarter due to $21 million in COVID-19 related medical claims in Japan for in-home sickness benefits, but would have been strong otherwise due to new transactions and higher yields. Turning to Asia-Pacific, as Todd mentioned, COVID-19-related medical claims in Japan were elevated this quarter with a combined claim cost estimate of $34 million, split between our Traditional and Financial Solutions segments. I thought I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d chime in as well since you asked about the tailwind from interest rates and last quarter we had given an estimate of $70 million more income for -- over the next 12 months, given the rise in rates year-to-date and certainly rates continue to rise."
