    "content": " Overall, Career learning revenue for the first quarter increased 63% to $153.5 million, driven by strength in middle and high school career enrollments and adult learning growth. Yes, I think, so first of all, I think that the Gen Ed enrollment, sort of, a bottomed out, and if you look pre-pandemic, our General Education business is sort of around those pre-pandemic numbers, so we feel pretty good that it's bottomed out at this level. I just wanted to understand, firstly, just sort of tracking the development of the General Eds enrollment trend, I recall, I think at the full-year, you talked about relatively robust sort of survey work in terms of sort of indicating that enrollment would be fairly resilient. I suppose the question there is, was that -- did that just turn out not to be the case and the survey work didn't work or coming back to your points about execution, do you think that was enough to sort of take the shine of that, just interested in sort of exactly whether it was a function of you guys not executing a 100% or whether that's generally being a pullback and sort of industry level demand. I mean, I think for sure, we have also much like Pearson, and I think our business is probably mixed similarly to them, that we've got some revenue per enrollment strength that's due both to the overall funding environment, but also to the mix."
