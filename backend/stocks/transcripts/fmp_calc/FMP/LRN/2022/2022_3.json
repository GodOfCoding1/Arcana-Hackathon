    "content": " Revenue was $421.7 million, an increase of 7.5% from the same period last year, adjusted operating income was $69.4 million, up 26%, and capital expenditures were $18.4 million, an increase of $7.1 million. As we've mentioned, this is due to the expected decline in enrollments after last year's large COVID-driven surge, somewhat offset by an increase in revenue per enrollment. Revenue from middle and high school Career Learning was $83.2 million, up almost 60% from last year. Adult Learning revenue was $22.6 million, up 30% from last year's third quarter. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. So this past fall the teacher shortage, I think I've indicated before that we could have - we definitely could have surpassed last year's number, probably hit a number like 200 if it weren't for teacher shortage."
