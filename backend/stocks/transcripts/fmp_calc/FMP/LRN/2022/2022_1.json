    "content": " And I think it\u2019s just sort of logical, like in order for us to, I think, hit the kind of numbers we\u2019re hitting, we have to have had both, a lot of returning families and then ongoing interest from new families. And you mentioned a little bit in the prepared remarks, but just your ability to launch programs in new states over the next few years, especially with some of the favorable trends you\u2019re seeing in accepting public vouchers. But I just think given everything that\u2019s going on over the past 2 years in this country, I\u2019m disappointed in those politicians who are still resisting giving the kids in their states opportunities for virtual programs like ours. On the guidance, and I think in the past couple of years, you\u2019ve seen quarterly absolute revenue relative to the first quarter of the fiscal year, either remain steady over remaining quarters or increase some. We actually \u2013 so, we didn\u2019t really have a lot of new programs this year, meaning fiscal year \u201822 on the career side. But it\u2019s a pretty good year-over-year comp for us, I think in the sense that a lot of that growth was in fact, not from new programs. And when I refer to, I think the sort of long-term benefit to us about what\u2019s going on, I think there is a lot of that, the \u2013 whether it\u2019s a vaccination requirement that some teachers are maybe reluctant to meet where they don\u2019t have to meet it with us, whether it\u2019s the fact that kid \u2013 that they are teaching kids in a classroom that aren\u2019t yet able to be vaccinated, I think that long-term trend plays well for us. I mean I think the market share question is one that \u2013 it\u2019s a little bit hard because so many programs, whether the brick-and-mortar programs or whatever have sort of spawned over the past year or so."
