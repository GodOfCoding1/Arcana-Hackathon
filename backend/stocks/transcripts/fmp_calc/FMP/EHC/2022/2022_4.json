    "content": " Certain risks and uncertainties, like those relating to regulatory developments, as well as volume, bad debt, and labor cost trends that could cause actual results to differ materially from our projections, estimates, and expectations, are discussed in the company's SEC filings, including the company's earnings release and related Form 8-K, the Form 10-K for year ended December 31, 2022, when filed. Continued vigilance on labor management, and a solid contribution from our 2022 de novos, facilitated Q4 year-over-year adjusted EBITDA growth of 16.4%. For fiscal year 2022, we were able to overcome an increase of approximately $70 million in contract labor and sign-on and shift bonuses, $16 million in net pre-opening and new store ramp up costs at our de novos, and double-digit second half inflation in food and utility costs, to generate a year-over-year increase in adjusted EBITDA. Contract labor expense in Q4 declined approximately $5.1 million or 20.6% from Q3, $10.3 million or 34.3% from Q4 2021, and $22.2 million or 53% from the peak in Q1 2022. Hey, good morning, guys. If you think just about that EPOB adjustment going from where we were this year with the 3.38 to 3.40, if in fact we go all the way there, even though you're getting good leverage on total SWB, with it growing about 1.5% on a year-over-year basis, 1.5% to 2% based on the improvement in contract labor and sign-on shift bonuses, you're increasing your FTE count by about 8%. Hey, good morning, guys."
