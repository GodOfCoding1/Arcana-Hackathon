    "content": " This means that, despite $39 million of headwinds from foreign currency exchange, the international team was almost able to generate as much adjusted EBITDA in one quarter than any prior full year in company's history. However, given the return of normal seasonality stabilizing industry supply and mounting macroeconomic uncertainties, we believe in order to optimize return on invested capital, we will need to manage a sequential decline in Americas' fleet consistent with what we've historically done in pre-pandemic years from the third to the fourth quarter. If you adjust for fleet gains, you'll see that our straight-line depreciation has increased from $210 in the second quarter of 2022 to over $230 in the third quarter of 2022. The used car market is currently in flux, but given our remarketing strategy along with our conservative nature of how we account for our fleet assets, we believe the ceiling for monthly per unit fleet costs in the fourth quarter will be similar to where we straight-line monthly depreciation in the third quarter. Which means that since the pandemic began a 11 quarters ago in the first quarter of 2020, we've repurchased $4.4 billion of shares, invested $1.6 billion back into our vehicle programs and brought our net leverage ratio to less than one times, the lowest in company history. So despite the difficult sequential comp in monthly vehicle depreciation, we are targeting to deliver more than $450 million in adjusted EBITDA next quarter, which means that at this point, we believe that we'll generate approximately $4 billion in adjusted EBITDA for full year 2022. Like I said, we've taken out more cars this quarter as far as fleet sales than we did any time in the third quarter, if you take out the pandemic years."
