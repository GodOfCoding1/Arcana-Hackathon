    "content": " As Joe mentioned earlier on the call, we are seeing a return to normal seasonality in the business, which means that for the first quarter of 2023, we believe RPD will see a seasonal decline from four Q 2022 As we enter a shoulder period in our Leisure segment and commercial rates make up a greater portion of our business mix. And as I said before in our earlier commentary, we spent a lot of time these past two quarters exiting higher mileage cars at pretty high gains, I would think, to get our fleet back in line so that we have a fleet size that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s right for the time of year and also a product that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s commercially acceptable to our customers."
