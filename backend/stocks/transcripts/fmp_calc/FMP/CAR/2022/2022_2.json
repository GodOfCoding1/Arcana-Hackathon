    "content": " Given macroeconomic uncertainties, we believe it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s prudent to trim vehicles in order to ensure a proper return on invested capital on our fleet asset base; therefore, similar to the first quarter, fleet sale gains resulted in monthly per-unit fleet costs in the Americas to be significantly lower than our straightline depreciation in the second quarter. What we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re seeing now is--and I think it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s good news, is more of a seasonality of what things were and how we can operate in that level of environment, and so while, yes, Brian mentioned about we believe price to be, we still think demand will be high, we still think that our cost controls will be great, we still think that the used car market will be strong, and that should affect our earnings in the third quarter. I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t give you an exact number because, as we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve said throughout this call, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re very nimble in terms of how we manage our fleet and where and when we dispose of our vehicles, so we can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t pinpoint a number; but I can tell you that the gains on sale will decrease in the back half of the year and we will get closer and closer to where we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re straightlining the cars right now. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to help that variable cost with more efficiency in our maintenance operations, and I think it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s more pleasing to our customer base, so we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to continue to look at our ability to get back to a more normalized fleet rotation, like we saw in 2019."
