    "content": " If you compare our most recent results to the first quarter of 2019, Americas revenue increased by $673 million while adjusted EBITDA increased by $775 million, for an incremental margin of a 115%. More impressively, if you compare the most recent quarter's results to the first quarter of 2019, you notice that despite having over a $160 million in lower revenue, adjusted EBITDA in the first quarter of 2022 is actually $44 million higher than the first quarter of 2019 when they posted a negative $21 million of adjusted EBITDA. You may proceed with your question. So if you look at our 10-Q which was filed earlier this morning, you'll see that if you take away the gain on sales and vehicles this quarter, which Joe mentioned at $300 million, we're still gross depreciating our vehicles at over $230 a month. You may proceed with your question. I was hoping maybe you could give us a little bit of color on the different buckets of demand between leisure and corporate and just maybe where they trended through the first quarter, and what you're seeing seasonally because Q2 could be a little bit different than Q3. You may proceed with your question. You may proceed with your question. So I think that coming off two years of a pandemic like Joe said, there's just so much latent demand around travel right now that we feel really good about where we stand but we're not going to comment right now with the third quarter."
