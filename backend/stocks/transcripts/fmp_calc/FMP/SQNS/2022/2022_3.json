    "content": " A strong reception of the new generation Cat 1 Calliope 2 allowed us to secure our first two significant design wins, representing over $30 million of three-year aggregate revenue. And then as well, the pipeline of opportunities as it relates to Cat 1, I believe you said 700 million wanted to confirm that again, and kind of how you're defining that I think historically, when you talked about the $300 million design win pipeline was about three years are using the same metrics on that front. So somehow $350 million in design win, three years revenue design, and the remaining 350 are really advanced projects that we believe we have very high likelihood, I will say to turn them from design end to design win. So over time, maybe we could end by having 50% of design when Cat 1 in dollar amount and 50 Cat-M. And there, we see ourselves in very good position, I spoke about $400 million addressable market for us, in 2025, this is almost counting, like, somewhere chips a little bit more than chips, if we sell module, the number will be bigger, you can double it so."
