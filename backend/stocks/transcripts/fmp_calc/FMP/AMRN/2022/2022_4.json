    "content": " CSL Seqirus brings highly experienced market access and commercialization teams in Australia and New Zealand that are well positioned to support pricing and reimbursement efforts for VAZKEPA, particularly with their strong record in successfully supporting pharmaceutical benefits listings, and eventual marketing and promotion to help us to deliver this important medicine to patients in these countries. Moving to our U.S. business and our plans for ECC 2023, in the fourth quarter of 2022, we recorded $90.2 million in total net revenue including $88 million in U.S. product sales. In the first quarter, we're experiencing typical pharma seasonal trends that branded products like VASCEPA can expect in the U.S. from fourth quarter to first quarter, driven by co-pays and deductibles resetting for patients and their healthcare plans with a new calendar year."
