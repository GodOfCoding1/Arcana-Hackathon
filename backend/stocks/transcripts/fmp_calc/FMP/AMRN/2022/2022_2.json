    "content": " In the second quarter of 2022, we recorded $94.4 million in total net revenue, including $90.6 million in U.S. product sales, reflecting the anticipated continued pressure from generic competition in the market. To that end, we took the difficult but necessary step to announce a comprehensive cost reduction plan to address expenses and market dynamics within the U.S. business, which will result in a $100 million in savings through the middle of next year. Moving forward, we are not investing to grow the molecule in the U.S. market, but we are investing in sustaining and supporting the VASCEPA brand and prescriber base we have today in the U.S. We expect volumes and price will continue to experience pressure throughout this year, and also anticipate the seasonality typically seen within the third quarter for the market. These savings were partially offset by our investments in growth and expansion in Europe and other markets outside of the U.S. As Karim mentioned earlier, in June, we announced an additional comprehensive cost savings plan that will result in $100 million in savings to the middle of next year."
