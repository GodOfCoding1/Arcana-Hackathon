    "content": " For additional information concerning the risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially, please see the Risk Factors section of our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021 and our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2022, which have been filed with the SEC and are now available through the Investor Relations section of our website at www.amarincorp.com. In the third quarter of 2022, we recorded $89.9 million in total net revenue, including $87.9 million in US product sales, largely unchanged from last quarter despite the continued pressure from generic competition and the restructuring effort we announced in June, which reduced our sales and marketing efforts and commercial footprint in the US significantly. For the third quarter of 2022, we reported total net revenue of $89.9 million, including net product revenue of $89.2 million, a decrease of 37% compared to the third quarter of 2021. US product revenue was $87.9 million, a decline of only $2.8 million versus the second quarter of 2022, reflecting relatively stable trends in both volume and price. During the three months ended September 30, 2022, Amarin continued the initiative which began last quarter to take steps to amend supplier agreement, to align supply arrangements with current and future market demand, resulting in a charge of $3.1 million this quarter. This has been a very solid quarter coming up from Q1 and Q2, with US revenue stabilization, the fact that we are cash positive excluding restructuring charges and we continue to make strides in pricing reimbursement in Europe and now launching effectively in one of the largest countries."
