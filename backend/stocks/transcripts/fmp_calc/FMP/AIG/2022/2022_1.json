    "content": " Life and Retirement adjusted pretax income of $724 million compared to $941 million in 1Q \u201821, a reduction of $217 million mostly attributable to lower net investment income, which was $2.1 billion in the quarter compared to $2.4 billion in the prior year quarter, a decrease of $224 million, reflecting lower call and tender activity from rising interest rates; the absence of the affordable housing portfolio, which was sold in fourth quarter \u201821 as well as reduced fee income; and an increase in deferred acquisition cost and statement of position reserves due to lower separate account asset values."
