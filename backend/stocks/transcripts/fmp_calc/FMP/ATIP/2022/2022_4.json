    "content": " Operating loss, excluding impairment charges in the fourth quarter of 2022 was $8 million, decreasing year-over-year from an operating loss of $12 million in Q4 of the prior year, which reflects early results of the multiyear business improvement initiatives that we started in the second half of 2022. Notable below-the-line items during the quarter included income resulting from a decrease in the fair value of certain liabilities acquired in connection with our business combination that we entered into in June 2021, specifically the warrants and contingent common shares, which totaled $10 million."
