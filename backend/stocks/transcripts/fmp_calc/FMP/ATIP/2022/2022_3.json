    "content": " Rent, clinic supplies, contract labor and other in the third quarter of 2022 was $51.4 million a 12% increase year-over-year from 45.8 million in Q3 of the prior year due to more clinics and greater use of contract labor. While cash use and operating and investing activities and 2022 year-to-date was approximately $80 million we are focused on driving operational performance as Sharon talked about controlling costs, and making investment decisions to improve cash flows over the next 12 months as compared to the last 12 months. Your line is open. And then the other half of that 20%, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve developed a plan for each of those clinics, and we will be taking actions starting now and over the next three to five years obviously, the lease terms are one of the factors that plays into the decision we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re moving on those that we can relative to a lease term or those that we have made a decision on closing or divesting. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. So we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve done a full analysis and have the standard of clinic level, and then it gets we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll see how our actions, how fruitful we are with the actions, if we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re being pretty, not trying to be coy here more, we have a plan, and we have a commitment to take an action and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to see how the market responds, and then we may modify the action, but the taking these 10% off the Grid is really important, because we spend a lot of time on this 10% and they obviously weigh down the performance of the other 80%."
