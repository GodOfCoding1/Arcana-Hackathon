    "content": " So the biggest thing we did was just looked at our training footprint and how we're training folks, what we're doing, what aircraft we're putting them in, making sure that it's the most efficient training footprints that we can, and we've made some very good progress during this quarter on optimizing both our training footprint and where we are going to be -- what airplanes we are going to be flying and made some decisions to say these are the levels we're going to be flying and I helped out on some other aircraft types. I think that when you look at what we're focused on, we've kind of indicated in the script, the way the math works under existing attrition models as well as what we have from a comfort level within the hiring pipeline and the data around first officer upgrades particularly coming out of a pandemic, the data is pointing that we can recover and get the pilots we need starting in late 2023 and going into 2024. I'm just trying to think through like aircraft supply is also a bit tight right now, so there's more demand, but then you've got maybe some offset on pilot availability driving some decisions with some of the third-parties you look to do this with."
