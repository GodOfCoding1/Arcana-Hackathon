    "content": " As it relates to the industry obviously, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s some things that some of our partners have done with wholly owned carriers that are very close to this, and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re having good conversations with them as well as far as long term partnering ideas surrounding various labor shortages, especially with pilots. And I just want to know whether or not it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not going to show up until you guys renew some of your agreements, like Chip, you said, I think \u00e2\u0080\u009823, \u00e2\u0080\u009824, \u00e2\u0080\u009825 things renew, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s usually a good time to kind of go back and discuss kind of where things are on the class side, etc. And I think that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the, I think that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the element that we want to emphasize of what our strategy is, is we want to a long perm element of our pilot contract that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to make sure that we can continue to achieve what we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve achieved over the last several decades at SkyWest, and the conversations are going well, and we continue to go down that pathway."
