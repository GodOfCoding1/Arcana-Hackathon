    "content": " We believe that the actions we're taking now to prepare the way over the next year or so for incremental utilization of our fleet, to work through the pilot imbalance affecting the industry and to preserve the optionality of monetizing strong demand opportunities over time will position us well for a successful 2024 and beyond. When I think about the block hour total that you gave us for 2023 down 20%, assuming no additional deliveries, it seems like that's probably a pretty good steady state for the next few years. But I will say that, after 2023, as you stabilize the labor force that there's tremendous non capital upside, just an increased utilization back to getting the 175 fleet and the other CRJ dual class fleet back up into the high utilization numbers that we're accustomed to seeing back pre-pandemic. I think we've said even on the last call, when you don't hire pilots until 2021 and it roughly takes two years to get a lot of your FOs into an upgradable captain scenario, that's when it starts to \u00e2\u0080\u0093 given various levels of attrition, that's when it starts to turn around in 2023 organically."
