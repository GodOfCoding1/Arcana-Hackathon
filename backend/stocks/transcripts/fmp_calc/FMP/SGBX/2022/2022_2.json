    "content": " Despite being a small company now, we are targeting large verticals, commercial construction vertical is 90 billion market opportunity, global modular construction vertical is an $85 billion market opportunity, point-of-care diagnostic medicine in 2027, will reach $30 billion and the largest key vertical market multifamily Housing is expected to have 213 billion of investment in 2022 alone. For the Company, the benefit of gaining this experience in medical is that not only are they a much more diversified company than they weren't 2020, but they have successfully right size the revenue streams as COVID has abated and have become less resilient on COVID testing for revenue, while continuing to grow the construction segment leading to one of the strongest quarters yet. This quarter alone, we had 2.5 times the total revenue for the full-year of 2019, we fine tune our capital allocation strategy throughout COVID and created our development company, SG Development Corp to pursue further opportunities by creating residential units and projects and even neighborhoods. And in a way where we are not only going to get the revenue from the factory, but we are going to be vertically integrated where the client we are going to own, asset management fees project fees, developers fees, depreciation, income for rent, income from sale, income from refinance, every one of those ways, is a way to raise capital for our Company without issuing a single share."
