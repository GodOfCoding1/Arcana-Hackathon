    "content": " Good morning, and welcome to Biofrontera Inc.'s Third Quarter 2022 Financial Results and Business Update Conference Call. Total revenues for the first 9 months of 2022 were $18.5 million versus $14.9 million last year, representing an increase of $3.6 million or 24%. SG&A expenses decreased by $2.3 million or 8%, again reflecting a one-time legal settlement expense incurred in 2021, partially offset by higher business insurance and headcount costs as a result of resumed hiring in 2022. These results put us on track to achieve full year 2022 growth in total revenues of between 24% and 31%, inclusive of the typical seasonal strength in the first and fourth quarters. In Q4, we acquired a 7.45% equity ownership position in Biofrontera AG with a current market value of about $6.9 million, mostly through tendering shares of Biofrontera Inc., partly also with cash."
