    "content": " Excluding EVRYTHNG, non-GAAP operating expenses decreased 900,000 reflecting the cash costs associated with the separation agreement we entered into with our previous CEO and cash severance costs related to organizational changes we made in Q2 2021, which totaled 2.5 million, partially offset by higher cash compensation costs due to higher headcount and annual compensation adjustments. While we will constantly add new products to our product suite, we also realize there's value to selectively metering out access to our platform so that others can build their own products, because not only will metering out that access generate compounding revenue, it will further our goal of digitizing the world's products using our technology, allowing those digitized products to benefit from our Digimarc-built solutions at some point down the road. The conversations we mentioned in the last call that would begin in Q2 are helping raise awareness that beyond just providing a higher quality and quantity of recycling, and in addition to the novel, unmined dataset that will come from having, for the first time ever, actual versus survey post-purchase data, Digimarc Recycle adoption provides a content creation-free means of engaging consumers on a topic about which they and regulators care."
