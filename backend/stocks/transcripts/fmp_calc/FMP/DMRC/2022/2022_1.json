    "content": " First year commercial bookings were $3.8 million during the quarter, up 50% from Q1 2021. Excluding EVRYTHNG in the Piracy Intelligence business, first year commercial bookings increased $900,000 or 42% from Q1 last year. Revenue for the first quarter was $7.4 million, up 11% from $6.7 million in Q1 last year. Excluding the impact of EVRYTHNG, subscription revenue was lower by $300,000 due to $500,000 of upfront revenue recognition on a two-year contract in Q1 2021, partially offset by the impact of new customer contracts."
