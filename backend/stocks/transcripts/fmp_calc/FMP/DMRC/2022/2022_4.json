    "content": " On the commercial side, we closed on our acquisition of Everything, launched our first products, announced our first major value-added reseller or VAR, repeatedly and publicly proved our ability to make a real impact on the global plastic problem and signed a multiyear deal with Walmart for an exciting new use case, further strengthening our relationship with the world's largest retailer. On the channel sales side, by licensing Digimarc illuminate to a growing number of VARs, we not only gain quickly scalable and high-margin revenues as our buyers go to market with their own products and services built upon our world-leading product digitization platform, we also increased the amount of items that are digitized using our technology. We are building the product digitization market 1 product and 1 bar at a time, solving discrete problems while watching with growing excitement as visionary companies and industry observers begin to understand that by adopting multiple products built on a single platform, our customers can solve for today's and tomorrow's discrete problems while positioning themselves to finally achieve true digital transformation as their products are no longer stranded in the analog world. These additions were offset by $1.6 million of subscription revenue from piracy Intelligence recognized in Q4 last year, which included the $1 million sale of noncore patents versus there being no revenue in Q4 of this year. The first is its highly scalable and high-margin revenue, right, as our value-added resellers are out selling whatever products or services they built upon Illuminate, that's them doing all that work and as they need more capacity, they got to license more from us."
