Our strategy to build shareholder value is to commercialize Camelina as a platform crop to produce renewable products, including feedstock oils, renewable diesel in the near term, and to leverage our advances in crop development to launch elite Omega-3 Camelina and PHA camelina varieties, PHA bioplastics in the future. And good afternoon, everyone. In 2022, we will continue to focus on the following milestones \u2013 expanding our commercial activities targeting the renewable diesel market, continue to build our differentiated elite Camelina germplasm collection, executing on our 2022 field testing and seed scale up program, advancing the optimization of our PHA bioplastic trait, and progressing the commercial launch for Camelina DHA+ EPA Omega-3 oils. And when you look at this, I would say, demand for biofuel, obviously, traits that can impact oilseed yield, whether it's canola, Camelina or soybean or seed oil content, really, there's a potential for some value capture there."
