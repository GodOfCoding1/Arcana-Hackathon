Looking at adjusted EBITDA in Q2 of 2022, and non-GAAP measurements, which excludes expenses for non-cash share based compensation, and for non-reoccurring items, was a loss of $9.5 million, compared to loss of $6.4 million in second quarter of Q2 of 2021. And as we look ahead to the 300 million that you reiterated today, in the out years, Kobi how would you think about the number of customers you'd need in production to help get to that number, if that's something because you have a RFQ shortlist and so forth."
