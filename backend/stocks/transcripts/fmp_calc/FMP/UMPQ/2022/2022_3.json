    "content": " Loan balances grew $1.1 billion in the third quarter, representing a quarterly growth rate of 4.4% as new generation was diversified across portfolios, business lines and geographies. Deposit balances increased $685 million, representing a quarterly rate of 2.6%, while growth once again outpaced deposit balances -- increases. For the moving parts as compared to Q2, net interest income increased $39.4 million or 16%, representing the power of our interest-bearing cash, skipping bonds and water falling down in the loans in the last few quarters, combined with the recent Fed rate increases. Slide 15 highlights net interest income, noting the increase to $288 million in Q3 resulted from the recent rate increases, along with continued strong loan growth. Net interest income increased $39.5 million over Q2, given the higher rates and loan growth discussed previously. I will talk about CECL in the provision in detail here in a few minutes, but you will see here, we had a $27.6 million provision this quarter, again related to continued loan growth and slight deterioration in economic forecast variables. And the operator disclosure for the core banking segment back on page 34 in the appendix and also on page 24 of the release, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s great to see the operating PPNR increased 45% year-over-year and 31% from Q2, which is good to see the beneficial -- benefit of continued loan growth and rate increases. We have $397 million in total held-for-sale volume this quarter, down 31% from Q2 due entirely to lower activity with higher rates."
