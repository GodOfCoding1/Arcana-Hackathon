    "content": " For the variance between 2022 and 2021 fourth quarter EPS was minimal, the components shifted dramatically as higher interest rates and 16% loan growth during 2022 drove a 31% increase in net interest income, Q4 to Q4, leading to a 25% increase in pre-provision net revenue despite the dramatic decline in mortgage banking revenue. Our annualized net charge-off percentage to average loans and leases was 19 basis points in the quarter, up 8 basis points from the third quarter's level as net charge-off activity within the FinPac portfolio increased as expected. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. So it's in the run for this past year which you look ahead over first couple of quarters of '23, you will see an increase in tax rate right et cetera -- like sub generally in the first quarter, you see that, and then it tails off over the balance of the year, then the merit comes on in Q2, will also have the added benefit with the combination on the combined basis the cost saves by Q4 next year and that too it get something will provide much more updates on as we get to close, and for sure, with outpost close with outlooks on that front. Your line is open."
