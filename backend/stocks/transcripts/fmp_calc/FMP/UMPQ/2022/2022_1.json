    "content": " Non-PPP loan balances grew $630 million in the first quarter, representing a quarterly growth rate of 2.8%, and annual growth rate of 11%. While the IMO facilitated the completion of the post-closing organizational design and made progress on systems selections and cost savings realization plans during the quarter, Umpqua's bankers generated net loan and deposit growth and replenished pipelines for continued expansion. And non-interest income declined $2.7 million, reflecting lower home lending gain on sale revenue, along with the fair value adjustments driven by the significant bond market sell-off and higher yields, namely MSR and swap CVA gains, not fully offset by rate-driven fair value losses on bonds and loans held at fair value, as detailed later on the right side of Slide 30. Overall loans held for investment increased $423 million or 2% during the quarter, and again, this was net of the $208 million in PPP loan forgiveness, so net PPP we had $630 million or 3% in non-PPP loan growth. And four rows down is the change in fair value on loans carried at fair value, a loss of $21 million here in Q1, driven entirely by the bond market selloff and resulting significant increase in long-term yields this quarter. Net charge-offs for Q1 remain low at $5.5 million or 0.1% of loans, much lower than the models from last year's adjusted. The FinPac portfolio's ratio came in at 1.49%, notably below its historical 3% to 3.5% range for the third consecutive quarters still reflective of the higher levels of customer liquidity improving economies and the overall favorable impact of strategic credit tightening implemented last year. I'd much rather though that cash go into loans as we've talked about consistently over the last couple of quarters, and that's been $2.7 billion of non-PPP growth over the past year."
