    "content": " Loan balances grew $1.5 billion in the second quarter, representing a quarterly growth rate of 6.3% and annualized growth rate of 25%. At this point, market trends in our existing pipelines indicate continued loan growth into the second half of the year, but at likely slower pace than the second quarter's significant volume. For the moving parts as compared to Q1, net interest income increased $19.4 million or 8%, representing the power of our interest bearing cash, skipping bonds and water falling down into loans this quarter, combined with the recent Fed rate increases. This makes five quarters in a row of robust loan growth, and the total non-PPP growth over the past year was $3.6 billion or 17.3%. We had $577 million in total loans held for sale volume this quarter, down 11% from Q1, due entirely to lower activity with higher rates. Our servicing revenue is stable and for the change in MSR fair value the passage of time piece was stable, while the change due to valuation inputs was a gain of $10.9 million, due again to the increase in long-term interest rates in the quarter. The direct expense component of this was $13.2 million as noted on the right side of the page, representing 2.3% of production volume, up slightly in basis points from last few quarters with the lower volume. Moving on to Slide 27, our non-performing assets to total assets ratio of 0.15% was relatively steady with the prior quarter, and our classified loans to total loans ratio declined 0.75% after last quarter's modest increase. The FinPac portfolio's ratio came in at 1.47%, notably below its historical 3% to 3.5% range for the fourth consecutive quarter, still reflective of higher levels of customer liquidity and the impact of strategic credit tightening implemented last year.
