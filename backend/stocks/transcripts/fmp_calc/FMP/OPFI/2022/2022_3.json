    "content": " The key highlights year-over-year are: net originations increased by 11% to $183 million; ending receivables grew by 39% to $408 million; total revenue expanded by 35% to $124 million; marketing costs per new funded loan decreased by 26% to $188. Operating expenses, excluding interest expense, as well as add backs, and one-time items decreased to $43.1 million or 34.7% of total revenue from $44.2 million or 48.1% of total revenue in the prior year period. Before turning the call over to Pam, I want to reiterate our key message that despite macroeconomic pressures, the business has stabilized with higher quality loans to new and existing customers, lower early delinquency rates, and a portfolio that is becoming stronger as older vintage non-performing loan cycle out due to adjustments to the credit model. Turning now to our third quarter results, total revenue increased, 35.1% year-over-year to $124.2 million. We generated an 11% year-over-year increase in originations to $182.7 million, while lowering our marketing costs per new funded loan by 26.4% or $67 compared to the prior year period to $188. Turning to expenses, operating expenses for the third quarter excluding interest expense as well as add backs and onetime items decreased to $43.1 million or 34.7% of total revenue from $44.2 million or 48.1% of total revenue in the prior period. Adjusted EBITDA totaled $13.2 million for the third quarter, down from $31.8 million in the prior year quarter as higher revenues are more than offset by elevated net charge-offs, which was partially mitigated by lower operating expenses. To review we have guided total revenue to increase 20% to 25% year-over-year, operating expenses as a percentage of total revenue to be 43% to 47%, excluding interest expense, add-backs and onetime items and profitability on an adjusted basis to be breakeven or a modest net loss."
