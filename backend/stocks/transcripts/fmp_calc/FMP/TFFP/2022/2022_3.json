    "content": " This quarter, I would like to discuss how we're actively applying thin film freezing to real-world clinical practice that, in my view, will create significant value for patients, our internal pipeline partner programs and for our shareholders. After administration of TFF VORI, the patient's lung function is stabilized, and there was no need to modify the patient's current dose of tacrolimus, an outcome also consistent with the results seen in the first patient receiving TFF VORI. This quarter, Dr. Williams and his colleagues presented additional new research at this year's AAPS Lung 360 Meeting, highlighting thin film freezing applications across several commercial and development stage monoclonal antibodies, including anti-FRSV2 antibodies and anti-PD-1 antibodies, each of which represents multibillion-dollar markets."
