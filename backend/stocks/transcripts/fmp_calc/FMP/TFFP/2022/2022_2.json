    "content": " Dr. Williams and his team at the University of Texas at Austin just published another paper in the International Journal of Pharmaceutics, demonstrating that vaccines containing MF59 or AddaVax, which is a preclinical nano emulsion that has the same composition and droplet sizes, MF59 can be converted to dry powder form by Thin Film Freezing. One last example, data from Dr. Williams' labs of a recent preclinical study in a rat model using partner's material, show that it is feasible to induce specific mucosal and systemic antibody responses, following intranasal administration of a thin film freeze dried vaccine candidate."
