    "content": " In the Americas, revenue decreased 4%, with mid-single-digit growth in retail, offset by significant declines in our wholesale channel. Starting with accessories which are a key component of our growth strategy, Women's Accessories was the strongest performing category with sales in our retail channel up over 40% versus prior year. While we were pleased with the continued growth in our own retail channel across all three of our luxury houses, revenue in our wholesale channel declined significantly, which resulted in expense deleverage and a lower operating margin. Looking at revenue performance by brand, at Versace, revenue decreased 1% on a reported basis but increased 11% in constant currency compared to prior year. At Michael Kors, revenue decreased 7% on a reported basis and 4% in constant currency compared to the prior year, impacted by the decline in wholesale. Operating expense as a percent of revenue was 49.4% compared to 42.8% last year, reflecting several factors primarily driven by the Michael Kors brand. We currently expect fiscal '24 revenue of approximately $5.8 billion, a 4% increase versus fiscal '23, driven by continued growth in our own retail channels across all brands.
