    "content": " The first deal will include our purchase of Steuart Phase 1 and Steuart's purchase of 35% of our Maren and Dock 79 projects -- excuse me, 20%. On completion of these 3 aforementioned land development projects, plus the build-to-suit warehouse due to deliver shortly at Hollander, we'll add 1.8 million square feet of additional warehouse product to our industrial platform that when added to the assets in operation at Hollander Business Park and Cranberry will total over 2.2 million square feet. Hickory Creek's 294 apartment units remained above 95% occupancy for the third quarter, while our JV with St. Johns, that includes 72,080 square feet of single-story office and 27,950 square feet of retail, remains 48% leased and occupied at quarter's end. As of September 30, 5 projects, including Dock 79, Maren, Verge, Riverside, and Bryant Street, totaled 1,600 apartments in operation, which represents a 47% increase over the third quarter last year when we had 1,085 apartments in operation. FRP's share of the net operating income for these 5 projects was USD3.315 million for the third quarter of 2022 versus USD1.931 million in the third quarter of 2021, a 72% increase. So to summarize, relative to our current third-party joint ventures and mixed-use developments, Hickory Creek and Windlass notwithstanding, we are currently invested in 6 mixed-use multifamily retail projects, totaling 1,827 apartments and 126,000 square feet of retail. Finally, as a postscript to our third-party joint venture program, and as some additional commentary on John's opening remarks, with our newly penned agreement with the Steuart Investment Company and our existing partners of 10-plus years, MRP Realty, we have a generational opportunity to create a unique waterfront destination among multiple projects, all controlled by a single ownership group with freedom to pursue alternate development plans that individual developments cannot consider. Predevelopment activities on Phase 1 conceptually planned for 400-plus apartments and 10,000 square feet of retail located on 1 of the 4 parcels that Steuart brings to the venture has commenced, and we anticipate a shovel-ready project sometime in 2023."
