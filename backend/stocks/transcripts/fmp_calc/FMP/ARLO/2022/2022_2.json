Total paid accounts were up 113% year-over-year with Arlo adding 206,000 paid accounts in Q2, an increase of 41% year-over-year and flat sequentially as our migration to the new business model is complete in additions take on the normal seasonality of our sell-through with a 90-day lag for the three month free trial period. With continued strong ARR growth, service revenue reached $32.8 million, up 30% year-over-year and marked a record for the 12th consecutive quarter. Despite the additional complexities and expense driven by the pandemic supply chain disruptions, we posted our highest ever non-GAAP gross profit of $35.1 million and our third consecutive quarter of non-GAAP operating profit outperforming the high end of our guidance for non-GAAP EPS, which came in at a profit of $0.01 per share. We delivered strong Q2 2022 financial results that exceeded our guidance, growing our revenue by 20.7% year-over-year, while growing non-GAAP growth profits sequentially and year-over-year to a record for the Company of $35.1 million. Our financial performance for the quarter was once again underpinned by a successful shift to a services first business model, which helped drive our non-GAAP growth profit up by 27.7% year-over-year comfortably over indexing revenues growth. At the same time, even after investing $1.2 million on creating content for our upcoming awareness campaign, we were able to grow our year over year non-GAAP operating profit by $5.3 million and post our third consecutive quarter of non-GAAP operating profits. And now, moving on to the Q2 financial detail, revenue came in at a second fiscal quarter record of $119 million up 20.7% year over year and down 4.6% sequentially. Our service revenue for Q2 2022 was a record $32.8 million, up 9.6% sequentially 29.8% year over year, driven by our services first business model and the addition of 206,000 paid accounts in the quarter. Product revenue for Q2 2022 was $86.2 million, which was up 17.6% year-over-year and down 9.1% sequentially. Our non-GAAP growth profit for the second quarter of 2022 was up $7.6 million year-over-year and up $0.6 million sequentially to $35.1 million, which resulted in a non-GAAP gross margin of 29.5% up from both 27.9% in Q2 2021 and from 27.6% in Q1 2022. Total non-GAAP operating expenses was $34.1 million, up $0.6 million or 1.9% sequentially and up $2.3 million or 7.2% year-over-year as we invest in R&D ahead of our new products and service introductions and lay the groundwork for our upcoming awareness campaign, in which we invested a total of $1.2 million dollars during the second quarter. While revenue was up 21% year-over-year, our gross margin expanded by more, driving a 28% increase in gross profit while our operating expenses only grew 7% after investing more than $1 million in our awareness campaign. In Q2, we posted a non-GAAP net profit per diluted share of $0.04, much better than our guidance and $0.05 improvement year-over-year, driven by a combination of revenue growth and gross margin expansion. For the full year and up from previous guidance, we expect our revenue to be in the range of $500 million to $520 million, while we expect our non-GAAP operating loss will be in the range of $15 million to $25 million equivalent to break even non-GAAP operating profit for the year minus our planned awareness spending."
