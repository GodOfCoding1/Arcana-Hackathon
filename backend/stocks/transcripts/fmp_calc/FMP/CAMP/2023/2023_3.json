    "content": " As the quarter end, we have cumulatively converted approximately 75% of eligible customers to recurring contracts, and are on track to substantially complete the conversion process for remaining customers by fiscal yearend. Both the sequential and the year-over-year growth in the software and subscription services business reflect the progress we are making converting eligible telematics device customers two recurring subscription contracts, which have contributed approximately $20 million to revenues in the quarter. At the end of the third quarter, we've converted approximately 75% of our total eligible telematics device customers and anticipate to substantially convert the remaining customers by the end of our fiscal year. In terms of performance metrics for our software and subscription services business, remaining performance obligations in the third quarter was approximately $252 million, up 20% from the prior quarter, and up 72% from the same quarter a year ago. Telematics products revenue in the third quarter was $29.6 million, which represented a 5% increase sequentially, and an 8% decline year-over-year. I think what our investors have to look forward to is maybe slightly slower growth in 2024, in terms of absolute subscriber growth, but much higher growth in terms of ARPU, as we add more full stack solution customers, enterprise fleet, transportation logistics, what I'm excited about is when I talked to my sales leader, Brennan Carson, who's brought in a lot of domain expertise in terms of transportation, logistics, and enterprise fleet, why we're doing these conversions, we're building a really excellent pipeline for future growth, and those are at much higher ARPU."
