    "content": " Revenue in the quarter was $37 million, which was up 7% year-over-year, but down sequentially as expected due to completion of a major trailer retrofit program with our large package delivery customer last quarter. In terms of performance metrics for our Software and Subscription Services business annual recurring revenue for the trailing 12 months was $85.5 million, up slightly, both from $85.2 million in the third quarter of the prior year and from $85.1 million last quarter. Our largest customer represented $14.4 million in revenue for the quarter, which is up 3% sequentially from $14 million last quarter and down from $16.4 million in the same quarter a year ago, due primarily to supply constraints. So as long as we keep executing to drive the percentage of our Software and Subscription Services revenue higher and higher to hit that, well now probably more closer to 60% target, I think our margins will improve, but in the near term, there are some others uncertainties that we're dealing with and we'll be working through those over the next I think few quarters. And I think early on in the year, we maybe lack a little bit in terms of how we pass that on, but we've just gotten better at learning how to partner with customers to participate in those broker buys as needed and to pass through some of the price inflation that we're seeing, and it's still an ongoing discussion topic."
