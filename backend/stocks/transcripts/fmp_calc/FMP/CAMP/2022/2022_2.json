    "content": " We finished the second quarter with strong growth in our software and subscription services revenue, increasing 24% over the prior year period and representing 52% of our total consolidated revenue. Also, during the quarter, we continue to make progress, transitioning several customers to our new device management solution built on our CTC platform that I discussed on last quarter's call. It should be noted that the revenue contribution from our software and subscription services business may vary from quarter to quarter depending on the installation and activation of devices, as well as the timing and progress of our transition of customers to our CTC platform. In terms of performance metrics for our software and subscription services business, annual recurring revenue for the trailing 12 month was $85.1 million, down slightly from $85.5 million in the second quarter of the prior year and down from $87.6 million in the prior quarter. Telematics products revenue in the second quarter was down 8% year-over-year and 16% sequentially to $37.6 million, primarily due to the continuing constraints in the supply chain. So Mike, obviously, the revenue contribution from the software and subscription services, we do expect to be a little bit uneven quarter-to-quarter as we work through installation and activations of devices, which is impacted by the supply chain challenges. But again, our goal is really to focus on the software and subscription SaaS business model, driving the majority of our revenue to that particular category through converting our customers on PULS to CTC DM, as well as driving new logos around our applications. Currently, our margin for the second quarter was just over 42% depending on how things fluctuate in terms of our subscription revenue in Q3 and Q4, that could move up or down 100 to 150 basis points."
