    "content": " I think next quarter, our second quarter may be a little bit difficult for us to actually eat into that backlog, but we're optimistic, a lot of the orders that are coming in now are actually out for our Q4 and even into Q1 of next year. But we're doing everything possible, as Jeff mentioned, to execute on the demand that we have and we have faced that our supply chain team will be pretty innovative to make it happen, but it will take a couple of quarters for us to get alignment between supply and demand. So yes, I think it's going to get better and we still see a very strong year on the equipment side as we really help our customers manage through this 3G to 4G transition."
