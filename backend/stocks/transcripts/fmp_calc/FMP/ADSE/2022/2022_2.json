    "content": " The extension of our sales efforts in the second half of last year and the first half of this year resulted in 54% of our H1 2022 revenue coming from outside of Germany, including new business from Spain, UK, Switzerland and other European countries. Because of the reason we all know, we expect the gross margin to turn positive again, in the second half of the year, as I said, because we have just changed our supply chain, and changed also our way of, let's say, securing volumes for critical components."
