But I suppose, I should first say we don\u2019t really have like a good thumb rule for what the percentage of our costs that would be able to be passed through on a sort of Fortis wide basis because we have different regulatory constructs in our jurisdictions, everything from ITCs, which basically just a matter of timing, but we\u2019ll get \u2013 it can pass through all their costs at their full formula transmission rates to PBR methods that vary in the level of interest and how that\u2019s treated on the annual true-ups. And then maybe switching to Woodfibre, and there\u2019s a recent article around the second pipeline being proposed through a tunnel and there\u2019s some references to the costs going up by, I think, $300 million plus. Please proceed with your question. Please proceed with your question. Please proceed with your question. Please proceed with your question. Please proceed with your question. So it was only, I think, around 3% was the overall bill impact of the purchased power and fuel adjustment clause that we just got approved, and that\u2019s \u2013 that 3% was for historical costs that will be collected over the next 18 months.
