    "content": " Turning to Slide 5, the new 5-year capital plan reflects a CAD 2.3 billion increase compared to the prior plan, driven by growth at our utilities and a higher foreign exchange rate. At UNS Energy, investments of CAD 4.6 billion are planned over the next 5 years, including CAD 1.2 billion for renewable generation and storage to support Tucson Electric Power's integrated resource plan. And then turning to the comment about it's already in the plan an incremental CAD 1.2 billion of renewables and storage at TEP and it's part of the IRP, I assume you're implying then that you hope to put that in a rate base."
