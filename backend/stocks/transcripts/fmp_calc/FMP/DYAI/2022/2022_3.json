    "content": " Dr. Osterhaus presented preclinical safety and efficacy data from animal studies including cancers and non-human primates demonstrating C1 produced antigens and antibodies are as effective as those produced by common cell lines used for biologic vaccine and drug production platforms like CHO cells Mark will speak to this in greater detail a bit later, but in summary, the data supporting the overall safety profile of C1 cells as well as our ability to produce proteins that prevent and/or treat disease equivalent to if not better than the most commonly used cell lines in production today."
