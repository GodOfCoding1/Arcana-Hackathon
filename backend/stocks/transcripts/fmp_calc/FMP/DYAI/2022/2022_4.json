    "content": " The excitement in this segment is well founded and can be attributed to three key factors: first, due to shorter developmental timelines and approval processes products and opportunities within alternative proteins can be commercialized in less time; second, by focusing on products that have applicability across our core verticals such as recombinant serum albumin, we can reduce developmental costs, yet increase overall revenue potential for Dyadic; third, as there is overlap between the Company's operating and alternative proteins across our business verticals, penetrating this market does not require significant additional resources from Dyadic."
