    "content": " Adjusted contribution totaled $40 million, down 9.2% year-over-year and adjusted EBITDA was a loss of $6.1 million compared to a gain of $2.6 million in Q4 of last year. For the first quarter of 2023, we expect billings between $84 million and $93 million, revenue between $54 million and $63 million, adjusted contribution was between $26 million and $31 million and an adjusted EBITDA loss of between $10 million and $17 million. We're not providing formal guidance for the full year at this time, but as Karim mentioned earlier, we believe we will generate sufficient growth to reach positive free cash flow in Q3 of 2023 through product enhancements, optimizing our platform, growing our higher-margin Bridg business and lapping the loss of the significant customer. I just wanted to start off on the expenses, helpful color you guys gave with kind of roughly $42 million in cash expenses for 1Q, and then there's a couple of moving pieces you mentioned with the full kind of realization of some of those annualized cost savings partly offset by like some merit increases or timing of some of that. And that's where us becoming a much stronger product-led company with a modern Ad Server and the ability to be a lot smarter as to how we how we put this rewards to the right customers at the right time will make a vast difference to our business going forward, both in terms of the engagements that we will see from the ad, but also the revenue that we can derive from these rewards you know."
