    "content": " Shifting to our results on Slide 5, we generated $40.1 million in adjusted net income for the quarter or $0.40 per share up 111% from the prior fiscal year second quarter. For the quarter we generated fee related earnings of 26.4 million, pre-tax adjusted net income of 51.8 million, adjusted net income of 40.1 million and A&I per share of $0.40. Moving to the balance sheet on Slide 14, gross accrued carry continues to increase driven by strong underlying investment performance in the quarter at over 1.2 billion which was up 13% in the prior quarter and was 150% over the last 12 months despite an exceptional level of realizations over the last year. So look, the good news there is, really contribution to the undeployed fee-earning capital, across all four asset classes, across all three strategies and really, through a combination of re-ups expansion of existing client relationships, in whether across asset classes or strategies, as well as some new accounts, but just in order of magnitude and the larger drivers, and we've never provided an exact breakdown, but I'd say this quarter infrastructure and private equity, we're particularly strong contributors there."
