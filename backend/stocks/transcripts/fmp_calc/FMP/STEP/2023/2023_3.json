    "content": " Private market fundraising has averaged well over $1 trillion a year since 2016, which compares to an average of just over $500 billion in the 6 years prior, while unrealized private asset value stands at approximately $10 trillion or roughly double the value from just 3 years ago. For the quarter, we grew fee-earning assets by $3 billion, largely driven by healthy deployment across several SMAs, activations of our PE secondaries fund and our multi-strategy Global Venture Capital Fund as well as incremental closings in comingled funds and evergreen private wealth offerings. Please proceed with your question. Please proceed with your question. Please proceed with your question. Please proceed with your question. And so not to come back to secondaries again, but I think it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a pretty good example where today, when you look at how fundraising has evolved over the last several years and the resulting net asset value that is in the ground across each of the asset classes where we operate, something like 30% of the current private market NAV falls in the infrastructure, real estate and private credit asset classes today relative to private equity, yet when you look at the secondaries market within any of those asset classes, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s probably closer to depending on what sources you look at, probably under 15%. Please proceed with your question. Please proceed with your question."
