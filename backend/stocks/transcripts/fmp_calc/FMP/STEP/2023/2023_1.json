    "content": " Moving on to our first quarter results on slide 5, we generated $47 million in adjusted net income for the quarter or $0.41 per share which is the same as the prior fiscal year's first quarter. Looking over our trailing four quarters, we have generated $1.62 of adjusted net income per share which is up 45% from a year ago. Moving to growth by commercial structure, commingled funds contributed about $800 million of net fee-earning assets driven by final closings in our VE co-invest fund which raised a total of $2.4 billion; our VC secondaries fund which raised a total of $2.6 billion. Looking over the last 12 months and excluding the impact from acquisitions, we have organically grown fee-earning assets by over $14 billion or 27% which is generally consistent with the 30% organic CAGR since fiscal 2018. Slide 9 shows the evolution of our management and advisory fees, where we are generating nearly $3.80 per share in revenues over the last 12 months, representing an annual growth rate of 25% since fiscal 2018."
