    "content": " On an adjusted basis, our consolidated first quarter sales of $353 million, operating margin of 22% and EPS of $3.50 which was an 85% increase over last year\u2019s record first quarter EPS of $1.89, all outperformed expectations. While a terrific quarter for all the biggest contributor to our record earnings was the performance of our largest brand, Tommy Bahama, where sales grew 46% versus 2021 to $228 million and adjusted operating margin increased by nearly 1000 basis points to 23%. In the first quarter of fiscal 2022, consolidated net sales were $353 million, a 33% increase over last year\u2019s first quarter net sales of $266 million, which included $12 million of sales from Lanier Apparel. On the freight, second quarter might be a little bit of a headwind because we didn\u2019t have a lot in the second quarter last year, but in the third and fourth quarter, it is easing compared to the prior year. And then as far as SG&A, as a percent of sales, it\u2019ll probably level off or maybe be a little higher in the last three quarters than the prior year as a percent of sales, but we do expect robust growth, and we do have some inflationary pressures, particularly with things like labor, that we\u2019re combating that will \u2013 but and then, as Tom mentioned, gross margin wise, we think we\u2019ve gotten ahead of the input cost increases and should still have higher IMUs throughout the year. So, in Lilly Pulitzer, we are probably selling less leggings than we were last year, but more occasion dresses than we were last year, and that\u2019s actually good because it\u2019s moving the average unit retail up without really a price increase, but just the shift in the mix is helping drive a higher AUR, which is great to see."
