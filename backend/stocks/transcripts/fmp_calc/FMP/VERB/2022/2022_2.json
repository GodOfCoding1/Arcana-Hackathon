    "content": " I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d like to use our time together today to talk a bit about MARKET, our livestream social shopping platform and provide some initial reactions and data points around Shopfest, which was the 3-day livestream shopping festival we hosted a little over 2 weeks ago now that marked the hard launch of MARKET.live. SaaS recurring revenue, a component of total digital revenue, was $2 million, an increase of 23% over the same period last year. Cost of revenue was $0.8 million, down 25% from the same period last year, reflecting planned cost reductions and a continuing shift towards the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s digital business and away from the lower margin non-digital business. Total revenue was $5.1 million, up 3.5% from the same period last year, reflecting strong SaaS recurring revenue growth offset by the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s strategic decision to continue to wind down its lower margin non-digital business. Cost of revenue was $1.8 million, down 23% from the same period last year, reflecting planned cost reductions and a shift towards the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s digital business and away from the lower margin non-digital business. General and administrative expenses were $13.6 million, a decrease of 2% from the same period last year primarily due to the implementation of planned cost reductions offset by planned increases in labor costs due to the launch of MARKET."
