    "content": " I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d now like to turn the call over to our host, Mr. Jason VanWees. This is Jason VanWees, Vice Chairman of Teledyne and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d like to welcome everyone to Teledyne\u00e2\u0080\u0099s third quarter 2022 earnings release conference call. Joining me today are Teledyne\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Chairman, President and CEO, Robert Mehrabian; Senior Vice President and CFO, Sue Main; SVP, General Counsel, Chief Compliance Officer and Secretary, Melanie Cibik; and also Edwin Roks, Executive VP of Teledyne. Of course though, before we get started, attorneys have reminded me to tell you that all forward-looking statements made this morning are subject to various assumptions, risks and caveats as noted in the earnings release and our periodic SEC filings. In order to avoid potential selective disclosures, this call is simultaneously being webcast and a replay both via webcast and dial-in will be available for approximately 1 month. Despite the strong dollar, supply chain constraints and inflation, we achieved record third quarter sales, earnings, operating margin and free cash flow. Excluding foreign currency headwind, which negatively impacted third quarter sales growth by approximately 3% or $39 million, core growth in local currency would have been 6.9%. In addition, year-over-year reported sales increased in all segments despite the FX headwind. Non-GAAP earnings of $4.54, was a third quarter record and just shy of our all-time record. Overall, orders and demand remained strong, which is a testament to the strength of our balanced business portfolio. Total company book-to-bill was 1.06x and while orders remained reasonably healthy in our short-cycle commercial businesses that were particularly strong in our longer cycle government, marine and aviation businesses and quarter end external backlog of approximately $3.2 billion was also a record. Turning to our 2022 full year outlook, with our strong operating performance in the third quarter, we were able to increase our full year earnings outlook while derisking the prior heavily weighed Q4 forecast. On revenue, given our current exchange rate and the U.S. government\u00e2\u0080\u0099s continuing resolution as well as the evolving semiconductor and technology export controls, we are a bit cautious at this time and now project full year sales of roughly $5.45 billion. In the third quarter, we also took the opportunity to refocus Teledyne FLIR by eliminating some smaller money-losing products to help improve our margins. Finally, while supply chain constraints continue to limit shipments, we have seen a modest \u00e2\u0080\u0093 very modest improvement in recent weeks at least with regard to availability of certain printed circuit boards as well as electronic components. Starting with our Digital Imaging segment, third quarter sales increased 2.3% despite currency translation headwind of nearly 4%. GAAP segment operating margin was 17.2%, but adjusted for intangible asset amortization, segment margin was 22.9%, a 170 basis point improvement from the second quarter of this year. In our Instrumentation segment, overall third quarter sales increased 6.7% versus last year. Sales of electronic test and measurement systems, which include oscilloscopes, digitizers and protocol analyzers, remained strong and increased 9.7% year-over-year with growth in all major geographies and product categories. Sales of protocol analyzers across numerous industry standards such as Peripheral Component Interconnect Express or PCI Express, Universal Serial Bus or USB, and high-definition multimedia interface, HDMI, remains strong as well as sales of oscilloscopes and our unique crossing product, which combine oscilloscopes and protocol analyzers together. Sales of marine instrumentation increased 5.1% in the quarter, primarily due to new record sales of autonomous underwater vehicles for both defense and commercial oceanography applications. Overall, Instrumentation segment profit increased 12.9% in the third quarter with GAAP operating margin increasing 126 basis points to 23.2% and 83 basis points on a non-GAAP basis. Excluding intangible asset amortization, the margins increased to 24.5%. In the Aerospace and Defense Electronics segment, third quarter sales increased 4.8%, primarily driven by a 20.7% increase in sales of commercial aerospace products. GAAP segment operating profit increased 23.4%, with margin 349 basis points greater than last year. And finally, in our Engineered Systems segment, third quarter revenue increased 7.2% and operating profit also increased slightly. Over the last 18 months, we have endured the same challenges as most companies, that is record inflation, supply chain constraints and now strong U.S. dollar. At the same time, we completed the integration of Teledyne FLIR, our largest acquisition and then we rapidly deleveraged. While the operating environment remains challenging, we are glad to be back to doing what we do best, investing in our businesses to drive organic growth, being vigilant on costs and simplifying our operations to increase margins and finally, acquiring and integrating complementary businesses. In the third quarter, cash flow from operating activities was $268.9 million compared with cash flow of $192.8 million for the same period of 2021. In addition, non-cash inventory step-up expense for the third quarter of 2021 was $35.2 million with no comparable amount recorded in the third quarter of 2022. And for the full year 2022, our GAAP earnings per share outlook is $15.46 to $15.60, and on a non-GAAP basis, $17.70 to $17.80. Maybe just to start, Digital Imaging had a nice margin pickup and recovery from kind of H1. Well, let me start with expectations for the year and then see if I can answer the rest. Actually, if you look at the year, we have net pricing improvement across all of our businesses of about 3.6% of sales, but that includes Digital Imaging. On the other hand, we have also against that, we have inflation, Greg, and price increases in the products that we buy. So our net pricing increases have kind of offset the headwind that I have \u00e2\u0080\u0093 that we have from price increases to us, that is inflation. So that we have had a headwind there, I am going to say about 2%, about $50 million. So fundamentally, Digital Imaging has done well. They have improved their margins, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been a relatively tight year up to now. I mean it seems like you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re getting quite a few of contracts, some at FLIR, some in the broader business. I think the \u00e2\u0080\u0093 in general, what we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re finding is that in our Defense businesses, our book-to-bill has improved significantly. Now for the third quarter, actually, our government businesses were down slightly, but the book-to-bill, which is an important part for us, has improved both in FLIR, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s close to 1x, but in our Aerospace and Defense Electronics is closer to 1.5x and in Engineered Systems to 1.35x. The \u00e2\u0080\u0093 what we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re finding is that the demand for electronic components and systems, including parts that are going to Javelin and other weapons that are being depleted, those are coming back strong. We also have really good orders in systems that are being developed like a wide field of new tracking layer, which is for missile tracking basically. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve had orders \u00e2\u0080\u0093 good orders, and we will have programs of about 60 million over 2 years. And then just last one, kind of a clarification question. It started the year at about 1%, went to 2% in Q2, 3% in Q3, and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re estimating about 2% in Q4, for a total, Greg, of $110 million hit that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re taking to our revenue for the full year. So if we didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have this translation only, we would have revenues \u00e2\u0080\u0093 another $110 million in revenues. Last quarter, very modest cut, I think, took some people by surprise. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re kind of in the same zone at the end of the day, despite all of that. Because it was kind of like a lot of movement to get to the same place, I guess, at the end of the day. Well, when we started the last quarter, we weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t sure how much prices we could \u00e2\u0080\u0093 of our price increases would stick. And obviously, we were also concerned whether we could manage our margins that take cost out to improve our margins. All of those coupled with the fact that our commercial orders held up pretty well, like in the Imaging businesses, helped us along the way. So in a way, yes, we were looking at \u00e2\u0080\u0093 we weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t in trouble in any way. But as we took some cost out and increased prices, and we had good cash flow, by the way, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s given us a lot more confidence. I think when we spoke last quarter, your view for Digital Imaging margins was something like 22% ish for this quarter and then maybe 23% for next quarter. It looks like you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re 3 months ahead of that, so you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re at 23% now. I think overall in the fourth quarter \u00e2\u0080\u0093 well, let me go talk to the year, which is easier for me to do. For the year, we think we will be at 22.2%, which would be about 20 bps better than last year. So I think Q4 is going to be better about 22.9%, 22.7% of that range. Again, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m a little cautious here because there is some softness in the commercial market. But again, our Defense businesses are picking up. I mean I know it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s early and we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to talk about \u00e2\u0080\u009823, but I know that there was this bogey out there for a while now about the potential for you guys to do, give or take, around $1 billion of free cash flow in 2023. Let me say, I think $1 billion for \u00e2\u0080\u009823 is a little too high because we have capitalized R&D that we have to worry about. But having said that, if you look at the big picture, which is the way I approached this, we started the year \u00e2\u0080\u0093 we started after the FLIR acquisition with a net debt-to-EBITDA of 3.7x. By the end of the year, everything else going along, we will be down to 2.4x. If all goes well by the end of next year and then by the end of \u00e2\u0080\u009824, we will be down to 0.9x. At the same time, put us in a position where we can do something bigger if we want to later on. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s really, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a \u00e2\u0080\u0093 while we didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t disclose the terms, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s got about 112 employees. With this acquisition, now we can essentially supply a system of both tubes and power supplies. For example, in a given application, we were studying, we sell the tubes and they add up to about $300,000 for that application. When we put the power supply with the tubes together, we can sell it over $2 million. The second area is in our Medical field where we supply products that go into cancer therapy, radiotherapy, X-ray systems to kill cancer. And we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve added to that \u00e2\u0080\u0093 we seriously sell that for about $10,000. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve added to that more components, and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve gotten to where we sell about $40,000, $50,000 of products in a system. But again, what we didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have is the power supply, cooling system, the whole system that you can use in developing the high-energy X-rays. So what happens is a content that used to be $10,000, we have grown it to maybe $40,000, now can grow over $100,000 per radiotherapy system. It improved margins slightly, but more importantly, what we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re doing is we took the costs out by reducing the workforce. It was a product line, for example, that they bought just before our acquisition in December of 2020. It was a product where they were trying to produce basically commercial \u00e2\u0080\u0093 industrial, commercial UAVs, unsuccessful, difficult business to be in. We have \u00e2\u0080\u0093 in FLIR, we have really good products in the defense domain that we sell substantial amounts of. But to compete in the industrial domain, that was a product that we had to kill. And then if I could shift \u00e2\u0080\u0093 speak one more in, please. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not like you have four quarters of $60 million loss in sales that adds to $240 million, just $60 million. The next quarter, we ship what we couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t ship, then we get delayed again. So we may start the quarter looking, saying, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to hurt us by $100 million, but we recover from that, so it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a $60 million problem for us right now. The flipside, the first part of your question, we are seeing some improvement especially in the more simpler printed circuit board assemblies. For example, to sell our cameras from Teledyne, DALSA and e2v, we need about 1,000 circuit boards a day on occasion. Having said that, we still have really tight market for more complex systems like field-programmable gate arrays, which \u00e2\u0080\u0093 gate arrays, which are FPGAs. We have a very effective effort underway to combine all of our needs across Teledyne, prioritize them and give our priority numbers to our suppliers. Thank you very much. Robert, you alluded to the short-cycle business holding up reasonably well. In some of the products that we make, for example, that go into warehouses, as the demand is softening in that domain, then obviously, they don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t need as much of our products for automation and improvement of delivery of their products. On the other hand, we \u00e2\u0080\u0093 because we have such a broad portfolio of products that range from security to traffic to firefighting, not all of them are kind of getting impacted simultaneously. Now if you went outside Digital Imaging, for example, in our Instruments domain where we have environmental instruments, we have oscilloscopes, protocols, we have marine instruments, we have marine vehicles. So what happens is that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the thing that Jason and I always talk about is the breadth of our products and both in terms of who we supply to and what people buy our products for, but also the diversity of our \u00e2\u0080\u0093 geographic diversity of our products, where that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s protecting us. But overall, I think we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re doing okay. So everybody is looking in the rearview mirror, including us, and you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re seeing 52-week highs, right, in the back. It might be 9 months ago, nevertheless, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s there. If we go forward and things persist the way they are and people see lower numbers looking backwards, then I think we will have more opportunities. Right now, what our focus is to see if we can do more bolt-ons as we have done historically. When we acquired e2v in 2017, our ratio, net debt-to-EBITDA ratio went up almost to 3x. 2.5 years later or so, it came down to essentially zero. And we in the interim, made another $500 million of acquisitions during that period. So, the number I quoted for 2024 includes us being able to spend maybe $600 million of smaller acquisitions. As to the bigger acquisitions, I think we are waiting a little \u00e2\u0080\u0093 obviously, we have some things in mind, but we ought to wait a little bit before people\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u0093 people are not so effervescent about their evaluations. Right now, we still like our commercial businesses. But we are also seeing, as you saw, we also bought something at least a bolt-on in the defense domain, partially bolt-on \u00e2\u0080\u0093 partially defense in the bolt-on. But on the larger stuff, it would be either commercial or a mixture of the two, like FLIR was. FLIR was 60% commercial, 40% defense. And so we will look at that, whether it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 70%-30% or 60%-40%. Generally, I would say because of the breadth of the products, while there are some softness in some areas, just like our \u00e2\u0080\u0093 rest of our digital imaging, FLIR\u00e2\u0080\u0099s book-to-bill right now is close to 1x, 0.98x, which is in some ways better than DALSA, e2v. From \u00e2\u0080\u0093 because of the \u00e2\u0080\u0093 again, because of the breadth of the products that they have from tomography instruments to infrared detectors to maritime systems, security, traffic, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think we are going to get hit on all of those all at once, and we are not. The only problem that we have at FLIR, if I may call it that, is that historically, their revenues have been more skewed to the end of the quarter rather than evenly paced during the quarter like the rest of our digital imaging is. So, the only risk there is you get closer to the end of the quarter and something unforeseen happens. It will take us \u00e2\u0080\u0093 we have the same problem in every acquisition we have made, large acquisitions, whether it was DALSA or e2v or others. Having said that, coming back to margins, I think margins are settling in. They \u00e2\u0080\u0093 from a non-GAAP perspective, while there has been some volatility, as you appropriately noted, I think will settle by the end of the year, we will settle to about overall in digital imaging to 22.2%. We are looking forward to really \u00e2\u0080\u0093 last year was an odd year because we bought FLIR in the middle of the second quarter, and we essentially shipped 12 weeks of product with 8 weeks of cost. Again, because of that, end of the quarter shipment that I mentioned. Obviously, we have been hesitant to talk about it, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to be probably in our Q anyways in a few days, maybe later on. The reason I am a little hesitant about the sales, which are about $50 million, is that they also buy products from us. Could be accretive $0.02, $0.03, $0.04, if we say the cost of borrowing is 4%, 5%. On the other hand, our cost of borrowing is not 4%, 5% because our average cost of borrowing with our fixed borrowing and cash is more like 2%. So, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to be accretive, revenue a little shy around $50 million, with some pass-through of our own products. Robert, on the supply chain, it really sounds like it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s starting to ease for you and your mitigating actions have been paying off. Last quarter, you had mentioned that the 800 of 900 missing components were resolved. But we started the year, this year, Kristine, by having about 36% of our missing components. Of course, the components were a lower number when we started the year. But the missing percentage has gone down to about 6%, 7%. The flip side is that of the 1,100 components, where we are missing maybe 65 or as I said, 60 open parts, the delay in those are kind of getting longer. And the demand on us is, okay, we are going to allocate so many to you, and you will get it next April. So, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s getting better, but still a challenge. And then in terms of \u00e2\u0080\u0093 maybe back to digital imaging, you had mentioned a return to portfolio simplification activities. No, we are \u00e2\u0080\u0093 in all of our products, I know in all of our businesses, we do 80-20, which means we take some products that are unique and they don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t make money. Back to your comment on the supply chain, you mentioned that for some of the missing items, the lead times are getting longer. In some of the discrete components like using commercial domain, things are okay. On the other hand, in some of the memory stuff it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u0093 the length is getting longer. If you look at memory devices, lead times are getting lower. On the other hand, if you look at more complex devices, like microcontrollers, processors, the lead times are still 4 weeks to 60 weeks. So, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s kind of a mixture and depends on what device we are looking for. For the simpler components and as I have said, printed circuit boards, we are making some real improvements there, and we feel very good about that. Thank you very much. Robert, I just wanted to go back to your commentary around the bid-ask spread in the M&A process. And the reason for that is private entrepreneurs are looking at things \u00e2\u0080\u0093 they are looking at the world, Noah, the way it is evolving, right. So, entrepreneurs that have built a business like the one we just bought, that \u00e2\u0080\u0093 those people have been in business since 1973, they are becoming more reasonable because they see things are not going to get better in the short-term. So, on the smaller deals like that, I think you are right. Having said that, on the bigger deals and public companies, they are still seeing 52-week highs in the background. Until we get beyond that, which is going to be another six months, four months, where people are not looking at, look my high was $500. And I am now trading at $350, they look in the mirror and say, well, my high was more like $400 and now we are at $350. Some businesses, we have a hard time increasing prices because of the programs that we have, long-term programs. In digital imaging, DALSA, e2v, for example, we have been able to increase prices about 4.7%. In marine, where we supply unmanned vehicle, but also a lot of connectivity products for oil and gas, we have also been able to increase prices about 4.7%. On the other hand, in some of our defense products, we have hardly cracked price or gotten about 1% or 2%. Having said that, on the average across the company, our price increases have been about 3.6% year-to-date. And against that, we have wage increases that are 4%. And then products, material that we buy that have been about 3.4%. Where we hurt is, of course, we are spending $50-plus million extra on getting our scarce products. So, I think over time, that will go away too. Just really, there was just an Altavian product that they bought in December of 2020, about four months, five months before we bought them. And it was \u00e2\u0080\u0093 I think it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s basically an industrial, commercial drone business, not in a very difficult market. Me on that domain, I would rather buy the truck and put in our very really advanced imaging systems on somebody else\u00e2\u0080\u0099s truck. Thank you very much. We would \u00e2\u0080\u0093 if you would be kind enough operator, I am going to ask Jason to conclude our conference call, and then we will stop. Brad, if you could give the replay information at the end of the call that would be great. And if you have follow-up questions, certainly do feel free to call me as well. Ladies and gentlemen, the call will be available for replay after 10 o\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock Pacific Time today and running through November 6th at midnight."
