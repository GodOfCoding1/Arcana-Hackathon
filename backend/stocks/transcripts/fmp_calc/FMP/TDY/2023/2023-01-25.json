    "content": " Our earnings outlook approximately 50 basis points of margin improvement in 2023 and we currently think instrumentation and digital imaging will be above-average contributors to this, while margins at Aerospace and Defense Electronics may be flat or declined slightly, given especially tough comps as a greater mix in 2023 of Defense Electronics relative to commercial aerospace aftermarket sales. GAAP segment operating margin was 18.8% and adjusted for intangible asset amortization only, segment margin was 23.8%, approximately 50 basis points greater than the fourth quarter of last year. In our Instrumentation segment, overall fourth quarter sales increased 7.9% versus last year, despite approximately 2.4% of FX translation headwind. Sales of electronic test and measurement systems, which include oscilloscopes, digitizers and protocol analyzers increased 3.8% year-over-year despite a tough comparison with the fourth quarter of last year's. Overall, Instrumentation segment operating profit increased 18.4% in the fourth quarter with GAAP operating margin increasing 215 basis points to 24.2% and 162 basis points on a non-GAAP basis excluding intangible asset amortization, which brought the non-GAAP margins to 25.3%."
