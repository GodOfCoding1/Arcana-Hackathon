    "content": " Free cash flow for the quarter was $550 million, an increase of $956 million as compared to prior year and moves our year-to-date free cash flow to $650 million or $150 million above our full year guidance. And I think if you look at the kind of quarter-over-quarter, there's some pretty good structural improvements around bringing down the restructuring and TSI cost is about $195 million, dealing with the interest that we dealt with last quarter when we refinanced our debt, that's about $70 million or so. I just think you'll see a greater and greater focus over time as we look at specifically the GIS layers of the stack and making sure we're being thoughtful with the kind of the CapEx upfront, the returns that we expect and the timing of cash flow. So when you think about our payments sitting at $180 million this quarter, going down to $140 million next quarter, I think that's just more cash we're going to keep at the end of the day."
