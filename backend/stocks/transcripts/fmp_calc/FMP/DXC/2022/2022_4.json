    "content": " Let's think about our business optimization in 2 parts: first, improving disciplined execution with a focus on driving higher-quality revenues; and second, optimizing costs that will allow us to expand margins. So if you look at what we've delivered on Page 5 over the past 12 months, you look at the 620 basis point improvement in organic revenue, you look at the 230 basis point improvement in adjusted EBIT, you look at what we've done in free cash flow, we basically have to deliver the same results over the next 24 months. So the first thing is now that we've got control of this business, and you've seen the progress we've made in '22, now it's our turn to really sort out businesses that will literally get us to high value."
