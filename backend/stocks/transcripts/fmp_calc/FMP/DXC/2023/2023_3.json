    "content": " Our clear execution of our transformation journey has built a quality company that you can depend on to deliver revenue that is not declining, change the mix of the revenue to the higher-value tech offerings of GBS, expand both margins and EPS, win new work in the market as our offerings are relevant and in demand, generate strong free cash flow, manage our debt and return cash to shareholders. With the momentum that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve created in the business, we have confidence that we are poised to deliver the business we had envisioned in FY2024, as we can see the ability to drive revenue flat to 1% growth, expand both margins and EPS, rotate the revenue to the new tech of GBS and generate increased free cash flow. Your line is open. And then just to clarify on the last point you made there after capital leases, it sounds like the real net free cash flow difference in your fiscal 2024 post capital lease payments is about $100 million, given you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve taken the number down. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open."
