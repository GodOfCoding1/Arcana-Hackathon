    "content": " Specific to Q2 compared to the prior year quarter, FX impacted revenue $300 million, adjusted EBIT margin by almost 30 basis points, EPS by $0.10, free cash flow by approximately $30 million. These are folks that are going to be out there, they're going to know, let's take my example that I gave the automotive industry incredibly well, or you can take Ray, for instance, Ray August who leads our insurance business, these folks know, senior people all across the industry. You had those 2 numbers up, that's $643 million plus what we've already done, and you're roughly around $650 million. I mean you came in at the upper end of your range in 2Q and down 1.5% on an organic basis, as you highlighted, one of the best results you've had over the last few years but left you that revenue outlook impact for 3Q. Look, that business is testing our patience -- testing my patience because it doesn't go unnoticed that, without modern workplace, we would have grown 1% in organic revenue this quarter, which a lot of people want to know how we're going to get to our FY '24 target, that's right at the low end of our FY '24 targets."
