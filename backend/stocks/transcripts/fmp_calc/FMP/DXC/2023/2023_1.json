I hope people have taken to heart, everything else we've done right in terms of the quality of company, whether it's the debt, the capital allocation, whether it's the improved governance score, and then I continue to look at consistently growing GBS when a lot of other folks are struggling in that area is a good shining star.

Look just taking the or narrowing the decline of GIS by 80 basis points, you're starting to see it's heading in the right direction because we literally have stacked up the last three quarters of minus 8, minus 8.3, minus 8."
