    "content": " In the bottom section of Slide 3, you can see the significant yield spread tightening that occurred across Agency MBS coupons in the fourth quarter, which caused MBS prices to rise, even though long-term interest rates were actually moderately higher. During the fourth quarter, tighter Agency RMBS yield spreads and increased pay-ups drove significant net realized and unrealized gains on our specified pools, which combined with net interest income exceeded net realized and unrealized losses on our interest rate hedges. The first thing I think you'd see is that, if you got mortgage rates, let's say, to 5.25%, and all of a sudden, people with four, 4.5, 4.75 note rates, they're going to be more willing to do cash out refinance. I guess, kind of where we see the most value now is like a sweet spot, like it's coupons that are high enough where you're getting enough coupon that you're sort of like going to be close or getting close to your financing costs, but aren't so high that a little bit of drop in mortgage rates, you can see a big pickup in speeds. And if I could just add, if you look at our net interest margin, and you leverage that given you can look at our debt to equity, you can look at our net mortgage exposure, which we dial up and down, you can see that the dividend should be well covered from that perspective, especially given where short-term rates are, because that's a tailwind as well."
