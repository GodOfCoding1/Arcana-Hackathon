    "content": " So while this is an enormous move for today, at least what implied volatility is telling you that having seen a little bit of inflation seem to respond to the progressive hiking cycle of the Fed is, sort of, implied all saying that, that's going to usher in maybe less volatility going forward that you don't -- if you start to see economic numbers that are reflective of what the Fed has done, and I think the big comment in Powell's last statement that the market picked up on was this notion of long and variable lag. So just with that said, I think that if you get more good news on inflation, and it looks like the Fed is near the end of their hiking cycle, I think what you'll see is we have comments with a lot of our clients at Ellington, not having to do with the public companies, our perception is that there is a lot of capital that is getting interested in fixed income and getting into credit and has been waiting, because the market has been too volatile and they want to see how far the Fed goes and they want to see -- because this year, it's basically been a year of the market inflation numbers being running generally higher than predictions."
