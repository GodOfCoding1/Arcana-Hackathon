    "content": " For the first quarter, EARN generated a net loss of $1.33 per share on a fully mark-to-market basis, as you can see on Slide 4. And I think if you get it right, there's a lot of excess return that is built into the price of some of these discounted MBS that isn't all -- isn't 100% captured to the model, and you're dealing with a market that has caused so much red ink out there that it's not fully priced in it."
