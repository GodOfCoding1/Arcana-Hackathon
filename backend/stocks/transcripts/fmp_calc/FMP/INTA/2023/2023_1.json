    "content": " We signed a new partnership with Equilar, which enhances our relationship intelligence capabilities across industries by letting our clients access Equilar's database of more than 1.5 million executives and board members directly within Intapp solutions. SaaS and support revenue was $56.8 million, up 31% year-over-year, reflecting both new sales, new clients, and upsells and cross-sells to existing clients of Intapp's purpose-built cloud solutions. Total revenue was $79.5 million, up 28% year-over-year, driven primarily by continued strong sales in our cloud solutions, as well as by solid growth in professional services revenue. Subscription license revenue was $12.2 million, compared to a $10.6 million in the prior year period, primarily reflecting several clients resumption of annual renewals after a period of multi year contract terms. Non GAAP sales and marketing expense was $24.1 million, a $6.2 million increase year-over-year as a function of increased headcount and related sales commissions to capture new business in our growing markets, along with the previously mentioned organizational realignment.
