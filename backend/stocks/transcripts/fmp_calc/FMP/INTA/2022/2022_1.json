    "content": " In contrast, we built our platform by working with these firms for over 20 years to develop specific, knowledge-based use cases in each area of expertise: areas like fund formation, M&A transactions, corporate finance, private credit, restructuring deals, intellectual property protection and litigation and real estate as well as the very complex compliance and conflict issues that arise for the global multi-strategy firms who participate across these regulated areas of the financial and commercial economy. Using our applied AI, including our recent relationship intelligence release, our cloud platform can serve up data and predictive information about relationships, deals, counter-parties, clients, matters, engagements and opportunities, accelerating the firm's ability to select and onboard new business in a compliant way and to deliver value throughout the relationship and project life cycles. Total revenue was $62.2 million, up 29% year-over-year, driven primarily by increased sales of our cloud solutions as well as by solid growth in professional services revenue. SaaS and support revenue was $43.5 million, up 31% year-over-year, reflecting the ongoing trend of adopting cloud solutions in our marketplace and specifically the sale of Intapp's purpose-built solutions for those professionals. No, I think we do tend to add on balance more new clients in financial services than in professional services where there's a little bit more new logo sales in finance services and a little bit more upsell in the professional services firms we've done business with for many, many years. No, I think that's right. No, I think that's right. We're actually doing some good business with people who are starting new firms, who have been using our platform now at some of the larger organizations and know that it's the right answer for their style of firm."
