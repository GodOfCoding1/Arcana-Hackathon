    "content": " Intapp's cloud solutions are purpose-built to help the professionals in these firms to build and cultivate their own area of expertise, to harness institutional knowledge across their firm, to find and win the right opportunities in the marketplace, to make better decisions using market data and to deliver better outcomes for their own investors and their clients. Q3 was another strong quarter for Intapp as follows: SaaS and support revenue was $49.8 million, up 35% year-over-year, reflecting both new sales to new clients and upsells and cross-sells to existing clients of Intapp's purpose-built cloud solutions. Total revenue was $69.7 million, up 25% year-over-year, driven primarily by continued strong sales of our cloud solutions as well as by solid growth in professional services revenue. Your line is open. And we've talked before about some of the kind of uneven revenue you see from things like our subscription license business and we're starting to come to the end of some of the impact of that, that you would see, given all the cloud growth we've had over the last few quarters. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open."
