    "content": " During the third quarter, we invested $43 million to drill 11 wells and increased our oil and gas production by 8% compared to the same quarter last year. We're planning to drill 50 to 55 wells with approximately 10 to 15 exploration and appraisal wells for a total CapEx program of $200 million to $220 million, with 35% of these CapEx allocated to exploration. So I don't know, Martin, if you want to give the details on which ones they are, but --\n So Phil, this is Martin, out of the eight rigs that we have drilling, we're drilling about half of those are drilling exploration wells, in Llanos 6 exploration asset that we call it. When we move to Oriente in Ecuador in the Espejo block, we're testing right now and completing -- doing completion tests on the Pashuri well that we announced that we reach PV and well at the same time the rig  is drilling the Caracara well, so that one in the order of around 30 to 40 more days and the non-operated we're testing the Humea well in Llanos 94."
