    "content": " In terms of operations and our base business performance during the second quarter, we drilled 9 wells and increased production to an average of almost 39,000 barrels a day, a 14% increase over the second quarter last year. So is the reform goes forward in the same fashion as one has happened in Colombia in the past, then the expectation would be that the non-deductibility is applied for the 2023 tax, which is payable in 2021 is 8%; that's 100% of the royalty. The bucket of the things that were fully licensed, some of those include basically channel 34 and 32, which is maybe development but some appraisal -- then we move to the fully licensed that is mainly exploration, and that's where CPO-5 is Janus that we will be drilling our first wells soon in the next couple of months and Channels 94, all fully licensed."
