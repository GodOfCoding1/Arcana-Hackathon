    "content": " During 2022, GeoPark completed its Work Program with 50 wells drilled for a total CapEx of nearly $170 million, mainly targeted to grow production in its most profitable assets, 2% production growth in Llanos 34 and 50% growth in CPO-5. With this investment and work program, as well as our team's ability to maintain costs in line despite global inflationary pressures, GeoPark closed a record year, with revenues over $1 billion, adjusted EBITDA over $540 million and bottom line net profit of over $224 million, equivalent to $3.80 per share. With 2023 underway, we are embarked on another ambitious work program planning to invest $200 million to $220 million to drill 50 to 55 wells, 10 to 15 of which are low risk, high potential appraisal and exploration wells. As you well mentioned, it's $6.85 below Brent today, averaging about $8 below Brent year-to-date versus levels of about 5.5% during 2022."
