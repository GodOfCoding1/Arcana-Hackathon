    "content": " We have also formalized a partnership in which SABESP will hold a 45% stake in the SP  SA, a paving company with the objective of setting up a plant for producing and selling cold asphalt with a total investment of R$40 million by 2023, allowing SABESP to use the material in our asphalt recomposition services. On Slide number 4, sanitation service revenues net of taxes increased by 16.9% in the period from R$3.9 billion in Q3 2021 to R$4.6 billion in Q3 2022, due to an improvement in mix and to a tariff readjustment of 12.8%, which has been in place since May 10, 2022. Starting from a profit of R$469 million in Q3 2021, we saw a positive variation in sanitation revenues net of taxes of R$670 million, with a more favorable mix and effect of the full application of the 12.8% tariff adjustments. On compared to the same period of last year, costs and expenses have increased by 30.6% excluding construction costs, moving from R$2.8 billion in Q3 2021 to R$3.2 billion in Q3 2022, still under the impact of accumulated inflation in the period. We see an improvement in the financial result of R$639 million, mainly driven by monetary and foreign exchange rate variations that went from a negative situation of R$313 million in Q3 2021 to a positive variation of R$348 million in Q3 2022, given the recognition of R$325 million for the monetary adjustment on the 215 agreement with the state government of S\u00c3\u00a3o Paulo as a result of the aforementioned core decision, which happened in July."
