    "content": " These cells have shown promise as a monotherapy as well as in combination with approved anti-PD-1 KEYTRUDA or OPDIVO in clinical trials, and these are trials in patients that are heavily pretreated with solid tumor cancers. At MiNK, we'll focus our internal efforts on deepening our data sets and select solid tumor cancer indications where iNKTs can complement available and approved standard-of-care and we believe expands the benefit of available therapies to patients with specific tumor types and will further elucidate our development plans with the data release at the upcoming AACR conference. I think importantly, one thing that is commonly observed in patients who are PD-1 refractory is the exhausted CD8+ T cells for those cells that actually cannot enter the trauma and do the past November, we presented data demonstrating that our iNKTs can actually reverse the CD8 exhaustion signature and also kill M2 suppressive immuno-suppressive macrophages."
