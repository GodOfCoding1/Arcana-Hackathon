    "content": " MiNK Therapeutics was launched as an IPO just about 10 months ago and today, we stand as the most advanced company pioneering, allogeneic or off-the-shelf in invariant natural killer T cells or iNKT cells in three active clinical programs. In our earliest patients treated, we reported lengthy disease stabilization beyond 10 months and suppression of tumor biomarkers in our first treated patient, a 50-year-old male was treated with 100 million cells per dose and experienced a rapid reduction in M-spike protein, a greater than 50% reduction in tumor cells in the bone marrow and disease stabilization exceeding 10 months. Great, thank you so much. So we -- graft versus host disease, that's a beneficial profile, side effect really of these cells as it actually mitigates graft versus host -- and I think, Jack, we've shared with you and we could make public, certainly some public presentations and publications of our team and our advisory team members' results of the mechanism as to why these cells may mitigate graft versus host. Great, thank you so much."
