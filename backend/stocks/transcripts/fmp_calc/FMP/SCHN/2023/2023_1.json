    "content": " Average net selling prices for non-ferrous shipments in the first quarter declined 14% sequentially, reflecting full the decline in market selling prices that occurred over the summer while the prior quarter had benefited from forward sales made at higher prices. We expect our ferrous volumes to be up approximately 35% sequentially, driven primarily by the resumption of full operations at our Everett and Oakland facilities at the completion of the shipments that were delayed at the end of the first quarter."
