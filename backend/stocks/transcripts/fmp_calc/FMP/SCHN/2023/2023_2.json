    "content": " During our second quarter, we successfully implemented initiatives targeting a reduction of SG&A expense by approximately $20 million annually, which we announced in January, focused on a combination of reduction in force, lower professional and outside services, decreased lease costs and reductions in other discretionary expenses. This increase was driven by three factors: first, over 100,000 tons associated with the resumption of full operations in Everett and Oakland; second, the delivery of several bulk cargoes delayed at the end of the prior quarter, carrying approximately 100,000 tons; and third, a drawdown of ferrous inventories at other facilities into normal ranges to meet strengthening demand. The share of export sales of non-ferrous was 54% in the second quarter, down sequentially from 60% due to increased shipments into the domestic markets of furnace-ready products recovered by our non-ferrous systems. First, metal spreads for ferrous and non-ferrous recycled metal are anticipated to expand as our contracted shipments for delivery in the third quarter fully reflect the increase in market prices that occurred earlier in the calendar year."
