    "content": " Our first quarter results benefited from the strong global demand for recycled metals, a robust West Coast market for finished steel products, and average selling prices for ferrous, nonferrous and finished steel products at or near multi-year highs. The improved performance was driven primarily by higher average selling prices, increased sales volumes for ferrous and nonferrous, productivity improvements, initial contributions from Columbus Recycling and a higher contribution from our steel mill, including $3 million of insurance recoveries recognized in the first quarter."
