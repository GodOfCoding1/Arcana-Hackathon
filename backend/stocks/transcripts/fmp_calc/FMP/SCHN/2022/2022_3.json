    "content": " The structural trends underpinning higher demand for recycled metals and low-carbon finished steel include among other things, significant growth in EAF production, which uses recycled metals as its primary raw material; decarbonization trends, which are driving the increased use of recycled metals by BOS; and in many other manufacturing production processes; the effects of years of underinvestment in industrial metals and mining, which have created structural shortages in metals like copper; the transition to low-carbon technologies which are more metal-intensive than the technologies they're replacing; and the U.S. Infrastructure Bill, which is expected to materially increase demand for finished steel and recycled ferrous and non-ferrous metal."
