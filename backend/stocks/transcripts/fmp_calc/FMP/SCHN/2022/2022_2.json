    "content": " Our second quarter results benefited from strong global demand for recycled metals, with average selling prices for ferrous, non-ferrous and finished steel products at or near all-time highs. On a year-over-year basis, this result was higher by $4 million and was driven primarily by increased sales volumes for ferrous and non-ferrous, higher selling prices for recycled metals and finished steel and recognition of insurance recoveries. Our product mix was highly diversified with sales of aluminum representing 29% of our non-ferrous volumes; zorba, 22%; copper, 16%; twitch, 14%; and others making up the balance of 19%, including stainless, zurik and lead."
