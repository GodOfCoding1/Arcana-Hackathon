    "content": " Operating cash flow in the fourth quarter was strongly positive at $180 million, driven by profitability and a significant reduction in working capital, including from the lower price environment and the reduction in inventories due to the four bulk shipments delayed from the prior quarter. We anticipate the compression of margin resulting from these two items together with the impact of tighter scrap flows will substantially offset the sequential improvement from average inventory accounting, which is projected to be a detriment of approximately $5 per ferrous ton in the first quarter, compared to a detriment of $23 per ferrous ton in the prior quarter, and the partial benefits of our new productivity initiatives."
