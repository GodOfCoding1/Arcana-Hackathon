But in general, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve heard from them, obviously equally on their call last week that they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve had a tight labor market and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sort of affected what they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve done from a patient perspective, but we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve heard equally from other of our customers that, that patients are looking at treatments and the treatment costs as you know, some of these depending what their payment plans, what their insurance plans are, they have copays and things like that."
