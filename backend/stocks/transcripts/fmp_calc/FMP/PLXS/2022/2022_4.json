    "content": " Our fiscal fourth-quarter revenue of $1.12 billion, representing year-over-year growth of 33% and GAAP EPS of $1.78 significantly exceeded our guidance. As a result of our strong performance in fiscal 2022, our 5-year compounded annual revenue growth rate now stands at an industry-leading 9%, consistent with our 9% to 12% goal. While considering the ongoing supply chain challenges and macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainty, our revenue guidance reflects the benefit from continuing new program ramps, significant unfulfilled backlog, robust customer demand, and our participation in numerous secular growth markets, including warehouse and factory automation, vehicle electrification, commercial space and robotic-assisted surgery. With $1 billion in wins and revenue growth of 13% in fiscal 2022, our wins momentum, which is defined as the trailing 4 quarter wins divided by the trailing 4 quarters of revenue finished at 26%. As we look to the fiscal first quarter, our supply chain efforts in fiscal 2022 are enabling us to fulfill robust customer demand, yet we still have orders in excess of $100 million that we do not anticipate being able to satisfy within the fiscal first quarter. Sequentially, inventory days improved by 16%, while still driving inventory purchases to support new program ramps, further success in clearing constrained components allowed for robust growth in fiscal fourth quarter shipments. With modest working capital investments, coupled with capital expenditures to support anticipated fiscal 2023 revenue growth, we expect the usage of cash for the fiscal first quarter."
