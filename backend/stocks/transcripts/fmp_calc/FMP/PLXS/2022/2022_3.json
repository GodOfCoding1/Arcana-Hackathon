    "content": " For the quarter, we achieved record revenue of $981 million, a result that exceeded our guidance range of $885 million to $925 million and represented 21% year-over-year growth. With trailing four-quarter wins holding in excess of $1 billion in sustained strength in the funnel, we are well-positioned for future revenue growth in support of our 9% to 12% annual goal. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re guiding fiscal fourth quarter revenue of $980 million to $1.02 billion, which reflects the success of ongoing new program ramps and customer demand that continues to substantially outpace supply. Incremental investments to support robust customer growth projections, supply chain and other inflationary pressures and increased incentive compensation expense are modestly burdening GAAP operating margin, resulting in a fiscal fourth quarter forecast of 4.7% to 5.2%. Achieving this result would mean the sector sequentially grew all four quarters in fiscal 2022, and they would finish the fiscal year with an outstanding revenue growth in the range of 15%. We won 47 new manufacturing programs, mostly from existing customers during the fiscal third quarter that we expect to generate $201 million in annualized revenue when fully ramped into production. In the first half of fiscal 2022, we highlighted that we had an organization that was built to support at least $1 billion in quarterly revenue with a greater than 5% GAAP operating margin. As anticipated for the fiscal third quarter, we made investments in working capital to support our customers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 strong demand and as a result of the continued supply chain constraints. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open."
