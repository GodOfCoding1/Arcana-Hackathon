    "content": " We are guiding fiscal second quarter revenue of $1.02 billion to $1.07 billion, GAAP operating margin of 4.5% to 5%, inclusive of approximately 60 basis points of stock-based compensation expense, and GAAP EPS of $1.06 to $1.24, inclusive of $0.21 of stock-based compensation expense. Our guidance reflects the continuing impact of the near-term demand dynamics that affected our fiscal first quarter, including weakness in SemiCap demand, a near-term slowdown in certain new program ramps, and well in excess of $100 million of unfulfilled customer demand. We expect to return to quarterly sequential revenue growth beginning in our fiscal second half associated with robust Healthcare/Life Sciences and Aerospace and Defense market sector demand, normalizing existing program ramp schedules, additional new program ramps as we benefit from share gains, and participation in secular growth markets, and continued backlog conversion, given our focus on resolving supply chain challenges. During our fiscal first quarter, our team experienced demand volatility in SemiCap customer forecast, continued challenges in securing supply of lagging edge semiconductors, and engineering changes within process new program ramps. With an unfulfilled backlog of more than $100 million, stabilizing customer forecasts, new program ramps, and continued action to improve supply constraints, the team is focused on delivering the revenue potential, while achieving 5.5% GAAP operating margin as we exit fiscal 2023."
