    "content": " By continuing to execute on our core values of providing unbeatable customer service and high order fill rates, we were able to increase both copper and aluminum volumes shipped in the third quarter and year-to-date periods in 2022 over 2021 levels. Net sales for the third quarter ended September 30, 2022, were $762.4 million compared to $716.3 million for the third quarter of 2021. Copper unit volume, measured in the pounds of copper contained in the wire sold, increased 12.9% in the third quarter of 2022 versus the third quarter of 2021. As Daniel stated, the gradual abatement of copper spreads in the quarter was more than offset by increased aluminum spreads and an overall increase in total volumes shipped resulting in the increased gross profit margin in the third quarter of 2022 compared to the third quarter of 2021. Copper unit volume increased 7.9% in the 9 months ended September 30, 2022, versus the 9 months ended September 30, 2021. The average selling price of wire per copper pound sold increased 4.3% in the 9 months ended September 30, 2022, versus the 9 months ended September 30, 2021, while the average cost of copper per pound purchased increased 1.5% for the same period. The increase in copper spreads on a year-to-date basis, along with increased aluminum spreads over the same period, coupled with an overall increase in total volume shipped drove the gross profit margin higher than the 9 months ended September 30, 2022, compared to the commensurate period in 2021. Aluminum wire represented 17.4% and 14.7%, respectively, of our net sales in the quarter and 9 months ended September 30, 2022. Aluminum wire volumes and spreads have increased for both the quarter and 9 months ended September 30, 2022, compared to the commensurate period in the prior year."
