    "content": " As part of the settlement and undisputed items, we made a request with the commission that at the time the proposed decision is put forth that it reflects the most current inflation factors on all of our expenses, and that would be the mechanism that we would address the rising inflation that's going on right now from when we filed the case in July 2021. I think that you have to look also at what's going on with the California energy cost of capital and the pending case there, what's happening with the proposed decision from the administrative law judge and the alternate proposed decision of the President of the Commission. I think in reference back to Angie's question, I think that the company would really appreciate it if the commission at least issued a proposed decision before we have to release earnings in February of next year so that we just have some guidance on that question about the effective date. I was just going to say what we're going to do, Jonathan, starting in 2023, has put together our case for re-request decoupling that we would either file in our 2024 GRC, which would be July or make the decision based on how things are going with the Supreme Court or other companies if we want to try and file it earlier through an application. I would expect that if the commission were to come out with a proposed decision and a final decision, let's say, here's your cost of capital for 2022, they would allow us to file for the adjustment for 2023 in that rate order. And so you walk through a hypothetical and you say, well, if they set cost of capital for 2022, and they do that on January 15 or whatever, there's probably going to be an order in that final decision, which says and the company shall file for the triggered cost of capital for 2023 in the same filing or subsequent to it."
