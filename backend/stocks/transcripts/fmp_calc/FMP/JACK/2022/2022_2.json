    "content": " Both brands had strong 2-year same-store sales performance, Jack up 19.8% and Del Taco up 22.3% for the quarter. Similar to Jack, I believe Del Taco's ability to innovate is key, whether it be new products like the recent release of chicken cheddar rollers and recurring fan favorites like the Tamale menu and crispy Jumbo shrimp or within digital, where the team has innovated successfully on everything from the Dell Yao Rewards program, now at 675,000 members to the stuff case of via Taco's tour live on Twitch.
