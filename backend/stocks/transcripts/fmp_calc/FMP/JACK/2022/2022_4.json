    "content": " Digital sales grew over 32% in 2022, achieving over $400 million for the year and now represents over 10% of our business, while the Jack Pack Rewards program still in its infancy continues to grow membership, particularly after we recently rolled the program out to our drive-thru and in-store guests in quarter three. And lastly, we are providing fiscal year 2023 operating EPS guidance of $5.25 to $5.65, which includes some unique and one-time items of note, including an $0.08 negative impact associated with the reduction in rental revenue from real estate sales and a $0.22 negative impact associated with the store level technology investments. Jack in the Box franchise level margin is expected to be around 40% to 41%, which includes the rollout of a new upgraded POS system in all restaurants, as well as other store level technology platforms to support operations, e-commerce and P&L management.
