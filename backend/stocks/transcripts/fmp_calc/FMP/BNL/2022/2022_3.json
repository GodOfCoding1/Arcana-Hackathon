    "content": " I don't know if it's moving at the same momentum as it was when things first started to move, but you certainly are seeing that reflected in the focus of our acquisitions in Q2, Q3, and as Chris indicated in Q4 as well, which I think really goes to highlight the benefit of our strategy where we do have a broader aperture than most, a multi-class diversified acquisition strategy that allows us to pivot very quickly in markets like this, to focus on the place where we see the best opportunity on a risk-adjusted basis, and that's been industrial for us since Q1, and that will continue to be the focus."
