    "content": " With over 900 million of accretive investments, more than 99.9% rent collected, minimal vacancies and proactive capital markets execution, we were able to deliver full year 2022 AFFO of a $1.40 per share, representing 6.9% growth over the prior year. With a disciplined, prudent and selective approach to growth this year, no material debt maturities until 2026, conservative leverage profile, robust liquidity and solid portfolio performance, I believe BNL is well-positioned to capitalize on 2023 and build momentum throughout the year for differentiated growth in 2024 and beyond. During the quarter, we generated a AFFO of $65.6 million or $0.36 per share, which represents 6% growth over per share results from the same period last year. As for full year 2022 results, we generated AFFO of $252 million or $1.40 per share, which represents 6.9% growth over our 2021 results. We are currently in a little bit of a place where it feels like the heavier movement you saw on cap rates throughout that sort of the last nine-month period of 2022 has may be slowed or plateaued a bit, but at the same time, there is still lots of opportunities that are out there where we feel like price expectations are still getting reset, price discovery is continuing and the risk-reward trade-off on these assets, there is still a little bit of room to grow. And with our $400 million midpoint of guidance on acquisitions, it certainly will be more back-end weighted than what it was last year when we were a little bit more smoothed out with roughly $200 million every quarter with $300 million in the fourth quarter, but we are completely open to reevaluating that guidance as the year goes on."
