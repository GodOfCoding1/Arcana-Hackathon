    "content": "  Operator: Hello, and welcome to Broadstone Net Lease's Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. Thank you, operator, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today for Broadstone Net Lease's second quarter 2022 earnings call. On today's call, you will hear from our Chief Executive Officer, Chris Czarnecki; our Chief Financial Officer, Ryan Albano; and our Chief Operating Officer, John Moragne, who will be available for Q&A. Before we begin, I would like to remind everyone that the following presentation contains forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties that can cause actual results to differ materially due to a variety of factors. We caution you not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements and refer you to our SEC filings, including our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021, for a more detailed discussion of the risk factors that may cause such differences. As we make our way into the second half of 2022, we continue to rely on our diversified net lease strategy to generate consistent and predictable results for our shareholders. Despite a heightened level of macroeconomic uncertainty and persistent volatility in both the equity and debt markets, I'm pleased to report another strong quarter of results across all facets of our business. Before I dive into Q2 operating results, I'd like to take a moment to reiterate how our diversified net lease strategy defensively positions us in today's dynamic market environment. As I've stated on previous calls, our diversified strategy uniquely positions BNL relative to many of our net lease peers to perform across all market cycles and economic backdrops. Relative to other REIT sectors, net lease has proven to be both defensive and resilient during periods of economic stress, and we feel that our differentiated strategy, well-constructed and highly diversified portfolio, along with a fortified balance sheet, provides us the flexibility to navigate periods of dislocation or changes in cap rates by changes in cost of capital. From a defensive perspective, our portfolio of 764 properties is comprised of 213 tenants to diversify it across 57 industries, with no single tenant accounting for more than 2% of annualized base rent. In addition, while our portfolio is comprised of many non-investment-grade tenants, hyper diversification has proven to synthetically create a lower risk profile than a simple investment-grade metric would otherwise indicate. I am pleased to report 100% of base rents were collected during the second quarter, and the portfolio was 99.8% leased as of quarter end. From an offensive point of view, having a wider buy box that includes multiple property types allows us to pivot quickly in response to sudden or dramatic changes in cost of capital. Clearly, the long-term cost of debt for all net lease REITs is considerably higher today when compared to year-end. In addition, the cost of equity has changed year-to-date for all net lease REITs, but more specifically those focused on non-investment-grade tenants. While cap rates in certain asset classes have experienced increases year-to-date, we have yet to see meaningful expansion in cap rates commensurate with the changes in cost of capital experienced year-to-date. During this period of dislocation, our diversified approach to investing has given us the ability to pivot quickly to maintain accretive spreads on new acquisitions. While we've been forced to be more selective given the environment, we're pleased with the opportunities that we have chosen to pursue year-to-date. During the second quarter, we invested $182 million in 15 properties at a weighted average initial cash cap rate of 6.4%. The leases include a strong weighted average lease term of approximately 20 years, and solid 2.1% annual rent escalations, translated into robust weighted average GAAP cap rate of 8%. While we closed many transactions during the second quarter that were committed to in Q1, we are pleased with the meaningful expansion in our weighted average initial cash cap rate quarter-over-quarter. Although investment spreads are not as wide relative to where they were last year, we're pleased with both the near and long-term accretion produced by Q2 transactions. Acquisitions completed during the quarter were more heavily concentrated to industrial opportunities at 82% with a smaller percentage of retail and health care transactions at 11% and 7%, respectively. We were able to source several attractive opportunities this past quarter, but I'm pleased to provide additional detail on. During Q2, we acquired eight industrial properties in five separate transactions for a total of $149 million. Last year, we completed and announced a two-property sale and leaseback transaction of a refrigerated food processing facilities located in Wisconsin. At the time of the initial transaction, the tenant was well underway with a significant expansion of one of the purchased facilities, which we agreed to fund a portion of the costs upon completion, which occurred in the second quarter. In addition, we completed a sale and leaseback transaction on a portfolio of hardwood floor manufacturing and distribution assets during Q2. During the quarter, we continued to acquire several investment-grade assets leased to discount retailers, which are relatively insulated from recessionary and/or inflationary pressures. This opportunity was sourced through an existing developer relationship, and we're hopeful that the relationship will continue to yield additional opportunities in the future. Since quarter end, we've closed an additional $80 million of transactions and currently have approximately $71 million of opportunities under control, which we define as having an executed contract or a letter of intent. With approximately $544 million of acquisitions either closed or under control year-to-date or 73% of the midpoint of our current acquisition guidance, I'm pleased to reiterate our confidence in our current full year 2022 acquisitions guidance range of $700 million to $800 million. The current market environment requires us to remain highly selective, but we are confident that our diversified capital allocation strategy will translate into an opportunity set that meets our risk and return expectations in the second half of the year. With a smaller asset base relative to many of our net lease peers, we're able to produce meaningful growth in earnings with relatively modest levels of acquisitions. I'll now turn the call over to Ryan to provide additional detail on our quarterly financial results, recent capital markets execution, balance sheet positioning and our current guidance for 2022. During the second quarter, we generated AFFO of $62.8 million or $0.35 per share, which represents approximately 6.1% growth over per share results from the same period last year. AFFO per share was flat quarter-over-quarter when compared to Q1 2022, which is largely driven by the revenue generated from late Q1 acquisitions, offset by accelerated equity raise that has derisked our capital markets execution in the back half of the year. During the quarter, we incurred $9.3 million of total general and administrative expenses, which includes $7.9 million of cash expenses consistent quarter-over-quarter. We are currently experiencing an environment where investors are concerned about inflation, rising rates and the potential for a recession, and we remain focused on navigating this dynamic market backdrop through proactive capital markets activity to maintain balance sheet strength and flexibility. During Q2, we sold 3.2 million shares of common stock under our ATM program at a weighted average sale price of $21.42 per share for net proceeds of $68.3 million. As of quarter end, there was approximately $166 million of capacity remaining on our ATM program. In addition, we continue to evaluate alternative equity raise methods available to us and are prepared to execute as pricing dynamics make sense relative to our pipeline of acquisition opportunities. On August 1, we entered into two new unsecured bank term loans, including a $200 million five-year term loan that matures in 2027 and a $300 million seven-year term loan that matures in 2021. The applicable margin commensurate with our BBB and Baa2 investment-grade ratings was 0.95% and 1.25% for the five-year and seven-year term loans, respectively. Given the current state of the investment-grade bond market, we turned to the unsecured bank market to both lengthen our maturity profile at attractive relative pricing and provide additional runway until conditions and the debt capital markets stabilize. While we remain committed to being a repeat issuer in the investment-grade bond market in the future, we believe accessing the bank term loan market at this time was a prudent long-term decision that provides a high degree of flexibility and aligns with our current growth objectives. For fiscal year 2022, we are nearing our AFFO guidance range to $1.38 to $1.40 per diluted share, which represents an implied growth rate of 6.1% at the midpoint over our 2021 results of $1.31 per share. Although these proactive and strategic capital structure decisions create a modest short-term drag on earnings, we believe derisking the balance sheet today will allow us to continue to execute on our growth objectives in the pursuit of long-term shareholder value creation. This guidance range is based on the following key assumptions: acquisition volume between $700 million and $800 million, which remains unchanged; disposition volume between $75 million and $100 million, which remains unchanged; and total cash G&A between $31 million and $33 million, which remains unchanged. As a reminder, our per share results for the year are sensitive to both the timing and amount of acquisition, disposition and capital markets activity that occurs throughout the year. Second, committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet and thinking long term as evidenced by the seven-year term loan that we completed just a few days ago and the pull forward of equity. These three factors to me are cornerstones of how we run the business, and then support an exciting and interesting back half of the year, along with a very robust pipeline. I think you were asking about the acquisition environment, but if you just repeat it, so I make sure we hear your question, that would be great. I think from a very high level, a very strong positive that we feel great about is that transaction volume and things that fit our buy box have remained very robust. To put a little bit of math around that, we've underwritten through the second quarter something north of more than $4 billion than we did last year. And so that has been a net positive that allows us to both be very selective as we're working through this uncertain environment, but also still keep an active pipeline that's very exciting. We've clearly seen the levered buyers, the PE-backed buyer, the secured financing buyer all generally exit the market, which has created a little bit of cap rate relief for us and ultimately, allowed certain asset classes, excuse me, to look more attractive. So you saw that very clearly with the non-investment-grade industrial space and manufacturing food store -- food processing, things like that. You also see the cost of capital for those who are still active being different and that is changing return expectations and ultimately, how transactions are being bid. And then I'd also couple that up with there's a number of transactions that continue to come out with a certain structure or a certain set of return expectations or parameters around it, and ultimately might come back two or three more times as a certain buyer chooses not to perform or is unable to perform. The last piece of it is clearly our ability to pivot and move between asset classes, and you saw that pretty clearly this quarter with our move back into industrial in a more significant way, whereas in Q1, we are very heavily weighted towards retail and restaurant. And so putting all those factors together, that's really what drove the cap rate differential we saw between Q1 and Q2. I'm not sure I can parse each component of that and tell you one was good for 20 basis points and one was good for 10, but those are the factors that we see impacting the acquisition market as we sit today. Again, that pipeline and that size of opportunities does give us a lot of excitement for the back half of the year, so we feel really good about being able to execute within our guidance range. And maybe I'll kick it to John to just talk a little bit more granularly about what's going on in some of the individual property sets, but we ultimately feel pretty good about being able to execute where we are on a going-in basis today and through the rest of the year. So to carry forward from where Chris was, we are currently on pace to evaluate about $30 billion in opportunities this year, which is a significant increase over us from even a historical high from last year. The market remains very competitive, but we think that, that placed our strengths with a diversified and differentiated investment strategy. Our ability to pivot between these asset types, industrial, retail, restaurant, health care, we think is unique in the space. Industrial, in particular, is an area where there's a lot of activity, some great opportunities in the pipeline. But with our strategy, we think the second half of the year is going to be really interesting, and we hope to be able to opportunistically execute on some additional growth on the back half of this year from where we stand today. Obviously, the sector -- spot prices have been a little bit -- but if you just raise equity to buy assets, the spread is smaller. Look, as we think about the portfolio, we have certainly thought about dispositions before and maybe a little bit of a different light today, but not too different. As we think about assets that exist in the portfolio that we could sell and positively recycle capital, you take that, you think about the frictional costs associated with it and the fact that we really like these assets and want to hold them for the long term. And as you look at this portfolio of deals that you have out there in this pipeline, a lot of discussions in the REIT sector, obviously, about the change in cost of capital for buyers in the market. I think that where we sit today relative to history, probably isn't dramatically different. Probably the difference and the biggest change of where we sit today is obviously putting a closer lens on retail or restaurant sectors where you clearly could see some incremental pressure on the consumer and making sure that we're acquiring the highest quality, highest performing sites possible in portfolio and perhaps doing a little bit more up-tiering in that regard. So one of the most common bullet points in an acquisition memo is that they've gone out and stress tested rates, rising across that stack of a tenant by 400, 500 basis points, and what does that do to their fixed charge coverage and their ability to meet their obligations. And so I think a lot of that, which is embedded in who we are and how we've been able to collect and have such a strong portfolio in a non-investment-grade basis for the last 15 years, is just a heightened focus on those type of metrics today more than ever. And then obviously, thinking about tenants refinancing risk in the same way that we spent a bunch of time talking about our refinancings today, and trying to make sure that we push out our debt maturities as long as possible looking at the capital stack and understanding where a tenant might have future refinancing risk in the next two, three, four years. Most of our tenants have a pretty good handle on that and are pushed out a number of years, but that's always a discussion topic as well. We absolutely are winning deals because of that with a 15-year track record of surety to close and not having financing contingencies, and also having a reputation in the market with brokers and sellers that we make sure that when we have signed up a deal that we have integrity around the terms that we've underwritten that we have done the work that we need to do to ensure that unless there's some real unknown that comes up during the diligence, we are going to close. And that matters in this market, particularly in comparing us with folks that are coming in with financing contingencies or with slightly shorter track record or no track record at all, where sellers are looking at it and saying that this is a key part of their business operational and financing strategy, and they want to make sure that they're going to have that cash in hand at the end of this deal. And as John said, it's happening every day with opportunities that we're going after to today's environment, so. And I just wonder how you think about it, right, 2024 is certainly probably further out, I think, than a lot of other folks would be thinking, but how you balance out potential interest rate drag in the short term versus how far out you're looking at extending maturities. I think maybe if I sort of reference back to previous conversations even last quarter's call, I believe we talked a little bit about the fact that we didn't need to go out to say the bond market or a more permanent financing source until maybe late this year or early next year, and it would really be driven by the pace of acquisitions. So as we sort of thought through where rates are, where rates may be headed, we are not really taking any long view other than the fact of shoring up our balance sheet, creating liquidity and locking in permanent financing. And due to the strength of our banking relationships, we did identify the fact that we were able to access a seven-year term loan. And from an overall pricing perspective, on an all-in kind of swapped out basis, you're talking, say, high 3s on that seven versus the alternative in the bond market of, call it, mid-5s on a seven or 10 year. So to us, it was a no-brainer, locking in today, locking the cost of capital from a debt perspective, put it out into a more permanent financing source. So of the $500 million total term debt, we used the $190 million to pay down our 2024 term loan which was already swapped out. At this point, we're evaluating fixing out the new term loan exposure all to remaining 300 or 310 rather for five- to seven -year tenors. In terms of the watch list, I'd say, there's been no real material change since Q1. But overall, nothing new specifically from a tenant perspective has come on or gone off in any meaningful way from one quarter to the next. I'd say maybe to sort of piggyback off of one of Chris' points from a thematic perspective, where clearly, looking at the market backdrop, the uncertainty, the inflationary pressures, supply chain-related dislocations and trying to understand how that really impacts each of our tenants. Asked in a different way, debt-to-EBITDA was 5.3 times at end of the quarter, just how high are you on to let that go as you sort of evaluate opportunities before you have to come back to the equity markets? As we think about our leverage, I think I've said that we're comfortable sort of operating in that low to mid-5% zone. Ron, we continue to think about Canada as excluding the portfolio we did last quarter as complementary to what we're doing. I think this quarter, we looked at two industrial portfolios and we're pretty active and neither of them came to fruition, but they were sort of three plus one as our internal joke. And we've -- that seems like that's a good spot for us to continue to differentiate ourselves and add value to a bidding process where a purely domestic buyer would only be focused on the U.S. assets, whereas we can provide a holistic solution through a sale-leaseback transaction. We also continue to explore if there's more opportunities across the retail verticals within Canada, but that's a little bit more preliminary at this point. Yes, I think we talked a little bit about it in the early part of the call, but certainly have seen more widening in the non-investment-grade industrial space. So again, taking distribution out of it, but the light manufacturing, food processing has seen some of that widening and then secondarily on the non-investment-grade retail that has also widened up a little bit. Health care for us this year, which is sort of our third vertical, has been a little bit quieter. So we're not ready to call any dramatic pricing movements there and the investment-grade retail space maybe a little bit of widening, but has also hung in there because the 10 31 buy has been pretty strong. So for the incremental dollar and where the pipeline is today, more heavily weighted towards that non-investment-grade industrial space, which is, I think, we were looking at yesterday, something like about half our pipeline right now with the other three verticals being fairly equally weighted after that for the remainder."
