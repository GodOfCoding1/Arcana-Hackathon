    "content": " The pace of nonresidential growth eased from quarter four due to tough comparables, but grew by 20% over the prior year with broad growth across commercial, civil and industrial end markets. HVAC where the majority of our business serves the residential end market grew by 18% with a two-year stack of 41%, while residential digital and commerce grew very modestly against a strong comparable as we've seen a slowdown in the do-it-yourself consumer. Organic revenue growth of 13% was bolstered by a further 2.9% growth from acquisitions and 1.5% from an additional sales day, delivered adjusted operating profit of $845 million, an increase of $93 million or 12.4% over the prior year with operating cost leverage driving an 11.2% adjusted operating margin. Turning last to our view of fiscal 2023 guidance, which remains unchanged, we expect to deliver low single-digit revenue growth for the year, driven by continued organic market share gains and the benefit of completed acquisitions, on top of markets which we expect to decline in the low-single digits. Kathryn, your line is open. Kathryn, your line is open. So, if you just look at -- let's take a two-year stack, fiscal 2021 and 2022, from a comparable perspective, growth rates in Q1 were in the high 20s range, stepped up or will step up to the low-30s in Q2 and will step up into the low-40s in Q3 and Q4, a combination of inflation and volumes. And as we go throughout the year, albeit, some macroeconomic headwinds particularly in new residential construction, we do believe we're extremely well positioned with the balance of our business mix and our business model, to continue to progress and outperform what are fundamentally solid longer-term end markets."
