    "date": "2022-06-14 18:39:05",
    "content": " As we previously guided, the strong comparables and changes in business mix led to some year-on-year gross margin compression, resulting in gross margins of 30.3%, tightly controlled costs driving strong operating leverage and improved overall adjusted operating margin by 90 basis points to 10.3%, while investing in our talented associates, supply chain capabilities and technology programs. Headcount and variable costs grew to appropriately support revenue growth and we delivered adjusted operating profit of $736 million in the quarter, an increase of $176 million or 31.4% over the prior year, with adjusted operating margins expanding 60 basis points to 10.6%. As we've discussed over the last several quarters, we continued to invest in working capital, both inventory to ensure we have the best levels of availability for our customers during this time of supply chain challenges as well as receivables driven by sales growth. And that balance with nonresidential and there's good strength coming through from a nonresidential perspective in areas like knock-on commercial activity after residential build-out, then also some really large project work that's happening across a variety of different industries that is supportive of both unit growth as well as ongoing inflation where, as we indicated previously, seeing that growth of inflation inside of finished goods continuing following commodities and that's played into the quarter and into the future. When you look at  numbers on what remodel activity is going to look like, the do-it-for-me portion of the market still sees double-digit growth coming in the future 12 quarters, we've seen that inside of our business where the professional and the do-it-for-me activity is continuing to perform quite well."
