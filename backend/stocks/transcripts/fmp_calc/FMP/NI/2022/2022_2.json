    "content": " We are also excited to share that we expect NIPSCO to issue an RFP for all sources of capacity resources including renewable generation projects and a targeted RFP for gas peaking units later this month, a refresh of our recent RFP results will provide better market perspective on pricing and availability of resources in line with the preferred pathway outlined in the 2021 NIPSCO Integrated Resource Plan. Taking a closer look at our second quarter segment non-GAAP results on Slide 5, gas distribution operating earnings were about $81 million for Q2 of 2022, representing an increase of approximately $15 million versus the same quarter last year. We're still thinking that a case sometime before the end of this year makes sense because if you think about the projects that are already completed and the ones that we have in flight that we expect to go in service next year, the timing for case filed sometime before this end of this year, makes sense to start stepping in those investments into our rate structure."
