    "content": " We expect to see steady activity levels in the Gulf of Mexico, including new infill development wells and subsea tiebacks to existing deepwater production facilities for which we are the exclusive midstream provider, and we will benefit from a full year's worth of volumes from both keys, key and sprints, both of which came on last year and continue to exceed pre-drill expectations. And when combined with our clear line of sight to increasing amounts of free cash flow from our operations, we believe we are well positioned with ample liquidity and financial flexibility to comfortably complete the remaining spend associated with our Granger Soda ash expansion project in 2023 as well as complete the construction of the SYNC lateral and CHOPS expansion projects in the Gulf of Mexico in the second half of 2024. The combination of a growing steady and stable base of production, combined with the large-scale contracted projects that have or will come online every year from 2022 through 2025, demonstrates the stability, longevity and future potential in the deepwater areas of the Central Gulf of Mexico, and its ability to regenerate itself and support long-term, stable and growing cash flows for many years and decades to come. As I mentioned earlier, we have successfully locked in the price for approximately 85% of our anticipated sales volumes of soda ash and related products in 2023, including our new soda ash volumes from Granger and our weighted average realized price for the full year is expected to exceed the weighted average price we received in 2022 as many customers continue to focus on security of supply versus price."
