    "content": " Strong demand for soda ash drove increased prices in all of our markets, especially the export market and we're starting to see activity levels in the Gulf of Mexico begin to ramp with first production from Murphy's King's Quay starting last month and first volumes from Argos just around the corner. Today, I'm excited to announce that we have entered into definitive agreements to provide gathering and transportation services for 100% of the crude oil production associated with two brand new standalone deepwater upstream developments, with a combined production handling capacity of some 160,000 barrels of oil per day, with first oil from both expected in the late 2024 early to mid-2025 timeframe. The Shenandoah project operated by BOE exploration production is located in Walker Ridge blocks 51, 52, and 53 and will have production handling capacity of approximately 100,000 barrels per day, with first deliveries of oil anticipated in late 2024 or early 2025 and will be further transported to shore through our 64% owned CHOPS pipeline. King's Quay and Argos combined with Shenandoah, Salamanca, and the newly identified opportunities I referenced earlier, all coming on within the next four or five years represent a tremendous runway of additional growth in volumes and importantly, significant incremental financial performance that we expect to see from our Gulf of Mexico franchise in the coming years."
