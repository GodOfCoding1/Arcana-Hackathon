    "content": " We believe this performance, combined with a clear line of sight to generate increasing amounts of free cash flow in the years ahead from additional offshore volume growth and a full year of soda ash volumes from Granger who will provide us with increased flexibility to address any near-term maturities on our capital structure under virtually any operating financial and economic environment. The outlook moving forward is driven by a combination of industrial production growth and increasing demand associated with the green transition, specifically from solar panel and lithium battery manufacturers at the same time as there is limited new supply available to the market outside of significantly higher cost synthetic soda ash production. Moving forward, we would expect general auto production levels to return to historic levels as well as significant growth for soda ash expected from solar panel manufacturing and lithium battery manufacturing to support growing demand for EVs and batteries for renewable sources of electricity. The decisions we have made over the last few years, the recovery in our market-leading business off the double black swan lows of 2020 and as well as the expected growth we have in front of us, all combined to provide us with the foundation of generating increasing amounts of discretionary cash flow and an improving credit profile in the coming quarters and for years ahead. And given that there's no -- in the soda ash business, there's not really the concept of take-or-pay or multiyear contracts, we would expect that you would need a clear runway to, call it, plus or minus $120 a ton net EBITDA margin to support that expansion and by golly, if there's $120 net EBITDA margins across the board, we'll make $600 million a year off of our 4.8 million tons of existing installed production capacity."
