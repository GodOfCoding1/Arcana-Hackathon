    "content": " To that end, during the quarter, we also announced that Sandy Ewing has transitioned from our TRUST 3000 business to lead SEI's family office and regulatory services, where she is working closely with SEI's business segment leaders to advance opportunities and execute growth strategies for these offerings in existing and new markets. In our asset management-related businesses, net sales, excluding the deconversion of Retirement Planners of America, which we announced in an 8-K filing last year and discussed last quarter were approximately $2.5 million. While net revenue from sales and asset management was a positive $1.4 million, lower capital markets resulted in reduced revenues from the second quarter."
