    "content": " Asset values will be a headwind as we move into 2023, but we will remain focused on where we believe there are growth opportunities including selling and installing OCIO new business in growth markets, retaining current OCIO clients, further integrating SEI Novus and advancing the ECIO platform, integrating and leveraging SEI Private Wealth Management in our institutional business. This reflects three new SWP sales, two in the U.S. and one in the U.K. We re-contracted eight clients during the quarter, representing $53 million in annual recurring revenue and an average extension of four-plus years. During the quarter, we re-contracted 15 clients totaling $55.2 million in annual recurring revenue, with an average length of over three plus years. So Investment Advisors, I think, is one area where we're going to be consolidating the AMD, the asset manager distribution components of revenue and profits with the adviser channel, that will have a dampening effect on the margins just because of margins in the asset management distribution business and the types of clients we serve there in the global nature and how we report revenue and expense in that business because the sub-adviser cost for the non-U.S. assets are an expense item on the P&L."
