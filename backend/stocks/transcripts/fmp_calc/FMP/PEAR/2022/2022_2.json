    "content": " It is in fact true that we revised our guidance down for script growth, because we are going to focus on driving up that payment rate, even if that means missing out on some unpaid scripts that we previously leveraged quite successfully to generate our large body of real world data that Yuri often talks about. The evidence and value is a really critical question that providers as well as payers and formulary decision makers are asking about, and as we outlined in the Investor Day, and I just summarized some recent studies, we're bringing additional data to bear and so as Corey mentioned, we now have not only our randomized clinical trial data, but we also have real world clinical outcomes and real world health economic outcomes across all three products. So what we're going to continue to do is focus on moving access agreements forward and focus on moving scripts through in those limited areas that we have moderate coverage density, we are not going to put as much emphasis on trying to bring up new sites where there's no coverage sensitivity, where we would generate a lot of unpaid scripts, that would be quite useful in terms of continuing to generate more data for years to analyze, but would not bring in revenue."
