    "content": " We partially redeployed these proceeds to our ground game, with approximately $33.2 million in acquisitions during the second quarter that were, one, 100% Permian basin focused, two, are anticipated to be developed by top tier operators, including Endeavor and Chevron, three, encompassed 95% PDP, DUC, and permitted net locations, and four, are anticipated to add 400 barrels of oil equivalent per day in production in the third quarter. If you looked at this quarter in particular, us signaling the transition or the deal in the Midland basin, and then offsetting that with the sale in Oklahoma, we did - through acquisition, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re anticipated to add about 200 barrels a day of production in the third quarter through the deal, but largely, we're seeing terrific development of our asset, and really that's our thesis of buying tier one assets under well-capitalized operators."
