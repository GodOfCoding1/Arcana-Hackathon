    "content": " As we noted in our press release this morning, our strong performance continued in the fourth quarter of 2022, and we are pleased with our full year revenue growth of 45%. The components of our revenue for the fourth quarter consisted of professional services revenue of $7.7 million, processing and maintenance revenue of $5.1 million, third-party revenue of $1.3 million, and as already highlighted, license revenue of $1.8 million. Total revenue for the fourth quarter was $15.8 million, a 21% increase year-over-year. Services revenue defined as total revenue less license revenue, grew 25% in the quarter on a year-over-year basis with full year growth of 27%. We expect this to be a record year for license revenue, and our focus going forward will be on continued growth in services revenue, with an emphasis on growing our processing business. Revenue growth, excluding our largest customer was 18% in the fourth quarter on a year-over-year basis. We achieved significant growth in 2022 by onboarding a significant number of new customers, converting a large portfolio of millions of cards in the first quarter, adding over 300 people in India, Bogot\u00c3\u00a1 and the U.S. and continuing to build out our processing infrastructure. For 2023, we expect growth in services revenue of approximately 10% and license revenue between $3 million and $7 million. Professional services revenue continued to be strong in the fourth quarter, and we anticipate similar professional services revenue in the first quarter of 2023, likely in the range of $7 million to $7.2 million. Also, the onetime large revenue balanced our 2022 revenue up to $29-plus million, marking a 45% increase for the preceding year. If I continue to talk about license revenue, we currently expect approximately \u00e2\u0080\u0093 I must say, plus or minus $5 million this year compared to the $16 million we received last year. It was approximately 75% last year, which was, again, highly skewed by the 2022 first quarter license revenue. So I guess summing up, the large customer concentration topic: one, the concentration is coming down; two, at this time, we know we will receive lower license revenue and believe other revenues will not vary greatly from 2022; and three, we simply don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know if any new programs will be added in 2023, but do believe it will make sense to continue growing programs over the CoreCard platform in future years."
