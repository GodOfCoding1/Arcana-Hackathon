    "content": " Total revenue for the third quarter of 2022 was $14.5 million, a 12% increase compared to the third quarter of 2021. Services revenue, which represents total revenue less license revenue, grew 30% for the third quarter of 2022, compared to the third quarter of 2021 led by 52% growth in our processing and maintenance revenues. Processing and maintenance revenues grew 52%, as I mentioned, in the third quarter of 2022 compared to the third quarter of 2021 from the recently added customers mentioned above who are now live and continued growth from existing customers. Revenue growth, excluding our largest customer was 22% in the third quarter of 2022, compared to the third quarter of 2021. Due to our solid performance through the third quarter of 2022, we are confident in top line growth expectations of at least 40% for fiscal 2022, compared to our previously provided guidance of at least 30%. Now, I'm not going to project 50% each quarter, but I can confidently say, we'll have significant growth in this recurring revenue line next year even though license revenues will be significantly down."
