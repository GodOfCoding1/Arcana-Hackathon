    "content": " The components of our revenue for the second quarter consisted of license revenue of $1.8 million; professional services revenue of $7.6 million, an increase of 25%; processing and maintenance revenue of $4.5 million, an increase of 8%; and third-party revenue of $1.3 million. As I mentioned, processing and maintenance revenues grew 8% in the second quarter of 2022 compared to the second quarter of 2021 from the recently added customers mentioned above, who are now live and continued growth from existing customers. Revenue growth, excluding our largest customer and excluding the impact of Wirecard was 30% in the second quarter of 2022 compared to the second quarter of 2021.
