    "content": " The drivers of the license revenue during the first quarter were onetime fees for moving from a single institution to multiple institutions, additional license tiers achieved due to completion of a large conversion and continued growth from existing customers. In addition to the license revenue of $12.5 million, revenue for the first quarter consisted of professional services revenue of $6.6 million, an increase of 14% versus prior year; processing and maintenance revenue of $4.1 million, an increase of 56% versus prior year; and third-party revenue of $1.2 million. You recall, we have said for several quarters, I believe, that we expected to have a very good first or second quarter this year, not knowing exactly when the license numbers would land as we have no control over the decision that our customers make. You remember last year, we consistently -- well consistently isn't probably the word for that, but we had to kind of change when we thought license revenue would happen because we're trying to second guess what our customers might do."
