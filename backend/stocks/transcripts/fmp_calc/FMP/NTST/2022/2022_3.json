    "content": " During the quarter, we completed $130 million of net investment activity, closed on both our second forward equity offering of 10.35 million shares and our $600 million sustainability linked credit facility, locking in attractively priced capital before the latest interest rate hikes, and site and heightened market volatility. At the same time, the positive investment decisions we have made, the limited operating risk associated with our current tenant line-up and our ability to lock in significant portions of our capital structure in the third quarter, allow us to narrow our AFFO per share guidance range to $1.15 per share to $1.17 per share, resulting in a small increase in our midpoint of expectations. Now moving onto our third quarter investment activity, we acquired 26 properties for $131.3 million at a weighted average initial cash capitalization rate of 6.6% and a weighted average lease term of 11.8 years. From our perspective, we really think utilizing a spot marginal borrowing rate or even our weighted average cost of debt, actually underestimates the true borrowing costs in the current market and the risks there is, it potentially produces false positive investment decisions for assets we intend to hold for the long-term. And similar to the way that we were thinking about the spot rate on the debt side, the benefit of the undrawn forward could produce positive investment decision for assets that our spot equity cost wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t, right, and really our preference with respect to that is to utilize the benefit to provide additional accretion to our shareholders for less marginal investment decisions."
