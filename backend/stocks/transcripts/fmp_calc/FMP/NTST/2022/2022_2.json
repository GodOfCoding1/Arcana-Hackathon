    "content": " The portfolio's annualized base rent grew to over $84 million in the second quarter, up 52% from June 30, 2021, driven by 114 acquisitions, seven developments and two mortgage loan receivables since the end of the prior year second quarter. Interest expense increased $600,000 to $1.5 million from $900,000 in second quarter 2021, due principally to our higher average balance outstanding on the revolver and increased base rates compared to second quarter 2021. At quarter-end, we had over $39 million in escrow to facilitate acquisitions that closed on July 1 and total debt of $412 million outstanding, of which $175 million is from our fully hedged term loan, with the remaining balance from our revolving line of credit. Please proceed with your question. Please proceed with your question. Please proceed with your question. Please proceed with your question. And so, in the event that we can sell some of those assets in at pretty aggressive cap rates, and we feel like we can redeploy the capital efficiently and accretively, we're always willing to do that, but we also don't want to be out the market selling $50 million, $60 million and not be able to replace it in the quarter, because that put some pressure on earnings. Please proceed with your question."
