    "content": " Turning to our revenue performance, we delivered $5 billion in revenue in the second quarter, comprised of $4.8 billion in base business revenues, which had strong growth of 10.2% or 9.6% organic, which excludes the impact of acquisitions. We are well positioned for strong growth across our three segments, given our performance and momentum in our base business and thus on a legacy BD basis, before adjusting for the diabetes care spin, we are increasing our base revenue guidance. Based on current spot rates for illustrative purposes, currency is now estimated to be a headwind of approximately 200 basis points or about $400 million to total company revenues on both a BD Legacy and RemainCo basis on a full year basis. So I don't think there's anything there to contemplate and then I think as you think of second half margins what you can expect to see there will be a small sequential decline on Op margin from Q2 to Q3 is really primarily driven by the fact that last year Q2 to Q3, you had nearly a 250 basis point decline from Q2 to Q3, and it was our low watermark, and we're actually going to be increasing the improvement in operating margin in the quarter year-over-year, versus what we did this quarter. So you should expect the 35 to lift next year, but not quite double,\n Maybe just we could turn it over to Dave's answer, not just the, the COVID combo test question, but maybe just give some overall color and what was a, a strong momentum in life sciences across both IDs and, and significant demand we're seeing in BDB as well."
