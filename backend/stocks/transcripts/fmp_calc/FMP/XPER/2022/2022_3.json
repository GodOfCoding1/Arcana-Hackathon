Second, today's discussion contains forward-looking statements that are predictions, projections, or other statements about future events, which are based on management's current expectations and beliefs, and therefore subject to risks, uncertainties, and changes in circumstances. Turning to our core business, consumer electronics had a strong financial performance in the third quarter with a 58% year-over-year revenue increase the $34 million. As previously noted on the call our third quarter earnings results are being reported on counting carve-out basis to reflect Xperi Inc's financial results for the quarter prior to our separation October 1st from Xperi Holding Cooperation, which is now known as Adeia Inc. Total revenue for the third quarter was $121.6 million, an increase in 3% from $117.7 million in the third quarter of last year. This increase is driven by our consumer electronics business, which had a strong third quarter with revenue of $34 million a 58% increase from a year ago peering primarily attributable to certain multiyear agreements being recognized in the quarter."
