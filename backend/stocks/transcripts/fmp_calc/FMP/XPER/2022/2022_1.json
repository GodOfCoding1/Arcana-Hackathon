    "content": " On a combined basis, our total revenue for the first quarter was $257 million, representing 16% growth from the first quarter of 2021, primarily due to the previously announced Micron license. Total revenue for the first quarter was $257 million, an increase of 16% from $222 million in the first quarter of last year, primarily due to higher revenue from our IP Licensing business. Revenue in our Product business was $119 million, down 4% from $124 million a year ago due principally to a customer settlement for past unit shipments of approximately $5 million that occurred in the first quarter of 2021. The Pay TV product category, which represented 54% of total product revenue in the quarter, generated $64 million of revenue, up slightly compared to the first quarter of 2021 due to IPTV growth from both MobiTV and new customer deployments, offset by continued churn in the legacy Pay TV subscribers. While revenue in the category was down $3 million year-over-year due to the previously mentioned customer settlement of $5 million in the first quarter of last year, the category would otherwise have exhibited growth, which is something we expect to occur in the category for 2022. In our final product category, Media Platform, revenue for the first quarter was $7 million, up 19% year-over-year. So I think our expectation currently is you'll see Pay TV flat to slightly down on the year, and -- but that's not -- that's masking, of course, a meaningful continued sub decline, which everyone expects consistent with industry trends with a fair amount of IPTV growth for us."
