    "content": " We expect to have a footprint of at least 7 million TVs powered by TiVo within three years, which would yield an annualized revenue run rate of approximately $140 million while delivering meaningful margin expansion over time. By launching smart TVs powered by TiVo and participating in the monetization of ad supported content, we expect this business to more than quadruple to over $190 million annually in a three year timeframe. Next, having exceeded 1.2 million paid subscriber households, our TiVo IPTV platform is currently generating approximately $40 million of revenue annually, primarily from recurring subscriber fees. Over the next three years, we expect annual revenue to more than double to over $100 million due to subscriber growth and increased revenue per household. Altogether, we expect our key growth areas of connected car, monetization and IPTV to grow from approximately $84 million to over $330 million in three years, contributing $246 million of high margin net new revenue."
