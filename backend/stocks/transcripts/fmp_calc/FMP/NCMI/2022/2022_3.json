    "content": " In the third quarter of '22, our total revenue was 49.5 million, an increase of more than 75% compared to the third quarter of '21 and we generated 28.3 million of revenue. On the local market side, our total revenues up more than 75% in the third quarter 22 compared to the same quarter last year. National revenue for the third quarter of 39.7 million was up over 75% compared to the prior year, while local and regional revenue for the third quarter of 9.8 million was up 72% compared to the same period last year. With a much higher percentage of our fourth quarter and 2023 revenue coming from our upfront commitment, we do not expect this accelerating CPM trend versus 2018 to continue as our revenue growth will begin to be driven more by an increase in inventory utilization, resulting in an overall increase in revenue per attendee. Turning to our expenses, the third quarter operating expenses, excluding depreciation and amortization, non-cash charges, and one-time items were 47.5 million overall a 9% decrease compared to the second quarter, while representing 19% increase over the same quarter last year. Having said that, it is important to note that due to our successful upfront campaign, 70% of our national revenue guidance for the fourth quarter of 2022 is already contracted versus 41% in the fourth quarter of 2021."
