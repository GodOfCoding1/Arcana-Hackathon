Looking at some of our key operating metrics, network theater attendance for the first quarter of $76 million exceeded our expectation. First quarter operating expenses, excluding depreciation and amortization and one-time costs were $44.1 million, approximately $2.7 million or almost 6% lower compared to the fourth quarter. In the first quarter, our core operating expenses averaged approximately $6.6 million per month compared to our pre-COVID run rate of $9.5 million per month for a savings of 31%. NCM LLC's cash balance at the end of the first quarter was $76.2 million and including the $6.8 million of availability on our new revolver, NCM LLC's total liquidity at quarter end was approximately $83 million, which was in excess of our liquidity covenant that requires a minimum liquidity of $55 million."
