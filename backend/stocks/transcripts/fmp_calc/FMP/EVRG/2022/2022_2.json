    "content": " We saw $0.02 of higher depreciation and amortization expense due to increased infrastructure investment; $0.02 of higher interest expense due to increased debt outstanding at higher interest rates; and finally, we had $0.07 of lower other income, net of expense, due primarily to lower COLI proceeds year-over-year as well as lower AFUDC equity. Year-to-date, these items were partially offset by the following: O&M expense due to higher planned generation maintenance outages and increased T&D contractor expense incurred during the second quarter drove approximately $0.05 per share; $0.06 of higher depreciation expense due to increased infrastructure investment; $0.09 of lower other income net of expense driven by COLI proceeds and AFUDC equity; and finally, we had $0.03 of higher income tax expense, and that was primarily due to tax smoothing, which reflects a shift in intra-year timing of the recognition of certain tax items in order to maintain our projected effective tax rate for the year, and this is not expected to result in a variance in our full year results."
