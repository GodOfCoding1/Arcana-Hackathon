    "content": " As disclosed in today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s press release, following multiple years of strong growth, we expect 2023 net sales down 15% from last year and adjusted EBITDA down 32%, in each case, at the midpoint of our annual guidance range. In the fourth quarter of 2022, net sales declined 21.5% to $130.7 million versus $166.5 million last year. By Channel, professional sales declined 3.9% to $54.9 million versus a 9% increase last year, which was in line with our expectations. Based on current sell-in and sell-through assumptions, we expect the net year-over-year impact of this to depress sell-in growth for both the Pro and Specialty Retail channels for Q1 by approximately $25 million in aggregate. First, we will be lapping an approximately $22 million net sales impact in the second quarter of 2022 from the introduction of one leader size offerings in the North American professional channel, which we do not expect to offset in 2023. And I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll just note here that because of the inventory rebalancing impacts that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve mentioned in both the fourth quarter of 2022 and the first quarter of 2023, our sell-through performance is actually materially better than the sell-in, the net sales declines that you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re seeing."
