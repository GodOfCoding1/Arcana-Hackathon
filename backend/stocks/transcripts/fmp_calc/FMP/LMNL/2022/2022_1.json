    "content": " These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, including those contained in our updated reports that we file with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC and Canadian Securities Commissions from time-to-time, including our annual report on Form 20-F and our 6-K containing our press release of the results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2022, each of which we have filed with the SEC and on SEDAR that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. Finance costs increased by $200,000 for the quarter ended March 31 2022, compared to the corresponding period in 2021, reflecting a higher interest expense as a result of the unwinding of the discounting on the provision, which has been recorded since June 30 2021, and a loss recorded on the modification of a lease as the inflation index in 2021 caused the lease payments for that lease to increase. Net loss from continuing operations net of taxes decreased by $2.6 million during the quarter ended March 31 2022, compared to the corresponding period in 2021. Net income or loss from discontinued operations net of taxes decreased by $7.7 million during the quarter ended March 31 2022, compared to the corresponding period in 2021. This decrease was partially due to the fact, that we had the full operations of the plasma-derived therapeutics segment during the quarter ended March 31 2021, where during the quarter ended March 31 2022, our discontinued operations income or losses are mainly affected by changes in the CDMO lease liability and provision caused by increases in inflation and variations in the discount rate."
