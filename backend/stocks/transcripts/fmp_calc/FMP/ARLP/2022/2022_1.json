    "content": " Reflecting higher sales volumes and price realizations, ARLP\u2019s total revenues, income before income taxes and EBITDA also jumped significantly during the 2022 quarter, increasing 44.6%, 221% and 61.5%, respectively, over the 2021 quarter. These increases would\u2019ve been even greater, but for 1.1 million tons of delayed coal shipments due to seasonal barge lock maintenance, high river levels and ongoing rail transportation challenges experienced during the 2022 quarter. As Brian mentioned earlier, we are anticipating 2022 sales volume from our coal operations to increase 10% to 15% and per ton price realizations 26% to 47% higher compared to 2021 levels, buoyed by increased prices, we currently expect ARLP\u2019s segment adjusted EBITDA margin per tons sold. Anticipated increase in coal sales volumes and prices from ARLP\u2019s mining operations should also benefit our Coal Royalties segment, with royalty tons sold expected to increase approximately 7.5% and revenue for royalty ton expected to be 22% to 26% higher compared to 2021."
