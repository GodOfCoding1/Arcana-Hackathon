    "content": " Following Carl\u00e2\u0080\u0099s and Marc's prepared remarks, we'll open the call up for questions. Before we get started, I would like to remind you of the Company's Safe Harbor language. Actual future results may differ materially from those suggested in such statements due to a number of risks and uncertainties, all of which are described in the Company's filings with the SEC, which includes today's press release. Today's call will include references to non-GAAP will include references to non-GAAP financial measures, such as adjusted EBITDA. And as a result, we delivered revenue in line with our guidance and adjusted EBITDA that was ahead of our guidance, reflecting continued progress on our strategy to make Beachbody more efficient, effective, and productive. With laser focus on execution and cash flow management, we achieved material savings in the second quarter, reducing cash burn by nearly $38 million and lowering operating expenses by more than 20% compared to the first quarter. As a result of these actions, we ended the quarter with $57 million of cash on hand. In addition, today, we announced that we entered into a $50 million debt financing agreement with Blue Torch Capital, with the potential to increase by another $25 million. During the quarter, we also focused on profitable customer acquisitions through new content releases, our highly effective proprietary sales network and disciplined marketing despite continued softness across the industry. Last month, we reached an important milestone as we completed the migration of all our content onto the Beachbody platform, adding 20 additional programs and roughly 1,000 standalone workouts, all in a single day, creating the largest content drop in our history and adding to our already significant library of evergreen content. This considerable library of assets is what powers our flywheel, where each program title can drive new customer acquisition, customer engagement, and ultimately, brand loyalty. We also delivered profitable subscriber acquisition and nutrition upsells with three recently launched programs, 4 Week Gut Protocol, Fire and Flow, and 4 Weeks for Everybody. These strategic offerings, both bolster our future category and market potential over time and can drive immediate revenue and expanding the LTV of our current customers. In the third quarter, we're continuing to grow our nutritional portfolio with the introduction of the First Thing and Last Thing supplements, a nutritional combination that's ideal for customers looking to improve overall wellness, improve mental clarity, reduce stress, and improve sleep. These completely unique new products represent a powerful lever to drive both LTV and near-term revenue as we market to existing customers who are predisposed to buying what Beachbody develops, because they appreciate the quality of our product line. We also recently launched another fitness program called LIIFT MORE, a program that features super trainer Joel Freeman, and is the follow-up to his highly successful LIIFT franchise. With respect to connected fitness, we also continue to drive higher LTV from demand for bikes across our subscriber base. Our focus remains on creating great indoor cycling content and an experience that is tied to our broad and deep content library, and at that content, not price, which creates the distinct Beachbody biking experience. And soon, we'll be making it even easier for customers to join our ecosystem with an extremely compelling digital subscription offer, but we'll talk a little bit more about that later in the year. During the second quarter, our coach network continued to serve as a powerful and profitable driver of acquisitions and nutrition subscriptions with high levels of motivation and excitement around this year's launch calendar. While we're pleased with our coaches' enthusiasm for reaching more people this quarter, we continue to pilot new incentives and training programs to enhance their role as brand ambassadors. It was our first summit in three years, and it was clear as we left St. Louis that the coaches were invigorated and excited about our substantial category potential, our offerings and the meaningful difference we can and do make in millions of people's lives. Our coach network is profitable and productive, providing a foundation for future success that no one else can replicate. Given the income earning opportunity for coaches, this proprietary sales channel also provides some countercyclical momentum to the business during these times of economic uncertainty. During tough times, Beachbody is even more valuable to our coaches and the income we provide becomes more important to offset pressure from higher costs or as a way to offset loss of income in other parts of their lives. Throughout Q2, we continued to successfully execute our direct-to-consumer marketing strategy, bringing our average CAC down by over 40% versus Q1 and achieving immediate cash payback on our media investments. During the quarter, we increased the price of BOD subscriptions by roughly 20% with no material impact to conversion rate, reflecting the strength of our product offering and our ability to drive profitable subscriber acquisition through target marketing. We've also seen continued success in increasing LTV, as we upsell our premium BODi experience to existing Beachbody on Demand subscribers. Our BOD users have some of the highest levels of retention across our user base, and we're expecting that part of the subscription to become a central part of the value equation in the months ahead. And with the completion of our platform consolidation this quarter, we'll now be able to market our entire suite of products, including Beachbody supplements to our full user base for the first time, representing an important opportunity to drive enhanced LTV over time. Looking to the second half of the year, we're taking a prudent view of the environment, given our expectation that demand patterns for at-home fitness could remain variable in the near term with greater levels of uncertainty around the broader economic climate. Regardless of the macro backdrop, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll continue to focus on profitable acquisition, generating demand through our compelling cadence of new releases and tightly managing expenses. Specifically, we're operating in what is still a large and under penetrated market. The global dietary supplements market was $151.9 billion in 2021, and is expected to expand at a CAGR of 8.9% from 2022 to 2030. And as the future of health and fitness becomes more digital, our unique value proposition is particularly compelling, given the simplicity of one platform and our suite of integrated fitness and nutrition products. In his first quarter as CFO, Marc has provided significant, strategic and operational insight, identified additional opportunities to enhance efficiency and served not only as a thought partner to me, but also a real leader to the finance organization. Kathy joined Beachbody last year as Chief Strategy Officer and played a central role in a number of key initiatives, including the development and execution of the One Brand strategy. In fact, our management team collectively purchased more than $6 million worth of shares on the open market during the second quarter. The actions we're taking to make the business more efficient and productive, such as reducing our cash burn and increasing the flexibility of our cost structure are allowing us to navigate the dynamic near term environment. And with a strong leadership team and a commitment to continued innovation, we are incredibly well positioned to capitalize on the significant opportunity ahead. Before joining the Company, Beachbody always stood out to me as a source of inspiration for getting people healthy and fit, with an impressive track record of developing amazing content that turned the trainers into household names. And we have the right ingredients to see that opportunity, including the best fitness content and programs, a powerful coach network and the advantage of being the only company providing a total fitness and nutrition solution. Since I started, my focus has been on improving our profitability in getting the Company to be free cash flow positive, and we have made meaningful progress this quarter. As a result of our swift actions to pull more cost out of the business, we materially reduced cash burn to roughly $6 million in Q2, a nearly $38 million improvement versus the $44 million we spent in Q1. And we delivered adjusted EBITDA that was not only ahead of our guidance for the quarter, but significantly less than the loss we recorded in Q1. As a result, 75% of our costs are now variable, giving us greater ability to flex with changes in revenue. Looking ahead, I'm also confident in our long-term revenue growth opportunities. To that end, I have begun a thorough review of the business, and I've already identified several additional near-term opportunities to improve profitability moving forward. To improve our gross margin, we will reevaluate SKUs that don't meet our strict price and profitability thresholds, or that are not reflective of market demand. In the coming weeks, I will continue these reviews with the goal of identifying and implementing additional initiatives to refocus, simplify, and strengthen the business as we progress through the balance of 2022 and into 2023. In addition to comparing our results to last year, I would also reference comparison to the second quarter of 2019 where it's helpful. Total revenue was $179.1 million, which was in line with our guidance. Digital revenue was $78 million, which was a 17% decline from last year. Similar to last quarter, we had a reclassification of business service fees from preferred customers out of digital and into nutrition and other revenue. Adjusting for this shift, digital revenue would've declined by 8%. Digital subscriptions decreased 16% year-over-year, as we cycled two years of strong growth through the height of the pandemic. However, when comparing to our pre-pandemic baseline, digital subscriptions continued to show solid growth of 35% over the second quarter of 2019. Engagement or DAU/MAU was down versus last year, but increased by 140 basis points compared to 2019. Quarterly retention levels increased over last year and Q2 of 2019, demonstrating our ability to retain subscribers through continued content innovation. Nutrition and other revenue was $90.5 million, down 30% compared to the second quarter of 2021. Looking ahead, as we have now lapped the toughest comps of the pandemic period, we believe our solid pipeline of new products, enhanced cross-sell and upsell initiative and efforts to simplify customer choice to reduce SKU counts should support improved demand and performance moving forward. Connected fitness revenue was $10.6 million with 8,800 bikes delivered. Digital gross margin was 76.4% and declined 1,130 basis points versus 2021, primarily due to higher content production cost and the timeline with which these costs are amortized. Additionally, roughly 300 basis points of the decline related to accelerated depreciation and program amortization in connection with our One Brand digital platform consolidation. And finally, the business service fee reclassification I mentioned earlier had roughly 200 basis points negative impact, given the high margins of that revenue. Also, our connected fitness gross profit continues to be impacted by higher shipping, freight, and warehousing costs, given ongoing supply chain pressures. Total operating expenses decreased approximately $53 million or 29% year-over-year to $131.7 million, as we continued our migration to One Brand. In particular, we significantly reduce our media spend in line with our high-return, low-risk customer acquisition strategy. With respect to the balance sheet, as I said, we made significant improvements in our cash burn in Q2 and ending the quarter with an unrestricted cash balance of $57.1 million and no debt. In addition to lowering our operating expenses through the One Brand strategy, we also reduced our inventory position and our capital expenditures in Q2 compared to Q1. However, as Carl mentioned, we also announced that we have taken the deliberate step to enter into a debt financing agreement with Blue Torch Capital for $50 million, with access in additional $25 million facility. As we think about the back half of the year, it's clear that the consumer post-pandemic mindset persists with people preferring to be outside and travel. With respect to profits and cash flow, our plan calls for gradually stemming our cash burn and returning to positive adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow over time. However, as we said last quarter, we don't expect our improvements in profitability to be linear quarter-over-quarter. For instance, in the back half we'll incur expenses for new employee hires, merit-based compensation increases and tech investments to position the business for the growth that Carl referred to. Taking all this into account, for the third quarter of 2022, we are guiding as follows: Total GAAP revenue of $150 million to $160 million, and adjusted EBITDA loss of $15 million to $20 million. Please note that in addition to the factors, I just outlined, our Q3 guidance also reflects an incremental $7 million in expenses related to our annual coach summit event in July. Finally, we now expect to realize a combined adjusted EBITDA improvement and CapEx reduction of approximately $110 million to $120 million in 2022 versus last year. Although, the environment remains challenging, we are committed to taking action to return to positive cash flow, drive profitable growth, and create long term value. We believe our focus on aggressive cost management through the back half of this year will set the business up for future growth and profitability as a leaner, more agile organization. And likewise, as we discussed in the opening remarks, we're seeing just an uncertainty in demand in the fitness space and particularly the in-home fitness space. But, you're right, the cadence of launches that we scheduled for 2022 are tip of the spear for bringing in new subscribers. I don't expect to see any -- like I can't expect or forecast any dramatic difference in our subscriber acquisition, except we'll continue to pursue it in a way that is profitable. And that's, what's a little bit different than the back half of last year where we were really -- we were spending into growth. And since the first quarter, we've stopped reaching with increased cost of acquisition and instead are now back to our free cash flow model, which has really served the Company so well for two decades. And maybe as a follow-up to that, in trying to figure out the floor on membership and revenue, so, digital subs, I guess they were 1.9 million 1Q \u00e2\u0080\u009820. And I guess, now we are tracking below \u00e2\u0080\u009819 revenue, but that's largely on the nutrition side. I think that's -- I think you've got that right, particularly because we've added the BOD Interactive subscription to the portfolio, which is frankly, the bright spot in terms of what we're seeing in terms of engagement and retention. Now, I can't -- I don't want to send a signal that I can identify the floor, but I believe that we -- like I said, I think we're in a very stable place based on our recruiting metrics within our coach network and frankly, the very strong performance of our direct marketing activities, which in many cases have outperformed our expectations. Well, what I would say, like you said, the difference in revenue coming from the nutritional files is obviously something that we needed to address. So, we are simplifying that as we've also taken friction out of the funnel, we're also taking some choice and making a very specific recommendation. And one -- just one last quick one, and then I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll leave. We've got the inventory, and we're actually in a very good position because we don't -- we're not in a position to have to support factories and purchase more inventory. So, that's our focus, because obviously we don't have to chase a cost of acquisition like we do out in the open market, if we're trying to start a subscription with a bike. Because I thought before it was EBITDA minus CapEx minus cash spent on content, and that would improve it. So, it looks like it's different. When we look at what was spent in 2021 versus how much we will spend in 2022, there will be $110 million to $120 million reduction. So, I think on the last call and in the last press release, you had actually improved the outlook to $120 million improvement. But as you can imagine, just being a bit more prudent with the outlook going forward from a revenue standpoint could impact contribution margin. We've seen where there are certain efficiencies that we can pick up, and in the back half of the year, we expect to realize some of the savings from those activities, which are ongoing creation of live content as we refine that system. So, it's getting better as that part of the business -- as we start to understand what's important to the subscriber and what's not important. And then, I think on the last call you had talked about there being seven major launches in 2022 versus many fewer last year. So, I will say, so far this year, we've got -- we've had the job one, launch, with Jennifer Jacobs. And like I said, we're right in the middle of this LIIFT MORE launch. We also had the -- while it doesn't count as one of the content drops, we did move all of the Openfit content and live rides over into the Beachbody library in July, which was our largest content drop ever, and our subscribers are loving all that additional value that they got with no additional cost effectively. Then we have the new program called -- well, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not allowed to say actually what that is, but we have another program coming in December, which will -- no, we already announced it. And like I said, we are focusing the first transaction with the customer into the primary nutritional that got people results with that program. So, for instance, on the LIIFT MORE, which is the lifting program, we're recommending what is called the performance stack, which includes a pre-workout and a post-workout. So, we're very prescriptive about what's right for that, with the program called XB Sweat and Sculpt from Andrea Rogers, this October will be prescriptive about a combination of Shakeology and pre-workout. And then we also have two seasonal Shakeology flavors coming in the second half of the year, one is chocolate caramel brownie and then we have a beach bar, which is a chocolate mint beach bar, and the other Shakeology flavor is vanilla chai. So, a lot of stuff coming in the back half of the year, it's definitely more launches than we normally do in one year. And then, can you just say -- I think my understanding was that seasonally third quarter revenue for the whole company is usually higher than fourth quarter. Linda, we're not giving guidance on the fourth quarter yet just given the demand environment. But what I would say is generally speaking, yes, it is usually a strong quarter, but with this whole post-pandemic situation, people wanting to be outside, we're being very diligent also in our marketing spend so that we get immediate paybacks. So, that's why we're guiding this way. One of the reasons for that is traditionally, one of the biggest launches for us of the year happens in December, as we go into the new year. So, we get the benefit of what we call our leadership event, which is a big event for our coaches that happens in October, then there's the couple of new nutritional launches that happen in the fourth quarter, and this big launch. There's the $50 million, we'll put that then on the balance sheet, and then the access to the additional facility is subject to additional terms and will not be put immediately on the balance sheet. On the first $50 million, the interest rate is SOFR plus a component of cash and pick. So, you're saying the interest rate is essentially SOFR plus 8%ish. And can I just ask you -- the other weight loss companies, Weight Watchers Metafit,  they haven't been doing so well either, and they have different problems. They're finding retention has fallen off, because people don't want to order the second month of food. So, if you had to characterize maybe your business in terms of the consumer and how they're behaving, like maybe you could give us a little color. I think that primarily the activity of our network has had more headwinds from this current environment, as any direct-to-consumer company would have, exacerbated by the complexity of the nutritional offerings that we made, which -- that is what we're improving. Because we gave so much, this is just a real consumer facing merchandising issue that -- you've got this volunteer sales force effectively. They're not employees, they're just trying to do their workouts and inspire people on social media and what then those people who are like, hey, I'd like to do what you're doing. And that's what we feel like, once -- what we saw from the 4 Week Gut Protocol program is we were so prescriptive and so specific about what to get that that program really hit its strides. And the other ones where we're sort of offering a more -- a broader suite that -- again, this isn't a sophisticated sales force. These are people just regular people like me, just trying to get their workout on and put every little group together. So, I would say it's -- this relationship of a bit of the environment that we're in, as Marc said, people are traveling. Now's not necessarily time to be pursuing body transformation because you don't know how long you're going to be able to be out and about, and on the other hand, some of the weakness or friction in the merchandising that we're cleaning up. Kaumil, look, what I would say is we already felt that we didn't need cash, additional cash to make the changes we're making in the business. So, when you look at how we materially reduce our cash burn down to $6 million this past quarter, really the increment going forward is a lot more controlled from our part to make changes to our platform, to position it for growth. So, I think honestly it's just a safety net, so we don't foresee going out and needing any more capital. That content is put in the hands of people who love what Beachbody does, they're called our coaches. The cost of acquisition in the coach network are all direct, meaning we don't experience those costs unless a sale is made. The approach that we took with this, because it's a sequel to one of our most popular programs called LIIFT 4 really been to lean into this concept of the people who love LIIFT 4 to follow on with this sequel. So, it's been great to see that this particular program is also appealing to men and couples are doing it together. It was launched in the last half of July, and it continues to create demand, but in terms of the cost of acquisition, that is pretty much fixed because it's transactional. And, and Kaumil, what I'll add to that, if you compare it to a year ago, our selling and marketing expense went from 62% of revenue down to 48%. So, in that you have that very variable component that Carl's referring to in the coach network. And then, our third route to market is obviously cross-selling into our own database of 2 million customers. And that I'd say we're -- I would say, honestly, we're refining and improving, because there's room to do a lot better there and we're working on it right now. And then with every company we're trying to -- the Street's trying to work out, what would be the implications of a recession. Well, that's -- if there's one thing that I'm -- after a couple of decades in this that I'm proud of about this company, we've been through three of them, three downturns. And we -- first, I would say any responsible CEO is never going to take for granted how you're going to do, because you don't know what the demand patterns are going to be in any recession. And as they're moving, as they're perhaps tightening their belts a little bit. Likewise, our coach network actually gets more productive in a recessionary environment for two reasons. One, the household is trying to offset higher prices from inflation, but also contraction in what might have been their primary income has this requirement of motivating them to be a little bit more aggressive about how they might get productivity in helping other people get started with a Beachbody membership. And I don't see any reason for us not to, if we're smart to possibly be the benefactors of the economic environment. Look, I'll say -- one, I would say most importantly, the cash usage would likely be comparable to the adjusted EBITDA. Number two, like I stated, we do have a $7 million expense in that Q3 that relates to our coach summit, that's one time. So, that's -- those are two things I would say, but cash usage would probably -- likely be comparable. And frankly, a lot of this does relate, like I said, to our deliberate and controlled investment in our platform and some of the changes we're making that Carl spoke about as well. Look, Jon, we could dive into more specifics, but what I could tell you is year-over-year, there's definitely substantial reduction and the -- because there's the technology component and then there's a programming component. So, let's set up time we could run you through the details of the numbers and give you that visibility. Maybe one broader question then, just going back to the cash question. So with that in mind, the deliberate investments we're making, if -- we could slow them down when we want, right. So, that's why I said we feel pretty comfortable that we could fund the business through existing cash flows, not through the borrowed borrow money, if that makes sense. There's some short-term headwinds coming out of the pandemic in the -- let's say the upcoming recession, but long term, we're still believers in the long term growth of this market. So, we're still investing to position the Company for growth. I don't know that we published the coach number, but I will say a couple of things have happened, which were very healthy for the business. In fact, by splitting out the coaches, the definition of a coach, a person with intent to monetize their health and fitness versus a preferred customer, who's really buying into the concept of a discount on the product. That has actually accelerated -- by having that designation, we've accelerated the number of preferred customers that came on. Likewise, the people who actually intend to be coaches, we can isolate them, train them appropriately and listen to them for what they're looking for. But now, we've got this clear view of what the coaches need and what they're looking for to maximize this opportunity for them. I believe we're going to simplify the business in a way that will be -- that will help us achieve our mission of helping more people, get involved with this community of health and fitness and taking better care of yourself. So, stronger signal from the coaches, but at the same time, like I said, at the beginning, they're operating in the same consumer environment as all of us. So, that's why we're taking the view that we are. So, I've seen that your sales and marketing spend for Q2, is down quite a bit, as you mentioned quarter-over-quarter to $87 million. On the first one, look, Q2 over Q2 reduction was around 20%. And on the sales and marketing front, we're going to continue to be diligent, so that we get a quick ROI on those customer acquisitions. So, I would say the percentage of revenue that you saw in this last quarter is consistent with what you'll see going forward. And then, in terms of profitability versus revenue, what I would say, the investments we're doing are really more around things. So, it's - and that's controlled investment is what I'll finish by saying, meaning, if ever we see, like, we need to slow it down, we could slow it down. I think one of the dynamics that you're seeing here year-over-year is, third quarter of 2021, we were aggressively selling bikes and we were also investing in a significant media push, brand strategy and acquisition. So, what you're seeing now is a much more prudent approach and a reduction in chasing revenue rather than buying revenue. Now, we're really staying true to what built this company over the course of two decades. And so, that's why we're taking this view of, if we're going to sell bikes, we're going to sell it into the database. And we take advantage of the positive relationship we create with those subscribers and sell them a bike, and we don't have the same cost of acquisition. So, while that'll be a slower rate of bike sales this third quarter, as compared to last third quarter, the economics of those sales will be much more favorable. And then, you did mention for Q1, your sales marketing out of $106 million that was $70 million was related to the sales commissions to the coach network. What I would tell you is as a percentage of revenue, we've taken it from 62% to 48% selling and marketing together. Joanna, look, what I would say is first of all, in the gross margin, a substantial portion of the negative gross margin was related to non-cash reserves, $15 out of the $20 million. So, I think trying to push that way, reduces the customer acquisition cost, which has a positive impact on the gross margin."
