    "content": " Now, over time, we expect to improve the margin on Connected Fitness sales as well as enhanced total LTV and we'll do so as we capture more attentive high-margin subscription revenue and increase the cross sell of nutritional products with targeted upsells made directly on the bikes' touchscreen, which are due to launch in Q2 of this year. For the second quarter of 2022, we're guiding total GAAP revenue of between $175 million to $185 million, which reflects the return to more historical seasonality trends, the impact of lower digital subscriptions versus prior year as we exited Q1, and the timing of new product launches. I think the second comment, I'd make just in terms of returning to profitability despite the conservative modeling, clearly accelerated demand in the network or a profitable Connected Fitness are definitely requirements for that path to profitability, but we're really focusing one quarter at a time now and only guiding with our Q2 guidance, but we feel very good, as Carl just said, about the 2020, two launches and also the lineup for 2023."
