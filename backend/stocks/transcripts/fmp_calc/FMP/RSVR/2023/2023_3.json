    "content": "   Operator: Good morning, everyone, and thank you for participating in today's conference call to discuss Reservoir Media's Financial Results for the Third Quarter of Fiscal Year 2023 ended December 31, 2022. Through the first three quarters of the fiscal year, we are very pleased with the performance of our business as we continue to report strong growth numbers fueled by healthy organic growth as well as the continued execution of deals across musical genres. In the third fiscal quarter, we recorded $29.9 million in revenue, which represented a 16% increase from the third quarter of fiscal 2022, inclusive of acquisitions. While it's a smaller portion of our revenue segmentation, I'd also like to note that our management business saw a significant increase during the quarter, which was primarily due to strong touring and merchandise revenue with the resurgence in live performances versus the same period last year. Music Publishing generated revenue of $20.2 million in the third fiscal quarter, which was a 14% improvement from this time last year and was largely driven by our Digital, Performance and Sync revenue streams. Within the segment, Digital revenue grew 29% year-over-year to $10.7 million and represents more than half of the Music Publishing revenue in the quarter. Our Recorded Music segment moderately grew by 1% during the quarter to $7.6 million with improvement from Digital and Neighboring Rights revenues, which grew 17% and 43%, respectively."
