As Golnar mentioned, we're off to a strong start in fiscal 2023, as we surpassed our internal expectations for the quarter on revenue and adjusted EBITDA while continuing to utilize a significant cash-generating power of our business to deploy capital towards strategic M&A and further diversifying our roster with accretive catalog and future deals. For Q1, OIBDA increased 56% year-over-year to $6.7 million, while adjusted EBITDA grew 73% to $7.4 million both as compared to the first fiscal quarter of 2022. Music Publishing generated revenue of $16.4 million in the first quarter, which was a 35% improvement from this time last year. Synchronization revenue in the publishing segment totaled $3.3 million, representing a 70% increase from the first quarter last year showing the benefit Reservoir receives from the value enhancement efforts we provide. Our recorded music segment continued to deliver strong results in the quarter, generating $7.6 million in revenue, which is up 80% from the prior year quarter."
