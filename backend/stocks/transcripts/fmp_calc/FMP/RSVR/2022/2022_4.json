    "content": " Our top line growth in Q4 was driven by solid growth across nearly every revenue type, but was particularly attributable to digital revenue expansion in our recorded music business, which delivered a 178% increase versus the prior year quarter. Looking at our operating expenses for the quarter, our overall cost of revenue saw a 44% increase from the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, which provides a slight margin improvement against the 46% revenue growth in the quarter. For Q4, OIBDA increased 34% year-over-year to 13.9 million, while adjusted EBITDA grew 47% to 15.4 million, both as compared to the fourth fiscal quarter of 2021. These increases were primarily driven by the improvement in revenues across both publishing and recorded music and were partially offset by transactional and administration costs related to being a public company. Moving to a breakdown of our full-year fiscal 2022 results, revenue came in at 107.8 million, a 34% increase year-over-year and well above the top of our previously raised guidance range. These increases were primarily driven by the improvement in revenues across both publishing and recorded music and were partially offset by transactional and administration costs related to being a public company. Synchronization revenue in the Publishing segment totaled 4.7 million, representing a 31% increase from the fourth quarter last year, largely due to the recovery in the film and television industry from the impacts of COVID-19. Our recorded music segment continued to deliver strong results in the quarter, generating 9.8 million in revenue in the fourth quarter, which is up 123% from the prior year quarter. All revenue types within our recorded music segment delivered solid results, led by digital revenue, which saw a 178% increase and that was driven by the continued growth and consumption at music streaming services."
