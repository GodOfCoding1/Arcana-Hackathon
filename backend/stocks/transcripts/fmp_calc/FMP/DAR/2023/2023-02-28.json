    "content": "  Operating income increased 18.1% to $249.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2022 compared to $211 million for the fourth quarter of 2021 primarily due to a $67.7 million increase in gross margin and Darling's share of Diamond Green Diesel's earnings increasing $53.8 million quarter-over-quarter, which more than offset depreciation and amortization increasing $36.6 million and SG&A increasing about $24 million quarter-over-quarter, both primarily due to the FASA and Valley Proteins acquisitions. The increase in operating income was primarily due to a $287.6 million increase in gross margin and a $20.7 million increase in Darling's share of DGD earnings year-over-year, which more than offset depreciation and amortization increasing $78.3 million and SG&A increasing about $45 million for fiscal year '22 as compared to 2021, both primarily due to the acquisitions of FASA and Valley Proteins."
