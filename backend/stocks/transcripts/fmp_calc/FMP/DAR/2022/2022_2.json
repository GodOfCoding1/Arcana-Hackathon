    "content": "  Operating income increased 3.8% to $278.6 million for the second quarter of 2022 compared to $268.3 million for the second quarter of 2021, primarily due to a $98.1 million increase in the gross margin from our Global Ingredients business, which more than offset a $52.1 million decline in our share of the earnings from Diamond Green Diesel, as well as an increase in SG&A and depreciation and amortization, primarily due to the addition of Valley Proteins."
