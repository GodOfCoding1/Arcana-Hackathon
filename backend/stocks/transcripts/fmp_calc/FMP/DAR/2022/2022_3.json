    "content": " In the third quarter of 2023, Diamond Green -- 2022 sorry, Diamond Green Diesel sold 190 million gallons of renewable diesel and recorded $1.26 per gallon in EBITDA. Net income for the third quarter 2022 totaled $191 million or $1.17 per diluted share, compared to net income of $146.8 million or $0.88 per diluted share for the 2021 third quarter. Operating income increased 30.4% to $268.3 million for the third quarter of 2022 compared to $205.7 million for the third quarter of 2021, primarily due to a $50 million increase in the gross margin from our Global Ingredients business and a $49.5 million increase in Darling's share of Diamond Green Diesel earnings. In the third quarter of 2022, we incurred $4.5 million in acquisition and integration costs, primarily related to our acquisitions of Rotebek , Valley Proteins and FASA as well as the previously announced pending Gelnex acquisition. For the nine months ended October 1, 2022, the foreign currency exchange impact was approximately negative $41.6 million using an average rate of $1.06 compared to an average rate of $1.20 for the nine months ended October 1, 2021. For the nine months ended October 1, 2022, the company recorded income tax expense of $108.6 million and an effective tax rate of 15.6%. And if you look at the base business, and you take the Valley and FASA and where we're going to finish this year, yes it's not hard to get a $1.2 billion number out of the core ingredient business where pricing is today."
