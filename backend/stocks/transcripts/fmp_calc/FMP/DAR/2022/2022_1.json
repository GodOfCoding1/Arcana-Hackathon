    "content": " You may now go ahead. And we're really good at going back-end, because there's just such a broad range of expertise along different product lines, around the world, different geographies, we understand various cultures around the world very well. You may now go ahead. You may now go ahead. There's a little bit of capital, it's not giant numbers that I'll have to go back into this to bring it up to our standards, but just start to look at pieces specific, moving different products around, we look at what we're selling product for versus what they have sold product for and say, if they would have only sold the product at the same price we did or near, that's an insignificant number. So that's positive, and I think that if you look at where we're estimating for the year to end up at a $1.25, that probably looks like a pretty conservative estimate at this point in time. You may now go ahead. You may now go ahead. You may now go ahead. And then if I think about the Diamond Green Diesel going to about 1.3 billion gallons next year, holding margin at $1.25, that's close to about $800 million. We're where we want to be right now and then if we start pulling dividends of $400 million to $600 million out of Diamond Green next year, on top of a core run rate that has a billion number in it, that -- there's somewhere between $700 and $1billion of free cash to, like I said, during one of the four things that we're going to do. You may now go ahead. You may now go ahead. You may now go ahead."
