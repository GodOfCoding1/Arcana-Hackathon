    "content": " Our GAAP net income applicable to common stockholders for the first quarter was $25.6 million or $1.40 per weighted average share outstanding during the quarter, while comprehensive loss attributable to common stockholders which includes the mark-to-market of our held-for-sale RMBS was $17.9 million or $0.98 per share. So I think we're just trying to really manage through that from the perspective of trying to understand what the right hedge ratio is for the assets in terms of where they could fully extend to as well as managing what we think the contribution is from the MSR to offset some of that, which I think I said in the script as we approach 3% on the 10-year, the ability for the MSR to assist in terms of limiting the effect of spread widening decreases just based on the pure fact that the current coupon as Ray mentioned, somewhere in the four versus the current coupon on our portfolio which is in the mid-3s."
