    "content": " The portfolio's recapture rate was lower at 12% versus 20% in the first quarter, which is expected if interest in mortgage rates rose, making the incentive to refinance less. The RMBS portfolio's prepayment fees exhibited similar games, the portfolio's weighted average three-months CPR reduced to approximately 7% for the second quarter compared to approximately 11% in the first quarter. For the second quarter, we posted a 3.46% RMBS net interest spread versus a 3.06% net interest spread reported for the first quarter, driven by higher yields as we reposition the portfolio, coupled with the combination of better prepayment speeds. I think one of the things that we've done, as you know we've taken down leverage on the RMBS side throughout the year, just given our view on where spreads could go and some of the volatility in the space as rates back up, what I think we would call meaningfully through the quarter."
