    "content": " Performance Chemicals margin compression was primarily due to lower volumes attributed to raw material availability and plant downtime, particularly in Engineered Polymers that Rich will discuss; while Performance Materials margin compression was primarily due to the mix shift within Performance Materials from automotive carbon to process purification, which Ed will review. In addition, Performance Chemicals represented 71% of total sales in this Q2, as compared to 65% last year, as Performance Chemicals revenues grew 28% year-over-year while Performance Materials revenue was down about 3%, due primarily to lower auto production in China. Turning to the transactions that John mentioned, the purchase price for Ozark Materials is $325 million, and it's expected to close in Q4; hopefully, early Q4. Turning to Slide 7, our Performance Chemicals segment saw record revenue growth versus the prior year's quarter on solid end market demand and continued price improvement, particularly in Engineered Polymers and Industrial Specialties. Performance Chemicals EBITDA of almost $66 million in Q2 was up 16% versus prior year quarter, while our segment EBITDA margin was down 230 basis points, which we attribute to the timing of pricing actions, supply chain constraints and lower volumes impacting plant throughput. As you can see on Slide #8, sales of the Performance Materials segment were $122.4 million, down 2.9% versus the prior year's quarter. Sales of our automotive activated carbon products were down compared to the second quarter of 2021, reflecting the impact of China's COVID-related shutdowns in April and May and the cascading negative impact on global vehicle production."
