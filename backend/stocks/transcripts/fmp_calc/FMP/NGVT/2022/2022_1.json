    "content": " Here you see our impressive top line improvement with record sales of nearly 20% year-over-year, as strong end-market demand enabled our sales and commercial teams to act quickly to recover the substantial increases in costs we experienced in the quarter. Diluted adjusted earnings per share of $1.62 was up nearly 28% over prior year, reflecting primarily our increased sales and good cost management supplemented by a lower share count as we repurchased about 1.5 million shares in the last 12 months with 610,000 shares in its first quarter. Our Performance Chemicals segment saw strong revenue growth versus the prior year's quarter on solid end-market demand and continued price improvement, particularly in Engineered Polymers and Industrial Specialties. Industrial Specialties sales increased 29% versus the prior year quarter with strong performance across all markets, particularly in the oilfield and adhesives. For the quarter, our segment EBITDA of $78 million was up almost 6% versus the prior year's quarter and our adjusted EBITDA margin has remained steady at over 50%. Your line is open. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Your line is open. Your line is open. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Your line is open. Your line is open. We also are heavily focused on the mix shift that we're seeing through Brazil, but also, obviously closely monitoring what's going to happen with China because that will ultimately be a hopefully a good swing in the back half of the year."
