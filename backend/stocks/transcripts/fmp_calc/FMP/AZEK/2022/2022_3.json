    "content": " For the third quarter of 2022, we delivered net sales growth of 21% year-over-year to $395 million, with solid and broad-based growth across our Residential and Commercial segments. Net income increased by $5.7 million to $27.5 million for the quarter compared to $21.8 million in the prior year, driven by higher sales and partially offset by higher year-over-year depreciation expense related to our capacity expansion program and higher interest expense. We are estimating a $90 million-plus inventory recalibration headwind in 4Q, plus the previously mentioned prior year of approximately $30 million plus inventory replenishment that we are lapping from the fourth quarter of 2021. If you take out the $30 million from last year in the -- in your fiscal second quarter, you're getting to a residential growth of around 33%. Also, if you take out the $30 million -- for this current quarter, you take out the $30 million from a year ago and then add back $90 million this year, you're actually getting the growth of low 30s to low 40s, which would suggest the end market remaining fairly strong and effectively not falling off to any degree."
