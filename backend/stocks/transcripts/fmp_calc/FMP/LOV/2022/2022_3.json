    "content": " From a profitability perspective, we delivered a 66% increase in adjusted EBITDA of $8.3 million or 17% of revenue compared to $5 million or 9% of revenue in the third quarter of last year. In fact, our subscription conversion rates for both Zoosk and non-Zoosk brands increased 11%, which we attribute to product improvements we made during the quarter, as well as our ability to drive higher-quality traffic. One of the effects of us sort of focusing on profitability, in particular in the second half of the quarter, is that if you look at the numbers that we've provided in terms of end subscribers that David talked about, they're a bit down; they're about down 4%."
