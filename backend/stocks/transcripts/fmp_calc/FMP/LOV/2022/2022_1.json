    "content": " We are also continuing to focus on high-return product initiatives, specifically improving Zoosk profiles to drive higher engagement in the first 7 days of registration, enhancing or search and matching algorithms across all brands, driving higher engagement and ultimately billings, and simplifying our technology infrastructure by moving our primary brands from 3 platforms to 2. As you know, Zoosk has been a declining property since we acquired it, and we are now, thanks to a lot of the things that we're doing around improving the product and also the improvement from our debt facility, we're able to spend more profitably, something that we have not done over the last couple of years, we actually had decreased marketing."
