    "content": " Highlights for the quarter compared to the same period last year include: revenue increased by $276,000 to $11.4 million; gross profit increased by $1.3 million, primarily due to increased utilization of our staff and reduced expenditures on proposals. Our cash balance was $14.1 million as of the end of the quarter, a decrease of $5.1 million over last year's balance of $19.2 million. Through the efforts of our team, we have steadily increased our backlog from $8.4 million at the end of Q3 last year to $19 million -- over $19 million at the end of this quarter. At the same time, we have steadily increased our revenue over the last 4 quarters from $5.9 million in Q3 of last year to $6.9 million in Q4, $7.3 million in Q1 and $11.4 million this quarter."
