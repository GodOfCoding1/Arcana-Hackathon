    "content": " Ad revenue in North America of $22.5 million up 21% year-over-year, 1,231,000 paid subscribers in North America and 350,000 in rest of world and we closed the quarter with $307 million of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and short-term investments. Regarding our ad business our focus has been on investing in our advertising team, technology and infrastructure, these investments are beginning to pay off as third quarter ad revenue reach $22.5 million, an increase of 21% versus Q3 2021 and represented approximately 10% of total revenue. One last thing, before we move on, back to the ad ARPU, because I also wanted to bring it into North America broadly, as opposed to U.S. only, because I think it's important to note that in the fourth quarter we would expect the ad ARPU to grow on both a U.S. and Canada basis year-over-year."
