    "content": " Within the segment and excluding CTEH, our higher-margin environmental assessment, permitting and ecological services continue to see nice organic revenue growth tailwinds as clients have needed regulatory environmental services to maintain operations regardless of COVID. And finally, within our Remediation and Reuse segment, our trajectory of strong organic revenue growth in the first quarter was again driven by demand for our PFAS water treatment in renewable biogas or negative carbon intensity energy services. The primary driver of revenue growth in the first quarter was organic growth in our Measurement and Analysis, and Remediation and Reuse segments as well as our acquisitions of Vista, EI, ECI, Horizon and Environmental Standards. First quarter adjusted EBITDA margin was 12.2% compared to 12.6% in the prior year quarter, mainly due to higher corporate costs, partially offset by improved operating segment's adjusted EBITDA margin of 17.8% in the current quarter, up from 17.3% in the prior year quarter. And finally, in our Remediation and Reuse segment, revenues increased 96.4% year-over-year to $49.3 million, reflecting a significant increase in demand for PFAS water treatment services and organic growth in our biogas business. Based on our strong start to 2022 and the expected deceleration in our CTEH business, we reiterate our outlook for full year 2022 revenues to be in the range of $520 million to $570 million, and adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $73 million to $78 million. So that's the -- when you think about our messaging around IPO, we talked about being around $400 million to $450 million of revenue, and hoping over a 5-year period from IPO to get to the 3% to 5% corporate as a percentage of revenue, 20-ish percent total margins."
