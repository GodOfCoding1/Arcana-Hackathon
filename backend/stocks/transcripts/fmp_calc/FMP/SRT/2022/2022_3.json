    "content": " In the third quarter, we capitalized on the momentum from our sales pipeline, developed digital partnerships and focused on delivering a higher proportion of nearshore and offshore services to our clients. Despite persistent macroeconomic headwinds, we have been able to add 28 new clients year-to-date, a significant proportion of service delivery for the 8 new logos won in this quarter will be delivered from nearshore or offshore centers, exhibiting our focus of driving growth to our bottom line through higher-margin offerings. Looking towards the end of the year and into the next, we are focused on taking advantage of the momentum from our sales pipeline to drive new logos and strengthen client portfolio, identifying value-accretive digital partnerships to strengthen our platform and transitioning a greater mix of our customer portfolio with nearshore and offshore delivery to drive higher margins through a more cost-efficient labor approach."
