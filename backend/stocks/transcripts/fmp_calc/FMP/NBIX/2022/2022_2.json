    "content": " But it just seems like at the lower end of the guidance range, you're essentially assuming kind of no growth the next few quarters and at the high end, you're assuming essentially similar level of growth from a dollar perspective to second half of last year. We're really pleased with the DTC campaign, and it's meeting our expectations in terms of the behaviors that we're looking for in the target patients in care partner population. And all of these things together are what's really driving the strong growth that we've seen this year, the raising of our guidance and our expectation that we've got a lot of headroom here in terms of this market opportunity and we're going to continue to invest as we see appropriate. And so even though we're five years into the launch, we feel like there's a long way to go in terms of continuing to develop the TD market and to help as many patients as possible. And if we did see, Marc, at this time, something structurally that was going to change, that would give us a lot of concern over our ability to continue to allow patients to have access to this medicine or a significant impact to our price when we're thinking about 2023, we would give everybody as much of a heads up as possible."
