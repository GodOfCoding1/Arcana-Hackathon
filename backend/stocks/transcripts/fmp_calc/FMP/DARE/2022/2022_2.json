    "content": " As we've mentioned on previous calls, bacterial vaginosis is the most common cause of vaginitis worldwide and is estimated to impact approximately 21 million women in the U.S. Organon, our global collaborator for XACIATO, shares our commitment to advance critically needed innovations in women's health, and we believe that Organon's unique focus on women's health, coupled with their strong commercial capabilities, will ensure that XACIATO reaches the women most impacted by this condition. So in terms of near-term catalysts, we look forward to keeping you updated on the launch of XACIATO, our FDA-approved product for the treatment of bacterial vaginosis, our collaboration with Organon, who is a global leader in women's health, our pivotal study start for a potential first-in-category contraceptive program, Ovaprene, which is subject to a license agreement for commercialization in the U.S. with Bayer, who maintains a global leadership position in contraception as well as 2 data readouts from our Phase I/II DARE-HRT1 program and our DARE-VVA1 program. With our diverse portfolio, we seek to bring to market differentiated prescription therapies that really prioritize women's health and well-being and expand those treatment options where not exist, enhance the outcomes where current standard of care has meaningful shortcomings and improve ease of use for women, where a more compelling form factor can drive adoption primarily in the areas as we've been discussing of contraception, vaginal health, sexual health and facility and where we think there are really compelling market opportunities."
