    "content": "  As a result of these three factors, in the not quite five years since going public, we have assembled a portfolio of one FDA approved product and seven investigational product candidates or potential product candidates entered into two commercialization collaborations, one with Organon and one with Bayer and have done so with relatively modest capital deployment and leveraging SBIR NIH grants for four of our programs, an NIH collaborative research agreement for one of our programs and a foundation grant of nearly $50 million for one of our preclinical programs."
