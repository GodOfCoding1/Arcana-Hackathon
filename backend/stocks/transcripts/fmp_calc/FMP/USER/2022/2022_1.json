    "content": " The operating margin was minus 19% and excluding the accounting benefit of $1.3 million that increased subscription revenue in the quarter, the operating margin would have been minus 23%, which still compares favorably to minus 35% in the year ago period. And I think that's really powerful because it bridges this thing that we talked about UserTesting called the empathy gap or just what is it like to really be my customer, and how many people in these organizations that are thinking about how they're going to meet customers in the Metaverse, are they themselves people spending all kinds of time in the Metaverse, that might not be the case. So I would say, even individual teams that are using our product, the usage might really run the gamut or sometimes it's really important, but tactical thing they're doing maybe with a frontline designer, and sometimes it's a project that's getting visibility much higher in the organization, and so it's a real mix. We do have customers that want to run larger sample sizes, if you will, to the point of your question, and we do now have capabilities in our product to use machine learning, things like our interactive path flows that help you analyze the customer experience narratives much more quickly and does enable us to think about having more substantively larger sample sizes, and you're right that the pricing model does also now line up with that."
