I'll just double down on David's comment that, I think, we've done a good job in the leadership team and the management at Atkore, but communicating that even in the past to know what's steel cost or what's PVC each of you investors understand from the tracking other companies, there's so much freight costs up over 40% in labor and what's the cost of lumber for a crate that we've done a pretty effective job of accurately communicating to our customers."
