    "content": " But that's from indicators like that to the architectural billing index, that David, mentioned in his prepared remarks, 17 months of positive ABI, we're still more optimistic for the future than I am for this year on volume, our capabilities to deliver new products to grow on. And that's why, again, when shareholders ask us questions about the ability to deliver our future earnings is all these things that we've mapped out is just at what point do we communicate out because, obviously, there's competitors and so forth there, but this drives exactly why we have comfort in our $800 million to $900 million and never seen $600 million as we go forward. But at the end of the day, there's products, for example, that we don't provide like switchgear that there's four or five other people in the electrical industry that they've gone from seven, eight weeks delivery times to a year. One could make the case that even if there's a slowdown in residential markets, and/or recession and consumer things that we need workers out on job sites, so I can make a case that there's a slight recession in those markets, and it opens up more people to work in the construction industry, where we're going to have a higher fall-through rate of our electric product, it could actually help Atkore."
