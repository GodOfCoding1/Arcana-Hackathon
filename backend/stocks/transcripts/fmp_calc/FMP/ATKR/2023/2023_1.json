    "content": " I would say for this year, we are seeing more price that we're holding on to, and/or just commodity costs drop them faster, different things like that and our value equations, that we are able to raise, as you mentioned, our whole year forecast for EBITDA of around $100 million. But I think there's enough other things that we're doing well, i.e., the volume growth, new product development or new products that typically have higher margin, our value equation for customers that are driving -- in some places we're getting margin, even more as we go forward, that we're comfortable raising our guide for the year, but -- and also very comfortable still on the FY '25 guide. And so, there's different dynamics in S&I as to when price changes in some of our other pipelines of how long we hold on the price versus the commodities coming down and what have you -- But in general, I would say that, that $70 million is a pretty significant reduction year-over-year. I will say, because we have great management teams literally across the board -- like, you look at what David spoke about with S&I, just an amazing quarter that for David, myself and the executive staff, we're having an all-day media on Thursday, and it's all about 2025 and 2028."
