    "content": " While this quarter was effectively breakeven on adjusted free cash flows due to a $15 million adverse impact from working capital changes, in the last 12 months we've generated $107 million in adjusted free cash flow, and we still believe that this business model will continue to have strong free cash flow. Given our sectors' late cycle exposure and the lag effect involving new projects, we now believe this offshore oil and gas recovery will benefit our business in earnest in 2023 and beyond, with the next couple of quarters of this year representing a transition period. In terms of other headwinds that the business is currently facing, we have -- not as much in the March quarter as the December quarter, but we are going through a period from a timing of repairs standpoint where we are having heavier than normal full cycle timing impacts from repairs, primarily related to the AW139 portion of our fleet, not exclusively, but that's the biggest driver is in our AW139, which are not all the current AW139 fleet is on a full just to sell PBH program. However, we did note in our prepared remarks that we think that the next couple of quarters of this calendar year will likely be more of a transition period for the business, and that broader based increase and activity, particularly on the oil and gas side would be a 2023 and beyond, as we see it multiyear growth cycle for the business. And I would also note, a large portion of our U.K. business is our U.K. search and rescue contract, which isn't related to oil and gas, and it's a contract with the government."
