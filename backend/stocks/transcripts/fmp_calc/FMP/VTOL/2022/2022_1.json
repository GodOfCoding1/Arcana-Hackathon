    "content": " As of June 30, synergy projects representing $42 million of annualized savings have been completed, which means that we have already captured over 80% of the total synergy projects at the 1-year anniversary of the merger, placing the company well on the way to achieving our target of at least $50 million of annual run rate savings. With that reminder, the current year quarter versus pro forma prior year quarter EBITDA adjusted for special items and asset dispositions was $40 million for the current quarter compared to $48 million in the prior year results. Finally, we generated adjusted free cash flow, excluding net proceeds from asset sales, of $39 million for the current quarter, which is consistent with the average for the 2 prior quarters. Since the merger last June, we have generated $180 million in adjusted free cash flow, excluding net proceeds from asset sales, and continue to believe that this business model will have a strong free cash flow. I know you guys don't give guidance per se, but can you perhaps walk us through what it would take to get to the $1.5 billion and $240 million of EBITDA when you first announced the Bristow deal?"
