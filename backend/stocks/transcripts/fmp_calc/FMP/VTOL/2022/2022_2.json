As previously disclosed in July of this year, Bristow repurchased approximately 550,000 shares for gross consideration of $15 million, representing an average purchase price of $27.24 per share. EBITDA adjusted to exclude special items and asset dispositions was $45 million for the second quarter of fiscal year 2022, compared to $40 million in the first quarter or an increase of approximately $5 million. Income tax expense was $14.5 million in the current quarter, primarily driven by the previously mentioned bankruptcy-related settlement, insurance proceeds and aircraft sales."
