    "content": " Meanwhile, we have continued to make investments to strengthen our business, such as the new long-term highly favorable maintenance support agreements for our global AW139 helicopter fleet, while at the same time returning capital to shareholders with $10 million of share repurchases executed over the last two months at an average repurchase price of $23.48 per share. I think we've spent a good amount of time -- I know we spent a good amount of time and I think we've made some good progress over the last 18-months doing the diligence, developing these relationships, determining who are the right teams with the right technology and the right capital base that we want to partner with, that are going to have aircraft that not only will meet operating specifications, but will be good fits for Bristow's mission profile. The one in the Falklands is a long-term contract that has a few years remaining with the extensions, and then there is a shorter amount of time remaining on the one -- the smaller contract here in the U.K. And on the maintenance buy-in, the $55 million that's going to be paid between now and year-end, how is that treated from an accounting standpoint?"
