    "content": " We're really proud of our third quarter 2022 financial results, in which Axonics generated record total revenue of $70.4 million. I mean, it's great to have 830,000 people visit the website, learn about Axonics and obviously, that number is going to be well over 1 million clearly by the end of the year. I think we're clearly causing the matter of seeing revenue growth, the question that the market is expanding and we're getting -- taking advantage of that but we're also creating that situation. So I think what I would say is, since we're ramping up production of F15 and we'll be bringing R20 online as that's approved at the end of the year, that will have some impact anytime you start manufacturing. And I think given what's happened over the last two quarters and given where we are today with manufacturing, I think it would be safe to say that people wanted to apply a 71% gross margin to Q4, that would be perfectly fine and in line with where we are now. But if you're not doing -- in your network, if you're not doing some thousands of units, you're not going to get the HCA price and that's how we're able to try to keep things slotted."
