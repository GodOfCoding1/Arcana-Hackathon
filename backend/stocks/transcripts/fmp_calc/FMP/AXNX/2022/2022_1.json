So for existing accounts that we've been working with who've had some patients for various reasons that are not suitable in the physician's mind for a rechargeable system, we're getting that business today. Your line is now open. We stack up some patients on the first day or the first week, so that we got -- make sure you're doing the right thing, and you're comfortable as a physician, making these injections.,and then it's -- we don't need to be there. And so I think like probably most every medical device company in the industry, we've all seen certain components whether it's epoxy or a resistor a capacitor get swallowed up by some wholesaler, who then increases the price on you, but nothing what that I would deem material. So I think that any level of investigation that anybody does surveys, individual conversations or just looking at the numbers, I think it's going to be really obvious that if any physician wants to -- how should we say attach their wagon to a certain horse, it's Axonics not the legacy provider. Your line is now open. But in some instances, some of those accounts still gave some business to our competitor just because the patient may have had one in their body before, and it was working okay and -- or maybe the patient gained an extra 150 pounds and they didn't think that rechargeable was a good idea because they couldn't reach around, or any one of a number of things. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. So, it's -- I can give you anecdotal stories, where docs have even come up to me in the seminar recently in Denver last weekend and say, I got two patients already from the Find Real Relief campaign and then I have got two external trials and one is already being implanted."
