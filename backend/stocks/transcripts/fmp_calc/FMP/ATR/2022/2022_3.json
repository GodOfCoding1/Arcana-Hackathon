    "content": " Pharma's adjusted EBITDA margin was 31%, which included the onetime inflationary wage payment to certain employees in Europe of approximately $2.2 million. This segment's adjusted EBITDA margin for the quarter was 12%, and this included the onetime inflationary wage payment to certain employees in Europe of approximately $1.9 million. Considering the currency headwinds and the uncertainties we are facing, as outlined by Stephan, we expect our fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $0.73 to $0.83 per share, which includes approximately $0.05 per share impact due to the start-up and ERP implementation costs related to our injectables division. And I think last quarter, Bob, you mentioned Europe profitability actually being kind of at that 15% threshold that you're looking for in Beauty and Home."
