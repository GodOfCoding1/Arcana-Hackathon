    "content": " As Mitch said, we delivered another strong quarter with adjusted earnings per share of $2.64, up 17% over prior year, driven by significant revenue growth and strong margins. We delivered a strong adjusted EBITDA margin of 16.4%, up 100 basis points compared to prior year and 110 basis points sequentially despite the impact of inflation and supply chain disruptions. Year-to-date, we've generated $282 million of free cash flow with $209 million in the second quarter, up compared to prior year, driven by our strong net income growth. LGM's adjusted EBITDA margin increased 50 basis points to 17.1% and was up 150 basis points sequentially, largely driven by accelerated pricing actions to offset inflation and positive mix. And we now anticipate 16% to 17% ex currency sales growth for the full year, slightly above our previous expectation, driven by higher prices to mitigate the increased pace of inflation, partially offset by a lower volume outlook in base apparel. Lastly, we continue to anticipate investing up to $350 million on fixed capital and IT projects and roughly $35 million in operating expense, adding capabilities and new capacity particularly in key strategic platforms such as Intelligent Labels, which is poised to grow more than 20% annually in the coming years."
