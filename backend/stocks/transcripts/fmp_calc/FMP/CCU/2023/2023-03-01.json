    "content": " Top-line decreased 6.6%, driven by 5.5% drop in volumes, however, 10% growth versus Q4, 2019, and a 1.1% decrease in average prices in Chilean pesos. In terms of our segment, in the Chile operating segment, top line grew 3.6% in Q4, 2022, due to a 12.4% growth in average prices, partially compensated by 7.8% lower volumes. In International Business Operating segment, which includes Argentina, Bolivia, Paraguay and Uruguay, net sales dropped 27.6%, mainly as a result of a contraction of 26.7% average prices in CLP, although the increase in local currency in line with inflation, while volumes contracted 1.1%, the growth against Q4, 2019 was 4.7%. Despite what we do in terms of measuring promotion effectiveness of revenue management efforts, the key, and this is very important in our beer portfolio, is that we are entering the year with a very good brand equity level, which ensure us that we could maintain our price points and propositions and also, as a consequence, rationalize promotions and discounts. We are with high level of not only brand equity, as I mentioned, but also growing market share, especially in Chile in both alcoholic and nonalcoholic products, which is good because at the end, we have been doing big efforts in revenue management."
