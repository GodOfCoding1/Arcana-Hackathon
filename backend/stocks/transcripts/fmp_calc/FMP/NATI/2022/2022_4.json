Despite ongoing global macroeconomic uncertainty, we delivered on the 2022 targets that we shared at our September investor conference with record revenue of $1.7 billion, up 13% year-over-year and non-GAAP operating margin of 20%, up 130 basis points compared to 2021. And even in a wide range of downturn scenarios, we now expect to exceed our 300 basis point non-GAAP margin expansion target. Semiconductor and Electronics reported 2022 revenue of $433 million, up 10% year-over-year, with Q4 orders down 10% year-over-year, in line with our expectations for the quarter. Aerospace, defense and government delivered strong results with 2022 revenue of $412 million, up 9% year-over-year, with Q4 orders down 12% year-over-year. And even in a wide range of downturn scenarios, we now expect to exceed our 300 basis point non-GAAP margin expansion target. Non-GAAP operating margin was 20%, a record for NI had an increase of 130 basis points year-over-year, demonstrating the continued focus we have had on driving variability and efficiency in our cost structure.
