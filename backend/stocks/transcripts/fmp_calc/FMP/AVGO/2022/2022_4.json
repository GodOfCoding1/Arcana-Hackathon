    "content": " For the year, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m pleased to report that consolidated revenue hit a record of $33.2 billion, growing 21% year-on-year, yet another year of double-digit organic growth. In our fiscal Q4 \u00e2\u0080\u009822, consolidated net revenue was a record $8.9 billion, up 21% year-on-year. Semiconductor solutions revenue increased 26% year-on-year to $7.1 billion, and infrastructure software revenue grew 4% year-on-year to $1.8 billion. Next, our storage connectivity revenue was a record $1.2 billion or 17% of semiconductor revenue and up 50% year-on-year. In Q4, infrastructure software revenue of $1.8 billion grew 4% year-on-year and represented 21% of total revenue. Based on current business trends and conditions, our guidance for the first quarter of fiscal 2023 is for consolidated revenues of $8.9 billion and adjusted EBITDA of approximately 63% of projected revenue. One moment for our next question. One moment for our next question. One moment for our next question. One moment for our next question. One moment for our next question. As you see there, Q4 year-on-year was just 13% -- and I shouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t say just -- was 13%, and Q1 was actually still 1% up, but there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s obviously some movements in between, but -- and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m sure that has something to do with COVID logistics -- impact on logistics chain of our largest customer, but I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really tell in the bigger picture. One moment for our next question. One moment for our next question. One moment for our next question. One moment for our next question."
