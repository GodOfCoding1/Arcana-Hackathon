    "content": " So we're in an unusual situation today, in that, we are simultaneously facing both demand headwinds across our network of stores given the current macro environment as well as a supply challenge in a subgroup of stores due to the constraints up on exam capacity, but we see these as temporary and we remain confident in the long-term strength of our business model. For full year 2022, as a percentage of net revenue, we now expect cost applicable to revenue to increase approximately 290 to 300 basis points versus last year, primarily due to the deleveraging of fixed costs as well as lapping last year's record performance that benefited from product mix shifts and an elevated ticket. We operate in a highly fragmented industry with ongoing structural tailwinds, such as an aging population and increased eye strain from such things as greater screen usage, and we believe that several initiatives, including our remote medicine rollout should help us to get our exam capacity more in line with the demand that there is for exams at our stores. If I were to give you kind of a normalized version of where SG&A margins moved structurally, I would say, a little wage inflation for associates, which I think we've managed pretty well; a slight deleveraging of advertising, but we are going to leverage this year even amid that $200 million miss; and then from there, rents are up a little."
