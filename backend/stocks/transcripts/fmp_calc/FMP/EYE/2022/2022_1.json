    "content": " For the first quarter, net revenue decreased 1.2% versus our record Q1 sales last year and adjusted comparable store sales declined 6.8% compared to the strong 35.8% increase in the first quarter of 2021. In Q1, 2022, net revenue decreased 1.2% compared to 2021 due to the Omicron impact, macroeconomic headwinds, the constraint to exam capacity and the exceptional growth last year. Against the backdrop of what we know today our updated 2022 outlook projects; net revenue between $2.01 billion and $2.07 billion; adjusted comparable store sales growth compared to last year in the range of negative 4% to negative 7%; adjusted operating income between $85 million and $105 million; and adjusted diluted EPS between $0.65 and $0.80, assuming 82 million weighted average diluted shares. For full year 2022 as a percentage of net revenue, we expect cost applicable to revenue to increase 350 to 375 basis points versus last year primarily due to the deleverage of fixed costs, as well as the lapping of last year's record performance that benefited from product mix, shift and an elevated ticket."
