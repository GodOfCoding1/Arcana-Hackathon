    "content": " Though this was slightly behind last year's second quarter adjusted EBITDA, as anticipated in our internal projections, our growth and expansion has been able to mitigate much of the financial impact of the rising cost of labor and supplies, as well as the $7.4 million we estimated in 2022 for Medicare reimbursement reductions. For the second quarter of 2022, RadNet reported revenue from its Imaging Centers reporting segment of $352.8 million and adjusted EBITDA of $55.5 million, which excludes losses from the AI reporting segment. As compared with last year's second quarter, revenue increased $18.9 million or 5.7% and adjusted EBITDA decreased $1.7 million or 3%, also excluding Provider Relief Funding received in 2021. Including our AI reporting segment, revenue was $354.4 million in the second quarter of 2022, an increase of 6.1% from $333.9 million in last year's second quarter. So, we did see some slowing of our growth in the second quarter here, and we do think that we - a lot of that has to do with the ongoing impact of COVID, not only with patients and their hesitancy to get exams done, particularly exams that are more elective in nature, and we've noted that in our mammography business, although it is growing year-over-year, it's falling significantly behind the projections that we had put together for that modality in 2022."
