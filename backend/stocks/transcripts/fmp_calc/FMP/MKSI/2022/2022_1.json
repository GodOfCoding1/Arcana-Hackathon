    "content": " In the first quarter, revenue from our Advanced Electronics Market comprised 11% of overall revenue. Sales to our Semiconductor Market declined 1% sequentially in the first quarter, in line with our expectations, reflecting continued supply chain constraints, as well as a temporary shutdown at our Shenzhen facility due to local government COVID-19 measures. As we look to the second quarter, we expect revenue from Advanced Electronics to be down sequentially led by continued softness flexible PCB equipment spending. For 2021, revenues from Advanced Electronics Market comprised 15% of MKS\u00e2\u0080\u0099 total revenue and on a pro forma basis with Atotech\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 2021 reported financial results would have comprised 32% of overall revenue. In the first quarter, Semiconductor sales were $488 million, down 1% sequentially but up 19% year-over-year, reflecting broad-based demand from our vacuum and photonic solutions. While first quarter research and development expenses remained flat sequentially, reflecting continued investment in product development, first quarter operating expenses were down $3 million sequentially to $144 million and below our guidance range as a result of strong cost controls as well as the timing of certain equity compensation expenses, which will be reflected in the second quarter. Even though business levels remain robust, we expect second quarter revenue of $730 million, plus or minus $30 million, primarily due to continued supply chain constraints. Your line is open.
