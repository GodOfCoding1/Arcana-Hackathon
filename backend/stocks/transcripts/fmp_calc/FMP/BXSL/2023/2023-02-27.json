    "content": " Yet we also hear from our investors and other market participants, that it's less about averages, particularly averages that are obscured by exclusions, and more about the tails, mainly the percent of one's portfolio below an interest coverage ratio of one-time on a forward basis using higher rates. If we flow through the December 31 spot rates, we can see that BXSL would have roughly 8% of its portfolio with an interest coverage ratio below one compared to the Lincoln private credit markets database, which have more than twice that amount, a very stark difference. Next turning to the balance sheet on slide 13, we ended the fourth quarter with $9.6 billion of total portfolio investments, of which approximately 98% are floating rate at a weighted average yield of 10.7%."
