    "content": " In terms of yields the returns, we generated a dividend yield of 8.8% over the last 12-months, based on quarter and NAV, which included a regular dividend of $0.53 per share, and two special dividends totaling $ 0.25 per share in the current quarter. Going into our balance sheet and dividend performance BXSL ended the first quarter with total portfolio investments of $10 billion, outstanding debt of $5.6 billion and total net assets of $4.4 billion. Now moving on to our capitalization liquidity our balance sheet is comprised of efficient diversified sources of capital, including a significant amount of fixed rate unsecured debt, as of quarter end, 56% of our debt outstanding was in the form of unsecured bonds, which provides the company with significant flexibility and cushion as well for potential for additional earnings upside as rates continue to rise as Brad mentioned. So I give - maybe that stat helps a little bit to answer your question, in the sense that because of our loan to value because of where we sit in the capital structure - types of businesses that were focused on how they're more cash flow generative, in a rising rate environment, we don't think even if they get to 5% that our portfolio would be under a lot of distress."
