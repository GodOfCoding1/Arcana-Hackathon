    "content": " If the average base rate would have been at June 30 level for the entire quarter, we estimate that second quarter net investment income would have been 18% higher or an additional $0.11 per share. If base rates were to increase another 100 basis points from June 30 level, we estimate that another $0.09 benefit to net investment income or 32% above second quarter actual NII all else being equal. In the second quarter, our net investment income of $0.62 per share exceeded our regular dividend by $0.09, representing dividend coverage of 117%. Turning to our balance sheet, BXSL ended the second quarter with total portfolio investments of $101 billion, outstanding debt of $5.8 billion, and total net assets of $4.4 billion. Net asset value per share decreased from $26.13 to $25.89, primarily due to the special dividend, which was paid from accumulated undistributed net investment income from prior quarters. The $105 million of net investment income represents $0.62 per share, up from $0.61 per share in the prior quarter, mainly driven by higher interest rates and still well in excess of our regular dividend of $0.53. Our second quarter weighted average yield on debt investments and other income-producing securities at fair value was 7.8%, up from 7.2% in the prior quarter, driven by increase in base rates. Over the same period, the average LTV of our borrowers and the mix of first lien loans has remained relatively constant with LTV at 46% as of the end of this quarter versus 44% a year ago and the concentration of first lien assets in the portfolio at 97.6% versus 98.1% a year ago."
