    "content": " Switching over to Cohu's systems business, it added 58% of third quarter revenue at 43% non-GAAP gross margin. Gross margin in Q3 was 47.5%, about 100 basis points higher than guidance driven by Cohu's recurring business and differentiated products. With a three-year compound annual growth rate of 6.5%, Cohu's high-margin recurring business provides consistent cash flow through industry cycles. And as we put on the slide deck and in the remarks, we do run a pretty strong recurring business, which in the last 12 months is about $336 million, and it's been growing over the years, and we think that that's going to continue as more systems that we have shipped over the last 12, 18 months start coming out of warranty. So if you put it all together, well, I guess -- and I touched on recurring as well, which has been on a last 12-month basis, about 42%, I think, of our business, 41%, 42% at $336 million and growing and should continue growing as more of our recent shipments start to roll out off of warranty periods."
