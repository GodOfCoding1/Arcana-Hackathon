    "content": " Fourth quarter non-GAAP gross margin of 48.8% is a Cohu record, reflects 470 basis points growth year-over-year, and it's better than our target financial model at this revenue level. Gross margin benefited from steady growth of Cohu's recurring revenue, where we achieved a 3-year compound annual growth rate of 5.2% through Q4 and represented approximately 45% of fourth quarter revenue with 55% non-GAAP gross margin. Cohu's test interface annual revenue grew over 9% year-over-year, demonstrating the value differentiation of our solutions when integrated with our testers and handlers. Gross margin in Q4 set a new record for Cohu at 48.8%, about 180 basis points higher than guidance driven by Cohu's recurring business and differentiated products. Full year 2022 gross margin also set a new record for Cohu at 47.2%, which is a 360 basis point improvement year-over-year and tracking to our midterm target of 49%. With a 3-year compound annual growth rate of 5.2%, Cohu's high-margin recurring business provides consistent cash flow through industry cycles. Well, I guess some in mobility is still, but a lot outside of mobility and significantly increasing the fraction of that revenue that's in the analog and power IC test, which we grew to about 32% of the semi test business last year. And then just kind of more holistically, if you -- might be sort of favorable events that kind of really took the gross margins towards 49% this last quarter, but that's at a sub $800 million annualized revenue level."
