    "content": " Importantly, gross margin of 46.5% continues to progress toward our three-year target financial model and benefited from growth of our semiconductor test business as well as increased in-sourcing of contactor manufacturing, now at 66% at the end of Q2. We're not forecasting 2023 yet, but based on early customer projections and increasing wafer manufacturing capacity, we anticipate another ramp sometime near the middle of next year, driven by high-end smartphone demand continued growth of automotive ADAS and ex EV, strong industrial and data center. Regardless, we're very focused on continuing to grow the business, expanding the use of Diamondx, vision inspection systems, interface products and data analytics, such that Cohu can achieve our $1 billion revenue target model and 49% non-GAAP gross margin. We've made significant progress over the last six months, transitioning manufacturing from outside suppliers to our factory in the Philippines, resulting in lower cost and a 300 basis point expansion of the contactor business gross margin, while continuing to increase contactor insourcing to reach our goal of 80% by end of this year and thereafter with normal efficiency improvements, expect to achieve the contactor gross margin target of high 40% by mid-2023. But I -- like I said, I don't know the exact timing on all of that when -- it's a bit of a reading the crystal ball here based on the customers' request or at least early request, early forecast for when they would like to see product delivery, and that's going to get adjusted here over the next six months as we get closer to it."
