Today, I am pleased to announce our quarterly revenue of $1 billion \u2013 $1.36 billion for fiscal year Q3 2022, which was 51% year-over-year growth and 16% quarter-on-quarter growth sequentially. First, again, our fiscal third quarter net revenue totaled $1.36 billion, up 51% year-on-year and up 16% quarter-on-quarter. This 210% growth was well above with the higher end of our guidance range of $0.17 to $0.19, demonstrating strong operating leverages and the customers accepting the value of our total IT solutions. Based on our current demand and capacity, we are forecasting at least $1.45 billion revenue for the coming June quarter to end the fiscal 2022 on a strong note at above $5 billion yearly revenue. In closing, our 51% year-over-year revenue growth and $1.55 quarterly EPS proved that our total IT solution strategy has been gaining customers' preference and trust in this growing pen. I'm pleased to report solid fiscal third quarter revenue of $1.36 billion, 51% year-on-year increase and 16% quarter-on-quarter increase. Revenues for the trailing four quarters of Q4 '21 through Q3 of fiscal year '22, totaled $4.63 billion. We achieved $846 million in organic enterprise channel and AI and revenues, representing 62% of Q3 revenues versus 64% last quarter. Our OEM clients and large data center segment achieved $423 million in revenues, representing 31% of Q3 revenues, versus 23% last quarter, which was up 54% year-over-year and up 54% quarter-over-quarter, with strong growth driven by our large, new and existing data center customers and OEM appliance customers. Our 5G/telco, Edge and IoT segment achieved $86 million in revenues, representing 7% of Q3 revenues versus 12% last quarter. On a non-GAAP basis, operating expenses increased 6% quarter-on-quarter and increased 15% year-on-year to $110 million. Cash flow used in operations for Q3 was $228 million compared to cash flow used in operations of $53 in Q2, as accounts receivable and inventories grew due to increasing demand from our customers and to mitigate the continued impact of supply chain disruptions, including CapEx of $11 million, Q3 negative free cash flow totaled $239 million. For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, ending June 30, 2022, we expect net sales in the range of $1.4 billion to $1.48 billion, GAAP diluted net income per share of $1.45 to $1.64 and non-GAAP diluted net income per share of $1.51 to $1.69. The company's projections for GAAP and non-GAAP diluted net income per common share assume a GAAP tax rate of 17.4%, a non-GAAP tax rate of 19.4%, and a fully diluted share count of $54.3 million for GAAP and 55.79% shares for non-GAAP. For the fiscal year ending June 30, 2022, we are raising our revenue guidance range from $4.2 billion, $4.6 billion to a new range of $4.96 billion to $5.04 billion and raising our GAAP diluted net income per share outlook from at least $2.77 to a range of $4.16 to $4.35, and our non-GAAP diluted net income per share from lease 320 to a range of $4.53 to $4.71."
