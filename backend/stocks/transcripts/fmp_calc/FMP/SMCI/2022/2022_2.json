Today, I am pleased to announce our quarterly revenue of $1.17 billion for fiscal Q2 2022, which was 41% year-over-year growth, and our sequential growth was 14%. First, again, our fiscal second quarter net revenue totaled $1.17 billion, up 41% year-on-year and up 14% quarter-on-quarter, at the higher end of our guidance range of $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion. Our fiscal second quarter non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.88, compared to $0.63 in the same quarter last year, which was 40% growth and at the higher end of our guidance range of $0.70 to $0.90. We are seeing continued strength across all geographies and strong demand for our products and services, resulting in fiscal second quarter revenue of $1.17 billion, a 41% year-on-year increase and up 14% quarter-on-quarter. Super Micro\u2019s Q2 FY 2022 recorded revenue growth across all three of our market verticals, achieving $756 million in the Organic Enterprise and Channel and AI/ML vertical, $274 million in OEM appliance and large data center vertical and $142 million in the 5G/telco and Edge/IoT vertical. Turning to operating expenses, Q2 OpEx on a GAAP basis increased 3% quarter-on-quarter and 14% year-on-year to $113 million. On a non-GAAP basis, operating expenses increased 2% quarter-on-quarter and increased 15% year-on-year to $103 million. We expect net sales in the range of $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion, GAAP diluted net income per share of $0.58 to $0.81 and non-GAAP diluted net income per share of $0.70 to $0.90 for the third quarter of fiscal year 2022 ending March 31, 2022. The company\u2019s projections for GAAP and non-GAAP diluted net income per common share assume a GAAP tax rate of 15%, a non-GAAP tax rate of 16.5% and a fully diluted share count of 54.5 million for GAAP and 56 million shares for non-GAAP. The outlook for Q3 of fiscal year 2022 GAAP diluted net income per common share includes approximately $8.5 million in expected stock-based compensation and $1.7 million in other expenses, net of tax effects, that are excluded from our non-GAAP diluted net income per common share. We are maintaining our revenue guidance range of $4.2 billion to $4.6 billion for the fiscal year 2022 ending June 30, 2022, and our GAAP diluted net income per share outlook of at least $2.77 and non-GAAP diluted net income per share of at least $3.20. The outlook for fiscal year 2022 fully diluted GAAP earnings per share includes approximately $37 million in expected stock-based compensation and other expenses, net of tax effects that are excluded from non-GAAP diluted net income per common share.
