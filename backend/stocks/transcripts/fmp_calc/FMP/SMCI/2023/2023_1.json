    "content": " First, revenue for the first quarter of fiscal year 2023 totaled $1.85 billion, up 79% year-on-year; above our guidance range of $1.52 billion to $1.62 billion, with growth rate at about 10 times greater than the overall IT industry. I'm pleased to report Q1 fiscal 2023 revenues of $1.85 billion, a 79% year-on-year and 13% quarter-on-quarter increase. We achieved $840 million in our Enterprise and Channel vertical, representing 45% of Q1 revenues versus 51% last quarter, that vertical was up 16% year-over-year and 1% quarter-over-quarter. Our OEM appliance and large datacenter segment achieved $921 million in revenues, representing 50% of Q1 revenues versus 44% last quarter. On a year-on-year basis, U.S. revenues increased 131% as we gained market share with our advanced rack-scale Total IT Solutions for high-growth server workloads. Turning to operating expenses, Q1 OpEx on a GAAP basis increased by 4% quarter-on-quarter and 17% year-on-year to $127.4 million. On a non-GAAP basis, operating expenses increased 3% quarter-on-quarter and increased 16% year-on-year to $117.3 million. For the second quarter of fiscal 2023 ending December 31, 2022 we expect net sales in the range of $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion, GAAP diluted net income per share of $2.54 to $2.81 and non-GAAP diluted net income per share of $2.64 to $2.90. The outlook for fiscal year 2023 fully diluted GAAP EPS includes approximately $32.7 million in expected stock-based compensation and other expenses, net of tax effects that are excluded from non-GAAP diluted net income per common share.
