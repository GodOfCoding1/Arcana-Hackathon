    "content": " Finally, we continue to aggressively repurchase shares during the third quarter and into the fourth quarter as we repurchased approximately $3.6 million shares of common stock at a total cost of approximately $183.9 million from August, 2022 through October, 2022 year to date through October, we have repurchased $12.3 million shares of common stock or approximately 16% of total shares outstanding at a total cost of approximately $683.9 million. Attendance benefited largely from an increase in demand primarily from international guests when compared to prior year, which was impacted by more severe COVID-19 related restrictions on international travel Attendance during the quarter was unfavorably impacted by adverse weather including impacts of Hurricane Ian in September, 2022, which led to closures at the company's parks in Florida and Virginia for a combined 15 operating days. In part, per capita spending improved due to a combination of factors including pricing initiatives, improved product quality and mix, and the impact of new or enhanced and expanded venues and or other park offerings, operating expenses increased $20.8 million or 10.7% when compared to the third quarter of 2021. If a percent of revenue was 9.4% for the third quarter of 2022 compared to 10.3% for the third quarter of 2021, we believe that approximately 20 million to 25 million of costs in the third quarter compared to 2019 are temporary unusually high inflation driven costs that we expect to moderate in the coming quarters. Now turning to our balance sheet, our current deferred revenue balance as of the end of the third quarter was $182.3 million and increase of approximately 5.1% when compared to September of 2021, which included the impact of some COVID-19 related product extensions and onetime items compared to September, 2019."
