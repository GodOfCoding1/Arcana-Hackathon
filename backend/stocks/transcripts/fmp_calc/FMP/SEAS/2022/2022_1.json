    "content": " We repurchased approximately 1.5 million shares of common stock at a total cost of approximately $109.9 million during the first quarter of 2022, and we completed our previously authorized share repurchase program by purchasing an additional $140.1 million in the second quarter of 2022. As Marc mentioned, our results of operations for the first quarter of 2022 and 2021 continue to be impacted by the global COVID-19 pandemic, due in part to a decline in both international and group-related attendance in both periods. As Marc discussed, the increase in admissions per capita was primarily due to the realization of higher prices in our admission products, resulting from our strategic pricing efforts and was largely offset by the impact of our admissions product mix, due in part to an increase in pass visitation and the impact of park mix when compared to the prior year quarter. Our current deferred revenue balance as of the end of the first quarter was $208 million, an increase of approximately 7.6% when compared to March of 2021 which included the impact of some COVID-19-related extensions. Where then that -- there's a little bit of a drag on that number obviously is just from the mix of pass holders visiting, who spend more in total revenue, but have less per visit and then we have some other, as I mentioned, just not having everything open that we'd like to, would have helped as well."
