    "content": " I'd say, opportunistically, where we have products that offer our customers that flexibility, we're taking advantage of that with our customers to rethink their portfolio of our products and in some cases, we've mentioned it, in particular, on the Universal side and on the management side, and we have with EUC for a number of years now seen success in pivoting that over. And just to add a little bit more, I think when customers convert to our subscription and SaaS offerings, especially the SaaS offerings, we also see the increased possibility of upselling and crossing -- cross-selling them a larger portion of our portfolio more easily because customer uptake of SaaS is easier than customer uptake of on-premise license where they would install software and deploy it, et cetera. What we mean by that is customers are now looking at their IT application assets and deciding which cloud or -- whether it's private or public cloud, the individual applications to live on based upon a number of factors, technical factors being a big consideration, business factors, cost, the desire not to get locked into any particular cloud vendor and having sovereignty over where they put their applications and data. In closing, VMware is well positioned to deliver the multi-cloud platform for all applications, enabling digital innovation and enterprise control that our customers need to accelerate their business."
