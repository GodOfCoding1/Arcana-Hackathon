    "content": " During the second quarter, we continue to extract the synergy between the two models by allowing our direct model business development personnel to leverage their own network to identify and acquire new network partners. By leveraging the scale and existing capabilities of our direct model, we have drastically accelerated the pace of our network partner acquisition and approximately 1,800 new network partners were acquired during this quarter, of which more than 70% were sourced through our direct models personnel. Once the impact of COVID diminishes, we are uniquely positioned to quickly acquire market share as direct model typically acquires POI at a faster pace than network partners due to its higher level of execution capabilities. The decrease was primarily attributable to the impact of COVID-19 during the second quarter of 2022, which resulted in a significant decline in general offline foot traffic in China, due to COVID-19 restrictions.
