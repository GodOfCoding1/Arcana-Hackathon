    "content": " Not only has it performed very well thus far, including a 14% increase in unit sales in the first quarter, but it holds significant potential for added growth, both in food service where it's predominantly today, as well as an expanding into the retail sector. Starting with food services our largest segment representing proximately 68% of our total sales, revenue of $238.3 million exceeded Q1, 2022 by $26.6 million or an increase of 30% and that included approximately $13.4 million in Dippin' Dots sales. The healthy performance in food services was driven by 157% increase in growth and novelty sales benefiting from our Dippin' Dots businesses well, 32% increase in churros sales and 27% increase in handheld sales. I think in last quarters, we had kind of tried to guide the group that you know, almost all - you can call it 100% of the profitability of dividends in q3 and q4 again, no surprise, given the seasonality in that business. So by my math, it's about 13% of historical sales in the first quarter that puts the brand on about $100 million sort of run rate or about 10% higher than last quarter. It's certainly helpful as we're starting to look at the Dippin' Dots business, being able to leverage our relationships and our customer contacts that we have to accelerate that growth and so, just really pleased with the progress that is happening on that side, led by our sales teams, really happy with that. As I sit here now, I still feel confident in our ability to do that, particularly as we get to Q3 and Q4, because I believe the things we're doing, the initiatives, getting all those inflationary stuff behind us, getting in the peak season, and I think we'll start to see volumes really kick back in and some of these new products and new ideas, new innovations are going to drive growth."
