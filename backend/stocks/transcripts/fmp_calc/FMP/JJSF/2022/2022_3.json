    "content": " Taking a look at the third quarter, revenue of $380.2 million was an all-time quarterly record, representing a 17.2% growth versus the prior year period and an over 35% increase versus our second quarter revenue. Our Retail segment also enjoyed strong growth, posting $61 million in sales and growing 13% compared to the same quarter last year and over 46% compared to the same period in fiscal 2019. Starting with Food Service, which continues to be our largest segment representing 60% of total sales, revenue of $227.8 million grew by 16% versus Q3 2021 and by almost 18% compared to Q3 of fiscal 2019. So that price increase that we took in April certainly helped that cost continue to go up in the quarter even as you mentioned, certain commodities -- projections of certain commodities are starting to come down a little bit, being one of those fuel a little bit -- I mean, our experts still kind of call out as to wait and see, but realized some of that is stabilized and some come down, again it takes a bit of time for that to also grow."
