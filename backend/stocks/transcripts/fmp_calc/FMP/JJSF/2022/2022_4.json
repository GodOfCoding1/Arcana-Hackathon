    "content": " Starting with Food Services, which continues to be our largest segment representing 60% of total sales, revenue of $256.8 million exceeded Q4 2021 by $58 million or an increase of 29.2%, including approximately $31.5 million in Dippin' Dots sales. Connor, just to add, we called out the $31.5 million benefit in the quarter from adding Dippin' Dots so you can kind of back into the math, our sales grew 14.2% excluding adding Dippin' Dots and even as another kind of benchmark, ex the Dippin' Dots business sales grew 18% versus 2019. We've talked about getting back to what J&J's normal run rate was in that 30% plus, that's something that we preach day in and day out around the company, work really hard, our sales teams did a fantastic job getting out in a difficult environment and taken some pricing where needed because of some of the cost initiatives, but we're looking forward to getting back to that spot. And then I guess kind of a question I guess around Dippin' Dots distribution costs, and then kind of segment profitability in total, obviously, their revenues that come through on Dippin' Dots upfront Q4, I'm assuming there is some profit contribution from that as well, while at the same time if I kind of do a quick math, it looks like maybe that segment is a little bit still pressured at least for the time being on the profit side and then also, we obviously see the distribution expense is still fairly high year-over-year. And then, Q3 and Q4 for Dippin' Dots are really the big quarters and that's why we feel really, really good about as we get into the back half of the year where we're going to be, but I wouldn't say Dippin' Dots had much of any impact on performance this quarter, did help profitability a bit, but the bigger impact going forward is going to be Q1, where sales are seasonal and so you won't see as much profit in that quarter."
