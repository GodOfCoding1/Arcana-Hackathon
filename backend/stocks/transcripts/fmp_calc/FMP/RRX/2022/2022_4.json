    "content": " This fourth quarter was also the eighth in a row of being price/cost positive, which, along with sizable M&A synergies, NPD mix-up and our ongoing 80/20 and lean efforts, drove 300 basis points of adjusted EBITDA margin expansion versus the prior year period. Adjusted EBITDA margin in the quarter for MCS was 27.8%, up 300 basis points compared to the prior year, primarily due to merger synergies and volume growth, partially offset by nonmaterial inflation, supply chain frictions, mix and FX headwinds. To put Climate\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fourth quarter top line results in context, the U.S. residential HVAC business faced tough comparisons, including 15% growth in the prior year quarter and a two-year stacked growth rate of nearly 40%. While there was pressure on Climate\u00e2\u0080\u0099s EBITDA margins in the fourth quarter due to lower volumes and headwinds related to material inflation, nonmaterial inflation, supply chain disruptions and currency, the segment did realize a benefit related to the capitalization of freight variances that will unwind in the first quarter of 2023. The adjusted EBITDA margin in the fourth quarter for Commercial Systems was 17.6%, up 510 basis points compared to the prior year, reflecting some moderation in freight costs along with strong execution of our 80/20 and lean initiatives, partially offset by commodity and other nonmaterial product cost inflation. The adjusted EBITDA margin in the quarter for Industrial was 12.2%, an increase of 650 basis points versus the prior year period."
