    "content": "  Adjusted EBITDA margin for the quarter for MCS was 24.8%, down 140 basis points compared to the prior year, factoring in commodity inflation, higher freight costs, updated corporate cost allocations and FX headwinds, largely offset by tailwinds related to favorable price realization, merger synergies, restructuring actions, higher volumes and mix. The adjusted EBITDA margin in the first quarter for Commercial Systems was 21.1%, up 510 basis points compared to the prior year, reflecting favorable price realization, positive mix and volume growth, partially offset by commodity, freight and other non-material inflation in addition to costs associated with supply chain disruptions."
