    "content": " Adjusted EBITDA margin in the quarter for MCS was 27.2%, up 30 basis points compared to the prior year, factoring favorable price realization, merger synergies and volume, partially offset by mix, higher freight costs and FX headwinds. The Climate team has a path to modestly higher margins in the fourth quarter and plans for a more significant recovery in 2023, when we expect the segment's adjusted EBITDA margin to move back into the high teens or low 20s. So hopefully, that helps. So hopefully, that helps. And so we made great progress in the third quarter and that we're now over 90% and expect to finish the year still at a 95% range as we exit the year, which means tremendous cash flow in Q4."
