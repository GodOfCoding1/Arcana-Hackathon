    "content": " More assistance is on the way as included in the Proposed Inflation Reduction Act by Senators  and signed into law as early as tomorrow and the nuclear industry would receive roughly $30 billion in tax credits which would incentivize many nuclear power plant operators keep their facilities going for many, many years to come, produce more power from those facilities and bridge the technology gap until SMRs are commercialized. Sizewell C will provide reliable low carbon power for more than 80 years, cutting gaseous creating thousands of high quality skilled jobs and long-term investment opportunity up and down the country, as well see will be one of the UK's largest ever green energy projects and this decision significantly strengthens the pipeline of new nuclear power capacity in Britain.\" Moving our discussion to the company's balance sheet, they remain strong as we exited the second quarter with $5.4 million in cash compared to $5.4 million at the end of the first quarter and compared to $3.6 million at the end of 2021. You know, it's, not like asking, I mean, there's no specific guidance that you put out there, but at the same time, and I think you acknowledge the fact too, that, the company doesn't needs to get to that 15 million to 17 million in revenue on a quarterly basis to, you know, have a cash flow, breakeven, if anything, or, that, so we have to get that, achieve that number in the ERC credits is not going, it's probably at the tail end, I mean, you've got the last time, and that's probably going to receive in next three to six months."
