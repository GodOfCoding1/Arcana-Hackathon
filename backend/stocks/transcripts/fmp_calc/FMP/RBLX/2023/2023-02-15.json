Going into usage and DAUs, we're proud to report that in January we had our highest ever DAUs at 65 million DAU and Q4 DAUs continue to show really strong growth: Europe 24%; APAC 21%, U.S. and Canada up 19% in Q4 DAUs. As it relates to cash flow, as Dave mentioned, we did continue to take an investment posture this year, we're really happy to see high returns on those investments and to see margins coming back into the business, really driven by top line growth. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open."
