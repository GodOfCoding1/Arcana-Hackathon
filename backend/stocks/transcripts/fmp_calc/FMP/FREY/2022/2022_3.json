    "content": " So, there is multiple opportunities in the existing customer grouping in this regard, both in terms of participating in Giga America per se, if that was to sort of be something we wanted to consider, but maybe more importantly, to forge upstream partnerships and downstream partnerships from cell production with companies that want to have security of supply and having product development for end applications and/or input factors into cell production located close to one of the larger cell manufacturing facilities in the U.S. Then of course, we are also looking at establishing our own capital manufacturing facility, which of course would strengthen that and working diligently across the entire raw material spectrum with strong stakeholders like ITOCHU and others that we have in the making, which we will be announcing on a regular basis is something that gives us a very strong comfort that the supply chain and raw material supply into Giga scale production is feasible, but you need to sort of be very active across multiple segments."
