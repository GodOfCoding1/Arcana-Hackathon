    "content": " But I think the way in which we are positioning this clean battery solutions, with localized production and over time decarbonize the localized supply chains is obviously something that is resonating and ultimately a critical component of ensuring decarbonization of the energy systems, 4-hour storage solutions, 2-hour storage solutions, maybe even 8-hour storage solutions are today\u2019s solutions that can be delivered with lithium-ion battery solutions and the 24M technology, where we can produce larger and thicker electrodes, basically reducing the need for additional, let\u2019s call it modules and packs and racks around them."
