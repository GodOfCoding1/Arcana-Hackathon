    "content": " As a result of the higher number of fast shipments, we now expect recognized EUV revenue this year on 40 systems to be around \u00e2\u0082\u00ac6.4 billion, which is similar to revenue last year. Compared to last quarter's view, the number of EUV fast shipments in 2022 that will now be recognized as revenue in 2023 has increased by 9 systems to a total of 15 systems with a sales value of around \u00e2\u0082\u00ac2.4 billion. We are helping our customers with the fast shipments, which actually means that if you look at our production value, so the value of the system coming out of our factory with and without fast shipments, that's actually, as I said, not as fast as we planned, but it's definitely growing."
