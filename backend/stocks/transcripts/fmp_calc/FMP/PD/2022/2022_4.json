    "content": " Customers spending more than $100,000 annually with PagerDuty grew 39% year-over-year and those spending more than $1 million grew by 65%. Additionally, our customers with ARR over $1 million increased to 43, up 65% compared to Q4 of last year. Non-GAAP operating loss improved to $2 million or 3% of revenue compared to a loss of $5 million or 8% of revenue in the same quarter last year, primarily result of sustainable sales and marketing efficiency gains and economies of scale across G&A. Quarterly billings were $106 million, which was an increase of 30% year-over-year, exceeding the high end of the range we provided during last quarter\u2019s call. So it means it\u2019s really easier for our customers to trial, easy for customers to buy and easier to apply what was historically known as Rundeck to use cases that go beyond DevOps and ITOps and can be used across IT and across other parts of the organization, so easier use in the cloud, driving direct actions integrated into PagerDuty."
