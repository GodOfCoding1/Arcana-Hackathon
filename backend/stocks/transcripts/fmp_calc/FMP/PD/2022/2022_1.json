    "content": " Revenue of $64 million grew 28% year-over-year, driven by strong expansion, particularly in the enterprise and mid-market, with customers adding users, adding new products and upgrading to our digital operations plan. I think this is something we don't talk enough about the fact that we don't have a single customer that's sold out, because we look at the ability to penetrate customers across their entire engineering workforce, which includes developers as well as IT, then we see expansion into security teams and security operations centers, customer service, et cetera. And I think in the past, we've shared some of the momentum that we have with partners like AWS, where we think there's an opportunity, not just to build product together and integrate really effectively into their cloud service environment, which helps customers as they're migrating to the cloud move much faster with significantly less risk, but it also -- it evolves into potential go-to-market opportunities. And I would just, Derrick, when I look at the diversity of our customer base and the vertical opportunities, some of the things that I think are newer to our business, one, we're really seen over the last several quarters success in highly regulated industries like financial services, where the barriers to entry for SaaS providers are higher."
