    "content": " Despite the macro backdrop, overall revenue grew 29% year-over-year to $5.6 billion as our Data Center, Gaming and Embedded segments, each delivered significant year-over-year growth and performed in line with our expectations. While we are pleased with the performance of our Data Center, Gaming and Embedded segments, each of which grew significantly year-over-year, our third quarter results also reflect lower than expected Client segment revenue. Gross margin was 50%, up 150 basis points from a year ago, primarily driven by higher revenue in the Embedded and Data Center segments, partially offset by lower Client revenue and $160 million of inventory, pricing and related charges in the graphics and client businesses. Starting with the Data Center segment, revenue was $1.6 billion, up 45% year-over-year, driven by strong growth in third-generation EPYC server processor revenue. For the full year, we expect revenue to be approximately $23.5 billion, plus or minus $300 million, an increase of approximately 43%, led by growth in the Embedded and Data Center segments. Your line is now live. Your line is now live. Your line is now live. Your line is now live. Your line is now live. Your line is now live. Your line is now live. Your line is now live. Your line is now live. And despite the macro concerns, and as you mentioned, some near-term workload optimization, your North American cloud customers, I mean, they are still growing their cloud services business at a strong 30%, 40% year-over-year growth rate and I assume that these types of growth rates like the consumption of compute networking, storage workloads and therefore, installed utilization, like, this is all quite strong in driving the need to build out more compute capacity.
