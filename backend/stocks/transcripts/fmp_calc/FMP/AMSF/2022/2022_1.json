    "content": " For the first quarter of 2022, AMERISAFE reported net income of $17.3 million or $0.89 per diluted share compared with $19.3 million or $0.99 per diluted share in last year\u2019s first quarter. Operating net income for the first quarter was $15.9 million or $0.82 per share, an increase of $0.06 or 8% from the first quarter of 2021. Revenues in the quarter were lower, impacted by last year\u2019s $5.5 million increase in unrealized gains on equity securities. Our tax rate for the quarter was 19.1% compared to 18.3% for last year\u2019s first quarter, largely due to higher underwriting profits. Operating ROE for the quarter was 16.3%, an increase from 13.9% in last year\u2019s first quarter. And also in capital management, our company paid its regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.31 per share in the first quarter, which represented a 6.9% increase over last year\u2019s amount. So last year\u2019s second quarter was just audit and other premiums were just $0.5 million, so $0.5 million versus $0.3 million in the first quarter of 2021."
