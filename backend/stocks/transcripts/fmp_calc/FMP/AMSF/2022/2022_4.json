    "content": " For the fourth quarter of 2022, AMERISAFE reported net income of $20.8 million or $1.08 per diluted share and operating income -- net income of $16.1 million or $0.84 per diluted share. This compares favorably with Q4 2021 net income of $3.5 million or $0.18 per diluted share and a net operating loss of $9,000 with the difference primarily driven by large claims in the prior year. For the full year, net income was $55.6 million and net operating income was $59.3 million compared with $65.8 million and $54.7 million in 2021, respectively. Gross written premiums were $55.6 million in the quarter and $276.1 million for the full year, both relatively flat on a year-over-year basis. For the full year, voluntary premiums declined by 5.9%, partially offset by audit and related premium adjustments of $14 million. The net loss ratio for the quarter was 55.3% and 56.1% for the full year, which reflects $10.4 million in favorable loss development in the quarter and $40.6 million for the full year. Our total underwriting and other expenses were $17.4 million in the quarter, resulting in an expense ratio of 26.4% compared with 24.7% in the fourth quarter of 2021. For the full year, underwriting and other expenses were $72 million or 26.5% compared with 26.1% in the prior year.
