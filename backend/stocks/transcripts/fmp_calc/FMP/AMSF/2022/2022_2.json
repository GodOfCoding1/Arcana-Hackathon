As a result of the increase in expenses, our expense ratio for the quarter was 28.3% compared with 26.4% in the second quarter of last year. Our tax rate for the quarter was 13.9% compared to 18.5% for last year\u00e2\u0080\u0099s second quarter, largely due to a higher proportion of tax-exempt income versus underwriting income in the quarter compared with last year."
