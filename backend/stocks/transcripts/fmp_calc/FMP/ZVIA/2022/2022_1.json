    "content": " In the first quarter of 2022, Zevia achieved net sales of $38 million, reflecting 24% growth versus the first quarter of 2021 on the high-end of our guidance range. In the midst of rising costs, Zevia took pricing actions that will result in a 6% increase in core soda packages effective in the second quarter and has communicated an incremental 10% increase across all packages in all retail channels and geographies from which we will begin realizing price in the second half of 2022. Your line is open. So, I think when we look at original 6% on Soda, plus the incremental 10% pricing action, plus call it 2 points from optimized promotional spend, I think we're comfortable that we are both out running inflation, but also going to see those accelerations reflected in the top line in the second half. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. So, when you take that initial 6% soda action, 8% energy and tea, plus the 10% incremental soda price increase, plus the 2% anticipated optimization of promotional spend in addition to the cost optimization strategies that we've outlined, I think we're quite comfortable with the opportunity for those gross margins to return to historical levels in the second half. Your line is open."
