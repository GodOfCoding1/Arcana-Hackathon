    "content": " In Q4, we delivered net sales of just over $35 million, ahead of guidance resulting in 3.5% revenue growth over prior year and an 8.7% decline in volume as we cycled the one-time pipeline sales in the warehouse club channel from Q4 of 2021. Looking at growth through syndicated data as a measure of sell-through, volume includes 13.5% for the fourth quarter according to IRI   sales remained strong through the ups and downs of retailer and e-commerce operator inventory management fluctuations, Zevia posted double-digit growth year-over-year for all months in 2022. Zevia households increased their brand spend annually 12% in 2022 versus 2021, driven by increases in spend per trip with consistent purchase frequency rates across the larger brand buying base. Our gross margin continued to show sequential improvements in the year with our strongest margins yet at 44.3% for the fourth quarter of 2022, 1 point above same quarter a year ago, primarily due to the impact of pricing, offset by slightly higher manufacturing costs. Gross profit delivered in the period was 15.7 million, up $0.9 million or 5.8% versus year ago, reflecting growth in net sales and a small improvement in cost of goods sold in the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA loss was 2.9 million, compared to an adjusted EBITDA loss of 5.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2021, a year-on-year improvement of 2.4 million or 44.7%, showing continued progress managing towards profitability and generating cash flows from operations. For full-year 2022, Zevia achieved net sales of 163.2 million, an increase of 18.1% versus 2021. I would say that was the most stark input for the back half of last year because as we saw the economy changing in a pretty rapid rate, we saw some of our key customers maybe over   and as a brand who has 10% or more of its business in e-commerce, which was a much less predictable sort of order rate, if you will, I think we, as well as being a brand that's not DSD, we're a little sort of had outsized impact on that dynamic."
