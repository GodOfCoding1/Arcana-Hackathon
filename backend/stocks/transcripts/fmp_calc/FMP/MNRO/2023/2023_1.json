    "content": " Adjusted diluted earnings per share, a non-GAAP measure was $0.42 in the quarter and excluded $0.03 per share of gain on the sale of our wholesale tire locations and tire distribution assets, net of closing costs and cost associated with the closing of a related warehouse and excluded $0.08 per share of certain discrete tax items related to the sale, as well as the revaluation of deferred tax balances due to changes in the mix of pretax income in various U.S. state jurisdictions, again, because of the divestiture."
