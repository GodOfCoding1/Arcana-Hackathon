    "content": " During the second quarter, we continued our long standing policy of sharing our results with our shareholders through our dividend and we continue deploying cash on our share repurchase program, which authorizes us to repurchase up to $150 million of the company's common stock. Turning to slide 7, sales decreased 5.1% year-over-year to $329.8 million in the second quarter, which was due to the divestiture of our wholesale tire and distribution assets in the first quarter of fiscal 2023."
