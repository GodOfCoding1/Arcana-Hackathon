    "content": " I can tell you from a gross profit perspective, there\u2019s not--they\u2019re very similar to most of our stores, so it\u2019s really all about marrying capacity and productivity and we just need to get the sales line up to a level where they\u2019re able to drive to the bottom line, those sales can fall to the bottom line. Now we\u2019re going to have everyday delivery from ATD, which is best in class, and I\u2019m really looking forward to bringing new assortments to our stores so that we can be more relevant on both the tires and then continue to evolve our parts distribution, using our third party providers. As we continue to drive productivity for the technicians we\u2019ve added and continue to meet the demand that\u2019s in the marketplace with more higher productive technicians, that will ultimately benefit our gross margins and our ability to take what was a headwind in labor in Q4 for margins and, as we progress through the year, turn that into more neutral, even a tailwind as we move into the later parts of this year."
