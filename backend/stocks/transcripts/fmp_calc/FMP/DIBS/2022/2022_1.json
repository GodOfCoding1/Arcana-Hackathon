    "content": " In contrast, consumer GMV declined modestly year-over-year due to lower new buyer conversion, a trend that's continued into the second quarter. Traffic and top-of-funnel engagement metrics remain strong, but new buyer conversion headwinds resulting from rising macro uncertainty and economic reopening have reduced our GMV growth outlook for the second quarter relative to our previous expectations. Since our last earnings call, changing consumer behavior, rising macroeconomic uncertainty and consumer conversion headwinds have reduced our second quarter GMV growth outlook relative to our previous expectations. While trade GMV growth remained robust, consumer GMV modestly declined due to traffic mix shipped from returning buyers to new buyers and softness in new buyer conversion. Average order value growth was offset by order softness due to 2 traffic mix shifts: a shift towards mobile web and a shift towards new buyers, both of which have lower conversion rates. We forecast second quarter GMV of $104 million to $111 million, equating to a year-over-year change between a decline of 3% and growth of 3%; net revenue of $24.4 million to $25.5 million, equating to year-over-year change between a decline of 1% and growth of 3%; adjusted EBITDA margin loss of minus 32% to minus 28%."
