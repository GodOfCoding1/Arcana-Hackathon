    "content": "  The Board of Directors' strategic review will recommend a new model for Credit Suisse with the following objectives: first, to strengthen the world-class global Wealth Management franchise, leading universal bank in Switzerland and multi-specialist Asset Management business; secondly, to transform the Investment Bank into a capital-light advisory-led banking business and a more focused markets business that complements the growth of the Wealth Management and Swiss Bank franchises; thirdly, to evaluate strategic options for the securitized products business, which may include attracting third-party capital; and fourthly, to reduce the group's absolute cost base to below CHF 15.5 billion in the medium term, executed with prudence while remaining focused on improving risk management and risk culture."
