    "content": " Here on Slide 4 of the presentation, we reported a net loss of CHF4 billion in the quarter including a CHF3.7 billion impairment related to the reassessment of deferred tax assets resulting from the strategic review. The adjusted pre-tax loss of CHF100 million, mainly due to an investment banking \u00e2\u0080\u0093 a weak investment banking performance, as well as somewhat lower client activity across all our divisions. Adjusted operating expenses were down 6% year-on-year at CHF3.87 billion, mainly driven by lower compensation and benefits expenses. This was mainly due to a reduction in our compensation and benefits accruals of CHF 398 million, reflecting our revenue performance and pre-tax loss in the third quarter. This is more than offset though by the CHF 4 billion capital raise, which adds around 140 basis points taking us to a pro forma CET1 ratio for the third quarter of 14%. Total net revenues in Wealth Management were CHF 1.36 billion, down 14% year-on-year impacted by lower client activity volumes and recurring revenues. Thank you very much. Thank you very much.
