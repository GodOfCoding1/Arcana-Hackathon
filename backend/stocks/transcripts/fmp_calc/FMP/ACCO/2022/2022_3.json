    "content": " In mid October, we issued a press release updating our third quarter and full year outlook, highlighting the fact that the third quarter proved to be more challenging, given the economic environment, especially in Europe, and more cautious inventory replenishment by retailers. Last night, we issued our third quarter results, reflecting sales at the midpoint and adjusted EPS at the high end of our guidance with our full year outlook unchanged. While the third quarter sales environment was challenging in EMEA, both computer accessories and gaming accessories continued strong comparable sales growth trajectories in that market and combined were up low double digits percent in the quarter and year-to-date. Given a lower sales overall, we are experiencing fixed cost deleveraging in our facilities, while inflationary costs are beginning to come down, their landing effects in our P&L will continue to impact their gross profit to the end of the year, but should improve as you progress through 2023. Sequentially inventory was found $40 million from the second quarter, but remained high due to inflation and lower than expected third quarter sales volume. So my anticipation as we'll still make significant progress in the fourth quarter and really come end of this year early next year, we'll be in the normal working capital cycle of the supply chain issues of pretty much behind that so there's not a reason to hold more inventory than we need to come end of this year."
