    "content": " Looking to the second half of 2022 and going forward, our advertising investments will be increasingly focused across B2B, Boxed Up loyalty, and Boxed Market to help support enhanced growth of our highest profit customer channels. So if you look at three straight quarters of consecutive 55% plus year-over-year growth, when we just think about that business and some of the other segments that we outlined, we just thought it was exciting and the right thing to do as we think about the long-term for the business to really feed that business appropriately. Your line is now open. I remember, while I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m between kind of I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m new guy at our analyst day last year, we said these days will come about and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re really happy to say hey, we said B2B could be a strong growth catalyst for us going forward and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve now delivered three straight quarters of that. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. As we think about building an incredibly strong business over the next two, three, four, five years that gets to EBITDA profitability even faster than we originally projected, I think it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s really the right call because one, obviously there is a customer need for it or else it would be very difficult for us to grow at those speeds or see the kind of pipeline growth that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re seeing. Your line is now open. Your line is now open."
