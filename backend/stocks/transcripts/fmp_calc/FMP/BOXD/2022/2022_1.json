    "content": " Turning now to the Software and Services segment, we generated $2.2 million in net revenue in the first quarter, which increased $1.2 million or 127.1% year-over-year and beat our internal expectations. In addition, we are seeing positive trends within our profitability as gross profit of $6.1 million in the first quarter increased by $1.2 million or 23.7% versus the prior year period and gross margin came in at 13.1%, a 101 basis point increase from 12.1% in Q1 of 2021. Adjusted EBITDA was a loss of $22.2 million compared to a loss of $11 million in the prior period primarily due to increases in growth related and public company related investments across advertising, staff, insurance costs and professional services costs. On the KPI side, gross merchandise value was $53.4 million for the first quarter, an increase of $8.6 million or 19.2% versus the prior year period, showing strong reacceleration on both a quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year basis. When we look at turning to your other question around sort of customer acquisition costs and what we are seeing there, I think as we have sort of previously communicated early across the investment periods, you are in Q1 and Q2, were really, really focused around sort of its brand messaging and starting to build some of that awareness around the brand and investing much more heavily into marketing across those types of channels, which we always anticipated would basically yield medium to longer term gains across customer acquisitions, conversion rates, etcetera."
