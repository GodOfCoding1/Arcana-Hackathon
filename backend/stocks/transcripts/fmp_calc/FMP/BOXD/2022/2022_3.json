    "content": " Notably, expansion of B2B GMV mix has also led to overall retail net revenue per active customer, reaching an all-time high of $336 after growing 38.4% in Q3. In addition to focusing our efforts and resources to enhance growth in the highest margin areas of our business, a key part of driving increased profitability is, of course, also taking a closer look at our cost structure, shipping cost improvements, price optimization, restructuring of corporate staff and focused marketing investments towards B2B and Boxed Market were all factors in our quarter-over-quarter adjusted EBITDA improvement of $6.1 million. In addition to stronger retail AOVs, the increase in spend per user was a direct result of strategic initiatives taken to drive enhanced growth of our stickiest and highest profit customers which supported mix shift towards B2B and Boxed Market. As discussed previously, as part of our strategic vision, we expect advertising investments will be increasingly focused across B2B and Boxed Market to help support enhanced growth of our highest-profit customer channels which we also believe will produce the highest relative return on investment going forward. What I could say is that for each B2B customer that we do acquire, the value of that customer is so much higher from an LTV perspective, from a profitability perspective, from a revenue perspective as well, that the customers we need to acquire to sort of achieve our targets on the B2B side are much lower than what we would expect and need to acquire if we were focusing that same energy, investing in B2B -- or B2C customer acquisition."
