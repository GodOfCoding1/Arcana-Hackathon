    "content": " Number three, within the last quarter based on the debt pay down, we had achieved and the continued strong cash and adjusted EBITDA generation of our business both Moody\u2019s and Fitch, change their rating outlook from stable to a positive outlook. So TI is still larger, but many of the others in Infineons and STs and Maxim\u2019s and ADIs and, we\u2019re really caught up to all of them in the last 12 or 13 years by scaling the business almost 10x at the current quarter guidance, we\u2019re running somewhere in excess of $6.5 billion. I\u2019d just add to that, but we have made significant increases in our dividend in the last three quarters, and it\u2019s up 18.8%, year-over-year with the three large sequential increases that we\u2019ve made. In terms of the CapEx itself, I mean, you\u2019ve seen \u2013 if you go back and look at our history, last 5, 10 years, you\u2019ll find that we have gone above and below that 3% to 5% \u2013 3% to 4% number, I think the two years previous to this, we were at about 1%. But foundries are willing to add capacity on the more leading edge nodes then they are on the trailing edge given the choice of the capital allocation and their priorities they are working on more relieving the leading edge capacity, leaving the trailing edge much more constrained because of the such an aggressive growth if the growth of the industry returns back to a much more normal over the 10 years, then it\u2019s quite possible that the trailing edge capacity will not be as constrained again."
