    "content": " What I'm really excited about is that these investments are beginning to pay off, but we feel like there's still lots of capacity to continue on the journey that we embarked upon a couple of years ago, and part of that is that we've hired about 25 bankers over the past six quarters and believe that although their production has certainly kicked in, we'll have room to grow there. We've hired two bankers this past quarter, and I think two or three bankers a quarter is probably a good run rate for us over the next 1.5 years or so. One is we've been working on developing a network of financial institutions that we serve not only through SSW but also through our big group and our core bank group who sales, loan participations and average deposits for us from other financial institutions, and they are about $300 million in each of those categories. We're also able to use our big group to recommend financial institutions to SSW, -- so we certainly hope to continue to grow that as a source of deposits end up source of risk mitigation with our loan exposure. So I think you said high single-digit deposit growth in the fourth quarter and then four-star municipalities should come in, in the fourth quarter -- first part of the first quarter, somewhere in the $200 million to $250 million range. So we think that that's going to improve somewhere around 50 to 60 basis points in the fourth quarter, which, with our seasonality in the deposit front, which a lot of those municipals that will start coming in will be interest-bearing along with the five basis points that we're not going to get, that was a onetime."
