    "content": " Compared to the first quarter of 2022, total gross loans increased by more than $36 million, while net interest income grew almost 3%. Net income of $3.0 million in the second quarter of 2022 was lower by $100,000 in comparison to the first quarter of 2022, mainly the result of a credit loss provision to our allowance for loan losses of $500,000 in the first quarter of 2022, while no loan loss provision was made in the current quarter. In the second quarter of 2022, net interest income totaled $8.9 million, an increase of $253000 compared to the first quarter of 2022, due primarily to growth in interest on investment securities, but offset by slightly lower loan interest income and higher interest costs. Interest income on investment securities increased $498,000 this quarter compared to the first quarter of 2022, due to a growth in average investment balances of $55 million, along with increased yields. Non-interest income totaled $3.8 million this quarter increasing $233,000 compared to the first quarter of 2022, while declining by $1.7 million in comparison to the prior year second quarter."
