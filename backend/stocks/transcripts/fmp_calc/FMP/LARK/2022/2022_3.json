    "content": " Compared to the second quarter of 2022, total gross loans increased by more than $41 million while net interest income grew by over 6% or $553,000. Net income of $2.5 million in the third quarter of 2022 was lower by $533,000 in comparison to the second quarter of 2022, mainly the result of a credit loss provision to our allowance for loan losses of $500,000 in the third quarter of 2022, while no loan loss provision was made in the second quarter. In the third quarter of 2022, net interest income totaled $9.5 million, an increase of $553,000 compared to the second quarter of 2022, due primarily to growth in interest on investment securities and loans, but offset by higher interest costs. Interest income on investment securities increased $290,000 this quarter compared to the second quarter of 2022 due to a growth in average investment balances of $17.2 million, along with increased yields. Noninterest income totaled $3.5 million this quarter, decreasing $267,000 compared to the second quarter of 2022, while declining by $1.9 million in comparison to the third quarter last year. Alluded to before, loan growth was very strong this quarter as gross loans, excluding PPP loans, increased $41.4 million during the third quarter, representing an annualized growth rate of 24.5%. Deposits decreased by $14.3 million during the quarter to $1.1 billion, which combined with our loan growth resulted in increasing our loan-to-deposit ratio to 63% at September 30, 2022, which still remains low, giving us plenty of opportunities to fund new loan growth. Gross loans outstanding as of September 30, 2022, totaled $711.3 million, an increase just over 24% on an annualized basis from the previous quarter."
