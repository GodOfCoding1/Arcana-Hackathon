    "content": " Apollo's business is heading in the right direction and importantly our 2022 growth is occurring in advance of four big growth drivers that we're going to discuss on the call, seizing the endobariatric opportunity with the launch of Apollo ESG and REVISE, continue to scale our commercial channel, especially in the U.S. But with that said, as we set guidance for the remainder of the year, we do remain cognizant of the continued potential global macro economic impacts, especially from inflation, continued foreign currency pressures, particularly for the euro, which currently represents nearly half of our U.S. or O-U.S. direct revenue and again, potential seasonality later in the fourth quarter in our endobariatric accounts, which represent a growing mix of our total revenue. I'm very pleased to talk about today four opportunities that are either in the very early stages or brand new that will help drive that accelerate phase and you see them on the slide, I referenced them earlier, endobariatric opportunity, growing our commercial channel, expanding access to suturing with OverStitch NXT and then pursuing significant expansion opportunities outside the U.S. No other procedure has the combination of an FDA authorization, level one clinical evidence and then delivers a combination of effectiveness, safety, and very good durability. So we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been doing some work in terms of the modeling of both the cash pay and the reimbursed side and think with pretty modest assumptions on overall utilization that in total that the business can be across both cash pay and reimbursed in the $450 million range within a \u00e2\u0080\u0093 call it eight year \u00e2\u0080\u0093 eight to 10 year timeframe for now with the cash pay part of it being maybe not fully half, but 40%, 45% of that."
