    "content": " This performance represents a really nice step-up compared to our recent sales levels and the growth has come ahead of two very recent and important catalysts that we've just announced in the last month, the FDA market authorization for the Apollo ESG and Apollo REVISE devices and publication just last week of the MERIT study in The Lancet. In the near term, we're focused on building capabilities following historical underinvestment in the business, the most significant area being sales and marketing in the U.S. For example, in the second quarter, our non-GAAP sales and marketing OpEx ran about 45% of revenue which reflects our planned investments and growth initiatives, primarily in building out our sales channel as we prepare for the launch of Apollo ESG and REVISE products. This is a group that now complements our existing market development managers -- sorry, traditional sales reps. And the REM role really complements the traditional sales rep role by focusing on supporting new and emerging practices and that can incorporate Orbera ESG and revision procedures. But then having said all of that, I have said before, I think there is an opportunity, given the value proposition I mentioned for ESG to become a market-leading weight loss procedure -- that's not baked in -- I mean, that level of optimism isn't fully baked into that 20% number."
