    "content": " In the industrial medical markets, third quarter revenue grew nearly 50% year-on-year to $120 million, a new record for the company. Third quarter revenue was a record $560 million, growing 49% year-over-year and 17% sequentially. Revenue in the industrial and medical market also reached a record $120 million, growing 48% from last year and 14% from the second quarter. Improved supply also allowed us to grow data center computing revenue 41% year-over-year and 27% sequentially to $88 million, on par with 2020's record levels. Telecom & Networking revenue was $43 million, up 40% from last year and 12% from the second quarter. Operating expenses were $99.8 million, up approximately 6% from last quarter, mainly due to a full quarter of SL Power and higher variable costs on strong revenue. Given the strong performance in the third quarter, continued parts constraints and the initial impact of headwinds in the semiconductor market, we expect revenues for the fourth quarter to be approximately $470 million, plus or minus $20 million. Based on our tax rate of 18% to 19%, we expect Q4 non-GAAP earnings per share to be $1.55, plus or minus $0.25, ahead of our target set earlier in the year for our fourth quarter exit rate. And we think we can grow faster than the market, not only just based on our shipment improvements, but also based on our design win pipeline, which is much stronger than it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been in quite some time as we kind of \u00e2\u0080\u0093 we refocus as a company about a year ago on the industrial medical markets, and the sales team has done a great job winning a lot of new designs."
