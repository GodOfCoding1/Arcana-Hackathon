    "content": " Data center computing revenue grew 29% year-over-year to $76 million, but declined 5% sequentially; and telecom and networking revenue was $35 million, up 6% from last year, but down 9% from the fourth quarter. The other part is, we've been working pretty hard on alternative qualifications as well as board redesigns to get around some of the more intractable supply issues and our customers have been working very closely with us to qualify those solutions quickly, and so that's also played a part in our success in the last two quarters and we see that these alternative solutions will play a bigger role moving forward in 2022. It sounds like you're reiterating your guidance for $6 of annualized EPS and I think in past quarters, that was sort of on our revenue run rate of something a little bit north of $400 million. Got it, thank you. Got it, thank you."
