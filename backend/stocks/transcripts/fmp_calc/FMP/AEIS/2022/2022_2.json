    "content": " In the second quarter, revenue from the semiconductor equipment market grew 30% year-on-year and 13% sequentially to nearly $230 million. In the industrial medical market, revenue grew 26% year-on-year and 27% sequentially due to improved parts availability, as well as the addition of SL Power. Revenue from the semiconductor market was $229 million, up 30% from last year and up 13% from last quarter. Revenue in the industrial medical market was $105 million, growing 26% from last year and 27% from last quarter. And although supply chain constraints will continue to pace our performance, our Q3 revenue guidance reflects four consecutive quarters of year-over-year revenue growth, increasing our confidence to achieve our year-end annualized earnings targets of $6 per share despite persistently higher material costs. Looking forward, we believe that solid demand drivers in our markets, the profile of our order book, actions we're taking to mitigate supply chain challenges and investments in new products position us well to deliver on the pent up earnings potential for the company for many quarters to come. Regarding the target for $6 EPS run rate by end of this year,  contribute from \u00e2\u0080\u0093 let's say, for 4Q, assume we may see the sequential growth in top line and also probably you will see some gross margin benefit from maybe more moderate \u00e2\u0080\u0093 the cost premium from the third party, the IC."
