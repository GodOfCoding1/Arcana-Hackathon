    "content": " Griffon first quarter revenue increased 9% over the prior year as we saw a sustained demand across our consumer product categories, a robust housing and commercial construction market, and healthy repair and remodel activity. Our adjusted EBITDA trailed the prior year, but as we indicated on our fourth quarter call, we expected margin compression in our first quarter as we continue to work with customers and suppliers to normalize price to cost parity across our businesses. Excluding items that impact comparability, selling, general, and administrative expenses were $121 million or 20.5% of revenue compared to $109 million or 20.2% in the prior quarter, with the increased dollars primarily driven by distribution, transportation, and labor cost. Excluding items that affect comparability from both periods, current quarter adjusted income from continuing operations was $21 million or $0.39 per share compared to prior year of $27 million or $0.50 per share Corporate and unallocated expenses excluding depreciation were $13 million in the quarter, in line with the prior year quarter. Moving on to guidance, on a continuing operations basis, excluding the contribution from Telephonics, but including the contribution of Hunter, in the remainder of this year, we expect revenue of $2.75 billion and segment adjusted EBITDA of $355 million for fiscal 2022. The incremental Hunter contribution for the remaining eight months of fiscal 2022 is expected to be $250 million of revenue and $55 million of EBITDA, excluding the effects of acquisition-related costs and purchase accounting. And that along with our pricing actions that we expect to be done by the end of our second quarter, brings us to our second half of the year seeing normalized margins more in line with what we saw in the first half of fiscal 2021 -- for the second half of fiscal 2022."
