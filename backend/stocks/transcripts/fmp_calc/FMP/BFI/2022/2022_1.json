    "content": " Before we begin today, I want to remind everyone that this conference call may contain forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including statements relating to BurgerFi's estimates of its future business outlook, store opening plans, same-store sales and restaurant operating margin growth plans, prospects or financial results including projected sales, restaurant EBITDA or financial results from the company's acquisition of Anthony's Coal Fired Pizza & Wings. While our first quarter total revenue, including both BurgerFi and Anthony's was impacted by the Omicron variant of COVID-19 in January, we were able to deliver an impressive 311% increase in revenue to $44.9 million compared to $10.9 million in the year ago quarter driven primarily by a full quarter of operations of Anthony's, which was acquired on November 3, '21, and new BurgerFi restaurant openings."
