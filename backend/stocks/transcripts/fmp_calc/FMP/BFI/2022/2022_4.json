System-wide sales for BurgerFi in the fourth quarter decreased 5% to $38.7 million compared to $40.7 million in the year ago quarter, primarily due to the decline in same-store sales, partially offset by new restaurant unit growth. BurgerFi's restaurant level operating expenses increased 340 basis points to 90.6% for the quarter compared to 87.2% in the prior year fourth quarter, primarily due to lost leverage on fixed costs due to the same-store sales decline.
