    "content": " These forward-looking statements may be related to BurgerFi's estimates of its future business outlook, store opening plans, same-store sales and restaurant operating margin growth plans, prospects or financial results, including the projected sales, restaurant EBITDA or financial results from the company's acquisition of Anthony's Coal Fired Pizza & Wings. The significant increase in revenue over the comparable period was related to the acquisition of 61 corporate-owned Anthony's Coal Fired Pizza & Wings in November 2021 and the addition of new corporate-owned BurgerFi locations, representing over 50% unit growth when compared to the prior year. Our second quarter consolidated system-wide restaurant sales decreased 2% to $74.3 million, which comprised of a 4% decrease at BurgerFi and a 2% increase at Anthony's. System-wide comparable same-store sales decreased 5% for the quarter, consisting of an 11% decrease at BurgerFi and a 3% increase at Anthony's. The BurgerFi corporate-owned revenues increased $1.7 million or 14.4% to $13.5 million for the second quarter of 2022 compared to $11.8 million in the same period in the prior year, driven by the addition of new corporate-owned restaurants over the last year, partially offset by a decrease in same-store sales. System-wide sales for BurgerFi in the second quarter decreased 4% to $42.4 million compared to $44.2 million in the year-ago quarter, primarily due to the decline in same-store sales, partially offset by new restaurant growth. Total revenue of $175 million to $180 million, which assumes a low to mid-single-digit increase in same-store sales and the addition of 13 to 17 new restaurants, 3 corporate-owned and 10 to 14 franchises, as well as up to 30 BurgerFi Gopuff locations this year."
