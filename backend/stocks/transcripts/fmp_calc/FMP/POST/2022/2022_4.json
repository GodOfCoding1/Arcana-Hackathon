    "content": " Post ended the year in strong fashion, anchored by exceptional performance in foodservice, we delivered a quarter with nearly $280 million in adjusted EBITDA, and a year with over $960 million in adjusted EBITDA. Attacking this opportunity will be a multiyear effort focused on several areas, including maintaining pricing discipline vis-\u00c3\u00a0-vis input cost inflation, stabilization of supply chain costs and performance, better leverage on fixed assets within Refrigerated Retail, and improvements in manufacturing asset reliability aimed at minimizing plant downtime. Net sales increased 16.5%, and benefited from pricing actions in each segment and continued volume recovery in our foodservice business. Segment adjusted EBITDA grew to $110 million, benefiting from improved average net pricing and volume growth, which combined mitigated the impact of higher cost to produce. I think that what we are seeing is continued strengthening of the core franchise, and we expect the profitability to normalize at higher levels than pre-pandemic and gives us continued confidence in the growth rate in perpetuity, but not \u00e2\u0080\u0093 we are not trying to suggest that annualizing this quarter as a current run-rate for the business. So, foodservice margins, as I have suggested in my remarks, tend to normalize at higher levels than prior to an experience like the \u00e2\u0080\u0093 whether it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s COVID or AR, whatever the emergency may be because I think that the business is so competitively advantaged, and the biosecurity is so good, and the cost structure is so impressive that it really does allow for a demonstration of the value of the relatively unique proposition that we offer."
