Hosting the call today from Post are Rob Vitale, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Jeff Zadoks, Chief Financial Officer. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today for Post's First Quarter Fiscal 2022 Earnings Call. The press release that supports today's remarks is posted on our website in both the Investor Relations and the SEC filings section at postholdings.com, in addition, the release is available on the SEC's website. Before we continue, I would like to remind you that this call will contain forward-looking statements which are subject to risks and uncertainties that should be carefully considered by investors as actual results could differ materially from these statements. We also urge you to read the registration statements, the proxy statement and prospectuses, the related amendments of these filings, and other documents related to the proposed distribution of our interest in BellRing Brands that have been and will be filed with the SEC because they contain important information. For a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the nearest GAAP measure, see our press release issued yesterday posted on our website. Despite a challenging environment, we delivered a quarter largely in line with expectations, and we continue to maintain our expectations for the full year. While our outlook continues to be presented on a basis consolidated with BellRing, respective outlook remains largely unchanged. We will initiate post RemainCo guidance no later than our next earnings call, by which time we expect the separation have been completed. Third, we expect the amount of cash that will be distributed to BellRing stockholders, including Post to be approximately $400 million. Finally, we will pro rata distribute approximately 78 million of BellRing shares rather than exchange any of them for Post shares. This transaction required and continues to require a considerable effort across both organizations, and I want to thank everyone involved. First, cost inflation ran ahead of pricing actions. We have taken the pricing needed to offset our inflation in all segment, but with varying effective dates. Second, each segment had unmet customer demand resulting from shortages and labor inhibiting production and/or shortages in transportation resulting in unshipped orders. In U.S. Cereal, consumption for our branded products continues to run ahead of pre-COVID levels by nearly 2%, and our related market share is just shy of 20%. Last quarter, I mentioned we may have seen an inflection point in the value trade. A shift to value in the category is margin dilutive to Post, but it's profit-accretive. Foodservice performed as expected, meaning it had a weak profit quarter as this segment was the one most dramatically impacted by costs running ahead of pricing. During the second quarter, we are experiencing some soft demand resulting from the Omicron COVID variant. Nevertheless, we now understand that the volumes bounce back quickly as variant received, and we expect this softness to be limited to a month or 2. Weetabix continues to be a rock solid performer, all the factors our U.S. businesses face are present in the key U.K. market. Suffice to say that it continues to performed well in a great category, but the current year results are constrained by insufficient capacity. On balance, I would say we navigated the first quarter effectively. We feel good about how we are managing the controllables, and we're remaining nimble enough to adapt to curve balls as they come our way. REIT and M&A is performing to plan with the exception of Almark, which has seen costs accelerate ahead of pricing. We will not undertake an acquisition that jeopardizes our execution in a challenging year, but we believe there are opportunities to find value that complements our efforts. We then expect significant second half acceleration stemming from price realization, improvements in supply chain execution, Foodservice volume recovery and BellRing capacity expansion. As I mentioned, assuming the spin proceeds to plan, we will provide separate stand-alone guidance for the remaining business, no later than our May call. Net sales increased 13% and benefited from approximately $98 million from recent acquisitions, volume demand recovery in the Foodservice segment and pricing actions across each segment. Similar to last quarter, throughput decline and per unit product costs increased. Net sales and volumes increased 14% and 8%, respectively. Excluding the benefit from the private label cereal and Peter Pan acquisitions, net sales and volumes declined 1% and 9%, respectively. Cereal average net pricing increased 9%, driven by favorable product mix and pricing actions. Adjusted EBITDA decreased 5% versus prior year, primarily driven by higher manufacturing costs resulting from supply chain disruptions across freight, supplier reliability and warehousing. These disruptions drove declines in throughput and along with lower volumes, poor fixed cost proportion, causing higher manufacturing cost per pound of production. Weetabix net sales increased 4.5%, benefiting from a stronger British pound to U.S. dollar exchange rate and higher average net selling prices, reflecting lower trade spending and base price increases. Specifically, prior year benefited from COVID-related increased at-home consumption and customers increasing inventory ahead of Brexit. Supply chain disruptions, most notably in packaging and transportation availability, contributed to the volume declines and drove a 3% decline in adjusted EBITDA. Our Foodservice business saw net sales and volume growth of 24% and 13%, respectively, and were lifted by higher away-from-home demand and distribution gains. Although we saw year-over-year growth this quarter, total segment volumes remained below pre-pandemic levels. Adjusted EBITDA was relatively flat to prior year, benefiting from volume recovery and improved average net pricing, which was only able to partially offset increases in freight costs, poor fixed cost absorption and other costs to produce. Excluding the Egg Beaters and Almark acquisitions and Willamette Egg Farms, the business we divested on December 1 and net sales and volumes declined 2% and 7%, respectively. Pricing actions drove increases in average net pricing for side dish, sausage and cheese products. Supply chain constraints, most notably around labor availability, suppressed side dish and sausage volumes. Adjusted EBITDA decreased to approximately $36 million and was pressured by lower volumes, significantly higher sale, cheese and egg input costs, increased freight and higher manufacturing costs. Premier Protein net sales increased 4.5%, a slower rate than recent quarters resulting from shape capacity constraints. Dymatize net sales grew 41%, benefiting from price increases, strong velocities and distribution gains. Our working capital increased slightly, reflecting a decrease in payables and increased inventories for U.S. cereal and powders at BellRing. During the quarter, we purchased $1.5 million of our shares at an average price of $103.37 per share. Our net leverage at the end of the first quarter, as measured by our credit facility was approximately 6.4 times. On this basis, we expect to deleverage between 3 quarters at a full term once we have completed all steps in our separation of BellRing. During the quarter, we issued $500 million in principal value of senior notes as a tack-on to our 5.5% senior notes due in December 2029. With that, I'd like to turn the call back over to the operator for questions. Rob, when -- I think when Post provided its initial fiscal '22 EBITDA guidance, I think it was predicated on the thought that inflation will have peaked and labor markets have sort of normalized. And obviously, you reaffirmed the full year guidance today. So I'm trying to get a better understanding, I guess, of if in your view inflation has peaked and labor expectations have played out as you initially built into guidance. Or maybe it's more of a matter of having built in enough flexibility in guidance to deal with what still feels like a very unsettled environment, at least in listening to so many of the other companies that have reported thus far. I'm trying to get a feel for how that played out and what that means for your expectations on those metrics, right, as we go into the latter part of the year. So first, I would say that it certainly remains an unsettled environment. The -- what I would characterize the year is shaping up to reflect is pretty strong ability to get pricing where needed so that the Peanut pricing net of cost while negative this quarter is moving in the right direction, and we feel good about that vis-a-vis inflation now, obviously, inflation accelerates from here that could have a different potential outcome. So I feel that specifically to Post, we're making progress. But sitting here at quarter end, we still have a, I think, good shot at delivering on our expectations for the year, barring dramatic changes in the macro environment. And then I think you mentioned it might have been specific to Post consumer brands, but I want to make sure I understood it that your comments from last quarter about having just really started to see a bit of an inflection in sort of the value brands, sort of private label side of things, it has been holding. And the reason I ask is in trying to track all of these various categories across the space in terms of either trade down or private label trends, still just not really seeing it in the broader industry data. So we -- the comment was specific to post-consumer brands where we saw a flattening of our value segment, which includes the Monbag portfolio as well as private label. But we've also seen some improved volumes in our private label businesses and 8th Avenue volumes, although margins are under pressure. And then just lastly would be, I think you move into a lot more detail on this on the BellRing call, but I may have heard you say that you expect a deceleration at BellRing in 2Q. We tend from a promotional cadence and a new year to you shipping timing to have a sequential dip into Q2, so nothing more than the normal. I just had a question if I can ask you first on in terms of the proposed spinoff of the BellRing shares, just to get your perspective on that. Well, if you go back to when we announced it, we tried to announce the whole mortgage Board of opportunities to execute because these things have a long period of time and you're trying to -- I mean, a long execution time line. And as we approach execution point, it strikes us that there is significant opportunity in both shares and it doesn't make sense to trade one for the other. Neither is particularly in our opinion, overvalued, we would rather let our shareholders have the value in each shares, not incur the frictional cost of the premium related to exchange and then shareholders can move to whatever mix of securities they prefer without us having incurred the cost of premium from a Post side at a discount from a BellRing side. I guess I'm just curious, a split-off would have been a way for -- immediate way for Post to retire a large chunk of its shares, depending on how much it would split off. I think, yes, we would had an opportunity to shrink a lot of BellRing shares. But at a cost of using what we think are very attractively priced, meaning low-priced bearing shares. So going back to the second part of the question, the -- we certainly have the option to be more aggressive in share buybacks once the transaction is complete. But as we always do, we would look across the landscape and compare that to opportunities to invest externally as well. I guess I'm curious, do you have any frame of reference for how much that is, it depends by business, no doubt. Our supply chains are certainly getting better, worse case staying the same beat. Perhaps slowly getting better, but the load-to-truck factor is still very high, historically high. So I don't think that we're through the would yet on transportation, both costs and availability, that could be another couple of months. We'll take our next question from Michael Lavery, please go ahead -- with Piper Sandler. I know in the past, you've given that stand-alone financial information unless I may have missed this somehow I don't think I saw that this time. We've been on the wrong side of the pricing versus cost inflation, and we are attempting in fiscal '22 to have a fairly significant catch-up on that. We think the pricing will come through, but it's taken longer than we expected. From an overall Post perspective, we won\u2019t talk about it much because from a contribution to our overall value, we took out the entirety of our capital investment a couple of years ago and we have what amounts to an option value position in the company. So simply from a matter of relative value, we don't talk about a lot, but we still think that there is long-term value to the company that is surpassed couple of years by some external and some internal factors. And then just on Weetabix, partly from different COVID restriction dynamics, the entire grocery store in the U.K. is seeing declines. And even excluding currency, it looks like you were -- you had sales up modestly. But on a year-over-year basis, it's slightly unfavorable. Rob, can you just give us kind of as we're going into '22, what's your thoughts on the state of the cereal market, both U.S. and U.K.? And so the concern is -- or the question is, how many of those consumers do we retain as 1 day the pandemic ends or if people go back to kind of the normal lives. First of all, it's been a difficult analytic process because we've had external factors. But it\u2019s my intuition, and that's what it is, tells me that we're in a zero to 1, maybe 1.5 growth category. Once you factor all that out and get in to a normal run rate somewhere between zero and 1, 1.5 which is 100 basis points to 200 basis points better than it was pre-pandemic. And then, of course, there's -- whatever the new pricing dynamic is going forward from today. And Rob, I think I heard you say you expect to be back to pre-COVID levels in fiscal '23 which is just around 3 times. I'm sure you're going to be hit with some other offsets, they're going to eat into some of that and I\u2019m sure you also have a lot of operational improvements you're trying to attack. Well, let's keep it real simple and just say the current quarter times 4 and add $150 million of pricing. I think that gets you to -- now obviously, there are puts and takes -- there's going to be some improvement, there's going to be some additional -- I mean there's going to be some operational improvements, some going to be some additional costs. I'm trying to keep that as the very simplistic but when you look at the magnitude of the pricing versus the cost we\u2019ve already incur, you get -- it's a pretty clear runway. You said you're implementing that 150 annualized run rate in 2Q, probably not all the following year by 2Q, but it should be in 3Q. It's actually at least the majority, if not all, and more of that gross margin pressure you saw in Q4. Let me make sure I understood the way you sequenced it because in my comments, I made the reference that Q2 will look a lot like Q1. We really has a first half, second half story because of the timing and pricing. So if the rest of the question is related to gross margin vis-a-vis prior year, I would say the answer is yes, we can see getting back to prior levels. And then just secondly, as we kind of all go through the different segments, Refrigerated Retail volumes down a bit, not down in all categories, some commentary or just around some capacity constraints. As we look at Q3 compares obviously, a little bit easier, and in the back half just overall. But if you look quarter-to-quarter, we're going to accelerate through the year because capacity is expanding pretty dramatically as we get the staffing levels back to where they need to be. I'm very optimistic about the Refrigerated Retail segment because of the sequential progression we're making and just recognizing that come the next holiday season, we're going to be in a much better position. Well, labor is easier and more controllable for us than transportation because, by and large, we're a buyer transportation for our third parties. But on labor, of course, there's cost of labor, but there's also things like work rules trying to facilitate transportation of workers in this case. So we're looking at all things around culture retention, the way we pay, the frequency that we pay, how we get people to and from work, how we recruit to different communities, all the things that companies like ours are doing. And then just longer term, you do it every now and then and you kind of give like, hey, how do you think of the longer-term businesses of where you are. It's been a little bit just because there's been some, obviously, COVID, and there's been some issues going on. Can you just frame a little bit of where you think the growth of each of the businesses are, again, 15, 20 seconds per one, just wanted to make sure that we're aligned with how you're thinking about it longer term, not just this year. So if you think about cereal, both in the U.S. and the U.K., we view it as a steady, maybe a slightly faster growing or slower shrinking business than it was previously at the volume line with better pricing and steady cash generation, really similar to the way it performed previously. With Refrigerated Retail, specifically around the Bob Evans side dish business, we have equal, if not more confidence in the quality of that character and our position in it. If you look at our Foodservice business and BellRing, I think you know what we think about BellRing, we continue to believe it's got a very substantial growth ahead of it. And as I\u2019ve already talked about in terms of the decision to spend versus split, we are acting in alignment with that expectation of further growth. And we would have to argue that once we get through the rebate of the crisis amidst the pandemic and we see where volumes settle, that our growth trajectory is really consistent with where we enter the pandemic. What we don't know still 2 years in, is where does travel ultimately land, where do offices ultimately land. There may be a couple of points of exposure to the baseline, but we think the growth is intact."
