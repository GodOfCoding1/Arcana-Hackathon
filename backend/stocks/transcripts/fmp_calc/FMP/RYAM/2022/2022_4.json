    "content": " Revenues increased $309 million or 22% from prior year to $1.7 billion driven by strong demand and prices across all of our products, including cellular specialties, which represent half of our revenue and a significant majority of our EBITDA. The increases from prior year were led by our high purity cellulose segment, which delivered $150 of adjusted EBITDA, up $11 million or nearly 8% from the prior year. Paperboard delivered a solid $53 million of EBITDA, up $25 million or 89% driven by strong demand for sustainable packaging and higher prices. Corporate expenses improved $5 million from last year to $45 million for the full year driven by a change in the valuation of the GreenFirst shares and favorable currency impact, which were partially offset by higher variable compensation. Starting with the high purity cellulose segment on slide six, sales for the year increased $245 million or 22% to $1.3 billion driven by a 19% increase in sales prices for both CS and non-CS products. Overall, EBITDA for the segment improved $11 million to $150 million driven by higher prices and sales volumes, partially offset by the impact of significant cost inflation. EBITDA for this segment grew 89% or $25 million to $53 million as higher sales prices more than offset increased costs for purchased pulp, chemicals, logistics, and the impact of lower sales volumes. Sales increased by $24 million from prior year driven by a 25% in sales prices, partially offset by a 3% decline in sales volumes. Sales price improvements across each segment and volume improvements in HPC driven by strong demand for CS, more than offset $258 million of higher costs driven by persistent inflation throughout the year. On slide 12, we graphically depict how our $200 million to $215 million of adjusted EBITDA guidance converts to free cash flow and supports our capital allocation decisions to either repay debt and/or invest in attractive strategic projects. Overall, we expect to deliver $200 million to $215 million of EBITDA in 2023, an increase of 13% to 21% over prior year. It's obviously -- it's -- we're seeing pricing decline right now, but we're going to see some offset on that -- on the volumes in 2023, given the increased productivity that we're expecting after the investments we made last year."
