    "content": " Starting on Slide 5, sales for the quarter increased 10% to $352 million with price increases across all segments, driven by strong demand, including double-digit price increases for our cellulose specialties\u2019 products. Turning to our High Yield Pulp segment on Slide 9, sales declined $6 million from prior year, driven by a 32% decline in sales volumes, primarily due to supply chain and production constraints. Turning to Slide 10 on a consolidated basis, operating income declined $16 million from prior year to a $16 million loss as price improvements across each segment were impacted by higher input costs and supply chain constraints. And right now, we've already got past at 60% home, so we're in a real good position to continue on that momentum and you'll see that occurring and hitting us strongly in the second half of the year. You referenced really strong fluff pricing, which I've never seen these increases, so it'll be interesting to see how sustainable it is, but it's a lot of volume coming in on the DP side, just wondering what you're seeing in that market."
