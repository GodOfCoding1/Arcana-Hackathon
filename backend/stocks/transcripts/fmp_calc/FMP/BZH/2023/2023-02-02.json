    "content": " While there's too much uncertainty around future sales prices to provide profitability expectations for the full year, with our large backlog and available production universe, we believe we can deliver at least 4,000 homes in fiscal 2023, which should again lead to total homebuilding revenue in excess of $2 billion (ph). You may go ahead. I think that there will be improvement in our direct costs in the second and third quarter, but I think it's going to be pretty modest honestly, so weighted average thing as much as anything where the weighted average of homes with lower costs will be far better by the time get to the fourth quarter. You may go ahead. You may go ahead. And I also think it's important to understand that just because home prices may not fall as far from here as was feared, I think we're going to get to a point where we do have year-over-year price reductions because of the action that occurred in the first quarter really started last summer. You may go ahead."
