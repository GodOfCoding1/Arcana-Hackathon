    "content": " So with that out of the way, I would tell you that there really are two things that are happening in cancellations, either people chose to not lock and they find rates that either they can't or they don't want to afford or in a few of our cities, and it really isn't in most of our cities, we've seen folks walk away from fairly significant earnest money deposits in order to buy a home that is ready right now before their home with us is ready at a giant discount. And I think that there is definitely a dynamic around fiscal year ends in the industry between September and December, where if you're sitting on finished specs and we see it every year, maybe more so this year than many, you're seeing giant incentives on those ready to move in homes as opposed to on to-be-built homes. Folks that were not locked in on their rate and got to a place where they can't afford it or just say, \"gosh, 7% is a lot, and I want to wait or there's a $50,000 offer, an $80,000 off and they're walking away from a significant earnest money with us in order to go capture that."
