    "content": " You may go ahead. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s really about balancing the capital allocation priorities and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s setting the business up for growth in the future from a land perspective, growing book value per share, and continuing to delever the business from a net debt to net cap perspective. You may go ahead. You may go ahead. We obviously didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t talk about 23 land spending, the call specifically because as we kind of measure what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to happen in the market and what we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re seeing, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be pretty flexible the way you think about our capital allocation approach. You may go ahead. So if we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re in a robust selling environment, we may struggle in certain quarters to have the growth, but given the number of communities under development and approved I would say we\u00e2\u0080\u0099d have to sell at a much faster pace than I think is likely for us to not have community count growth. You may go ahead. Well, Kwaku, I think the answer really, and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not going to be kind of the playbook specifically, but I would tell you more broadly, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s about risk adjusted returns in the business. You may go ahead."
