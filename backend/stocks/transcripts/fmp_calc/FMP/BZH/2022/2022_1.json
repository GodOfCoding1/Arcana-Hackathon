    "content": " With such significant visibility into our expected closings, we now anticipate ASPs for the full year to be over $470,000 or more than 15% higher than the prior year and operating margins should be up about 200 basis points versus fiscal 2021. Your line is open, sir. And while I don't think we're going to see the kind of house price appreciation we've seen over the last year, one of our counter moves to that is to make sure we're really focused on getting the envelope the right lifestyle, but to get it in the most affordable format that we can. Your line is open, sir. So the next question, when I look at the community count slide from the fourth quarter 2021 deck versus the one in today's deck, it doesn't seem like there's been much change on the opening in the next six months and under development. But it is absolutely the case that the supply chain issues, the labor availability issues has made land development a slower exercise and it's why we're only going to see modest sequential growth in community count into the second quarter with \u2013 and I think the phrase that Dave used was right, acceleration in 2023."
