    "content": " We currently estimate the capital expenditures required for the design, assembly and launch of our first 20 commercial satellites to be approximately $300 million to $340 million. The initial five satellites, which we expect to launch in late 2023 will now use existing components from our BlueWalker 3 tests satellite design, including certain integrated circuit components, navigation controls, and antennas. We benefit from this change in mix of satellites, as it will enable AST to construct and launch these satellites sooner, but this will also result in an increase in cost per satellites, due to the current higher cost of these first generation components. In addition to this change in the mix of our first 20 satellites, a number of factors including inflation, supply chain disruptions, design changes, and increases in the cost of electronic components, assembly equipment, launch costs, salaries and other aspects of our satellite design and assembly activities has increased the cost to design, assemble, and launch our satellites. We are first building our next block of satellites using similar technologies and a combination of our current facility and Side 2 in order to launch -- to support the launches that we have next year, and then, to follow-up and extend our site to support the six satellites per month production capabilities. As I mentioned earlier, the increase in our capital costs estimates for the first 20 satellites was a result of the use of older generation BlueWalker 3 parts and the first five satellites, and the impact of general inflation and supply chain issues."
