    "content": " The third quarter was another period of milestone achievements and execution, and I want to congratulate the entire AST SpaceMobile team for their efforts on the successful launch of the Blue Walker 3 test satellite and the unfolding of the largest communications array ever deployed commercially in low earth orbit. After evaluating future R&D milestones over the next few quarters, we expect that the level of non-GAAP adjusted operating expenses will remain in the high 30s for the next 2 quarters as we continue to pursue important R&D projects for our bluebird satellite and decline to the low 30s thereafter. As Blue Walker 3 continues to perform as expected, we are now focusing our investments towards the production of our bluebird satellites in the latter half of 2023 and setting up ground infrastructure to connect to the terrestrial network of the MNOs supported by technology and infrastructure partners such as American Tower, Rakuten, Symphony and Nokia."
