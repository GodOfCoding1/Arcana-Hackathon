    "content": " As an experienced telecom CFO and banker, the work I did to understand the AST story continue to lead me to conclude that this project, given its global ambitions has the potential of making a large and profound impact on the world\u2019s connectivity ecosystem by solving what is probably the most critical problem faced in the mobile industry today, providing global cellular broadband coverage directly to standard unmodified mobile phones. It\u2019s an opportunity, like Sean highlighted, that is really differentiated and the mobile network operators who have \u2013 many of them have bad experiences with satellites historically saw this as solving a lot of the problems in the past. And so it\u2019s one that\u2019s always resonated well, and you can see that in the success we have had adding more and more mobile network operators over the last few months, some of whom have over 100 or multiple hundreds of subscribers under their belt today."
