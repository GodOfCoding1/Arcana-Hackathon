    "content": " Our capital expenditures, which have been averaging around $10 million to $11 million per quarter, will begin to increase to fund the development of our Block 1 satellites, which we currently expect to launch in the first quarter of 2024. First of all, I want to reiterate that our focus is providing cellular broadband globally for people that live work in places where there's not satellite connectivity that allow us to participate in the $1 trillion wireless market, and we think that that's our core business. As we have stated during our earnings presentation and disclosed in our 10-K, we believe we have enough cash on hand and other resources to fund the next 12 months of operations, including the construction launch of 5 Block 1 satellites, which are targeted to be launched in the first quarter of 2024. Please proceed with your questions. We focused on that as a first phase, but we do believe there's revenue there, both for service and other related things we can sell to those MNO customers as -- and then there's also the government opportunities, which government market is quite often in the satellite world an early contributor to revenue in the overall company cycle. Please proceed with your questions. Please proceed with your questions. And that's key because the reason why this challenge has not been solved before and why we think others will struggle to solve it in a meaningful way because there's a lot of components to the architecture, being able to transmit and do that initial end-to-end testing was a real key validation for us as well as flying the satellite and mechanical unfolding. Please proceed with your questions."
