Your line is now open. Your line is now open. And so, what I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d say in terms of the way to think about CapEx for the remainder of this year and sort of why the bit of a push out is, as we complete the Stage II commissioning as you would expect from us, we are pretty maniacally focused on maintaining retentions and hold backs in areas as we get to the finish line. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. Your line is now open."
