    "content": " Given the significant increase in construction on site, investment in maximizing the long-term value of the mineral resource, as well as planning and coordinating for Stage 2 commissioning, we are really pleased with the team's ability to focus and deliver on hitting world class production and shipping targets. And so we're thinking about this from a -- what is the most thoughtful way we can maximize long-term enterprise value for MP as well as make sure that we are doing things, again, just going back to what I said before, it's just so important is making sure that we can take on things that we can execute. And I would say that we are working as quickly as possible, frankly, for 2 years from -- at least 2 years, the biggest question we typically get from government and industry actors is how quickly can you get this all done, right, is people want this supply chain resort, it's strategic, economically, it's important national security wise. But the big thing, and I think that maybe this will sort of help remember that as we're building this out, one, we're certainly you would imagine that we're in constant contact with any major -- certainly GM, who's a publicly stated deal, but any major customer that we would ever have, we would be in constant contact with and make sure that we're fully transparent about our operation."
