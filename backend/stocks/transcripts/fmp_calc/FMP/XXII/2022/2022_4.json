    "content": " And hemp/cannabis, we still intend to hit cash positive 2024 driven by the continued acceleration of consumer demand for CBD derived products, improved operating results, such as our Prineville crude extraction facility, and an industry first fully verticalized solution with top customer and consumer CBD brands taking the centralized with GVB ingredients manufacturing and now distribution. We've also opened new facilities in Europe and acquired RXP in the U.K. to create a strong footprint for landed ingredients sales in the higher margin, European market and access to an emerging food and nutraceuticals market in the U.K. And finally, we have filed a DMF to allow our CBD isolate to be used by companies conducting clinical trials with the FDA supplying the multibillion-dollar pharmaceutical industry. 22nd Century's cash requirements are anticipated decrease, reflecting higher sales volume for VLN products through fiscal year 2023 and continued organic growth of hemp/cannabis operations. And then if you were to combine that with some of the new incremental revenue streams we're starting to create, particularly on the distribution side as Jim had mentioned, you have a clear path when you start to get to anywhere from, I would say $55 million to $60 million in revenue to be, again free cash flow breakeven, free cash flow positive as a business unit post corporate overhead as well. And so since you're looking at 1.2 million cartons on an annualized basis, let's call it by the middle of 2024, then you would still be short of that at the end of 2023 to that kind of steady state working capital needs."
