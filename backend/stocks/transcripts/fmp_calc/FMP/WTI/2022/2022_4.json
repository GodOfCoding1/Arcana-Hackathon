    "content": " To put this in perspective, the $563.7 million in '22, adjusted EBITDA was almost 50% higher than the total of full year's 2021 and 2020 combined, which totalled $383.7 million. For year-end 2022, we reported SEC proved reserves of 165.3 million barrels of oil equivalent, which included 7.3 million barrels of oil of equivalent -- of positive performance revisions and an increase of 6 million barrels of oil equivalent due to the two acquisitions we made early in 2022. So, in total, we added 22.3 million barrels of oil of new reserves, which replaced 153% of our 2022 production of 14.6 million barrels of oil equivalent. So, at year-end 2022, the company had total debt of $693.4 million or net debt of $232.1 million, net of cash and cash equivalents, consisting of the balance of the nonrecourse Mobile Bay term loan of $143.3 million and $550.1 million of 9.75% senior secured lien notes net of amortized debt issuance costs for both instruments. So, entering 2023, we strengthened our balance sheet by issuing new 2026 senior second lien notes at par, totalling $275 million in a private offering and used the proceeds along with a considerable cash position to retire all $552.5 million of our 2023 senior second lien notes. For full year 2023, we expect to produce between 37,000 and 41,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, which is a small decrease of 3% year-over-year and flat compared to fourth quarter of 2022."
