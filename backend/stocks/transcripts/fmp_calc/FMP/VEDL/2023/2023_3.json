As a reminder, all participant lines will be in the listen-only mode and there will be an opportunity for you to ask questions after the presentation concludes. I now hand the conference over to Mr. Sandep Agrawal, Group Head, Investor Relations, Vedanta Limited. Thank you, Pratham, and hello everyone. The financial statements, press release and presentation are already available on the website. Today from our leadership team we have with us Mr. Sunil Duggal, our Group CEO; Mr. Ajay Goel, Group CFO. We are also joined by leaders from a couple of key businesses, Mr. Arun Misra, CEO of Zinc business; and Mr. Rahul Sharma, Deputy CEO Aluminum business. Now, without further ado, I would like to hand over the call to Mr. Duggal. Good evening everyone, and welcome to quarter three conference call. During the third quarter, the Indian economy remains strong and resilient on some macroeconomic fundamentals in healthy domestic consumption. Despite rising interest rates, robust growth was witnessed in macroeconomic sectors like housing, automobile, consumer durables. However, the global economy continued to grapple with multiple headwinds like monetary tightening, high inflation, geopolitical instability and volatility in financial markets. In this macro environment, our team has performed commendably. We stood several initiatives, achieved strong operational performance. Our third quarter EBITDA stood at \u00e2\u0082\u00b97,100 crore. Free cash pre-CapEx for the quarter stood at \u00e2\u0082\u00b96,500 crore with focus on working capital and cost optimization. In line with our repurposed ESG strategy, we work to uplift the quality of life of communities through various initiatives around drinking water, sanitation, healthcare, community infrastructure, children's wellbeing and education among the rest. Our MSCI ESG rating has improved from CCC in 2020 to DB now, and Sustainalytics have also improved our ESG risk score by 4.5 points. Furthering on our goal to deploy 2.5 gigawatt of around-the-clock renewable energy for our operation by 2030, I'm delighted to share that we have approved plans for another 941 megawatt RE power under group captive RE power development program for our operating across India, including Hindustan Zinc. During the quarter, our aluminum business procured 390 million units of RE power and are conducting biofuel trials as green alternative for ladle preheating and heavy vehicles. We have also joined as HZL, Cairn India and Iron Ore Businesses in Net water positive operation. Cairn signed MoU with Gujarat State Forest Department for development of 60 hectares of Mangroves Forest, 50,000 saplings, in coastal area of Surat in our effort to promote biodiversity and reserve environment. When I come to operations and first on aluminum, our quarterly CoP further reduced by 12% to $2149 per tonne on account operations and buying efficiency. With better plant and mine metal availability, it continues to be in the first quartile of global cost curve. And of course, cost of production excluding TcRc in this quarter decrease 12% vis-\u00c3\u00a0-vis with operational efficiency and higher production volumes. We commenced first gas and condensate facility in Jaya field, which is OALP. As you know that the government has extended the PSC for 10 years and we have signed the addendum to extension with effect from May, 2020. Sale was sluggish due to common imposed duty and export, but now it has picked up. However, we saw a quarterly decline in VAB margin owing to price correction. Still one of our blast furnaces was put on maintenance shutdown, resulting in a 6% quarterly production decline. However, ESL\u00e2\u0080\u0099s margin were affected by declined steel prices and high cost production, the newly acquired iron ore mine owing to regulatory charges to repair on iron ore production. In FACOR, nine-month ore production grew 15% YoY. Due to operation efficiency our 60 KTPA furnace is undergoing test run and we are on track to get first production in the month of February, current quarter. Overall, we have made significant progress across our strategic priorities, creating value for our stakeholders. Consolidation of ZI under HZL will fast track ZI's growth by using HZL's best-in-class expertise in underground mining, melting and metal marketing. HZL's combined R&R would be one billion ton plus, and it would have benefit of improved access to developed market and strong foothold in African subcontinent for expansion. Moving forward, we are optimistic on the commodity market and macro data that we see now is improving. China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s reopening post zero Covid policy, property market stimulus and front loading of infrastructure investments to expand is another positive for metals\u00e2\u0080\u0099 global demand. At the same time, India's economic situation is expected to be better than the rest of the world due to strong domestic consumption. Moreover, this is seasonally a good quarter for commodity demand in India. India being our largest market, it's continued strength offered well for our business performance. With our outstanding portfolio of low-cost assets, multi-commodity credit, strong balance sheet and a commitment to ESG leadership, we are well positioned to deliver value to our shareholders and our communities. With this now I would like to hand over to our CFO, Mr. Ajay Goel, for financial performance. Third quarter witnessed a falling inflation and improving the sentiments, which has driven recent metal outperformance. Indian economy remained buoyant and saw strong growth in metal consuming sectors and India's manufacturing sectors ended 2022 on a strong moat, with the manufacturing PMI rising to two-year high of almost 57.8. This quarter performance witnessed steady production, easing off inflation that helped in a lower operating cost. At the same time, the profit was impacted by further softening of commodity prices. Numbers for the Q3 are reflection of continuing our various improvement initiatives in terms of enhancing production, lowering operating cost, and focus on free cash flow. That being the console quarterly revenue stands at about \u00e2\u0082\u00b933,691 crores, down 7% quarter-on-quarter impacted by lower LME and brent, the quarterly EBITDA at \u00e2\u0082\u00b97,100 crores with the margin of 24% supported by easing off input inflation and also strategic hedging. The highlight \u00e2\u0080\u0093 the main highlight for the current quarter remains our profit after tax, PAT, which is at about \u00e2\u0082\u00b93,092, which increased by 15%, quarter-on-quarter, healthy free cash flow, pre-CapEx \u00e2\u0082\u00b96,504 crores. You heard that we also declared \u00e2\u0082\u00b912.5 per share, fourth interim dividend. Before I move ahead further in Q3 performance, I would like to also highlight that our key metal businesses that is Zinc India, Zinc International and aluminum recorded highest ever MIC and metal production in the last nine months. We have an income statement in appendix, which will find details against each head of profit and loss account. When compared the third quarter EBITDA to the second quarter, the largest driver was the lower input inflation and first gain, which was partly offset by lower metal and brent prices. Further, if you look at items that were under our control during the quarter, we did well in terms of operational performance on cost front, which was the outcome of various improvement initiatives running across the businesses and to some extent, strategic hedging in Q3 as well. But if you compare last quarter, the benefit of hedging was lower competitively and therefore, it also impacted the EBITDA for the quarter. Net debt as on December 31, stand at about \u00e2\u0082\u00b938,000 crores with net debt-to-EBITDA, the leverage ratio at 0.96, which is maintained at low levels amongst Indian peers. As we are committed, earlier, our net debt-to-EBITDA level remains comfortable and well within the range of our capital allocation framework. Moving onto the balance sheet, we have built a more harmonious balance sheet with assets and liabilities moving towards better equilibrium and by which I need to say the overall debt at holding company has come down significantly in the current fiscal. We are well positioned to address our current maturities, focusing on driving improvement. In the first nine months, which is April to December, in the first nine months, we deleveraged holdco by $1.7 billion. Finally, we are confident in our ability to close the year with a strong performance as we have expertise to drive improvements across businesses while successfully weathering macroeconomic uncertainties. With this, I now hand over to operator for Q&A. Sir, my first question is on the proposed transaction with Hindustan Zinc. So I mean the kind of reserve and resources, the \u00e2\u0080\u0093 that I have at that point of time and now it has  has been put up as well as already ramped up to almost the full production. Second project is in pipeline, so that means the businesses on track to deliver 600KTPA of volume in the next two years time. Along with that a lot of exploration success has come and from the time then to now, you can see that the total contained metal in  is more than the funding at this point of time. So it creates a huge synergy and the success of the Hindustan Zinc transitioning to underground, putting up the smelting capacity integrating the operation. So I think it is a winning combination and with that winning combination, the common games and you can see that ONGC  other common company. We believe that this proposal could be exciting for the country, for the government and why should government not support. So Pinakin, I mean, you remember our policy allocation of capital \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and the entire proceed of $2.4 billion plus $0.5 billion in terms of time will be used and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be guided by your policy and allocation of capital. And in terms of how this money we can repatriate be it dividend or other means, I think that is something we are working on for nothing. But as I mentioned, allocation of capital policy remains the working team, so it is used \u00e2\u0080\u0093 it\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be used for funding our growth CapEx\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, any acquisitions at the same time, payment of dividend and deleveraging of VEDL or VRL. Thank you very much, sir. Couple of questions, on Aluminium Business, how do we expect the CoP to progress in Q4 FY2023 as remain the coal linkage is materialized at 65%, 70% and all other sources of Kolar price where they are today. So I have colleague in the name of Rahul Sharma, who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the CEO of Aluminium Business with me. But in the meantime, you can appreciate that we reduce the cost by say around $300 in quarter three compared to quarter two. But we feel that broadly the journey could continue depending on how much of the coal realization linkage, coal realization NPA movement would come. I think first I would just like to \u00e2\u0080\u0093 maybe \u00e2\u0080\u0093 just to take your flashback in terms of from in Q2 will, if you recall, we have said that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll reduce our cost by $200 and that was H2 guidance. If you see in Q3 itself, we have reduced $280, which is 12% reduction. And that is purely comes from three factor volume for sure is a coal cost, improved official KPI and also the buying efficiency. But coming to the Q4, I think we see that \u00e2\u0080\u0093 it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to better from here, especially the lever which we see because we are going to have the 100% coal metallization and also the Jamkhani coal mine, which is started in December. We are looking quantity from Jamkhani mine and also softer the commodity price, we see that there is going to be the \u00e2\u0080\u0093 further reduction and maybe \u00e2\u0080\u0093 maybe around 5% to 7%. The volumes are same, CoP same, however, EBITDA and revenue are the same despite lower realizations. See, the volumes are up slightly. So there are positive levers around the operation because of which, what is the percentage increase in EBITDA from oil and gas. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s flat, sir, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s flat CoP, despite much lower crude prices, how do you guys\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\n Yes. So you can see that the volume has gone up to 1.45, 1.46 and cost has also reduced. Sir, couple of questions. First is, I just wanted to have a sense and understanding of the debt maturity profile at Vedanta Resources. Please correct me if I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m wrong, but what I understand is we have an total outgo from $2.5 billion. So if you look at the\u00e2\u0080\u0093 maybe the two quarters, the one is a fourth quarter, the current quarter again of March, the need for the funding at  and with the current dividend of \u00e2\u0082\u00b912.50 and the renewal amount. If you look at the Q1 of next fiscal, which is April to June, the total requirement at Vedanta Resources is almost $2.1 billion, in fact $2,050 million to be precise. Now again multiple discussions, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re right, are going on. First of all, the oak tree upsizing by almost $750 million is one event. Secondly, we are in talks with the various banks based PUC or multinational banks, and at least $0.5 billion we assume we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll get from there, so $1.2 billion. Reminder amount is a combination of I guess of brand fees, which you pay in the first quarter and dividend. And Q1, we are in the advance stages of closing all of those over next two weeks\u00e2\u0080\u0099 time. So sir if I just go by the numbers, what you indicated, assuming oak tree at $750 million, brand fee at the $300 million, PUC of $550 million, mark cap at $150 million, it still lives with a gap of nearly $750 million. Well, I think those are the ones which are already in the pipeline out, Ritesh. And even the numbers can go hard, but with a combination of $750 million, $0.5 billion and the brand fee, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be covering almost $1.7 billion or so, and that leaves a small number, and even that we can cover, any additional payment of dividend always in option in Q1. And sir, I just wanted to understand we were striving for GR2RE, which I think the court has actually put a spanner. How does your thinking change basically when we are looking at a cash flow for the next year specifically, given that is again upwards of $2.5 billion plus of maturity for Vedanta Resources? So the whole proposal, as you remember, we spoke in last also a couple of investors call, the whole movement from GR2RE was a juristic. Knowing that the whole GR concept is basically a pass under new Complete Act, including I would think in very contemporary technical accounting. Amount that is paid in the last fiscal, including the two days amount is from the current reserve and profitability. That is very helpful, sir. More questions, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll join back with you. Hi sir, two questions from my side both again on the transaction. First, what would be the tax incidence of this inflow that we will get about $2.98 billion? So again, Indrajit, in terms of taxation, once you look at impact the two aspect, one is the international one. So the $2.98 billion one would receive the full consideration, there is no tax implication. Secondly, from the Indian tax perspective, I think that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s where we are still evaluating certain tax optimization ideas. So in terms of approvals, this is an RPT as we know, and that too also material RPT, which is crossing \u00e2\u0082\u00b91000 crores. So in terms of approvals, it is the audit committee of both the companies, Zinc and Vedanta Limited, which is done. Now the third step, of course is sending a postal ballot and getting the approval by the shareholders. Thereafter the 2.4 billion state consideration, leaving that deferred consideration can finish pretty quickly over next one month\u00e2\u0080\u0099s time. No, it's a board matter. One is 1.5 billion tonne Train I, 1.5 million tonne Train II. So as we speak, the Train I mechanical completion is getting over. And by this quarter end or the early quarter, next quarter the plant will be fired. And we are hopeful that in the next one to two quarter, it should ramp up to the full volume that is Train I. And the second Train, I think by the middle of the next year, the mechanical completion will be over, and then thereafter it will take one quarter or 1.5 quarter to fully ramp up. I covered this ballet in the call, so I said, so in terms of this entire money 2.4 plus 0.5 in terms of utilization will be guided by companies policy and allocation of capital, and it can be used for funding our CapEx\u00e2\u0080\u0099s both growth and sustaining at the same time payment of dividend and deleveraging for VEDL and VRL, but substantial portion we intend to use for deleveraging at a good plan. Okay, sir, thank you. I think secondly, after Athena, we have gobbled another asset in Meenakshi at pretty attractive valuations. So we'll discuss this, this question at that point of time. Sir, if I may just if I had, if hypothetically it goes at the parent or at Vedanta India listed entity, how should we look at the financials or if you can, if it's possible, if you can indicate what is the quantum of CapEx, which is required. I assume that the JV, that Foxconn 50-50 and there might be 30-70, so the effective outcome might be a bit low. So basically we can take, which we can understand it better. So Ritesh you have to appreciate that once this transaction is not approved, I am not supposed to discuss this numbers also at this point of time. And sir, on power, and secondly, basically Hindustan Zinc incremental basically worthless if at all. See, as far as ESG is concerned, we made the 10 commandments declaration to the market that what are we going to do. And there are various approvals, project initiatives, various entities are taking. So when \u00e2\u0080\u0093 even when we did the PLF of 4-gigawatt, it will reduce the carbon footprint by 15% from our current level. So against our overall declaration of 25%, if we are able to decarbonize 15% in the next two years time, I think we should pat ourself on the back, number one. Number two, as far as Athena and Meenakshi is concerned, see the power demand in country, you must have seen last year has gone up by 8% to 10%. So from that point of view, our footprints are not increasing from our operations. And that is why, we think that what we are doing is the right thing to do. What we have saw in Hindustan Zinc, Arun, you are party to the roadshow, if you can comment on that. So we have \u00e2\u0080\u0093 sir, thank you for the question. So with certain government is working out in what form, how many trenches they would do, and let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s wait for that. And we know that this calendar year, CY 2022, primary demand was 70 million and we see that it is going to be a CAGR of 4% to 5% as a growth, which is likely to happen. And if I talk about India per se, India demand if we see that on the backdrop of 17% YoY growth has been seen in the last nine months. And we see that the demand for the country, especially for India last year was 3.9 million, and this year is going to touch 4.5 million. So we can see that there is a very strong demand, especially India is, so, demand has been increasing electrical and power sector. And another factor also, China is coming back and we see that China is also growing for 4.4% year-on-year growth. And that's what I think as in on the line, same line, we are also looking to expand our capacity from, \u00e2\u0082\u00b92.3 million to \u00e2\u0082\u00b92.8 million, then we are taking up to \u00e2\u0082\u00b93 million. And also sir on realization, how do you see the realization moving now going forward because, the prices started to go up. Yes, again price point of view, I can only say that, key indicator which drives the growth and I have said few, but the important is that I think China removal of COVID related restriction, that's one. Second is India, which I have already spoken. That is that U.S. inflation dropped by 6.5% in December for vis-\u00c3\u00a0-vis 7.1% in November, U.S. dollar index also dropped, from 115 to 102 and other side, if I see that, the kind of production cut, which is 2.5 million in China and 1 million in Europe. And there is also, if you see the inventory level, which is I think the lowest since 2002 is 1.4 million. So all the indicator, if you see that that is a very strong indicator to have a better level from the current, which maybe has gone to 2200, kind of, I will only say on that point. And just last question so this, you mentioned during the call that, I know after this export ban removal, just the exports are picking up. No, we export last quarter you see when the ban was removed and we took a conscious call of slowing down the domestic sales because there we, there is a increase a bit of by around $8 to $10 per tonne. So as we speak we have been able to, move some shipments already and I feel that the from the current month it'll be the dispatch and the sale would come up to the normal level. So that means around 6 million tonnes, 0.6 million tonnes this month itself, it'll take. Although we still will have some inventory at the end of this month, which will be able to capitalize in the current quarter. And if you look at maybe for the first nine months, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s in fact almost touching \u00e2\u0082\u00b93000 crores, the number is actually the \u00e2\u0082\u00b92009 crores or \u00e2\u0082\u00b92005 crores. But right now, if you look at mark-to-market for the quantity hedged, the gain is almost still about 50 odd million for the fourth quarter. Ladies and gentlemen, that was the last question for today. Thank you and over to you, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of Vedanta Limited, that concludes this conference call."
