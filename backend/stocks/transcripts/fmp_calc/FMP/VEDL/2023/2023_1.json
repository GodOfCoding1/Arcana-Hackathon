    "content": " We have invested more than $14 billion across businesses over the last 10 years, without raising further capital from equity market, we are investing $3 billion over next two years and $2 billion in FY '23 alone of growth volume, value-added products, backward integration, operational efficiency and digitization. Our quarterly group revenue stands at INR38,251 crores, which is up 36% year-on-year, Y-o-Y, highest ever first quarter EBITDA of INR10,741 crores, up 7% Y-o-Y with a strong EBITDA margin of 32%, driven by operational performance, despite inflationary cost pressures and moderating commodities prices. Thank you very much. So just to clarify because we keep on getting this question, the $30 test (ph) would translate into what kind of realization impact for Vedanta or just to make it more simpler, if the tax was there in quarter one when the Brent was 114 and Vedanta's average realization was 110. Thank you very much. So if I speak off the second quarter for aluminum, against our planned volume for second quarter, almost 28% volumes are hedged and the hedging price is about $3,630 per tonne. Thank you very much. Thank you so much. Just being the Vedanta Limited call, but you're right, in terms of -- for the current fiscal for Vedanta Resources, total maturities is $3.7 billion, including $1 billion, which is a combination of interest cost and ICL that leaves almost $2.7 billion for the full fiscal in terms of external debt. Thank you so much. Thank you so much. Thank you so much. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you very much."
