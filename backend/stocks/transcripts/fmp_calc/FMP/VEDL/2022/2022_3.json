    "content": " The cost of production stood at $1,148 per ton, up 2% Q-o-Q due to higher coal prices and input commodity inflation partially offset with higher volume and operational efficiency. Depreciation charge for Q3 were INR2,274 crores, higher 19% Y-o-Y, primarily due to higher overall working interest production and depletion charge at Rajasthan Oil & Gas, higher ore volumes and capitalization of Zinc and Aluminum businesses. The finance cost for Q3 was INR1,216 crores, down 8% Y-o-Y, majorly due to lower average borrowings and up 14% quarter-on-quarter, majorly on account of one-time gain we booked on ASI bonds buyback in the previous quarter. As we can see on the chart, in summary, the significant portion of EBITDA increase of INR3,240 crores from INR7,700 crores last year to almost INR11,000 crores in this current year has been market or pricing driven, along with higher volumes at Zinc business and higher peers factors at TSPL from 60% last year to more than 90% in the current year Q3. Only one positive development from the last quarter to this quarter is that last - because we were talking for a last couple of quarters for the Tranche V. I think the positive development, which has happened is 16.6 million ton of coal through Tranche V, which is almost 60% of our requirement, and that is for five years."
