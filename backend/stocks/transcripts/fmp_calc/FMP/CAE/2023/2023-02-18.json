    "content": " We're excited about Civil's prospects as we build on our industry-leading position with the most innovative training and critical operations support solutions, and we expect to see significant growth during and beyond the ongoing global aviation market recovery. And if I look at \u00e2\u0080\u0093 I mean, not specifically addressing your question, I'll get to it, but if you look at next quarter, we're going to have a lot more full place similar deliveries, which will play a role in the margins because inherently, product sales are although profitable, they're not as profitable as training. Thank you very much. So as we go \u00e2\u0080\u0093 so that's what allows me to reaffirm not for Q4, for sure, and then having enough line of sight of how we're doing in terms of abatement of those factors to give the optimism that I have for its continuous sequential improvements all through next year along the way to our long-term target of double-digit growth \u00e2\u0080\u0093 double-digit profitability. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you very much."
