    "content": " Defense also won a contract in the sea domain with the platforms and system training contracts to support the Royal Australian Navy and this program is strategically significant in the context of Australia's its modernization priorities in light of geopolitical tensions in the Indo-Pacific region Under a five-year agreement, we'll be supporting the future training transformation of Royal Air Navy Mariners across four platforms On Site, In Port NSC. Capital expenditures totaled $68.6 million this quarter, with approximately 80% invested in growth, to specifically add capacity to our Civil global training network to deliver on the long-term training contracts in our backlog. And by and large, in the previous answer, I was talking about this, that we're seeing a shift in contracts that's certainly the ones we're bidding on going from really lowest price wins, what's called lowest cost technically acceptable contracts to best value in the United States Defense Department. So I'm pretty confident that first of all, that the programs that we're winning that earn a backlog certainly in the last five quarters where we've seen this strong backlog increase are at profitability levels that support our objectives for low double-digit profitability. I just wanted to first -- I'm trying to make sense of the defense SOI for second quarter, which was, I think, $18 million, still kind of down below the normal levels that you had before the last quarter."
