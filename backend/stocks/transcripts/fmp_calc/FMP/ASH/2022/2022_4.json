    "content": " Hello, everyone, and welcome to Ashland's fourth quarter fiscal year 2022 earnings conference call and webcast. The news release issued last night was furnished to the SEC in a Form 8-K. During today's call, we will reference slides that are currently being webcast on our Web site, ashland.com, under the Investor Relations section. As a reminder, during today's call, we will be making forward-looking statements on several matters, including our outlook for fiscal year 2022. Please also note that we will be referring to certain actual and projected financial metrics on Ashland on an adjusted basis, which are non-GAAP financial measures. The most directly comparable GAAP measures, as well as reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures to those GAAP measures are available on our Web site and in the appendix of today's slide presentation. Guillermo will then provide additional commentary related to Ashland's financial results in fiscal year 2022, progress made related to our operating strategy, our goals for environmental, social, and governments' commitments, and an overview of our financial outlook for fiscal year 2023. Having spent the last two weeks in Europe meeting with customers and our teams, today, we're holding this call from London. Ashland's results for the quarter were consistent with our expectations, and we delivered sales and adjusted EBITDA for the year at the top end of our expected ranges. Customer order dynamics remained strong across our core end markets, and we continue to make significant progress on taking appropriate pricing actions to recover costs across all segments. Given the tightness in markets globally, our teams have taken steps to improve the mix of high-value products we're selling. We continue to invest on future-forward sustainable innovations to drive profitable growth, accelerating the pace and impact of new product introductions. Ashland performed well during this quarter and fiscal year, delivering strong results, which I will review later in the call. Sales, of $631 million, grew by 7% compared to prior year. Against a backdrop of strong global demand, all businesses contributed to our growth. Adjusted EBITDA declined by a modest 1% to $147 million as strong results were offset by unfavorable foreign currency, higher incentive compensation, and planned facility turnaround costs. Adjusted EBITDA margin declined 190 basis points to 23.3%, compared to prior year quarter with FX and turnaround negatively impacting margins by 310 basis points. For the full-year, Ashland achieved an adjusted EBITDA margin of nearly 25%. Returns to shareholders continued to grow during the quarter, with adjusted EPS up 20% to $1.46 per share, reflecting the impact of share repurchases, lower interest expenses, and favorable effective tax rate. As I noted previously, all segments contributed to delivering sales growth in the quarter driven by inflation recovery pricing, mix improvement, and many product lines remaining capacity constrained. I look forward to discussing our outlook for fiscal '23, and reviewing the broader progress made by the company later in the call. Total Ashland sales in the quarter were $631 million, up 7% versus prior year, driven by continued inflation recovery and mix improvements. Gross margin was relatively flat at 33.1%, reflecting cost recovery and mix improvements by the commercial teams in the face of significant cost inflation. Excluding key items, SG&A, R&D, and intangible amortization costs increased to $123 million in the quarter primarily due to higher variable compensation accruals. In total, Ashland's adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $147 million, down only slightly from the prior year adjusted EBITDA of $149 million. It's important to note that unfavorable foreign currency negatively impacted adjusted EBITDA by $15 million in the quarter, while the planned turnaround at the Intermediates facility, in Lima, resulted in $13 million of incremental cost. Ashland's adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was 23.3%, with FX and the turnaround negatively impacting the margin by 310 basis points. Adjusted EPS excluding acquisition amortization for the quarter was $1.46 per share, up 20% from the prior-year quarter, reflecting a lower diluted share count, lower interest expense, and a favorable effective tax rate. Ongoing free cash flow was $93 million for the quarter, a reduction from the prior year, primarily reflecting an increase in working capital given the inflation in raw material and other input costs we have seen globally. Now, let's review the results for each of our four operating segments. Pharma demand remained strong, product mix was favorable, the team executed on disciplined cost recovery, and the plants operated well; all contributing to margin expansion. In total, Life Sciences sales increased by 13% to $213 million, while adjusted EBITDA increased by 19%, to $57 million. Personal Care also had a strong quarter, with good execution by the team. There was strong organic demand across all end markets, and the microbial protection acquisition we made last year is performing above expectations. For the quarter, Personal Care sales increased by 3% to $188 million, while adjusted EBITDA increased 10% to $56 million. Specialty Additives had a solid quarter overall with good performance by the team, while demand remained healthy and mix improved during the quarter, capacity constraints and unfavorable foreign currency limited overall sales growth. For the quarter, Special Additives grew sales by 3% to $187 million, while adjusted EBITDA declined by 9% to $43 million, primarily reflecting higher operating costs, including higher energy costs at our European cellulosic manufacturing facilities. Intermediates' reported sales were $64 million, up 7% compared to the prior year driven by higher merchant market pricing and improved product mix management. As discussed on previous earnings calls, the Intermediates team performed a planned turnaround at the Lima, Ohio facility during the quarter. The turning was executed on time and budget, resulting in costs of $13 million which impacted segment profitability in the quarter. Intermediates reported adjusted EBITDA of $17 million; a decline of 19% compared to prior year, and adjusted EBITDA margin declined to 26.6%. As we discussed at our Investor Day, last November, capital allocation discipline continues to be an important component of Ashland's value-creation strategy. Since August of 2021, we have executed on $650 million of share repurchases, representing approximately 11% of our outstanding shares. And earlier this year, Ashland's Board of Directors approved a new $500 million evergreen share repurchase authorization. We are investing in our existing business to grow organically, and continue to pursue our strategy of enhanced, profitable growth through targeted bolt-on M&A opportunities focused on pharma, personal care, and coatings. Against a backdrop of global uncertainty, Ashland has a strong balance sheet with the flexibility to pursue our targeted growth strategy. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Guillermo to discuss fiscal '22 results and our priorities and outlook for fiscal '23. Given the strong demand, we are largely sold out across many product lines resulting in capacity constraints for our segments. Cost inflation, particularly for raw materials, freight, and energy, were significant throughout the year. During the year, we launched a record number of new products which also have significantly higher sales growth potential, in line with our goal of increasing innovation, speed, and impact, and they all are aligned with our sustainability goals. In addition to these factors, changes in the global economy and the strength of the U.S. dollar grow significant unfavorable foreign currency impact to both sales and earnings. In spite of the challenges faced, Ashland delivered sales and earnings growth for the year that surpassed our original expectations. We closed the sale of the Performance Adhesives business earlier in the year, and used the proceeds to repurchase a significant number of our shares, and reduced our outstanding debt. We expect those trends to moderate next year, enabling cash flow generation more consistent with our stated targets. As we've discussed on past earnings calls, we began numerous large capital investments to increase capacity for key product lines to support our pharmaceutical, personal care, and architectural coatings businesses. These expansions are well underway, and we continue to expect production to come online towards the end of calendar year 2023, and into 2024. In summary, Ashland's balance sheet gives us a strong footing in an uncertain world, and we have the flexibility and discipline to execute our growth strategy and reward our shareholders. We continue to strengthen our internal innovation portfolio management to both accelerate the pace of new product launches, and to ensure that those launches create the most value for our customers and for Ashland. Before I turn to our financial outlook later in the call, I would like to review key financial highlights for the year. As discussed, the strong results were driven by resilient end market demand, mix improvements among capacity constrained assets, and disciplined cost inflation recovery, partially offset by significant foreign currency headwinds of $77 million. All segments grew adjusted EBITDA by at least double digits reflecting early cost recovery action, sustained quality margins, and continued mix improvement by our commercial teams. And as with sales results, adjusted EBITDA for the year was partially offset by significant foreign currency headwinds of $38 million. Adjusted EPS excluding acquisition, amortization for the year was up -- was $5.70, up 52% from prior year. Our priorities remain focused on growing our business while maintaining its quality, driving profitable growth opportunities, margin, and free cash flow expansion while leveraging EGS as a core value and enabler. From all the comments I shared, our teams continue to demonstrate strong progress on all fronts demonstrating operating resilience, strategic focus, innovation and growth, and capital allocation discipline. We opened our call this morning with a video that coincides with the launch of Ashland's inaugural ESG report, materiality matrix, and experiential web pages. As we think about Ashland's operations and results for fiscal year '23, we recognize that are many known macroeconomic dynamics impacting not only our company but our customers, suppliers, competitors, and the consumer. Known dynamics include global recessionary trends, continued inflation, supply chain and logistic challenges, European energy cost and availability, pricing arbitrage in certain areas of the global, rising interest rates and higher cost of capital, global currency volatility, and a decelerating M&A environment. A more significant global recession, the war in Ukraine, regional weather impacts, energy availability and cost, COVID, government- mandated lockdowns, and continued currency volatility are all factors that could have an impact over the coming years. Although we are expecting a recessionary environment during 2023, our businesses and markets we serve have historically demonstrated resilience. In line with this -- with our demand outlook, we expect no changes in our underlying operating performance. Taking these factors into account for fiscal year '23, we expect sales in the range of $2.5 billion to $2.7 billion which represents nearly 9% growth at the midpoint with inflation recovering and mix improvement remaining the major growth drivers. Let me be clear, as we have done in the past few years when uncertainty was high we are being pragmatic and focusing on the things we can control and forecast. We have confidence in the company's business portfolio, market-focused global teams, and our plans and actions that we are taking. We have demonstrated strong sales and earnings during the last two years, and we are confident that we will maintain that resilience in 2023, and beyond. Over the last decade, Ashland's journey of transformation has sharpened our focus as in an additives and specialty ingredients company. As we systematically identify and tackle the thorniest problems, we concentrate on areas rich in opportunities to innovate and drive value for our customers, where innovation and expertise in one business can be leveraged across others. We have solidified our portfolio as a global additives and specialty ingredients company with exceptional businesses that have leadership position in resilient, high-quality consumer-driven markets. Your line is now open. So, on the lower side, I think -- we're sold out. So, if you look on the lower side is that we do see some more recessionary impact in our businesses or that there's more inventory adjustment from customers. So, a volume impact that could impact both gross profit generation and absorption, a lower mix that could kick in, obviously for FX is a big challenge and continues to be a big impact for both upside or downside scenarios. And I think on both, it's very interesting; I mean inflation is driving a lot of the revenue growth for everybody in this environment. So, depending on how to look at it, I mean protecting margins is a high priority, but the growth and the EBITDA generation will also vary depending on the inflationary outlook. On the high side, it really is more about inflation continuing to be strong, robust movement on pricing recovery, and mix improvement, and that the FX is a little bit more favorable. And just, Guillermo, going back to the analyst day, which is, I guess, was about a year ago, I mean there was a lot of debate and discussion around longer-term Personal Care growth. You've done pretty well, you've exited some business lines, it seems like you launched a new product specifically in hair care and add some preservatives from Sch\u00c3\u00bclke. I think the core parts of the business, the teams are focused, we're driving margin recovery. And I think it's important to note for most -- for the core businesses, Science, Personal Care, and Coatings, and Specialty Additives; the inflation recovery maintained our margins. Any improvement really came more on the side of the mix impact on those businesses, which is a little bit different from the intermediate side of the equation. I think they're all focused on where we can get share gains, where we can drive growth with our underlying businesses. I mean, the real impact now for us this -- 2022 and into 2023, is getting that pipeline moving. I mean, we're introducing a lot of new products; the revenue of those products really will start kicking in, in 2024, because between introducing it, customers start working then, they like the product, and they really start introducing into new formulations. So, our -- what excites me right now is that that pipeline filling is going very well with a lot of very strong launches. A lot of -- not just a lot of products with higher impact, just it's very, as I said in the -- my comments, the amount of recognitions we're getting, awards is -- that's a leading indicator. Your line is now open. And this is -- we're monitoring that very closely, because there's two dynamics. One, the pressures of working capital for everybody has been a big issue with inflation, so we have a lot of companies looking at what they do. But at the same time, there is still some significant challenges of product availability, and you're seeing it especially, here in Europe, where force majeures, the economics of the situation are bringing down production in certain areas. So, depending on the industry, if I look at pharma, they're much more worried about supply reliability, they're looking to make sure that they're looking at risk management, contingency planning, they want to make sure we have inventory. We have -- the Q1 is probably the one that's going to be a little bit more noisy, and it's more the inventory side of the equation. So, I think this is where the bigger range that we're giving is having an impact. We -- to be very transparent, we were looking at do we give annual guidance or do we give a quarterly guidance, it's a very difficult environment right now to forecast because of all these variables. And we're sold out anyway, so we're going to start -- we'll be producing to rebuild inventories. Your line is now open. No, I think we still see -- if you just go down each of the segments, we still see continued demand. In pharma, I think we're experiencing probably -- the core market is robust, but we're experienced a little bit higher demand because other suppliers are having problems, and we've been very reliable, so I think we've been a go-to supplier by many of our customers. The -- in Personal Care, it's going to vary by player and region. Again, if the -- and the segment continues to behave as it has in the past, this is not something that you don't -- you wake up and start -- stop brushing your teeth in a recession or using shampoo, conditioners, or some of these products, so it should remain resilient. There is clearly a shift from DIY -- from, call it, the DIY normalizing, contractor markets still remaining pretty strong in the U.S. and in parts of Asia, but slowing down a bit in Europe. So, our issue, as I said, we don't have a lot of volume, so it's really going to be more around that pricing mix impact. And I think that the part that we're looking at is energy is still a big issue, especially in Europe. Labor, you're going to see myriad increases across the world, they're going to be higher than last year for most companies, and that'll include us. All that would -- higher inflation, those broad-based inflations I think would push everybody to take action to pass it through the chain. And even, I would say, in our -- from the raw materials perspective, and again it's -- it drives to your question of growth, and although raw materials, many -- the general inflation has receded a little bit, for our segments and all the players, our competitors are here, the energy side is a big impact. So, I would highlight, for us, 50% of our new inflation that we're seeing coming out of caustic and iodine, as an example. It's significant -- caustic, as an example, was a non-issue raw material for us in 2021. So, it's become a major cost item, which for our cellulosics, for us, for our suppliers is a big cost, so we're passing it on. So, it's sort of we're still in a micro -- in some of our product lines in the same world we were last year, but in a more micro dynamic that impacts certain technologies. And I think that's really, for us, what's going to drive that revenue growth potential. So, I think this gives us an opportunity to invest organically to look at M&A, and to reward our shareholders. Your line is now open. As I look back through history, it seems like Q4 is kind of the peak for the year in terms of margin and performance in that segment. I think, Mike, it was mostly around mix and what -- good performance on the cost side in all our plants, and all that. We had a very strong -- last six weeks of the quarter was very favorable mix in terms of the results, and that's what drove most of the performance. And then on the Specialty Additives business, it seems like that maybe is the area where you're seeing the most impact from energy volatility, maybe also the area where you can see the biggest impacts from some destocking. When we talk mix improvement, one of the places we take volume from to move to the high -- is in the Specialty Additives. So, they are more constrained than other because some of the lower-end segments, that's what we take. So, their constraints are a little bit different in the sense it's not just market, it's going to be our own prioritization of segments. Energy is a big issue, and it's there -- there, the landlords of all of our cellulosic plants. So, clearly, that's where we see a lot of the impact of the energy side. And the good news for us is that we're -- most of our plants are Netherlands, Belgium, and France. Your line is now open. I think as we look at what we expect to be our growth rate in fiscal '23 versus '22, it looks like at the midpoint. I think one of our biggest objectives is maybe less about taking cash out of working capital, and more about managing down how much working capital grows, which is going to primarily be a function of inflation. And also, based on how we can improve mix, we want to strategically add some inventory to those higher-margin product lines and SBUs so we can provide the right level of service there, and continue to drive mix improvement. So, as we look at our fiscal '23 plan internally, it -- normalizing free cash flow for fiscal '23 is less about trying to squeeze cash out of working capital, primarily inventory receivables; we want to continue to manage those with a lot of discipline. Given what we expect inflation to be, et cetera, there's likely to be some increase there, but incredibly modest compared to what it was in fiscal '22, again, unless we see a lot of accelerated inflation, which we're not currently planning for. I think, John, the other part that we are fortunate, that we have a strong balance sheet, that we are also looking at when we want to take actions if we want to reduce inventory, not -- I think one of the biggest concerns that we have right now is if everybody reduces inventory and then there is a supply problem in Germany, or any issue, that we go back to 2021, and we start having a lot of issues. So, we think this next quarter is going to be the highest risk one, although everybody is moving on inventory now. I think we'll have a much better view of what's happening in the world in the second quarter, and maybe that's a more appropriate time for us to reassess what we want to do on the working capital side. I think, clearly, everything's stopped. So, I do think it's going to be a period of time of everybody just taking a breath on what they want to do and move. I think part of the challenge that everybody has is, for the assets that we want, they tend to be very specialized, higher-end type application; I think people -- it takes time for people to change what they want to do over time. Some of these smaller, very niche spaces like that are critical for our bolt-ons, I think people will start reconsidering it throughout the year. John, another piece of the equation is I think people are also waiting to see what the interest rate environment kind of settles into. For companies out there with a lot of floating-rate debt, they're probably paying a lot of attention, I mean given that most bank debt trades off of three-month rates, which are up 400 basis points this year, most bond debt trades off 10-year treasuries, which is up 270 basis points this year. Your line is now open. Just thinking about the interplay between your expectations for the year, I mean the range and the mix shift strategy. So, I think it's not just a U.S. dollar based position. I think nutraceuticals, I mean we have sort of stabilized it over the last two years. So, it's not so much about growth that we are going to be looking but really -- revenue growth really driving earnings and profitability improvement. So, it's more that improvement that we are going to be focusing on. So, we are seeing in pharma as an example a very strong demand because others are having much bigger supply problems. So, we do see demand has been strong from customer's period, but our performance has been better than market just because we are in good position to supply. Your line is now open. Yes, I think we focus mainly or necessarily on the three core business: Pharma, Personal Care, and Architectural Coding. I think they are all if you look at historically and again we can just refer back to what's happened in the last recession, they all were very resilient. So, they are on the margin right now, but those are the -- those more -- products going more into that normal industrial area that we see some of the softness. And I just want to reiterate, this has been three years of surprises after surprises, challenges after challenges and they have performed in a big changing environment, external and internal extremely well."
