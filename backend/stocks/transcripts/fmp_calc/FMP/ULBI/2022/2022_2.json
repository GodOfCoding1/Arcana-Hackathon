    "content": " Revenues from our Battery & Energy Products segment were $30.1 million compared to $22.9 million last year, an increase of 31.8% with $6.6 million of the $7.3 million variance attributable to Excell and $0.7 million of net organic growth, comprised of a $2.1 million increase in commercial sales, partially offset by a $1.4 million decrease in government defense sales. The sales split between commercial and government defense for our battery business was 82-18 compared to 70-30 for the 2021 second quarter, and the domestic to international split was 47-53 compared to 52-48 last year, accentuating both the continued success of our global revenue diversification strategy and the delays in U.S. Government defense sales. Revenues from our Communications Systems segment were $2.0 million compared to $3.9 million last year, a decrease of 49%, reflecting shipments delayed to future periods due to increased lead times on components from suppliers and the timing of orders placed by our customers. In the second quarter, despite a 21% decline in sales to the U.S. government defense end market, our commercial end market revenues increases fully offset the government defense decline, leading to 3% of net B&E organic revenue growth. For the U.S. Army's Handheld Manpack, Small Form Fit and Leader Radio programs, after some supply chain delays in the second quarter 2022, we began shipping against the October 2021 announced $4.2 million vehicle amplifier adapters award, and anticipate making the remainder of the shipments throughout the end of this year."
