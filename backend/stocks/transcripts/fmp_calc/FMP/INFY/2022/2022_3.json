    "content": " Q3 was another successive quarter of continued acceleration in revenues at 7% constant currency Q-on-Q growth and 21.5% constant currency year-on-year growth, the highest year-on-year growth in the last 11 years. Driven by robust demand environment and our continued market share gains, we have further increasing our revenue guidance for FY 2022 to 19.5% to 20% in constant currency terms from 16.5% to 17.5% earlier. But how should we think about the core employee cost growth, which comes under the cost of revenue, which has been around 4% over the last -- over Q1 of FY 2021 versus a 6% revenue growth."
