    "content": " So Moshe, so I think as we had given the guidance at the beginning of this year of 22% to 24% and coming on the back of 24.5% last year, I think we were very clear that there would be some headwinds which we had got the one-off benefits during FY \u201821 and we have articulated that clearly in terms of travel facility, some other discretionary costs, the deferred costs like wage hikes promotions, etcetera, which were put on hold. And also, I think now a lot of our conversations is also more navigating towards value and that kind of value we are deriving for our clients, right, whether it\u2019s on the consumer side, on the retention side, it\u2019s in the supply chain logistics and how we positioned ourselves not just about the way the products are priced for us, but more about more innovative ways of pricing, where it\u2019s clearly linked to outcome linked to results of our clients. I think \u2013 the point you make earlier in the press conference, the question was on how we\u2019ve seen the pricing in Q1 from what we see in terms of large deals and past interactions, your point here in terms of what is the opportunity to see some pricing power and also building on the previous question, I think as Nilanjan was sharing with you, we believe we have an extremely differentiated digital portfolio. Hi, thanks for the opportunity. Hi, thanks for the opportunity."
