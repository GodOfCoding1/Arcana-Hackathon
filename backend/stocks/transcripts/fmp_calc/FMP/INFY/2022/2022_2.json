    "content": " With the strong start to the financial year, good deal momentum in Q2, robust pipeline, we are increasing our annual revenue growth guidance which was at 14% to 16% previously, now we're moving to 16.5% to 17.5% growth in constant currency. Share of digital to overall revenues, increased to 56.1% in quarter two, with continued strong growth of 42.4% year-on-year in constant currency terms. So I think as we've talked about, we've done this compensation hike in Q2 and we will continue doing what is necessary, and in fact, Pravin also mentioned in Q3, we have also rolled out skill-based plans, also, cost of hiring is going up so we will see some headwinds along with the seasonal headwinds of, far lows and working days in the future -- near future. It's too early to comment\n But if whatever we're seeing and hearing that this demand continues for the next several quarters then you could potentially see, given the shortage of talent the you will probably see a higher number of such a recruitment globally. This is Pravin, I think it's -- I mean we're the attainment that attrition will stabilize primarily because of infrastructure of  the demand will continue we're not seeing at least in, in yet to take demand coming down by all account."
