    "content": " What we have seen today in addition to what we said last quarter, for example, in financial services beyond mortgages, we see the investment banking side of our clients as well showing an impact of the economic environment and they are in telco, high-tech and retail in some clients. We see good traction on large deals and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen more in the sort of relevance connect with our clients on the cost efficiency and automation gains and in the areas, in the industries where there is economic support a good traction of Cobalt and the digital transformation phase. There \u00e2\u0080\u0093 in many places, we see essentially clients looking to use the cost efficiency to fund the transformation because in many cases, they still need to drive digital or cloud transformation to keep their market growth, so that clients connect, customer connect are going. I think the large deal momentum for us is really a function of what we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve put in place, we still within this mix of $3.3 billion have digital transformation deal, and we have cost efficiency automation deals. So, thanks for the question. So, thanks for the question."
