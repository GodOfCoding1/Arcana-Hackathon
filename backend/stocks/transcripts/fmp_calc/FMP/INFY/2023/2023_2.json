    "content": " Our H1 performance of 20% growth in constant currency and robust large deal signings in Q2 give us the confidence to change our revenue growth guidance, which was at 14% to 16% earlier to 15% to 16%, even as we are seeing emerging concerns that we talked about earlier. The conversations with clients, we've seen for this quarter, our digital business has grown over 30% and our cost services has also grown. And we are also seeing, because of the growth of core that I shared earlier, that we have both sides growing, of course digital growing over 30%, but we also see now the cost programs, which core reflects in part also growing. We don't give more color for future growth firstly by quarter or by segment, but overall, I go back to what we shared earlier that the macro environment has some areas, which we are looking at with more caution, our overall demand, the deal -- large deal pipeline is strong and both sides of our engine, both engines are doing well, digital and core and automation. So the ask rate to achieve the guidance is 0% to 1.2% in the next few quarters, which look softer despite a strong derivatives, also we are talking about more cost optimization deal coming along with the digital deals. We see some impact of furloughs, like I said, we have some of the attrition impact will come, but those are more longer-term impact, some of that will be in subcon et cetera and also of course that the seasonality of the volumes across the levers in that sense, you don't have growth as a lever really in terms of operating leverage and the question came through dramatically change the margin profile."
