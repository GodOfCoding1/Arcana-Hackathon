    "content": " First quarter rail segment revenue decreased $2.5 million year-over-year, largely driven by lower volumes and timing of orders in the Rail products business unit. Despite the lower sales, gross margins, increased 30 basis points year-over-year, due to higher volume in more profitable Friction Management and Technology Services and Solutions businesses, as well as improved margins and Rail products. While volumes were improved in parts of this segment year-over-year, gross profit margins declined 690 basis points due to higher steel, labor, and project cost for the bridge products business and unfavorable manufacturing absorption in the protective coatings business."
