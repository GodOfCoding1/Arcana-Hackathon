    "content": " Before we begin, I advise you that we will be making forward-looking statements today based on our current expectations and beliefs, including, but not limited to, potential market sizes and market share, ACIP recommendation impact, market trends, growth perspective and rates, manufacturing plans, seasonality, financial guidance and trends, including revenue, profitability and efficiency of current capitalization timing and results of clinical trial starts and data readouts and potential future uses of CpG 1018 adjuvant. Based on our initial data, we plan to advance our shingles vaccine candidate with CpG 1018 adjuvant into a Phase 1/2 study in early 2024 to evaluate various dose levels of the gE antigen and further evaluate immune responses over a longer period of time. Total revenue for 2022 was $723 million compared to $439 million for 2021, representing an annual increase of about 64%, which was driven both by HEPLISAV-B as well as CpG 1018 adjuvant sales as we successfully executed all five of our COVID-19 pandemic commercial supply agreements. Revenue recognized under our commercial supply agreements for COVID-19 vaccines totaled $588 million, gross margin of 62% for 2022, achieving the high end of our previously stated guidance range for both revenue and gross margin. The increase was primarily driven by continued advancement in our pipeline programs, Tdap and shingles through the completion of Phase 1 clinical trials, also successful top line data plus the continued advancement of our fully funded Phase 2 contract with the DoD for adjuvant plague vaccine."
