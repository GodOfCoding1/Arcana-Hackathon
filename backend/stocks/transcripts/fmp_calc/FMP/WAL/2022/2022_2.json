    "content": " Balance sheet expansion continued with quarterly organic growth of $5.3 billion or 52% year-over-year, excluding the $1.9 billion of loans transferred from held for sale to held for investment which was done to avoid income volatility from rising rate bonds. Loan growth was broadly diversified this quarter with regional banking divisions contributing 16% of organic growth or $863 million, our specialized national business lines, adding 55% or almost $3 billion and residential loans composing 28% or $1.5 billion, excluding the held-for-sale transits. Strong balance sheet momentum continued during the quarter as loans held for sale -- loan held for investment increased $5.3 billion, net of the HFS HFI loan transfer or 13% to $48.4 billion and deposit growth of $1.6 billion from balances back to $53.7 billion at quarter end. Total borrowings increased $4.4 billion over the prior quarter to $6.1 billion, primarily due to an increase in short-term borrowings of $3.9 billion and issuance of $494 million in credit linked notes, providing first loss credit protection on a pool of $2.2 billion in capital call loans and $3.9 billion in residential loans."
