    "content": " As a result, our largest business, MCM, increased U.S. portfolio purchasing in 2022 by 36%, which helped increase Encore\u00e2\u0080\u0099s global portfolio purchasing by 20% for the year. Against this backdrop of growing market supply in the U.S., we expect MCM\u00e2\u0080\u0099s portfolio purchases in Q1, 2023 to be at least $200 million at attractive returns, more than double Q1, 2022 purchases. Portfolio purchasing accelerated in the second half of the year, especially in the U.S., as we entered a new phase of the credit cycle that favors purchasing, which for Encore grew 20% to $801 million. Breaking that result down into our two major businesses, MCM\u00e2\u0080\u0099s collections in the U.S. in 2022 declined 17% compared to the prior year, primarily due to lower portfolio purchasing in recent years and the normalization of consumer behavior in the U.S. Cabot\u00e2\u0080\u0099s collections in 2022 declined 14% as reported, primarily due to the foreign currency effect of the weakening of the British pound and euro. In the U.S., revenues in 2022 were lower by 11% to $1 billion, while revenues in Europe were lower by 17% as reported, but were down only 9% for the year in constant currency."
