    "content": " Consistent with this strategy, as we continue to deliver strong returns and solid cash flows, we repurchased $26 million of Encore shares in the first quarter. In the first quarter, Cabot collections were $148 million, down 9% compared to Q1 of last year, primarily due to lower portfolio purchasing in recent quarters. At the end of the first quarter, our leverage ratio was 1.9 times compared to 2.1 times a year ago, and near the lowest in the industry even after the repurchase of $415 million of our shares over the past five quarters. As previously mentioned, persistent stronger than expected U.S. collections in Q1 as well as in recent quarters, led to the addition of $225 million of ERC."
