    "content": " However, and importantly, Q3 was our strongest quarter of portfolio purchasing in 2.5 years, driven by the steady growth in supply that we now see, particularly in the U.S. On a global basis, our portfolio purchases were $233 million, up 38% compared to the third quarter last year, enabled by improving market supply in the U.S. Before we discuss the key markets in which we operate, I believe it's helpful to reiterate the critical role we play in the consumer credit ecosystem by assisting in the resolution of unpaid debts, which are an expected outcome of the lending business model. Breaking that result down into our 2 major businesses, MCM's collections in the U.S. declined 20% compared to Q3 last year, primarily due to lower portfolio purchasing in recent quarters and the normalization of consumer behavior in the U.S. Cabot's collections in the third quarter declined 15% as reported due to the foreign currency effect of the weakening British pound and euro."
