    "content": " Turning now to our largest and most valuable market in the U.S. MCM collections in the second quarter were $355 million, down 19% compared to Q2 last year. MCM portfolio purchases in the second quarter were $116 million, an increase of 30% when compared to $90 million in the same quarter last year, and were the result of increased supply in the U.S. market. In the second quarter, Cabot collections were $142 million, down 16% compared to Q2 of last year, primarily due to the impact of foreign currency exchange and lower portfolio purchasing in recent quarters. When comparing the second quarter of this year to the second quarter a year ago, keep in mind that the elevated level of collections in Q2 of 2021 was extraordinary and resulted in part from the U.S. consumer behavior that has largely normalized since the beginning of 2022. Collections were $498 million in Q2, down 19% compared to the extraordinary collections in the second quarter of last year but were higher than we expected. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open."
