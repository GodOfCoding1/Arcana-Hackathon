    "content": " In Q1, consolidated revenue increased 10% to $526 million and adjusted EBITDA increased 15% to $88 million, again, driven by higher demand for our products and improved pricing and volume led by our Water Direct and Exchange business. For full year 2022, we continue to forecast revenue growth of 9% to 10%, adjusting for the exit of the North America single-use retail bottled water business and including the revenue from the tuck-in acquisitions made during 2021, as we continue to see the improving demand in both the residential and B2B sectors as consumers and workers are increasing their mobility."
