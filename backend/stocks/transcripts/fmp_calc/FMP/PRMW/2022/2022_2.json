    "content": " In the second quarter, consolidated revenue increased 9% to $571 million, driven by strong consumer demand, price increases, particularly in our North America water direct business, increased dispenser revenue strategic initiatives with retailers, robust growth of Mountain Valley and continued improvements in the customer experience. Excluding the impact of the exit of our single-use bottle water retail business in North America and foreign exchange, revenue increased by 16%, these gains were largely driven by growth in our Water Direct and Exchange businesses through increased demand in both the residential and B2B channels, pricing and the continued return to work across our footprint."
