    "content": " I'm pleased to report that we generated $96.6 million of adjusted EBITDA in the first quarter, a 53% year-over-year increase and a 28% increase when compared to the same quarter in 2019. Since its successful refresh, the Comfort brand has registered 9 consecutive quarters of unit growth year-over-year and has continued to generate RevPAR index gains versus its local competitors, demonstrating the attractiveness of this iconic brand to hotel developers and guests alike. Our Quality Inn brand, with over 1,600 hotels opened in the United States, continues to be a leader in the mid-scale segment with strong developer demand and an 8.4% increase in RevPAR, outperforming the segment during the first quarter versus the same period of 2019. Specifically, in the first quarter, we awarded 29 extended-stay domestic franchise agreements, a threefold increase year-over-year and a twofold increase compared to 2019 levels. WoodSpring Suites pipeline reached nearly 190 domestic properties as of the end of March, a 26% increase year-over-year with over 30 construction projects started, and we expect the brand's ground breaks this year to exceed 2021 levels. In addition, consumer confidence in our upscale products continues to drive the brand's RevPAR index gains versus their local competitors and underlines the attractiveness of Choice Hotels' value proposition in the upscale segment for current and prospective owners. Specifically, our Econo Lodge brand experienced an increase in domestic franchise agreements awarded in the first quarter of 2022 compared with 2021 and 2019, contributing to the brand's 14% year-over-year domestic pipeline expansion as of the end of March. Thanks to our enhancements in our distribution capabilities, we drove growth as compared to 2021 and 2019 through increased revenue contribution in the first quarter of 2022 from choicehotels.com. Through our investments in these strategic segments, we have materially outperformed the industry in RevPAR growth and continue to gain share versus our local competitors across all segments in which we compete in the first quarter versus the same period of 2019. For first quarter, we increased RevPAR index versus our local competitors by over 3 percentage points as compared to the same period of 2019, reflecting continued growth in both weekday and weekend RevPAR index. With hotel owners continuing to seek Choice Hotels' proven capabilities to consistently deliver strong top line revenues that maximize return on investment while reducing total cost of ownership, we expect our effective royalty rate to grow approximately 5 basis points for full year 2022 year-over-year. For the first quarter, our revenue-intense brands grew by nearly 1% year-over-year, excluding last year's departures of 17 AMResorts from our Ascend Collection and the exit from our portfolio of just over 40 underperforming assets that we discussed last quarter. For the first quarter, we awarded over 90 domestic franchise agreements, a 39% increase year-over-year, excluding last year's Penn National Gaming multiunit transaction."
