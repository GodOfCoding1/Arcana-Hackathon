And embedded within that, of course, is this $7,500 credit, vehicle credit for EV purchases to American consumers, which is premised on onshoring initiatives, whether it be free trade partners, in some instances or implementing facilities here in North America that's providing a lot of incentives to not just build the battery in the cell plants but a partner with companies like Electra to help make that onshoring a reality."
