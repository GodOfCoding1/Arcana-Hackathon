    "content": " Of note, during the period, we ramped our user experience portfolio across leading North American automotive OEMs exceeded 200 million unit cumulative shipments, closed a convertible debt offering of $160 million in support of our acquisition plans, launched a Board authorized $50 million share and warrant repurchase program. Revenue for the period was up 74% year-over-year and up 10% sequentially to $33 million, gross profit was $17.2 million translating into a 52.2% gross margin, up 590 basis points year-over-year and 180 basis points sequentially, better than our 51% guidance. R&D was $24.9 million in support of accelerated product development with SG&A of $7.4 million, reflecting continued investments to extend indie's sales reach, plus the implementation of a highly scalable ERP system. For the first quarter, we plan to scale to $160 million annualized revenue run rate, including the stub portion of GEO revenue with non-GAAP gross margin in the 52% range. Further, and perhaps most importantly, we believe the combination of indie's steeper growth trajectory, sustain gross margin expansion, particularly post-GEO synergies and planned operating expense leverage will enable us to reach profitability in the back half of this year, representing another key milestone towards realizing our 60% gross and 30% operating margin target model."
