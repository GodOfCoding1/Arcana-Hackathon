    "content": " Indie\u2019s performance is a testament to the resiliency of our team, our differentiated product portfolio, our underlying intellectual property and our key industry partnerships Specifically, during the first quarter, we once again outpaced our addressable markets and grew revenue to a record $22 million, approximately the same level of revenue that we delivered in the entire 2020 calendar year. Specifically, for the second quarter of 2022, we anticipate revenue growth on the order of 172% to 183% year-over-year and in the range of $25 million to $26 million, putting indie on pace for another record quarter. Further, we expect gross margin expansion to the 48% range with $30 million in operating expenses, comprising $23 million in R&D and $7 million in SG&A as we increase our product development investments in response to pent-up customer demand, particularly in radar and extend our sales and marketing capabilities globally. Given our visibility, scalability and planned operating leverage as revenue growth far outpaces OpEx, we are well on our way to reaching profitability in the back half of next year, representing a key next step on our path to realizing indie's long-term targets of 60% gross and 30% operating margins by 2025."
