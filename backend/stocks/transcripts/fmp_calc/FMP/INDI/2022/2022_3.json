    "content": " Specifically, during the third quarter, we significantly outpaced our addressable markets and grew revenue 147% year-over-year and 17% sequentially to just over $30 million, while expanding gross margin beyond the 50% mark for the first time. According to Cox Automotive, EV sales grew 67% in the third quarter of 2022, while overall US auto sales were down around 1% for the same period, while penetration of EVs has increased considerably to 6% of US new vehicle sales, up nearly three times in the last two years. The US has a long road ahead to reach a similar mix of EV sales as Europe or China, let alone the Biden administration's target of 50% of new vehicle sales by 2030. indie is well positioned to benefit from the electrification megatrend and capture significant share due to our strong relationships with an increasing number of leading EV OEMs."
