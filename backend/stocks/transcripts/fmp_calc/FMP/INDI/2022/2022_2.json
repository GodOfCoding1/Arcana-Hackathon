    "content": " Specifically, during the second quarter, we once again substantially outpaced our addressable markets, and grew revenue 181% year-over-year and 17% sequentially to a record $25.8 million, while expanding gross margin to be nearly 49%. This encouragement formed the rationale for our recent acquisitions of ON Semi's radar design team, and Analog Devices Symeo division, bringing together field-proven radar solutions over 250 man years of cumulative development, 205 related patents and applications as well as world-class mixed-signal SoC capabilities, ultimately enabling indie to capture our largest strategic program whenever. Given the massive sales channels we've opened for indie's current and future product offerings, we look forward to sharing our annual strategic backlog update next quarter and providing similar updates on new customer wins and product launches going forward. More importantly, given the depth of our design win pipeline, demonstrated scalability and planned operating leverage as our revenue growth and gross margin expansion far outpace our cost structure, we are on track to reach profitability in the second half of next year, marking another key step towards achieving our target model of 60% gross and 30% operating margins by 2025. Indeed, the next generation of automobiles are showcasing technologies focused on enhanced safety capabilities, better in-cabin features as well as more environmentally friendly powertrains with extended range, our differentiated portfolio of semiconductor and software solutions are positioning indie to gain a disproportionate share of what is fast becoming close to a $50 billion serviceable market opportunity for indie."
