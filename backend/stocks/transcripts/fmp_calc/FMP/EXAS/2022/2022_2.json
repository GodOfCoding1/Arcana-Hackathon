    "content": " The highlights from the quarter include being a Great Place to Work certified for the fourth consecutive year, screening more than 700,000 people for colon cancer with Cologuard, securing an improved position in ASCO guidelines for Oncotype DX Breast as the preferred test for early-stage breast cancer patients, improving our path to profitability and cash liquidity position. All of those things are temporary in nature and the need for colon cancer screening is persistent, and we're seeing a fundamental shift that is that Cologuard is becoming more commonly accepted within large health systems, among primary care physicians, importantly, among patients as a great way to get screened. In terms of MRD, we are \u00e2\u0080\u0093 have a couple \u00e2\u0080\u0093 we have access to a couple of important sample sets that will allow us to seek an LVT status and then work towards getting inclusion as one of the reimbursed tests we see this space is developing very nicely, it's setting us up for a product launch in MRD, not this year on a reimbursed basis, most likely next year. Everett and the team are keen really creative and finding ways around that and making sure that we are a good partner to health systems and other providers, and that's what's helped us deliver upon that growth, including 22% growth in the second half of the year. We're unlikely to see any impact, because tests that aren't reimbursed, that aren't in guidelines that don't count towards a quality measure credit, just don't -- it's challenging to conceive of a way that there would be significant uptake there that could impact that we screened over 700,000 people in the quarter."
