    "content": " We expanded our footprint in Q1 2022 by acquiring the assets of Rincon Water Company with the service area in Pinal County, Arizona; and Twin Hawks Utility with the service area in Pima County, Arizona. On April 18, 2022, we announced that we signed a definitive agreement to acquire Farmers Water Co., a water utility with service area located in Pima County, Arizona, subject to customary closing conditions and Arizona Corporation Commission approval. This increase was primarily driven by organic growth, combined with new connections associated with the acquisition of Las Quintas Serenas in Q4 of 2021, which together reflect a 9.7% increase in active service connections year-over-year."
