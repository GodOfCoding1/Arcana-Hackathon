    "content": " Subsequent to the quarter, our company completed a public offering of common stock totaling gross proceeds of $15.5 million and an increase to our unused revolving line of credit from $10 million to $15 million, ensuring we have the capital necessary to fund acquisitions, infrastructure investments and for general corporate purposes. Total revenue for the second quarter of 2022 was $11.7 million, which was up $763,000 or 7% compared to Q2 of 2021. Total revenue for the first half of 2022 increased $1.5 million or 7.6% to $21.7 million, which again was primarily driven by the increase in active service connections. Increased G&A expense by $0.2 million, primarily due to increased personnel costs, increased professional fees as well as increased regulatory expense associated with a onetime noncash write-off as a result of our recent rate case. Net income for the first half of 2022 totaled $3 million or $0.13 per share, an increase of $1.2 million or 69.7% compared to the same period a year ago. Adjusted EBITDA was $6.1 million in Q2 of 2022, an increase of $761,000 or 14.3% compared to Q2 of 2021. During the first half of 2022, adjusted EBITDA was $11.2 million, an increase of $2.4 million or 26.7% compared to the first half of 2021. When combining our unused $15 million line of credit with our June 30 cash on hand of $5 million, in addition to the $15 million in equity we raised earlier this month, we have approximately $35 million of liquidity to support ongoing operations and our growth strategy."
