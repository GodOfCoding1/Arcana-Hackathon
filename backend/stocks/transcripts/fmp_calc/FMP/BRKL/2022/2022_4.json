    "content": " Earnings for the quarter were $29.7 million or $0.39 per share as our loan portfolio grew $223 million, while also recognizing loan participation income of $2.6 million. And then maybe just in terms of, just curious on your -- on just the Brookline side of the house, your CD bucket, you have about $900 million or so in CDs for the quarter, with an average cost of 123. So once it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fully phased in, call it, $6.5 million or low $6 million a quarter, assuming that 30% cost saves is still about right, does that gel with where you guys are? And I think on that slide, we give you a good sense of what the loan originations were in the quarter and say, hey, this is what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the percentage of them that are re-priced immediately or within three months, what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s more of a fixed rate and what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s more of a floating rate that re-prices maybe in three years or five years, and then, of course, what the whole portfolio looks like and the duration of that portfolio just so you have a sense of where our risks might be."
