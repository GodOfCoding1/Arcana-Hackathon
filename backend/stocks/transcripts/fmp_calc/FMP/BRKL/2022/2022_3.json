    "content": " I'm pleased to report we had near record earnings of $30.1 million or $0.39 per share and that the Board has approved a 4% increase to our quarterly dividend, bringing it to $0.135 per share. Our loan portfolio grew $129 million or 7% annualized and our net interest margin for the third quarter was 3.80%, an increase of 24 basis points from Q2. Net income this quarter was up $4.9 million from Q2, driven by margin expansion, solid loan growth, as well as the year-to-date impact of energy tax credits of $2.4 million related to financing renewable energy investments. The allowance for loan -- loans and leases increased $1 million, helped by net recoveries of $179,000 and the reserve for unfunded credits increased $2 million. During the third quarter, deposits declined $158 million with liquidity in CDs and other interest-bearing accounts flowing to higher-yielding opportunities. As Paul mentioned, the Board approved a quarterly dividend of $0.135 per share, representing a 4% increase and a 4.2% yield based on yesterday's closing price."
