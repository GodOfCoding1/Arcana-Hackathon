And so that's... \n We like to have at least $100 million a quarter of gain and this quarter we just came up slightly short, it's probably one company sale fit in there. I mean is there a lot of movement going towards -- off-balance sheet into money market funds and have you seen that continue or... \n Well, I think, if you really had the raw data, you would find that it's really pretty lumpy particularly so far this year with rising interest rates. I know you had at announcement and it seems like ages ago, you had a $19 million interest rate mark on loans, which I think was current as of March 31 and then the interest rate mark on securities was through late May of $50 million and then you also have the markup on deposits which was as merged. We certainly haven't seen very many banks step in just because of the pain of interest rate marks, but can you share with us your thoughts how you're thinking obviously, you're going to be just across $10 billion."
