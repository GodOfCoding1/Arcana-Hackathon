    "content": " I'm pleased to report we had another quarter of solid earnings of $24.7 million or $0.32 per share and as well, we did an increase in our quarterly dividend of 4% to bring it to $0.13 per share. The loan portfolio overall increased $69 million from the prior quarter, driven by a growth in our core portfolio of $122 million, offset by PPP loan satisfactions. In the first quarter, we originated $550 million in loans at a weighted average coupon of 399 basis points. Prepayment fees were $1.5 million in Q1, which was down $210,000 from Q4 and deferred fees were $1.4 million or $342,000 less than Q4, resulting in net positive impact on net interest income of $132,000 in the quarter. After accounting for earnings and dividends, shareholders' equity declined $13 million and tangible book value declined a net $0.17 in the quarter. It's hard for me to give you a really good estimation from a quarter-to-quarter -- it is an activity we are -- it is growing within our loan departments and our clients, but it is something that from a quarter-to-quarter basis, I really won't... Well, it looks to me like it's working pretty well."
