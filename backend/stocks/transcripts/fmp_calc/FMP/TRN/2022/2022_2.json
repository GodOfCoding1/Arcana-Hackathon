    "content": " This quarter, 41% of our deliveries went into our lease fleet and this shift in the deliveries toward lease fleet additions is largely the result of more deliveries to industrial shippers, who typically make the decision to lease railcars. Also I mentioned, the car sales that we did in the quarter, the $140 million in car sales, a lot of that cash at the end of the quarter is tied up in our restricted cash, to see increase in restricted cash that's because those sales came out of securitizations, so that as we add cars of fleet."
