    "content": " In addition to the 15,000 railcar multi-year order with GATX, we received orders for an additional 4,500 railcars in the third quarter, demonstrating the continued momentum of the market. Looking at Rail Products, our revenue of $597 million was up 39% sequentially and 76% year-over-year driven by a large increase in deliveries in the quarter as well as better pricing dynamics. In addition to the Wafra car sale, we sold additional leased railcars in the quarter for total proceeds of $300 million and a gain of $34 million. Year-to-date our net lease fleet investment is $176 million and includes $532 million of fleet additions both through internal deliveries and secondary market additions and $159 million of fleet modifications and conversions, offset by $515 million in railcar sales. And with the railcars that we've delivered and with our -- along with our three-year outlook on net fleet investment, we just think it's a good time to execute on that and increase car sales as a result."
