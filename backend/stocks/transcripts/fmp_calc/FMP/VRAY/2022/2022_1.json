    "content": " Your line is open. Your line is open. We are in a very strong position in 2023 as well and growth just drives the P&L in this business so attractively for gross margin expansion, for operating leverage, and ultimately, gets us to cash flow breakeven in the out years, and we feel as though we are in a really good position there. And like we said in our prepared remarks, the doubling and quadrupling of patients over the next two years to three years, we have really good line of sight to that and we think we are in a very, very good position to drive shareholder value creation and treat patients with the therapy that they deserve and desire. Your line is open. Your line is open. It was conversations about technology as opposed to clinical outcomes, and we declared, as you are aware, three and a half years ago that we would lead and differentiate with clinical data and that is very much taking hold and we are augmenting that now with driving patient awareness because as we have talked with you on many occasions, patients will write the ViewRay story. Your line is open."
