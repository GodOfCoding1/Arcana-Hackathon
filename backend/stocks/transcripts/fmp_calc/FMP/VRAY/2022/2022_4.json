    "content": " Revenue in the fourth quarter grew 70% compared to the same period in the prior year to nearly $34.7 million, highlighted by 85% growth in product revenue, which was driven by five revenue units, an increase of two units compared to the prior year. Revenue in fiscal '22 grew 46% compared to the same period in the prior year to approximately $102.2 million, including 53% growth in product revenue primarily driven by an increase of six revenue units to 16 units in fiscal '22. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. So I think that's a combination of driving that top-line revenue growth like I mentioned, but also being frugal around expenses, too, and taking a second look at what we're spending and what we're getting out of that spending. Your line is now open."
