Maybe, another bigger picture one, but looking ahead to 2023, I know we don't have guidance here, but Scott just wanted to maybe take your temperature, the streets modeling 40% revenue growth on top of what you're doing here in 2022. Your line is now open. The best way that I think I can describe the conversations that we're having today and ASTRO is just exemplary is to contrast it in terms of where we were two or three years ago, when the conversation centered around technology, which is really emblematic of where this industry has historically been. I think, we are making a significant impact in that, and the conversations that we're having with customers today in stark contrast are all about clinical data, and how they can really get a MRIdian program off the ground if they're a new customer. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. And that top-line revenue growth and gross margin expansion coupled with really tight OpEx discipline is what allows this business to flip, to cash flow positivity in the '25, '26 timeframe. Your line is now open. And as Zach said, we're really excited to put some of our key opinion leaders in front of you to give investors the opportunity to ask questions about the kind of wonder of MRIdian the clinical data that's being generated in the toughest to treat cancers and more common cancers alike."
