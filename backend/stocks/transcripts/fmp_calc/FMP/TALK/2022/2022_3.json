    "content": " Specifically, you see that B2B revenue in Q3 was up over 65% year-on-year on a comparable basis, excluding prior period adjustments in the third quarter of 2021 and a 15% quarter-on-quarter growth, driven by a meaningful increase in the number of sessions and active users. B2B revenue was $16.8 million, up 15% sequentially, driven primarily by a higher number of sessions completed by behavioral health and EAP members, as well as progress in our DTE business, including new accounts and improved terms on renewing accounts. So you'll -- but we're making, I would say, in the last several quarters, we've made a lot of changes to the platform and the product and investment that have really started to pay dividends on the network side for us. But it's interesting that's actually, we think, creating a longer-term opportunity for our product set because we've got a very efficient product that I mentioned that we've been rolling out that really optimizes the existing behavioral health care spend between EAP, insurance and our added benefits that we're finding a lot of traction with both HR executives and CFOs as we go to market."
