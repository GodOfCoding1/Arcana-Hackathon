    "content": " As I noted last quarter, we continue to experience sustained momentum in our B2B business, which was up 47% year-on-year reflecting a meaningful increase in the number of sessions, active members, number of accounts and employees served in our DTE business. As a result, the total number of active members on Talkspace platform increased by 7% in the second quarter from the first as growth in B2B users outpaced B2C member declines. Consistent with prior quarters, I'll speak to sequential trends as we believe this view provides useful context, given the meaningful operational initiatives we implemented since November and the ongoing revenue mix shift driven by strong momentum in our B2B business. And what we also mentioned is because of that unified funnel change we made late in the first quarter, we're now driving through our B2C site a significant increase in B2B customers who are able to come into the website now and seamlessly find whether or not they have coverage through one of our payer partners or EAP plans and then to stay within the site and literally sign on as a B2B member. And the course in front of us, which Jennifer and I feel quite strongly that, we've made a lot of progress in the last several quarters is to improve, the revenue with the B2B business optimize our B2C and really begin to focus on reducing our cash burn and moving this company towards cash flow breakeven."
