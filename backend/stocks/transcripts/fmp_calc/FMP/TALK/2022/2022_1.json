    "content": " And finally, as we continue to focus on optimizing cash flow across the business, as I mentioned on our last call, we believe we have ample cash resources to enhance and expand our capabilities in ways that both deliver operating leverage over time, as well as value to our shareholders, but basic operating progress, like introducing KPIs, scorecards, real-time reporting have been both adopted and embraced throughout the broader organization and has allowed us to make timelier, data driven adjustments to our business plan. First quarter B2C revenue was $17.3 million, up 5% from the fourth quarter with three percentage points of growth related to a $500,000 one-time non-cash reversal in deferred revenue associated with customers no longer active on the platform. Our first quarter gross profit declined 6% sequentially to $15 million, with a gross margin of 49.8%, down compared to Q4 primarily due higher clinician costs and a revenue mix shift within the B2B business. Looking forward, without having specific numbers for you, I think we see opportunities to drive more optimal margin, that's specifically in our largest opportunity is with regard to our W2 salaried network where we have really just begun early in the second quarter, to implement initiative to drive better productivity, with regard to that, the work that they do."
