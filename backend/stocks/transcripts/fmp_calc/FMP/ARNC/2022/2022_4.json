    "content": " We had a net loss in the fourth quarter of $273 million, and this included a $304 million loss related to the sale of our company's Russian operations. For the full-year of 2022, adjusted EBITDA, excluding Russian operations, was $635 million and was up 2% year-over-year. Revenue in the fourth quarter declined $196 million year-over-year, primarily due to the impact of the Russian divestiture, lower volume and mix and lower aluminum prices, partially offset by higher price realizations. Adjusted EBITDA in the quarter was $154 million or $145 million, excluding Russian operations, and down 5% year-over-year on a comparable basis. Revenue in the fourth quarter was approximately $1.5 billion, down 2% organically year-over-year. Adjusted EBITDA in the quarter was $120 million, down $42 million or 26% year-over-year. Revenue in our Building & Construction segment in the fourth quarter was $304 million, up $43 million year-over-year and up 18% organically. Adjusted EBITDA was $49 million, up $16 million or 48% year-over-year as better price realizations continue to more than offset inflation and higher aluminum costs. Revenue in our Extrusion segment for the fourth quarter was $109 million, up 31% organically year-over-year. Inside of that, our expected sales on fully electric and hybrid vehicles will grow globally to an estimated $400 million, up 50% year-on-year, following 75% growth in these applications in 2022. Your line is open. Your line is open. So if we look at the pro forma EBITDA result for this year at $635 million, and then you outlined last quarter, it's about a $100 million kind of outage related issues. Your line is open. Your line is open."
