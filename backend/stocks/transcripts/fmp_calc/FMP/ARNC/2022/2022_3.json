    "content": " Altogether, we estimate the challenges that Davenport and Tennessee reduced our estimated adjusted EBITDA outlook by approximately $70 million for the full year 2022 compared to our expectations coming out of the first quarter. Revenue in the third quarter increased $390 million year-over-year, primarily due to the impact of higher loan on prices as well as realization of pricing actions and improved volume and mix. Adjusted EBITDA in the quarter was $143 million, down $28 million or 16% year-over-year due to the impacts of the operational challenges on volume and fixed cost absorption and the European energy impacts to volume and costs. Our savings net of inflation was a negative $187 million as it was impacted by the operational issues and European energy inflation and includes approximately $128 million of inflation in the quarter primarily from energy, transportation and alloying materials.
