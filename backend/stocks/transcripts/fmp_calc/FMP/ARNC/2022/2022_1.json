    "content": " Free cash flow for the quarter was a use of $198 million, impacted by high aluminum prices, the working capital ramp related to our packaging restart in Tennessee and our expansion project in Davenport. Revenue in the first quarter increased $516 million year-over-year, primarily due to the impact of higher aluminum prices as well as the realization of pricing actions and improved volume and mix. Adjusted EBITDA in the quarter was $205 million, up $26 million or 15% year-over-year, primarily due to improving price, volume and mix, partially offset by inflation. The unfavorable aluminum price impact of $16 million in the quarter is related to the impact of rapidly rising aluminum in the Building and Construction Systems segment, which as you\u2019ll see on the next slide, is more than offset by pricing actions in the quarter. Revenue in the first quarter was approximately $1.8 billion, up 7% organically year-over-year driven by growth in every market except ground transportation, which continues to be impacted by supply chain issues related to chip availability. Adjusted EBITDA in the quarter was $176 million, up $11 million or 7% year-over-year, reflecting stronger price, volumes and mix, which were partially offset by inflation. Revenue in our Building and Construction Systems segment in the first quarter was $291 million, up $55 million year-over-year and up 21% organically. Adjusted EBITDA was $44 million, up $16 million or 57% year-over-year, driven by increases in price, mix and volume, which offset the inflation and higher aluminum costs we are experiencing. Revenue in our Extrusion segment for the first quarter was $97 million, up 21% organically year-over-year and adjusted EBITDA was a loss of $5 million versus a loss of $4 million last year as pricing actions and volume growth were offset by inflation in the quarter."
