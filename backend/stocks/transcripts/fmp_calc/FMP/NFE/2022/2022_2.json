    "content": " We are affirming guidance for the remainder of the year that we expect 2022 to generate approximately $1 billion in EBITDA, and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re actually providing guidance for 2023 of guidance of $1.5 billion, which we think has a substantial amounts of upside depending on the timing and nature of the FLNG installation. The results this quarter really solidify our run rate adjusted EBITDA that exceeds $1 billion on its way to north of $1.5 billion for 2023, even before accounting for FLNG cash flows, which depending on pricing and timing could be an additional $1 billion next year alone. And now with this Pemex this is the first of what we think, could be a number of meaningful transactions in the long-term for us to then look to obtain our own molecules to really complete that integration because I tell our guys all the time here, the business that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re in is that we buy gas in our portfolio."
