    "content": " 52 TBtus equals about 1 million tons of gas, so about 1.5 million tons last year, closing on 2 million tons this year and then 161s TBtus, we are actually making a big upward adjustment next year, but then follow over to the right and you can see what our expectations are for the rest of our FLNG volumes in 2024, 2025 and you can see a fairly profound shift to the right in terms of volume. On the left side of the page, we have actually been doing a ton of detailed modeling about 2023 gas balances in Europe and for those of you who follow this, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s -- it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a highly variable problem, but we like to go back to kind of one simple metric, which is in 2021, there was 122 MTPA of Russian gas supply through pipelines, in 2022, there was 67 MTPA and in 2023, we expect to be zero. But what we are also seeing, actually, especially in recent months, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a lot of related opportunities in kind of secondary and tertiary areas like transportation, hydrogen storage and renewable power, and we continue to look at a number of opportunities in those areas from a strategic perspective. As we think about the gating factor in terms of how big your FLNG solution can be, is the right way to think about it that eventually, we are going to hit a point where we are servicing our projects in the Caribbean, our projects in Brazil and elsewhere, i.e., is that kind of we are building these units with an eye on meeting our demand for these projects as we see them in the future or will we always be or do you see a scenario where you are always in a normalized environment down the road selling gas into the open market outside of your company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s end markets?"
