    "content": " Our second quarter operating results compared to last year were as follows: Total net sales were $168.3 million, a decrease of $33.6 million or 16.7%, compared to a company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s second quarter record of $202 million last year due to going up against last year's unprecedented pent-up demand and stimulus impacts. Turning to the third quarter of fiscal 2022, based on our quarter-to-date net sales results and current historical trends, and anticipating some deceleration in the latter half of the quarter as Ed noted earlier, we currently expect our total net sales for the third quarter of fiscal 2022 to be in the range of approximately $165 million to $170 million, SG&A to be approximately $46 million to $47 million, operating income to the range of approximately $1.9 million to $4.6 million, our estimated income tax rate to be approximately 27% and earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $0.05 to $0.11 based on estimated weighted average diluted shares of approximately $30.2 million."
