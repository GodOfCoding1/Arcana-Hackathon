    "content": " After the market closed today, Ooma issued its second quarter fiscal 2022 earnings press release, as well as a press release announced appointment of Shig Hamamatsu as Vice President, CFO and Treasurer effective next Tuesday September 7 via Business Wire. Our average monthly subscription and services revenue per core user or ARPU increased 10% year-over-year to $13.1, which is due to an increasing mix of Office Pro users. But no, we still get a lot of customers who take one or two seats and that's it, and are just getting started or just have of a very small business and want to as we say sound and look like a big business at a small business price, which is what we think Ooma Office is all about. And then finally, just Office and Office Pro, and at some point here over the next quarters, a tier above Office Pro, the market is just so vast that it comes down to the amount of sales and marketing effort we can make and just driving the execution and the growth, and that's also something we've been doing for years, and are going to continue to do. Everyone on the Ooma team is working hard and we're pleased with our results this past quarter, but we're also excited as we look forward and you know I really appreciate everyone's support and confidence as we build the business."
