    "content": " As discussed in today's press release, we're beginning -- we're bringing to market a combined and complementary offering of dedicated use of our 900 megahertz broadband spectrum paired with Federated Wireless' shared spectrum SaaS services for use on the CBRS band. And really, while it's -- I would say the spending in CBRS may not be as material in the overall scheme of utility spend, for us, it's a good example of how we translate these ecosystem partners into win-win situations where, obviously, we get the benefit of combining this product and making it more appealing to the customer, Federated obviously gets access to this great group of customers we've invested years of building relationships. They're still, as you said, working their way through justification and stakeholdering on a deal that size is much larger than what we see in just the spectrum transaction, and that's still a necessary process, even though they are -- I'm confident in this, seeing the urgency and the scarce nature of what the spectrum offering is, that's promoting a lot of the conversations we're seeing."
