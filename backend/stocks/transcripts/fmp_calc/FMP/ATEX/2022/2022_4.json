I\u2019m Natasha Vecchiarelli, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications at Anterix. Joining me on today\u2019s call are Rob Schwartz, our President and CEO; Ryan Gerbrandt, our COO; Tim Gray, our CFO; and Chris Guttman-McCabe, our Chief Regulatory and Communications Officer. Before we begin, please note that during today\u2019s presentation, we may make forward-looking statements either in our prepared remarks or any associated question-and-answer session. In addition, at the conclusion of today\u2019s call, a replay and transcript of our discussion will be posted to our Investor Relations website. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Anterix\u2019s President and CEO, Rob Schwartz. This morning, I\u2019ll give you an update on our industry progress and customer pipeline, and Tim is going to take you through our year-end financials, and then we\u2019ll open up for questions. As we pursue our goal of being the de facto private broadband solution for the utility sector, I know at times how difficult it is to measure Anterix\u2019s progress beyond the closing of lease contracts. To start with, I\u2019m happy to share that we have three signed letters of intent with utilities in our pipeline, one of which was signed in the past two weeks. As these larger deals are strategically important to our plan, it\u2019s helpful to highlight that some of these very large deals involve expanded processes with utility, adding an increased complexity to help them bring them to completion. Overall, we\u2019ve also seen a positive seasoning of our pipeline. We are using every tool in our toolbox to continue our progress, which now includes our new platform that I\u2019ll describe shortly. In addition to the movement within our pipeline and the LOIs we have secured, the launch of a platform yesterday is another indication of growing market support for offering. Two of the utility industry\u2019s largest trade shows are taking place this week and next, the Utility Technology Council Convention and DistribuTECH. Our team on the ground has shared that the initial response we are getting to this news is exceptional, and while this is no substitute for a signed contract, from an industry perspective, it can\u2019t be overstated how this is further significant endorsement of our goal to drive nationwide utility adoption of 900 megahertz. Built on the foundation of our Anterix Active Ecosystem Program, six initial C-level executives have committed to oversight of this industry cooperation and collaboration to drive 900 megahertz solutions. And while we\u2019ve talked about the significance of our Anterix Active Ecosystem Program, it bears repeating that it\u2019s a great illustration of the support we\u2019re receiving for our offering. This platform is designed to meet the needs and requests of our customers, and we expect the platform to further differentiate our offering in the marketplace, expand our competitive advantage and continue to drive the leasing of our valuable spectrum asset. For our customers, the platform will provide Anterix with the ability to identify utility needs and match those needs with the Anterix Active Ecosystem community we have gathered, harnessing the power and scale of that combination. Amarin, Dominion, Evergy, Exelon, Southern Company and the Utility Broadband Alliance, which represents numerous additional utilities and technology developers. Focusing Anterix and those innovators on real-life industry needs and the development of solutions that will drive economies of scale, lower risk and complexity and accelerate the availability of products. As part of the launch of the platform, five targeted initiatives have been identified, including a 4G, 5G cloud core hosted by AWS, an enhanced multiband communications module and integrated cybersecurity offering, a connected lab environment and a public network roaming management solution. And while the focus of our business remains on monetizing our spectrum asset, the platform will enhance and simply the solutions set for utilities and as a result, drive adoption. From total cost of ownership studies to spectrum valuation, development of business models, rate case strategy, use case development, applying for infrastructure funds and more, the adoption of private broadband has become a strategic decision for these utilities, not simply a replacement of a communications capability. Yes, it takes time, but the outcome of this partnership effort supports not just our near-term customers, but also the entire base of our pipeline, and the resulting multi-decade relationships. And with that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Tim. I\u2019m pleased to announce that for our fiscal year 2022, for the first time on an annual basis, we yielded positive cash flow before share repurchases. Further, we expect receipt of an additional $55 million of contracted proceeds from the SDG&E and Amarin contracts through mid-2026, which will continue to strengthen our balance sheet. As we previously guided, we expect to spend roughly $70 million per year through fiscal year 2024, including approximately $40 million of OpEx and $30 million in spectrum clearing costs. For fiscal year 2022, we spent approximately $35 million in OpEx and $25 million in spectrum clearing costs, which includes returning costs, spectrum acquisitions and anti-windfall payments. Current fiscal year-to-date, we have an additional $10 million in committed funds for contracts not yet closed to clear spectrum. I\u2019d like to note that in the two years since the Report and Order was issued, our spectrum clearing efforts have increased the number of counties where Anterix fully meets the FCC\u2019s broadband licensing requirements to over 2,000 counties throughout the United States. Our business plan continues to be fully funded with approximately $106 million in cash on our balance sheet as of March 31, 2022, and no outstanding debt, providing ample capital and balance sheet flexibility to continue to support our business initiatives. Total activity during our fiscal year 2022 included approximately 215,000 shares repurchased at a cost of $15 million. I\u2019ll conclude by saying that as our spectrum asset continues to increase in value as we converted it to broadband, combined with the overall strength of our pipeline and balance sheet, I am pleased with the foundation we have heading into our fiscal 2023. As we\u2019ve talked about in the past, there\u2019s all kinds of points of entry that utilities have shown, those who have transacted with us and those who are on the process of doing so. I think it\u2019s also worth looking at all of the names of folks \u2013 when you saw the press release about the platform, the C-suite C-level folks that are showing the level of support they are for the collective action of the industry is really another indication of how these utilities are stepping forward. As far as the point of timing, I\u2019m going to pass to Ryan in a second, but we\u2019ve said in the past, predicting the precision of timing we know is something that is virtually impossible with the kind of counterparties that we\u2019re working with. To me, the macro indications of what\u2019s happening in the marketplace just continues to give us confidence about the scale of the opportunity and the demand that\u2019s developing for 900 megahertz. And the specific timing, I think it\u2019s still a jump all for us to be able to say how fast those specific LOIs will convert into contracts, but we have confidence if they will. So what makes it \u2013 what gets a utility to the point of \u2013 I mean when you say LOI, presumably, someone is literally e-signing at least or signing a piece of paper. Like what\u2019s on that paper, that person is willing to sign, as opposed to just saying like, \"Hey, we\u2019re going to continue to work this out and then sign an ultimate contract. Look, again, I know you\u2019ve been through this yourself. In some instances, it\u2019s valuable to frame up a transaction and start with a letter of intent. But again, we\u2019ve done deals, we\u2019ve gone straight to contract and haven\u2019t done letters of intent from them as well. I mean there\u2019ll be multiple ways since we talked about, I don\u2019t see this as the exclusive way that we\u2019re going to see this process progresses, but these are complex processes. As we\u2019ve said before, these are sophisticated procurement teams that we\u2019re working through a lot of the details of these pending transactions. And these types of vehicles can be nice way, be able to begin the process as we\u2019re starting to flesh out kind of key aspects of the delivery, the spectrum transaction, and ultimately work our way incrementally towards the larger deal. I mean what it looks like to me is like, hey, I\u2019m a utility, I\u2019m going through this lengthy process of evaluating it. Maybe some of them are LOIs on that list, I don\u2019t know, but I guess they\u2019re basically \u2013 if you bring them together in this manner, it reduces their risk that they commit to something that ultimately an ecosystem doesn\u2019t broaden out in terms of the utilities. So clearly, our 900 megahertz spectrum is part of the 3GPP standard, and there is an ecosystem that exists and companies like Amarin, STG and Evergy are deploying it. This is about how do we create a process for continuous innovation on this 3GPP standard of 900, and how do we create an ecosystem around not just the infrastructure and the devices, but going up the vertical stack of applications, the cybersecurity offering is called out there as an example. And so for us, it\u2019s not about getting customers to contract with this, although it\u2019s clearly going to be a catalyst for that, it\u2019s about how do we create an environment that creates a continuously valuable solution over the multi-decades that we\u2019re signing these agreements. And Rob\u2026\n If these people are in some type of forum where they\u2019re having these discussions, shouldn\u2019t that make it easier for you to try and get a services business off the ground or maybe you create some type of cloud based core,  Web DISH is doing and enable that to be shared across multiple utilities. If you noticed the five initiatives that we\u2019re putting forward, the first is a 4G, 5G cloud core, and we\u2019ve talked about that we\u2019re doing it in conjunction with AWS. And it\u2019s not just about having a cloud core for an individual utility, it\u2019s about what that does collectively. So when \u2013 and I mentioned cybersecurity, if you\u2019re coming in at a collective effort to be able to connect to these utilities, being able to detect the threat landscape across utilities and be able to use that broader information to be able to react to those kind of issues across the board is so much more valuable. I mean scale is an overused word, and yet when you think of this new platform and you think of apply the word scale to both sides of the equation, on the utility side, we\u2019ve got a half dozen executives. And then obviously, on the other side, you\u2019ve got the 80 companies poised to deliver on those needs. And so it\u2019s \u2013 and in between, you have five products right now with what we expect to be dozens and dozens more going forward. And it really drives \u2013 again, overused word, but it really drives scale to all sides of the decision-making, both before utility contracts and then after the contract. We can\u2019t forget that, and Amarin started their efforts in advance of us having an FCC ruling. We do think there\u2019s absolutely \u2013 as pioneers break the ice here, there\u2019s going to be \u2013 it makes it easier for others to move forward. But you are correct that the complexity of these transactions is, I would say, more significant now that we\u2019re getting into it because of the strategic rationale. But specifically within the utility sector, I touched on cybersecurity and needless, you don\u2019t have to open a paper to understand that every day, there\u2019s increasing threats from what\u2019s going on in the global landscape that utilities are one of the primary focuses. It is now a nationwide risk issue, and we\u2019ve demonstrated and San Diego Gas & Electric has publicly talked about and work with Schweitzer about the value of being able to use these to prevent wildfires. It\u2019s not a telecom question, it\u2019s a strategic decision about how they use these to be able to mitigate wildfires. And now with the decarbonization objectives of all utilities and our global commitments, the need to be able to have two-way communications out to all these distributed energy sources is also happening, but that\u2019s a very complicated problem utility to trying to solve. And so we\u2019re now integrating to solving these top strategic issues for utilities, and those take time from a planning standpoint, of which we\u2019re a component of it, but we\u2019re not driving solely. And so it\u2019s not just about purchasing spectrum or leasing spectrum or building an LTE network, it\u2019s about solving these macro problems and that does increase the complexity and timing, but these are issues that must be solved by utilities. So that\u2019s why when we say, it\u2019s not if but when. We\u2019re certain that the communications systems for providing are going to help solve these, but the complexity of the decision-making absolutely is elongated because of the strategic nature. In the past, you\u2019ve said that the final stage of the pipeline, there was about $400 million in there. Obviously, we\u2019ve got some activity as Rob hit on in the prepared remarks, too, in terms of the developing through both Phase 2 and Phase 3. As we said, obviously, we\u2019re focused \u2013 laser-focused on the next deal, but the ability to move the volumes through is really where the critical mass comes from as we\u2019re also keeping our eye on the fiscal year 2024 goal and how we continue to progress those through. I think, Phil, we\u2019re still seeing a preference for prepayment for most of our utilities. So I think, generally, we\u2019ll continue to see that trend. We are, as I mentioned in my comments and some of the responses earlier, still see lots of signs of why this growing demand, while the processes individually take a lot of time, everything is moving forward in a really strong and powerful way. And I think this platform announcement and support is just another sign of that, and as we see this collective solution coming together, we think it makes it even easier for utilities to understand and transact. Letters of intent we\u2019re talking about didn\u2019t really touch on it yet, but the federal funding, we see as a coming stimulus as well. The speed of each individual transaction absolutely frustrating that it doesn\u2019t go as fast as we\u2019d like, but we haven\u2019t seen anything indicating that there isn\u2019t forward movement across the board. Yes, I\u2019d like to add one thing. I want to come back to \u2013 we talked a little bit about kind of the evolving strategic imperative as it relates to the complexity in terms of how we\u2019re engaging the deals, but there\u2019s a flip side to that, that I think is very positive to your question, Simon. That strategic imperative and the fact that we are seeing this elevate into a C-suite issue and private LTE and broadband being directly relatable to the solution set that utilities are exploring for reliability, for clean energy goals, for providing cyber protections, only further reinforces the logical outcome and the critical importance that private LTE is playing, both in their near-term tactical plans and in the broader strategic plans. So those indicators are critical as we\u2019re seeing the general trajectory \u2013 time aside for a minute, but in terms of the big picture of how we see adoption ultimately play out. No, that\u2019s a little bit of a moving target as we deliver spectrum, but based on the parameters of the contracts this fiscal year, we should receive those dollars. As you know, we\u2019re working with numerous utilities that either have CBRS licenses or using unlicensed CBRS. And we see the integration of that, as we\u2019ve talked about for a while as being a really strong complement having a communications module, and this is \u2013 for those who don\u2019t know this, it\u2019s the card that gets slotted into most communication devices, especially those that are used for fixed wireless like a Cisco or GE device that puts it with \u2013 on a cellular network. Those \u2013 the commonality of those cards to have multiple bands, CBRS and 900 plus other bands of carriers, so we have the ability to deploy it immediately, start on carrier network and evolve onto your private network as it gets built out. So we see that as being a highly functional product, and it\u2019s a great example of kind of the crowd sourcing that we did across the ecosystem of the vendors that all needed this, utilities that we\u2019re asking for it, but there was no one at a central point that was going to take the collective action to help develop it and create the economic benefit for the industry and for us and our shareholders. So to the LOI\u2019s range and what in them, contained in them, and they\u2019re all under NDA. So I can\u2019t really reveal the specifics, and \u2013 but in general, there are indications of directional interest in getting the contract and contract specifics, including pricing as well. So \u2013 and so for us, it\u2019s just, again, another indication directionally of the volume of utilities. Not the only path forward, Mike, and we see it as just a good indication from those three utilities about their commitment to move forward. Yes, we\u2019re still confident, Mike, about fair market value being in that range for sure. From our experience to date, as you know, it\u2019s a wide range, but it is what defines fair market value for us and that includes the conversations with the parties that are in those non-binding LOIs. I don\u2019t have it offhand, Mike, but happy to share that with you from the information we have. There\u2019s service territories, as you know, is public information. And it\u2019s really a question of timing of how we convert that to cash flow, but the asset remains on our balance sheet. And every day that goes by as we see more and more interest in private networks, we see that, that \u2013 the value of that asset continues to increase from our perspective."
