    "content": " But overall, Rob referenced kind of what we've seen in the building of the Phase III pipeline, which has increased, to be more than $400 million of potential contracted proceeds in this phase alone. First, it's really about continuing to position us and our company as the trusted advisor to these utilities as we're working day-to-day and the pipeline customers that you mentioned in that $400 million of that Phase III. 28:32 We're also seeing kind of the increases of the voice that organizations, like UBBA, EEI and UTC have who have a much broader perspective in terms of the utility audience, but that's where a lot of the utilities refine, go out to get their information and attract learnings around some of the new evolving things that we may just not have touched yet frankly through some of the direct sales relationships and the team that we've been able to build, I'd say, so . As we said in the prepared remarks, I mean we've been seeing growth actually or development which it would translate to in all of the three phases, so while we've been seeing kind of the growing of the funnel as we just mentioned, the additional 10 coming into the top end, we've been seeing equal kind of growth as we move through Phase II and I'll -- today as we noted, with the $400 million in Phase III."
