    "content": " In the first quarter, we exceeded our guidance delivering revenue of $100.7 million, 12% ahead of the prior year and positive adjusted EBITDA while continuing to invest in sales and marketing as well as product and technology to support accelerated growth in the second half of the year and into 2023. As an enterprise we've gone to market with a single digital front door that fully and seamlessly integrates a suite of virtual care and high touch offerings, including the introduction of Sharecare Plus, our advocacy solution, a tech-enabled home care offering with care links, a library of clinically accredited digital therapeutics and now virtual primary care as part of our solution set. Sharecare's interoperable platform enables us to quickly add new capabilities that are important to our clients, whether we build, buy or partner to achieve them and in turn, retain our focus on enhancing engagement, navigation and tech enabled capabilities that drive value across the entire patient journey. In closing, in 21, we established a stronger foundation for success by adding Doc AI to drive innovation and product development, partnering with Anthem to build a digital first payer agnostic advocacy solution, expanding our sales team and enabling us to increase our reach with existing and new clients, extending our presence into the home by acquiring CareLinx and going public which enabled us to strengthen our balance sheet to support future growth. We expect these investments to support our long term growth and drive additional operating leverage in the second half of the year, as we gain greater traction for the Sharecare digital platform, expand our record retrieval and execute in our life sciences channel with existing and new customers."
