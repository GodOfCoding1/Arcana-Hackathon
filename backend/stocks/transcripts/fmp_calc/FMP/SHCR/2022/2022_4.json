    "content": " In our core enterprise business, we contracted over 900,000 new eligible lives for Sharecare+, our new digital-first advocacy solution and 1.8 million new members for CareLinx, our home health solution and ended the year above our target KPI of eligible lives with 12.4 million. The Provider segment contributed $104 million in revenue in 2022, and through our previously discussed globalization efforts, we are tracking to deliver $14 million in annualized cost savings, which began in Q1 2023 and we expect to realize approximately $10 million of operating expense reductions within the year. Similar to our full year results, year-over-year growth for Q4 was also impacted by our decision to discontinue health security, which resulted in a revenue reduction of approximately $10 million and over $4 million in adjusted EBITDA over the prior year period. As a reminder, the 12.4 million includes growth in lives from Sharecare+, which we will receive the benefit of a full year of contract delivery in fiscal year 2023; increase in records retrieved to $6.5 million records, a 12% increase over fiscal 2022; capital expenditures of approximately $30 million."
