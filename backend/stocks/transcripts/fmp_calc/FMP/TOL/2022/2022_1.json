    "content": " We signed 2,929 net contracts for approximately $3 billion, up 2% in units and 19% in dollars over last year's extremely strong first quarter when orders were up 59% in units compared to fiscal Q1 of 2020. The average selling price of signed contracts in the quarter once again exceeded $1 million and was up approximately $149,000 compared to last year's first quarter. In our first quarter, we delivered 1,929 homes at an average price of approximately $875,000, generating homebuilding revenues of $1.69 billion, which was up 9% in units and 20% in dollars from 1 year ago. Our first quarter pretax and net income were $200.8 million and $151.9 million, respectively, both up approximately 57% compared to $127.4 million and -- I'm sorry, $96.5 million, respectively, in the first quarter of 2021. As a follow-up, I just want to -- so thinking about your sales pace in 2021, you sold maybe a little over 3 homes per community per month in the quarter, similar to that. And so this quarter, as Marty said, we will be starting more homes than we sell, but those homes will -- in fact, they should have a shorter construction cycle time because at least in the early stages of the home, we don't have a client, and we're able to move faster, but they will, we believe, deliver in the time frame as if they had been sold."
