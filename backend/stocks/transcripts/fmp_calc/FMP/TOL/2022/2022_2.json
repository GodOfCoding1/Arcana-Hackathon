    "content": " SG&A expense, at 11.1% of homebuilding revenues, was 80 basis points better than both last year\u2019s second quarter and our guidance. Based on the strong pricing and margin embedded in our backlog and with approximately half of our backlog scheduled for delivery in fiscal year 2023, we expect our fiscal year 2023 adjusted gross margin to be better than fiscal year 2022\u2019s. We signed 2,874 net contracts for $3.1 billion, up 1.2% in dollars over 2021\u2019s extremely strong second quarter, when orders were up 97% in dollars compared to Q2 of 2020. In our second quarter, we delivered 2,407 homes and generated homebuilding revenues of $2.2 billion, up 6% in units and 19% in dollars from 1 year ago. The average selling price of our 2,874 signed contracts in fiscal year 2022\u2019s second quarter was $1,075,000, up nearly $200,000 compared to last year\u2019s second quarter and up $53,000 over Q1. Other income, income from unconsolidated entities and land sales gross profit is expected to be breakeven for the third quarter, but is now expected to be approximately $110 million for the full year, an increase of $10 million over our prior guidance. So for the last 1.5 years, we\u2019ve been running an approximately 5% price increase per quarter. And if I can just add one more, the \u201823 margin guide to be up, obviously, that\u2019s a reflection of the 50% of your backlog that\u2019s in there presumably at margins similar or better than what you are expecting in the fourth quarter of this year."
