    "content": " In our fiscal third quarter ended July 31, we reported earnings of $2.35 per share, up 26% compared to the third quarter of 2021 and driven by continued gross margin expansion. SG&A expense was 10.3% of homebuilding revenues, which was 20 basis points better than both our guidance and last year's third quarter. They make a non-refundable down payment averaging $80,000, so they are also financially invested as our low backlog cancellation rate in the third quarter attests, our buyers have remained committed to their new homes even in this uncertain environment. As a result, our net signed contracts were down approximately 60% in units compared to last year's historically strong third quarter. In our third quarter, we generated homebuilding revenues of $2.3 billion, down 7% in units and up 1% in dollars from one year ago. Third quarter joint venture land sales and other income was $13.2 million, exceeding our breakeven guidance, mostly due to gains on land sold into joint ventures that we had originally projected would occur later in the year. And so the reduced guidance is probably, Alan, around 10% to 15% due to less spec sales that will sell and deliver what I call in the same quarter or in a short period of time since that's not the primary part of our business model. That, of course, is not our full year deliveries because we still have homes we can sell in the fourth quarter and even into early 2023 that will still deliver by October 31 of '23, and that includes build to orders and that, of course, includes many of those 20% spec homes that I talked about, which is part of our strategy."
