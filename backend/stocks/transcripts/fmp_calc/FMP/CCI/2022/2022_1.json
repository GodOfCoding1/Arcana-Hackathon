    "content": "  Looking further out, I believe our strategy and unmatched portfolio of more than 40,000 towers and approximately 115,000 small cells on air or under contract, and 80,000 route miles of fiber concentrated in the top US markets have positioned Crown Castle to generate 7% to 8% growth in dividends per share for years to come. Since the establishment of the 5G standards, and the start of the associated network upgrade in 2017, we have delivered double-digit annual AFFO per share growth, which, when added to our approximately 3% dividend yield over that same time period, generated returns of approximately 14% per year to our shareholders, which has led the tower industry over this time period. We expect to once again generate industry-leading organic tower revenue growth in the US and we believe our comprehensive set of solutions across towers, small cells and fiber, which are all necessary to build wireless networks, will allow us to deliver on our annual target of 7% to 8% growth in dividends per share."
