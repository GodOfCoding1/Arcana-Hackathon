    "content": " So -- And as we work to position through so that we have the right staffing for the initial tranche of the freighter aircraft and work to move people through the training cycles to get equipped for the 787s coming on later this year, we'll still have some unproductive time in terms of pilots spending time in training rather than flying revenue block hours for us and that is going to continue, really throughout this year and probably start to level out some next year. Please proceed with your question. Please proceed with your question. Please proceed with your question. And do we have as many airplanes as we want to fly our flight and server demand, particularly in the peak time of the year and the summer and if we can -- we're going to continue to work with our partners at Pratt, who have been a good partner with us over the year to see if we can get a little bit more certainty and hopefully a little bit more aircraft availability in the summer which would allow us to get some of the revenue back that we're leaving on the table if we don't have aircrafts flying. Please proceed with your question. Please proceed with your question."
