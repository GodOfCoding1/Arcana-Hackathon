    "content": " In our markets outside of Japan, however, average fares for the quarter were up 31% compared to 2019, which drove a ticket PRASM improvement of 25% of the strong fare performance, all despite the strength of the US dollar. In the Neighbor Island, we expect to fly about 80% of our 2019 capacity in the fourth quarter, and we are competing well and continue to maintain a share of local traffic well in excess of our seats here, earning a sizable load factor premium, as well as meaningful yield premium compared to our competitor. We anticipate our overall capacity for the fourth quarter to be down approximately 5.5% from 2019 levels, bringing our full year capacity down approximately 9.2% from 2019, which is slightly lower than we forecasted last quarter, reflecting the adjustments to our Japan schedule. To summarize, we continue to see strong demand and we expect our fourth quarter load factor to be close to 2019 levels, premium cabin PRASM improvements to continue to accelerate to historical highs and extra comfort revenue to exceed 2019 levels. A focus on traveling abroad, I think, it's going to take a little while but we're -- we think that's about the sweet spot where folks will start coming back, and we'll see stronger golden week in travel really at the end of the first quarter and into the second quarter and we plan on matching our capacity concurrent with that."
