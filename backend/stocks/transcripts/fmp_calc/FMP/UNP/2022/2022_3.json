    "content": " Costs related to higher inflation and ongoing network inefficiencies were offset by fuel surcharge revenue, volume growth and strong core pricing gains to produce adjusted operating income growth of 13%. Finally, third quarter results also include the favorable comparison to last year's weather and wildfire events, which adds 50 basis points to OR and $0.05 to EPS. This year's inflation, while we came into the year thinking inflation was probably going to be around 3%, and that would be higher than what we've seen historically, it's probably going to be closer to 5%. I mean, it looks like if it's $20 million third quarter and fourth quarter, and then another incremental -- I'm just -- it doesn't see -- it looks like it's kind of like $50 million to $60 million on a net incremental next year versus 2022. I don't know that we'll be quite that next year, but it's going to be much higher than our normal, which -- or higher than what we thought kind of back at our May Analyst Day, which was 2.25%."
