    "content": " Partnership's revenues for the fourth quarter of 2022 relative to the same quarter in 2021 were lower primarily due to a reduction in contracted capacity at the Hardisty terminal that was effective July 1, 2022. As of December 31, 2022, the partnership had approximately $2.5 million of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents and undrawn borrowing capacity of $60 million on its $275 million senior secured credit facility, subject to the partnership's continued compliance with financial covenants. The partnership's Board determined to keep the distribution unchanged from the prior quarter and to evaluate the distribution on a quarterly basis going forward, and we'll take into consideration updated commercial progress, including the partnership's ability to renew, extend or replace its customer agreements at the Hardisty and Stroud terminals, current market conditions and management's expectations regarding future performance."
