    "content": " During the first quarter, we announced the acquisition of the Hardisty South Terminal from our Sponsor as well as the simplification of the partnership\u2019s financial structure by eliminating its IDRs. On April 6, the Partnership closed the acquisition of the Hardisty South Terminal from USD Group LLC and eliminated our Sponsor\u2019s IDRs for total consideration of $75 million in cash and approximately 5.75 million common units. And as Dan mentioned, the acquisition of the Hardisty South Terminal increases the size, scale and growth capacity of the Partnership\u2019s asset base while optimizing operational and commercial synergies of the Hardisty Terminal in order to capitalize on growth benefits associated with the Sponsor\u2019s DRU program. As mentioned, the Partnership also experienced higher selling, general and administrative costs during the first quarter as compared to the first quarter of 2021 mainly due to approximately $500,000 of legal and consulting fees incurred related to the previously mentioned acquisition of the Hardisty South Terminal. As of March 31, the Partnership had approximately $4.5 million of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents and undrawn borrowing capacity of $112 million on its $275 million senior secured credit facility, subject to the Partnership\u2019s continued compliance with financial covenants."
