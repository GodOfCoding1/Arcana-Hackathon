    "content": " Despite flat to declining precious metal prices, we still posted a 12% increase in revenue to $343 million, which included excellent results from our royalty portfolio. Operating cash flow was very healthy at $249 million, up 28% over the same period last year, and earnings were $138 million or $2.10 per share. Our Royalty segment contributed $57.9 million in revenue, an increase of 14% over the prior year quarter, representing about 34% of total revenue for the quarter. On the stream side, revenue of $111 million was up about 3% from the prior year quarter. With respect to KCM's financial position, working capital has been impacted due to the slower ramp-up, and we're currently in discussions with KCM on providing the final $26.5 million available under the Silver Stream. In the event we contribute the full $26.5 million, Royal Gold Stream interest would increase to 100% of payable silver, which at full production is expected to be 1.8 million to 2 million ounces per year. Revenue was $169 million for the quarter, a 6% increase over the prior year period. Earnings were $68.2 million or $1.04 per share, a 14% increase from the prior year quarter. We reported another very strong quarter of operating cash flow at $119 million, which was a 19% increase over the prior year and was primarily due to higher proceeds received from both our royalty and stream interest. In line with our strategy of using operating cash flow to manage our debt level, we repaid the remaining $50 million revolver balance in early December and ended the year debt-free and with a full $1 billion revolver undrawn and available. KCM has advised that it intends to draw the remaining $26.5 million stream advanced payment later in February, which would then increase our Silver Stream interest from 90% to 100%."
