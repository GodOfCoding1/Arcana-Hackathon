    "content": " Revenue for the quarter was $131 million, operating cash flow was $95 million, and earnings were $46 million, or $0.70 per share. With respect to the Cortez Complex royalty, we received notice from Nevada Gold Mines that the 15 million ounce threshold was reached late in the quarter, and approximately 3,300 ounces of mine production was attributable to the 1.2% royalty. Our balance sheet remains strong, and our cash flow in the quarter allowed us to repay $50 million of the $500 million that we drew on the revolver for the Cortez complex royalty acquisition. Our royalty segment contributed $33 million in revenue, a decrease of 44% over the prior year quarter with lower contributions from Cortez, Pe\u00c3\u00b1asquito, Robinson, South Laverton and Dolores. Our stream segment revenue was $99 million, about 15% lower than the prior year quarter. We expect to lower volumes in the current quarter, but prices of our key metals were also weaker compared to the prior year, with gold down 3%, silver down 21% and copper down 17%. Note that with the announced addition to reserves at Mount Milligan, the gold and copper depletion rates for our stream have decreased as of September 30, to $416 per ounce of gold and $1.06 per copper pound compared to $703 per ounce of gold and $1.53 per pound of copper in prior quarters. Although operating cash flow remained strong at $95 million this quarter, it was lower than the record $130 million we reported in the prior year. For DD&A, as a result of the lower gold and copper depletion rates at Mount Milligan that I just mentioned, we expect our 2022 DD&A guidance range to decrease to $510 to $560 per GEO from the original range of $535 to $585 per GEO. For DD&A, and in line with what I stated during our last quarterly call, we have assigned 38% or nearly $200 million of the purchase price to production stage mineral interest."
