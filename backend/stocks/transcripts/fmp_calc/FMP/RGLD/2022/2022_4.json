    "content": " Our royalty segment contributed $54 million in revenue, a decrease of about 7% from the prior year quarter with lower contributions from Pe\u00c3\u00b1asquito and Leeville, partially offset by stronger contributions from the Cortez Legacy Zone and revenue from our new royalties on the Cortez CC Zone. At Cortez, we received revenue of approximately $5.2 million from these new royalties with $4.5 million from the Rio Tinto Royalty over the full quarter and $700,000 from the Idaho Royalty for the month of December. Our stream segment revenue was $109 million, which is basically flat compared to the prior year quarter, higher contributions from Mount Milligan and Xavantina were offset by lower revenue from Andacollo and Pueblo Viejo. As Mark mentioned in his remarks, we also recognized just over $5 million in new revenue from the recently acquired Cortez interest, and had overall strong performances within both our stream and royalty segments. With respect to the Idaho Royalty, we acquired for $204 million in December, we allocated $73.4 million or about 36% of the purchase price to production stage royalty interests. After adjusting for a onetime impairment of $4.3 million on a non-principal exploration stage royalty interest during the quarter, our adjusted earnings were $60 million or $0.91 per share."
