    "content": " Please see the Risk Factors section in RGP's report on Form 10-K for the year ended May 28, 2021, for a discussion of risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause the company's business, results of operations and financial condition to differ materially from what is expressed or implied by forward-looking statements made during this call. In fiscal 2023, we will work to advance three projects: the commercialization of HUGO which is expanding into the California market this quarter, the execution of Project Phoenix, which is the modernization of our core technology stack and the continued improvement of consultant experience through digital means. Revenue increased by 27.5% over prior year quarter on a same-day constant currency basis while top-of-the-funnel activity was strong, fortifying the pipeline going into fiscal 2023. Also, while we made progress with respect to pricing, increasing bill rates by 4% compared to prior year quarter and 2% sequentially, we continue to see pricing leverage as an opportunity across the enterprise and remain focused on the strategic objectives. On the industry front, revenue growth in health care, financial services and technology industries also all well exceeded 30% compared to the prior year quarter. On a full-year basis, and we said this during our Investor Day, that this year heading into fiscal 2023, we expect our SG&A to continue to hold at the 27-ish percent, but we're also making some investments this year and back into our business, making investments in digital practice as well as our technology platform project there."
