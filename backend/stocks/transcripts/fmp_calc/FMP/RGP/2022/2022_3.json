    "content": " Enterprise revenue increased by 32% over prior year quarter and 4% sequentially on a same day constant currency basis, while top of the funnel activity was robust, especially when taking into account holiday effects for both Christmas and New Year\u2019s Day. We achieved record third quarter revenue and further improved our SG&A leverage, which led to $22.5 million of adjusted EBITDA, or an 11% adjusted EBITDA margin, a 490 basis-point increase from the prior year quarter. Building on the structural improvement in our SG&A, run rate SG&A expense for the quarter was $54.4 million after excluding noncash stock compensation, contingent consideration, restructuring charges and technology transformation costs, representing 26.6% of revenue, a 380 basis-point improvement compared to the same period a year ago."
