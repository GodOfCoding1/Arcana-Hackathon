    "content": " We\u2019ve reengineered our sales process, organization and account strategy; we\u2019ve revolutionized our delivery strategy to be borderless to ensure our clients have access to the best talent and our talent has access to the best projects regardless of geography; we\u2019ve redesigned incentive compensation with a focus on employee return aligned with shareholder value; we\u2019ve developed technology and digital consulting capabilities to address our clients\u2019 most pressing needs; and we\u2019ve built a new digital pathway for stakeholder engagement. I think where the challenge comes in is that there is more opportunities for consultants and some of them do get poached at what I would say at an inopportune times, like almost prior to the -- now you almost never saw somebody commit to a project and then sort of at the 11th hour leave to go to another project and we\u2019ve seen that happen I would say several times much to the consternation of our client service team, but it is a function of kind of what\u2019s happening in the world today."
