    "content": " Please see the Risk Factors section in RGP's report on Form 10-K for the year ended May 28, 2022, for a discussion of risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause the company's business, results of operations and financial condition to differ materially from what is expressed or implied by forward-looking statements made during this call. What you can expect to see in the coming months with the refreshed website as well as thought leadership based on RGP-led market research, offering perspectives on how organizations are managing their most mission-critical projects, particularly in the face of challenging economic times, talent shortages and a hybrid working world. In addition to the strong top line growth, we also expanded our adjusted EBITDA margin by 280 basis points from the prior year quarter to 15%, a record first quarter margin and a key GAAP diluted EPS of $0.53 per share for the quarter. The other thing I'd say is, with the work we've done internally over the last five years, we do have much greater visibility to our data and to the investments we're making and whether that's paying off and what the trend lines we see in our client buying behaviors. And that's really where we're focused on delivering and putting together our platform, which brings the right level of care on the talent side and the client side to really be successful in this new way of working."
