    "content": " Overall, we have performed solidly through the first three quarters of the year, growing by about 6%, exclusive of the divested task force business on a same-day constant currency basis, and our growth pipeline continues to be sizable. While we outperformed our top line outlook range provided in January, compared to the prior fiscal year, which had elevated revenues as clients emerge from pandemic, revenue of $186.8 million for the third quarter was down 4% year-over-year on a same-day constant currency basis and excluding taskforce."
