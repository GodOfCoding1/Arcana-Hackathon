    "content": " Directing your attention to pretax pre-provision earnings and excluding the impact of merger and acquisition expenses, COVID expenses, gains and losses on the sale of securities, Banner Forward expenses, changes in fair value of financial instruments and the gain on the sale of branches, earnings were $57.8 million for the second quarter of 2022 compared to $49.7 million for the first quarter of 2022. Due to strong loan growth in the quarter, and coupled with the increasing economic uncertainty as we look to the balance of 2022 and into 2023, we posted a $3.1 million provision for loan losses as well as an additional $1.4 million provision for unfunded commitments. Losses in the quarter were again offset by recoveries and after the provision, our ACL reserve totaled $128.7 million or 1.36% of total loans as of June 30, down one basis point from the linked quarter and compares to a reserve of 1.53% as of June 30, 2021. We reported core portfolio loan growth, excluding PPP loans of $338 million or 3.7% for the quarter and 14.9% on an annualized basis. Commercial loans, excluding PPP, grew by nearly 9% or $94 million in the quarter, which is an annualized rate of 35% and balances are now 5% higher than reported as of June 2021. Additionally, there was strong growth in the small business score portfolio, up 6% or $49 million due to the successful small business campaign that rolled out in the second quarter. As anticipated, agricultural loan reflects the seasonal draws on lines of credit with balances of $38 million quarter-over-quarter or 16% and are up 17.5% year-over-year, excluding PPP loans. Very briefly, touching on asset quality, adversely classified loans continued to decline, reducing $24 million in the quarter and are down $118 million or 43% year-over-year. Core revenue, excluding gains and losses on securities, changes in fair value of financial instruments carried at fair value, and gains on the sale of sold branches increased $10.7 million from the prior quarter due to an increase in net interest income. Total loans increased $315 million from the prior quarter end as a result of increases in held-for-portfolio loans, partially offset by a $28 million decline in PPP loans. Excluding PPP loans and held-for-sale loans, portfolio loans increased $338 million and 14.9% on an annualized basis. Time deposit balances declined $44 million from the prior quarter end, of which $8 million were due to the aforementioned branch sale and the remaining $36 million decline driven by higher cost CDs continuing to roll over at lower retention rates. Net interest income increased by $10.4 million from the prior quarter due to an expansion of the net interest margin, coupled with growth in average loan outstandings and lower balances of lower-yielding overnight interest-bearing cash. Total average interest-bearing cash and investment balances declined $275 million from the prior quarter, while the average yield on the combined cash and investment balances increased 46 basis points due to a lower mix of overnight funds and higher yields on both the securities portfolio and overnight funds, driven by higher rates -- higher market rates. Total noninterest expense increased $858,000 from the prior quarter, primarily due to higher compensation costs, professional fees and fraud losses, while Banner Forward implementation costs declined $900,000 to $1.6 million in the current quarter. Compensation expense increased by $1.3 million due to increases in salaries due to annual merit increases, along with increased production-related commission and bonus expense, partially offset by a decline in severance expense from the prior quarter. Check team-related fraud losses increased $1 million, reflected in the payment and card processing expense line item while professional services increased due to a combination of volume-driven outside contract client servicing activity and various legal expense items from the prior quarter related to lending, governance and settlement activities."
