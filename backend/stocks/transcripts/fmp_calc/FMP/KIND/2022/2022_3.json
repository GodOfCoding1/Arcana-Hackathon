    "content": " This strong growth was driven primarily by U.S. neighbors with over 1 million net new WAU added quarter-over-quarter, and 90% of new neighbors to the platform came organically in Q3. The message was clear all this year that you were staying in investment mode irrespective of what happened on sort of the revenue environment, how should we be thinking about lapping the investments that we're seeing this year and elements of yield or output on those investments, especially around bottom of the funnel advertising and platform growth that could cause leverage in the operating model in '23. It's a big push to bring new logos onto the platform, and this helps to drive demand where we're seeing some headwind in spend per advertiser, which I think was the second part of that first question is."
