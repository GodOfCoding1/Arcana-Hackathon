But we know that when ads are great content, and this is very particular to Nextdoor because we are a high-utility platform, so seeing an ad for the plumber or seeing an ad for the class at Home Depot about gardening at the moment in time when you're actually thinking about it or maybe going to ask neighbors for recommendations, those are really high-engagement, high-quality content. And for both of those reasons, it's incredibly important right now that the Nextdoor shows off the fact that we are a proprietary ad platform, our users are logged in, and we actually have a lot of our own first-party data to be able to help advertisers target and so on."
