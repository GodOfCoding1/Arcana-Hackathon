    "content": " Moving forward to Slide 14, a good quarter on the deposit front with growth of $230 million and a 20% CAGR since the beginning of 2020. I mean I think when you think about deposit betas for Veritex or any other high-growth bank with a higher loan-to-deposit ratio, especially if they're heavily floating rate, deposit betas just don't have the same impact. I don't have the actual reports in front of me from 2Q, but I did look at the Q3 reports last night and it's got Fed funds speaking at $4.5 million, which seems kind of low to me, but that's where the curve was at the end of the quarter. But I'm not -- I don't lose any sleep but we're having a fee number in 2023, that's going to be below $50 million. I mean I think you will see us use wholesale broker, those type things, FHLB, maybe for -- as you think about the rest of Q4, even going into '23, our goal is not to let that type of funding broker or wholesale get above 20% of incremental funding. As it relates to -- on the investment portfolio, don't expect us to be adding to that, and it's going to spin off maybe about $75 million, something -- a little bit higher between $75 million and $100 million next year in cash flows coming off the portfolio."
