    "content": " For the quarter, within our installation segment, we experienced a 35% increase in residential same-branch sales from the prior year period, which was driven by a 35% increase in single-family same-branch sales and a 33% increase in multifamily same branch revenue. During the 2022 third quarter, we acquired an Orlando, Florida-based installer of spray foam and fiberglass insulation to residential, multifamily and commercial customers with annual revenue of approximately $2.4 million. From a segment standpoint, installation revenue increased 34% to $673 million, driven by strong growth across IBP's residential new construction market. During the third quarter of 2022, the acquisition of new businesses increased our recorded amortization expense to $11 million compared to $9 million for the same period last year. Adjusted EBITDA as a percent of net revenue was 16.7% for the 2022 third quarter, a 140 basis improvement from the same period last year. And we would not -- well, I guess I should back up and say the price/mix growth that we've experienced this year and particularly in the back -- the second quarter and the third quarter, we're coming next year into very tough comps."
