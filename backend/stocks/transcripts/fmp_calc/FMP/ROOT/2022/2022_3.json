    "content": " For a more detailed description of our risk factors, please review our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021, where you will see a discussion of factors that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from these statements as well as our shareholder letter and third quarter 2022 Form 10-Q released last evening. And we plan to -- with the rate actions we're taking, the loss ratio improvements and things we're doing on fees, expense reductions we've taken as well as other things we're doing with the business, we do expect the cash burn to be significantly lower next year. So when we think about where we are today, again, when we look at the current loss levels and the current level of where we're seeing severities come in and frequencies come in, we do believe, given our on-level loss ratio being in the low 60s, that we are broadly rate adequate across many markets for where loss costs are today."
