    "content": " In 2022, we significantly strengthened the foundation of the company by achieving profitable pricing levels in the majority of our markets and reducing our capital consumption by 48%, all while much of our competition continued to see rising loss ratios and deteriorating earnings. The combination of rate increases strengthened underwriting and meaningful segmentation improvements continue to drive decreases in our loss ratios quarter-over-quarter, moving us closer to our long-term target of 65%. So, as we think about those markets and we go back to your earlier question around marketing, and starting to think about growth, we can find states that have certainly lower loss ratios than other states, as well as segments within those states that are more profitable."
