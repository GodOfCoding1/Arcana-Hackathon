    "content": " We also highlighted our anticipated milestones for 2023, which include: Announcing AB-729 data from our two ongoing Phase IIa combination trials; and additional off-treatment data from our Phase Ib clinical trial. We also intend to initiate in 2023 three Phase I clinical trials with our early-stage compounds, namely: AB-101, our oral PD-L1 inhibitor; AB-161, our oral RNA destabilizer; and AB-343, our newly nominated nsp5 main protease inhibitor in development for coronavirus infection. At the end of 2022, we completed enrolment and announced preliminary data from the lead-in phase of AB-729-201, the Phase IIa clinical trial with 729 in combination with ongoing nucleoside analog therapy and short courses of interferon. The first 15 patients who reached week 16 of treatment after receiving two doses of AB-729 on day 1 and week 8, plus NUC therapy, showed a mean surface antigen decline of 1.5 logs, which is comparable to the decline observed at the same time point in our Phase Ib clinical trial. Our second Phase IIa clinical trial, AB-729-202, which is evaluating 729 NUC therapy and VTP-300 or placebo, is being expanded to include an additional arm with low-dose nivolumab, which is a PD-1 monoclonal antibody inhibitor that's approved for a number of types of cancer under the brand name Opdivo. We plan to report initial data from the Phase IIa clinical trial combining 729 NUC therapy and VTP-300 in the second half of 2023, and to dose the first patient with Nivo in the clinical trial amendment that combines AB-729 VTP-300 plus Nivo. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. And then obviously, we're looking for the same thing in our Phase IIa studies, whether or not the addition of interferon and/or VTP-300 plus or minus Nivo, results in further s-antigen reductions than 729 alone. Your line is open. Your line is open."
