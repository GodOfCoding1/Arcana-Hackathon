    "content": " Now, this morning we issued our third quarter 2022 financial results and corporate update press release, which highlights the significant progress we have made in advancing our preclinical and clinical programs in support of our mission to develop a functional cure for hepatitis B virus, and to treat COVID-19 and future corona virus outbreaks. Now, we also presented data from a preclinical study that assessed the ability of monotherapy and combination treatment with AB-101, our small-molecule oral PD-L1 inhibitor and an HBV-targeting RNAi agent to reinvigorate HBV-specific T cell activity in an HBV mouse model. Now, during the nine-months ended September 30, 2022, the company received a $40 million upfront payment from Qilu Pharmaceutical Company related to a technology transfer and license agreement for AB-729 in Greater China, $15 million of gross proceeds from Qilu's equity investment in the company, and approximately $9.2 million of net proceeds from issuance of common shares under Arbutus' \"At-the-Market\" offering program."
