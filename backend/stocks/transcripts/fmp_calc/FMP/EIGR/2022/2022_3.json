    "content": " And the regimens that were subsequently advanced into Phase 3, the composite endpoint defined as a two log decline in HDV RNA and normalization of ALT was achieved in 29% of patients receiving the all oral regimen and 63% of patients receiving the combination with Peginterferon Alpha after 24 weeks of treatment. I'll just add, Maury, that, as you know, the composite endpoint of greater than or equal to a two log decline in HDV RNA, we believe based on the Phase 2 data that we should see those kinds of reductions in viral load, irrespective of whether patients come in with high viral load or high baseline or lower baseline, whether or not the patient would ultimately get negative or become undetectable, obviously, maybe influenced by their baseline viral loads."
