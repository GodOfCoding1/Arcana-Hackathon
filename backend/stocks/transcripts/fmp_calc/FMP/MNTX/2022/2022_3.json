    "content": " Third quarter revenues, despite being a historically slow quarter due to 2 weeks of summer downtime at our European operations, was $65 million, just slightly below Q2 sales and representing a 27% year-over-year increase. Revenue for the third quarter was $65 million, an increase of $14.1 million or 27.7% versus the prior year period. Adjusting for these and other onetime items, our non-GAAP adjusted operating expenses were $9.8 million or 15.1% of sales compared to $7.6 million or 14.8% in the last year's similar period. Adjusted net income was $1 million or $0.05 per share compared to a loss of $219,000 or $0.01 per share last year. Net debt at the end of the quarter was $85.6 million, up from the prior period due to rental fleet acquisitions related to the Rabern expansion and funding of material orders to meet our current demand. As it pertains to our financial goals, Slide 8 indicates how close we are to reaching our milestones with $300 million in sales and 10% adjusted EBITDA margins. And this is just a status check, but we are closing in on $300 million in sales and presently operating at an annualized adjusted EBITDA run rate of $21 million."
