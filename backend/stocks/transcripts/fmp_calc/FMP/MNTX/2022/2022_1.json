    "content": " First quarter sales were up 28% year-over-year, and we closed the quarter with a growing backlog valued at $206 million. The improvement, which was also up sequentially from $53.4 million in the fourth quarter, was driven mainly by sales of larger tonnage cranes in the Manitex business and aerial platforms in the Oil & Steel business. The net income for the quarter was driven by higher sales of straight mast cranes in the Manitex business and aerial platforms from the Oil & Steel business and were impacted by material cost increases, which continue to rise and put pressure on our operating margins despite price increases that we were able to implement."
