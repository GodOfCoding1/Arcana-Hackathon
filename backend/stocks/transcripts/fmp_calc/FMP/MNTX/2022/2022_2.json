    "content": " The second quarter was highlighted by continued gains in both our sales and our backlog, the company's adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of sales also improved meaningfully during the quarter. Second quarter consolidated sales were up 16% year-over-year, and our second quarter backlog closed at a record $214 million. Improvement, which was also up sequentially from $60.4 million in the first quarter was driven mainly by revenue from Rabern Rentals and an increase in sales of our straight mast cranes in the United States. Adjusted EBITDA increased to $5.2 million or 7.4% of sales for the second quarter of '22 versus adjusted EBITDA of $4.2 million or 7.1% of sales in the second quarter last year, and also represents sequential improvement of 290 basis points from Q1 of '22."
