    "content": " This quarter's decline was driven by one, the New York Banking Teams, which put down $2.4 billion, which included -- that included $1.3 billion decline in 1031 transaction balances. On the digital front, despite the significant decline in the value of crypto currencies and the latest digital winter it's quarter, our deposits were only down $2.4 billion, which includes the movement of $1.5 billion to off balance sheet treasuries. With our continued emphasis on cash deployment and higher prevailing market interest rates, our net interest income reached $649 million for the second quarter, an increase of $76 million or 13% in the 2022 first quarter and an increase of $192 million or 42% from the 2021 second quarter. The $38 million or 22% increase was principally due to the addition of new private client banking teams, national banking practices and operational personnel, as well as consulting and professional fees related to various new projects, which we've initiated to support the growing needs of our clients. And if they go to 10%, not even having to be 100, you go to 10%, that's an extra $2 billion -- $2.3 billion in deposits. I think, I've said many times over the last few years -- not the last few years, since the beginning, that if our expenses went up to 30% and they were all based on -- we brought on a significant number of teams, we would have no problem doing that because the revenue follows quickly and it's opportunistic."
