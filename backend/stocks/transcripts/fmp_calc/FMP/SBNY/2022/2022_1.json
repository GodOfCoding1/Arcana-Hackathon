    "content": " I think you\u2019d need to see meaningfully larger moves by the Fed and much higher rates before we\u2019d really see the demand fall off in that space, and we continue to have the opportunity to take significant market share there and we anticipate it will be a strong area of growth for us moving forward. Just given that you\u2019re one of the most asset-sensitive banks amongst peers and with rates moving up, I think you said expense growth was likely to be in the mid-teens, but given that you\u2019re already at a 32% expense ratio, if I model that out, it seems that if you continue at this loan growth pace and the asset sensitivity comes through, your expense ratio will be comfortably sub-30%. No, I mean, everything is in--you mentioned teens of expense growth guidance, 16% is what we\u2019re forecasting, and certainly the asset sensitivity that we have is providing a significant amount of operating leverage and will continue to as rates continue to increase, so there\u2019s nothing missing in that, no one-time expenses. The $3 billion in deposits that we had grow this quarter, we\u2019ve been in business now about 84 quarters and this was the eighth highest of the 84 quarters, so it\u2019s not anything that we would take lightly. I think $3 billion is a very good quarter, and I think everyone, including us, got used to the $10 billion a quarter during 2021, and we don\u2019t expect that to happen. We\u2019ve seen that in the past, where we used to earn $3.25 million a quarter in fees on the off-balance sheet money markets."
