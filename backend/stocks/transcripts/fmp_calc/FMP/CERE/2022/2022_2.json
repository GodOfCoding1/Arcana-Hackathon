    "content": " At Cerevel, it's our aspiration to become the leader in neuroscience company and we are certainly well on our way of achieving this distinction with a broad and deep pipeline of new programs, compelling early data in schizophrenia, which has led us to initiate a potentially pivotal large Phase II program for emraclidine, 5 new data readouts expected next year and a robust set of mid to late-stage programs that have the potential to bring transformative medicines to millions of people living with schizophrenia, Parkinson's, epilepsy and dementia-related apathy. For our mid to late-stage programs, as we mentioned, we expect a remarkable size data readouts before the end of next year, 3 Phase III readouts for tavapadon in Parkinson's disease, a Phase II readout in darigabat for focal epilepsy and a Phase II readout for CVL-871, in the novel indication of dementia-related apathy. Your line is now open. Operator, we'll take the next question. Your line is now open. When we step back and we look at tavapadon, we see a novel mechanism of action that we think can offer a lot of benefit to patients, but also a very robust data package that really supports, as Ray said, tavapadon potentially being a backbone of therapy across the spectrum of Parkinson's disease. Your line is now open. Operator, we'll take the next question. Your line is now open. Operator, we'll take the next question. Your line is now open."
