    "content": " And in the second half of 2023, we expect data from our two tavapadon Phase 3 trials in early-stage Parkinson's, which would complete what we expect is needed for the registrational package for that drug. We expect to follow this important set of milestones with data from our two recently announced Phase 2 trials of emraclidine, with data results in schizophrenia in the first half of 2024. Also, working very closely with the clinical group, what we've really carefully considered is the fact that when you look at the potential for a new mechanism in treating psychosis and you look at the current treatments that are used and you'd start to think about various indications you can pursue, I think that there's some indications that are very obvious for a PAM. And so when you think about the potential of this mechanism, being one that doesn't -- hasn't required titration today with emraclidine, and you're thinking about clinical practice and even how typicals and atypicals are used at higher doses in certain populations and knowing what we've characterized preclinically in our models, we believe that there is a real opportunity to expand on indications with a full agonist."
