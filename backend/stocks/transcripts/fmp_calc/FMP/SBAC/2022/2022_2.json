    "content": " Foreign exchange rates were largely in line with our previously forecasted FX rate estimates for the quarter, but we're a tailwind on comparisons to the second quarter of 2021, positively impacting revenues by $3.4 million on a year-over-year basis. Domestic same-tower recurring cash leasing revenue growth over the second quarter of last year was 7.1% on a gross basis and 4.1% on a net basis, including 3% of churn. Based on this backlog, our strong second quarter and the continuing high activity levels by our customers, we have raised our outlook for full year site development revenue by $40 million. During the second quarter, we continue to expand our portfolio acquiring 210 communication sites and one data center in Brazil, which we previously disclosed with our first quarter results for total cash consideration of $127.3 million. We anticipate closing on this acquisition during the fourth quarter of this year and expect these assets to produce approximately $68 million of tower cash flow during the first full year following closing, based on our current estimates of future exchange rates. In addition, during the second quarter, we declared and paid a cash dividend of $76.6 million or $0.71 cents per share and today we announced that our board of directors declared a third quarter dividend of $0.71 a share an increase of 22.4% over the third quarter of last year."
