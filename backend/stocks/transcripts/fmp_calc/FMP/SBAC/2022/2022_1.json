    "content": " Same-tower recurring cash leasing revenue growth for the first quarter, which is calculated on a constant currency basis, was 4.3% over the first quarter of 2021, including the impact of 3.1% of churn. Domestic same-tower recurring cash leasing revenue growth over the first quarter of last year was 6.4% on a gross basis and 3.7% on a net basis, including 2.7% of churn. This increase is due to several factors, including lower domestic churn impact during 2022 as a result of longer decommissioning cycles as compared to SBA's initial estimates, higher international CPI-based escalators, higher reimbursable and miscellaneous onetime revenue items and contributions from acquisitions completed during and after the quarter, all of which was partially offset by increased churn in Panama. In addition to the leasing benefits I just mentioned, we also raised the midpoint of our services revenue outlook by $27 million or over 13% due to our very strong first quarter results and the continuing strength of our backlogs. In terms of your comment about them being behind by six-- I mean maybe that's their own internal goals and projections, but I would repeat what we've said now for, I think, the better part of the year, which is they're very active, actually busier with us than we thought they would be for a rolling 12-month period. Then secondly, following up on Walt's question, it looks like you had about $12.6 million in U.S. organic growth this quarter on that 6.4%. So really, it's kind of the balance of those two which will ultimately drive where we set the dividend going forward, but I think you would agree at 25 -- less than a 25% payout ratio, we have a lot of room to increase the dividend materially in the years ahead."
