    "content": " EBITDA margin for the Critical Illness Rehab -- Recovery Hospitals was 6% for Q1, compared to 19% in the prior year. The salary wages and benefit revenue ratio for critical illness increased 18% from prior year Q1, but improved by 2% from Q4 2021. The overall salary wage and benefit to revenue ratio for the inpatient rehab hospitals increased by 8% from prior year Q1, but improved by 1% from Q4 2021. Turning now to Concentra, Concentra had an exceptional quarter, experienced a slight increase in net revenue from Q1, while EBITDA increased significantly by $7.5 million. In the first quarter, the outpatient division experienced a 1.5% increase in salary wages and benefits to revenue ratio compared to the prior year Q1, but improved by 1% from Q4 2021. On the critical illness side, I think what you're seeing is something that we talked about a couple quarters ago, when -- through the pandemic, I think there was an increasing recognition of the value that long-term acute care hospitals or our critical illness recovery hospitals play in the continuum of care of decompressing ICUs."
