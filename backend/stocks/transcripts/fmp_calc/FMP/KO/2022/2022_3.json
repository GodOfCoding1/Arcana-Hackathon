    "content": " Our focus and our confidence in our year-to-go and going into next year is about the momentum we've created in our business over the years and our ability to not just to continue with marketing and innovation, but to leverage all the thinking behind revenue growth management and the price pack promo architectures to maximize affordability, and therefore, accessibility of our categories for those consumers that are under pressure. In the sense that we are going to continue, we believe, barring something very unforeseen or at this stage, we believe we're going to continue to invest for the long-term health of the business and that's going to drive top line growth, as it has. And obviously, that's getting really material, including strong double-digit growth in the U.S. Of course, we continue to bring new marketing and new innovation to Coke Zero Sugar and it's going to be a big focus of what we drive going forward. And just to maybe to reiterate, the difference, I think, between the long-term growth algorithm and what may be coming at us over the next year or so, I think it's going to be somewhat out of algorithm, given the various factors that we have discussed on the call and indeed have discussed throughout the year."
