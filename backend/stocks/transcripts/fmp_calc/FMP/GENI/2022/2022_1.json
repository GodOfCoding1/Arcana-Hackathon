    "content": " Unlike B2C, sportsbook's operating partners who have to invest heavily to acquire customers and win market share in new states, Genius ' business model benefits from economies of scale. Particularly, as we expect to be adjusted EBITDA positive through remainder of the year, and to generate closer to the cash flows by the second half of 2023. view that especially as you think that as operators appear to be pulling back in terms of how much that they're spending, how long you can keep that 25% discount  you consider in terms of being able to continue to grow that business substantially but then also deliver the below average CPAs. So the marketing that Genius offers to our customers is very performance-driven, so it's not something that you'll ever see them really cutting back on because it's directly attributable to their new customers sign-ups and player value and things like that. Look, New York coming online it's hugely beneficial to us in two ways, through the spend that we put through the Media Business, and obviously the date that we're setting to the sportsbook. If any effect comes through this in the next period, what we will see is we will see great opportunities not only to bag more marketing spend to help that guard acquired new customers, but also, we will be selling that data on new states, which will give back to new betting handle, which fundamentally we benefit from. So that's opportunities across the Betting Business, but also across the  revenues  like sometimes what they're able to do from an app  point of view will impact the size of the State and it's not a huge amount we can do about that on a macro level."
