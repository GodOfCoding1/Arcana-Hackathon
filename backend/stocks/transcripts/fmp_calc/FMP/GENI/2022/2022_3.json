    "content": " On today's call, I will discuss key business highlights from the quarter, which include new customer wins across sports, betting and media, an update on our U.S. betting performance and an overview on key technology services we've delivered to the NFL and its partners. You may recall in our last quarterly report, we outlined the operating leverage in the business and the multiple ways Genius generates EBITDA margin accretion alongside growth in betting revenues. Again, each of these factors have contributed to the growth of our U.S. betting business, which helped propel our overall U.S. revenues by more than 70% year on year in the third quarter, including specifically U.S. betting, which has far outpaced a broader U.S. market growth in September 2022 compared to September 2021. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open."
