    "content": " Given our revenue growth and predominantly fixed cost base, we expect to nearly triple our growth EBITDA from $16 million in 2022 to $41 million in 2023 and generate positive free cash flow in the second half of the year. Looking ahead, our execution in 2022 and strong tailwind entering the New Year gives us confidence in our guidance of $391 million in revenue, and $41 million in adjusted EBITDA in 2023. Given our relatively fixed cost base, which does not need to grow nearly in line with revenues, this resulted in group adjusted EBITDA of $3 million in the quarter marking is significant improvement from Q4 of 2021 up $15 million year-on-year. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Second half year, obviously with growth in revenues and EBITDA in the second half year, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll see that free cash flow, start generating an H2 and then obviously, beyond a cash flow positive in 2024 as a year, and so on and so forth. Your line is open."
