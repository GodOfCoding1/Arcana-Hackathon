    "content": " So as we head into Q3 and Q4, we're looking at pricing in all these markets and saying that's probably -- there's some stability there at the moment and sort of forecasting that prices will remain in and around these levels into the balance of 2022. I mean, that's not true necessarily for India and China with those very low in-country inventories will it be compelled to negotiate a contract sooner rather than later in 2022, that could be possible but for the for the spot markets, like I said, we're sort of forecasting in and around these levels for the balance of the year.
