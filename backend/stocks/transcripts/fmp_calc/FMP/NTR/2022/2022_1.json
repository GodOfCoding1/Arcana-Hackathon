    "content": " I think in terms of overall supply-demand impact, certainly, there's a really large potential for supply constraints in 2022 just given, as Ken mentioned, the restrictions on Belarusian shipments to tidewater and all of different sanctions impacting Russian production. But it goes back to just us assessing the duration of this impact and what it will actually impact on the market in terms of trade patterns, and ultimately, restrictions potentially to certain parts of the world, and we know that's going to happen this year, hence, our 60 million to 65 million ton guidance range where we expect there will be demand rationing, much different than demand disruption, but demand rationing. Exports coming out of Russia, and while unlike the Belarusians perhaps, the Russians do have some access to markets, and so, an example of that would be rail into China, which we expect to continue through 2022, and that could be over the course of the year maybe a 1.5 million tonne. So looking forward at 1.5 million tonnes to 2 million tonnes per year, you're moving out to sort of 74 million tonne, 75 million tonne mark in the next four to five years, which I think regardless of what scenario unfolds, it's likely to continue to be a supply-constrained environment in that period of time. We've looked at a number of scenarios and different ramp-ups and different changes over the next four to five years, and in most cases, you're getting back to the current trend type levels of demand in 24, 25 just given supply constraints in the market."
