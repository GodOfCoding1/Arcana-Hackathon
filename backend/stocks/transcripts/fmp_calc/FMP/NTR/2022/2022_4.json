    "content": " So we would agree with you that if we look at the unconstrained demand that we would see on the planet, given this very strong backdrop that we see with the Ag fundamentals and certainly, the way farmer affordability has improved with the softening of price, that on an unconstrained basis, we would be at 70 million tons. So that if we look at 2023 and we look at inventory levels around some of these major markets, certainly, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen destocking in North America and Brazil, but we are watching inventory levels in China, which would be about 2.3 million tons today, so certainly, getting below historical averages and in India, for example, where for all intense inventory levels are low. So a question on potash demand and really outside of North America and really thinking in the different parts of Asia and the view you have on channel inventories in the key importing regions of Southeast Asia, in China, in India that would inform kind of importer behavior that seems to be kind of mirroring the kind of slowness intensiveness that you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re seeing or have seen in the U.S. and Brazil?"
