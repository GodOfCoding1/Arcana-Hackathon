Joining us today are the company's Chairman and CEO, Tony McDonald, as well as company's CFO, Ian Patel. These statements reflect CEA Industries' current beliefs and a number of important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in this call, including the risk factors set forth in the company's Form 10-K, which was filed with the SEC. Also, please note that the company filed its 10-K and issued a press release announcing fourth quarter results -- full year results earlier today. If you would like to be added to the company's e-mail distribution list, please send an e-mail to info@ceaindustries.com. As we have seen across many industries, volatility in the macro environment has persisted, affecting both operators and consumers over the past year. As a result, capital expenditures in the sector have slowed significantly, resulting in delayed reduced or eliminated cultivation facility construction projects, which has negatively impacted our project bookings and revenue. To navigate this environment, we have continued to focus on diversifying our customer base outside of cannabis, while proactively implementing cost saving initiatives to mitigate future supply chain and inflationary pressure on our business. A great example of our higher standard was reflected by a new contract win that we announced in November, in which we signed our third consecutive contract with a Northeast cultivation facility. Earlier in the year, we performed a mechanical engineering services for this 36,000 square foot cultivation and processing space, followed by a benching equipment and installation contract. Due to our exceptional work in the prior engagement, we have now been contracted to provide HVACD equipment for their flower veg mother clone and dry cure rooms, as well as cannabis processing rooms. Earlier in 2022, we announced a formal partnership with Merida Capital, a cannabis focused private equity firm, in which Merida agreed to use us as its sole provider of certain products and services for its indoor cultivation facilities. Since signing the agreement, we have signed two engineering contracts and one equipment contract with one of Merida's Connecticut-based clients to provide engineering and a suite of HVAC systems. As highlighted in our last conference call, in November, we entered into a non-equity strategic alliance with Hydrobuilder Holdings, a leading omni-channel platform with 22 retail locations and 10 warehouses, serving the indoor and outdoor CEA and hydroponics industry. Not only does this offer a financial benefit to the company, but an environmentally sustainable solution for water conservation, which is top of mind for many organizations that monitor their impact on the environment. Jumping right into our results, Q4 revenue was $1.5 million compared to $3.1 million in the year ago period. Our net bookings in the fourth quarter were $206,000 compared to $4 million in the same period in 2021. Gross profit for the fourth quarter of 2022 was $200,000 or 10.3% of revenue compared to $600,000 or 18.1% of revenue for the same period in 2021. The decrease in gross margin was primarily driven by lower revenue and higher variable costs, which includes the cost of equipment, external engineering, shipping and handling and travel and warranty costs. It's worth noting that our OpEx is also down 13% from Q3 2022, reflecting the early benefit of our various cost saving initiatives. Net loss for the fourth quarter of 2022 was $1.3 million, or negative $0.18 per share, compared to a net loss of $400,000 or negative $0.25 per share in the year ago quarter. As of December 31, 2022, cash and cash equivalents were $18.6 million compared to $2.2 million as of December 31, 2021. While working capital increased by $15.1 million during this period, the increase was primarily driven by net proceeds from the sale of our common stock and warrants of approximately $22 million in February 2022. Looking ahead, we will remain cautious with our spending and capital as we evaluate the lingering supply chain and inflationary environment. Our cost saving initiatives have already begun to produce benefits and between our efforts to further reduce expenses and diversify our customer base, we are confident in our ability to navigate this challenging period. As cannabis companies increasingly focused on their core operations, and turning cash flow positive, many have dialed back their CapEx plans which of course impacts our ability to book and forecast revenue in the future. In February, you announced a set of cost cut saving initiatives and a reduction in force to help right size the business given the challenging macro environment. As it stands today, we have ample runway to see through the current market environment with approximately $90 million of cash and equivalents on the balance sheet. An audio replay of this call will be available on ceandustries.com/investors beginning on March 28 at 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time, and will remain available until April 11, 2023."
