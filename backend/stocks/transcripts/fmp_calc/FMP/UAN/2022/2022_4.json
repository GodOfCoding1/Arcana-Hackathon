    "content": " The summarized financial highlights for the fourth quarter of 2022 included net sales of $212 million, net income of $95 million, EBITDA of $122 million and the Board of Directors declared a fourth quarter distribution of $10.50 per common unit, which will be paid on March 13, 2023 to unitholders of record at the close of the market on March 6th. For the fourth quarter of 2022, we reported net sales of $212 million and operating income of $102 million. Excluding inventory and turnaround impacts, direct operating expenses increased by approximately $4 million from the fourth quarter of 2021, primarily related to higher electricity and natural gas costs, and increased repair and maintenance expenses, offset somewhat by lower personnel costs. Capital spending for the fourth quarter was $2 million, which was primarily maintenance capital and full year 2022 capital spending was $41 million. On 45Q tax credits for the Coffeyville facility we completed the transaction with tax equity investors on January 6th and received initial net cash proceeds of approximately $18 million, which would potentially add to cash available for distribution for the first quarter of 2023."
