    "content": " As the year continues, we are focused on further establishing PYLARIFY as a PSMA PET imaging agent of choice in the USA prostate cancer community, maintaining market leadership with our Microbubble franchise, executing strategic transactions in line with our portfolio objectives, and delivering on our financial objectives which we believe best enhance shareholder value. And good morning, everyone. During the first quarter, our commercial teams continued to execute on our strategy, namely to establish PYLARIFY as the PSMA PET imaging agent of choice in the US prostate cancer community, maintain market leadership with our Microbubble franchise and deliver on our financial objectives. And good morning, everyone. TechneLite net revenue was $22.6 million, down 0.9% from the prior-year quarter due primarily to the exited contract mid last year with an approximate $2.5 million per quarter impact, offset in part by opportunistic sales in the quarter. This updated range includes not only recognized revenue from Novartis of $24 million recorded in the first quarter, but also the continued adoption of PYLARIFY, which we now model at $385 million to $420 million for the full year. I think when combined with our market access progress, where 90% of covered lives have access to PYLARIFY, we remain focused on continuing to add new customers and we do that on a regular basis, but ensuring that we also increase the breadth and depth of the penetration going forward. Just on the guidance, and not to split hairs, because, obviously, great outlook and all, but just on the Q2 guidance, specifically, if we just compare sequentially, if you sort of strip out the strategic $24 million that you mentioned from Novartis, you kind of did like $180 million \u2013 I think $184 million you said."
