Before we begin, I would like to direct your attention to the forward-looking statements disclaimer contained in today's press release. In summary, it outlines that statements in the press release and on this conference call that state the partnership's or management's expectations or predictions of the future are forward-looking statements intended to be covered by the safe harbor provisions under federal securities laws. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on today's call. We are on pace to exceed the partnership's full year 2022 revenue guidance of approximately $320 million to $340 million. Today, the partnership also announced a distribution of $0.30 per unit. The process is ongoing, and we may review the partnership and PBF Energy's filings with the SEC for additional information. Adjusted partnership EBITDA was $54.6 million, which includes approximately $800,000 of noncash unit-based compensation and environmental remediation costs associated with the East Coast Terminals. During the third quarter, we spent approximately $1.5 million in total CapEx, including approximately $1.3 million for maintenance. For the full year 2022, we currently expect capital expenditures to be approximately $10 million, including $8 million for maintenance and $2 million of regulatory spend. Consistent with our commentary on the PBF Energy earnings call this morning, our near-term efforts are focused on continuing to strengthen the financial position of the partnership. If indeed, this is our last earnings call as we suspect, I greatly appreciate everyone's support and interest to date."
