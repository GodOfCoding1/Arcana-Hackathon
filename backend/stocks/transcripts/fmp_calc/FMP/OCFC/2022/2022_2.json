    "content": " In keeping with normal seasonal trends, the Bank has experienced net deposit growth of $145 million since June 30. Credit trends remained benign with the company realizing just $9,000 of net charge-offs for the quarter and net recoveries of $83,000 year-to-date. Obviously, it looks like loan yields of the pipeline are up over 100 basis points year-over-year, but the addition of the brokered deposits maybe the \u00e2\u0080\u009casset sensitivity\u00e2\u0080\u009d over the near term and it plays out maybe at the tail end of the current cycle if we get like $350 million by next year. Visibility, going out more -- a little bit more than a quarter has become a little bit more murky just because you just don't know where clients are going to fall out, but I made a comment earlier this morning that we had 3% 10-year rates just four years ago. Thank you, Mr. Bishop. Thank you, Mr. Navas. Thank you, Mr. Bishop. Thank you, Mr. Navas."
