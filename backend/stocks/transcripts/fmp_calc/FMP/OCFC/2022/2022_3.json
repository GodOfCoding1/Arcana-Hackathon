    "content": " So what we're going to do is work through as you can imagine the next few weeks, the outcome on the Partners transaction, and then I think that would give us the opportunity to come back to you and our other investors and kind of share what we think the target should be going forward. So I think we're going to be opportunistic, and we're watching like everybody else to see where we think kind of the terminal rate might come out, what the outlook might be in the back half of next year so that we don't structure funding the cost as too much down the road. So look, I think what you saw from this quarter was kind of a mid-single digit expansion is a decent run rate that we should expect, as long as you see rates continuing to rise, it's not going to be linear, some quarters, it might be closer to flat, some quarters, it might be closer to 10 basis points. And what I think is going to happen with deposit competition and pricing, both of which could kind of materially changes, but pretty comfortable, you'll continue to see expansion and growth in NII until rates start to come down. So I think you've got a couple of different causes here in a quarter where you're doing more transactions, you could have a little bit of a benefit in both Trident and in swap fees. And when I think back about the opportunity, we had to grow through tactical acquisitions over the last few years, I think it's very valuable thing for us in building a platform that I think we're going to be able to do a lot with."
