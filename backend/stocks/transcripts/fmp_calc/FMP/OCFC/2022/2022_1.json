I think we've got it somewhere in the range of the $250 million a quarter in net organic loan growth, but to be fair, I think there's definitely the opportunity to outperform. So I think we have two loans that might have a floor rather than that the entire portfolios through the floors, which means, we're equating to for each 25 basis point movement by the Fed, you have the opportunity to expand margins somewhere in the range of 5 basis points could be a little more, little less depending on the quarter."
