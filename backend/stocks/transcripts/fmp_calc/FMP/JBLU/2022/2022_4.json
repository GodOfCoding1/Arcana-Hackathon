    "content": " Looking further ahead, we are excited to continue building on last year's record performance as we expect another strong year of revenue growth ahead of us, underpinned by robust leisure demand and multiple network and commercial initiatives. And also in the last year or two, we've seen a lot of willingness from corporate customers as well to participate in some of the additional cost of buying SAF, which is again, making it easier for the airlines to commit and corporate to also continue traveling. So what you're seeing from JetBlue is just year-over-year GDP combined with the JetBlue-specific revenue initiatives, continued contribution from the NEA, ramp-up of loyalty around JetBlue Travel Products. Robin, on the Spirit, I get a lot of questions from arbs who don't understand why you are planning for a first quarter or first half 2024 close, when it seems perfectly obvious to me that it would be in the second half -- first half of next year versus second half of this year."
