Consolidated total revenue for the fourth quarter of 2022 was $409.3 million, an increase of 3.7%, compared to $394.8 million in the prior year period. Net loss attributable to common and participating preferred stockholders for the fourth quarter of 2022 was $7 million or $0.09 per share, compared to a net loss of $5.2 million or $0.07 per share in the prior year period. Total adjusted EBITDA, which excludes discontinued operations was $28.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2022, an increase from an adjusted EBITDA of $22.1 million in the prior year period. DBMG ended the quarter with $243 million of debt, which is an increase of $54.4 million from year end 2021, driven by working capital movements resulting from topline business growth. Non-operating corporate adjusted EBITDA losses were $3.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2022, down from the fourth quarter of 2021 by $800,000, driven mostly by a decrease in bonus expense, which was partially offset by an increase in professional fees. As of December 31, 2022, INNOVATE had total principal outstanding indebtedness of $725.3 million, up $94.5 million from $630.8 million at the end of 2021, driven primarily by Infrastructure\u00e2\u0080\u0099s increase in its credit line as a result of working capital movements, Spectrum\u00e2\u0080\u0099s refinancing, corporate\u00e2\u0080\u0099s utilization of the remaining credit line in the third quarter and R2\u00e2\u0080\u0099s borrowing from Lancer Capital."
