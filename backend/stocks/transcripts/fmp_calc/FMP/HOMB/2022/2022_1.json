    "content": " Starting with just over $300 million in assets, we're in our eighth year at Centennial, reporting loans outstanding of just over $2.1 billion on $3.4 billion of commitment. Total deposits continued decline in the first quarter, with growth of $320 million or 9% on an annualized basis, and over $1 billion in growth year-over-year, or approximately 8% on an annualized basis. We've only been with them now for 20 days, gotten well over the last nine months and it's pretty exciting to see what avenues they're going to open up, and we're still looking down several avenues that they can do, and I really do think once that time we'll take care of some of that with our existing customer base, the communications going well there. Well for every a 100 basis points that we have that goes up on the Fed funds, that's about $35 million, and that would be in the range of about well over 20 basis points to the margin. So I mean, I guess following up on some of Brett's question, but I mean, you kind of noted, hey, we've got this $4 billion in money to deploy maybe over the next 18 months, 24 months, $2 billion in loans, $2 billion in securities, give or take. We  clean will probably\n It's been interesting watching that process I=as Stephen\u2019s kept me up to date, I want to -- going step by step with the Happy people and there's some significant savings that we're starting to see some of that or we've captured some or we'd actually put it on the books yet, but it looks pretty high right now."
