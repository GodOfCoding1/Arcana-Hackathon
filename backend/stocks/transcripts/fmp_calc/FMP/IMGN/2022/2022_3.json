    "content": " Looking to the market opportunity, our estimate of the eligible patient population is based on data from DRG, which indicate that there are 19,500 drug-treatable second to fourth line platinum-resistant ovarian cancer patients in the U.S. each year. We will also seek NCCN compendium listing for the mirv-bev combination immediately after approval, which would add another 1,800 FR alpha high patients, giving us a total market opportunity of 7,000 patients in the platinum-resistant setting. As we will discuss later in the call, we have also initiated studies to move into recurrent platinum-sensitive disease, which would bring the total U.S. market opportunity for mirv in recurrent ovarian cancer to above 11,000 patients. Given the totality of the data generated, and in particular, the strength of the pivotal SORAYA data, we believe mirv has the potential to displace single-agent chemotherapy as a new standard of care for patients with folate receptor alpha positive, platinum-resistant ovarian cancer. In an initial analysis of data from our ongoing Phase CADENZA trial in frontline BPDCN patients, we were very encouraged with the activity seen in both de novo patients and BPDCN patients with a prior or concomitant hematologic malignancy, with 11 of 13 or roughly 85% of patients achieving a form of complete response. So yes, you should anticipate seeing not just more relapsed/refractory patient data than is in the abstract that you should also anticipate seeing, I would say, a small but meaningful group of frontline AML patients who have received our triplet."
