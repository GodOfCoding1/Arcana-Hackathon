    "content": " Now, we've been working on DNA vaccines since the early days of the pandemic and have generated much valuable data, our data supporting the efficacy of LinearDNA vaccines in mice, ferrets and felines are robust, and show that LinearDNA vaccines invoke a powerful new moral response with high antibody titers and a cellular immune response that often exceeds plasmid DNA. We are planning to use phase 2 of the trial to evaluate lipid nanoparticle mediated intramuscular delivery of LinearDNA vaccines Are cell bio suite, an investment made in fiscal 2021 recently concluded in vitro studies that prove the LNP encapsulated LinearDNA manufactured by Applied DNA can transfect and express the desired protein. Based on these promising data and the results of the Phase 1 trial, we intend to initiate a bridging study in mice in the next few weeks that, if successful, will itself provoke initiation of a Phase 2 ferret trial in which LNP LinearDNA COVID-19 vaccine will be administered to ferrets via intramuscular injection."
