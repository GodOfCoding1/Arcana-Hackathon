    "content": " Notable in Q1's revenues were orders for research and development quantities of linearDNA by first-time biopharma customers for their mRNA development efforts, as well as a recurring commercial order from an existing biotherapeutic customer. And the plasmid DNA, which is the industry's incumbent DNA production technology, suffers from long lead times, high complexity and high capital and labor costs as it moves to scale to support the growing number of nucleic acid-based therapies under development. Given that linearDNA's relevance to nucleic acid-based therapies is so broad, we have carefully examined the market and have deliberately chosen to focus on two near-term opportunities that we believe offer the nearest term revenues and can serve as a jumping off point for applying our platform to the broader genetic medicines opportunities. Nevertheless, by using the many tools in our particular PCR toolbox, we overcame these challenges and developed a workflow that utilizes specialized PCR primers in the PCR process to achieve highly homogeneous IVT templates, thus creating a differentiated production platform with many advantages over plasmid DNA manufacturing. In addition, by providing an IVT template that is already linear inform, we estimate that our linearDNA IVT templates can eliminate about 35% of the process steps required by conventional plasmid DNA-based mRNA production workflows. Our linearDNA sits at the intersection of the expansion of nucleic acid-based therapies and the industry's movement toward enzymatic DNA manufacturing platforms that are faster, less complex to operate and less investment intensive."
