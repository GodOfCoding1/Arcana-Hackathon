    "date": "2022-06-24 10:57:02",
    "content": " In the first quarter this year, without any new user registration, solely relying on the existing users, our average DAU increased by 8.2% year-over-year with peak DAU reached 9.7 million, surpassing that for the same period of last year. Another important observation is that, for both job seekers and enterprise users in this quarter their average achievement per MAU, which is the average numbers of TAM of mutual consent on content formation exchanged with the counterparty in the first quarter increased by more than 20% year-over-year. And in terms of their margin -- sorry, their like paying ratio and ARPU, like the large enterprises their paying ratio and ARPU are also in a stable situation, so there like impact mainly due to the number -- total number of active -- smaller number of active enterprises from small medium sized segment. And also regarding the question related to the margin, so as I just mentioned in the prepared remark that first quarter due to seasonality reason it was with a lower margin in upcoming quarters we would like to see improved situation. But having said that, because of second quarter is already seeing some like impact from the COVID pandemic, so the margins improving -- they will be improving, but might not be as high as third quarter last year and fourth quarter last year."
