    "content": " For the full year 2022, our net revenues were $4.3 million, a 45% increase compared to the prior year, driven primarily by an increase in the sales of electric forklifts. For the full year 2022, our cost of revenues was $3.5 million, which was unchanged compared to 2021 despite an increase in revenues as we lowered cost significantly in our electric vehicle business. In addition to achieving faster time market and lower development costs as a result of our asset-light model, we are also achieving lower production and build materials costs compared to our Gen 3 vehicles by utilizing standardized processes and procedures, better designs for our components and sub-assemblies and a streamlined supply chain process."
