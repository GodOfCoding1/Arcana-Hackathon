    "content": " As of June 30, Easterly's net debt to total enterprise value was 40.5% and our adjusted net debt to annualized quarterly pro forma EBITDA ratio was 7.2x, with a weighted average debt maturity of 6 years, and over 88% of all outstanding debt fixed at attractive levels, I am pleased with our company's positioning as we navigate a rising rate environment. I think though that as you heard President Biden mentioned in the State of the Union address last winter that the efficiency of the federal government may be compromised by working from home and that there's been a huge backlog over the last years of COVID and that the government does do a better job in their office space, which I think is probably not a great surprise to all of us. This is not probably the time you're seeing a lot of that occurring, but I think that people do value portfolios more in that it's difficult to put some great buildings together right now, obviously."
