At present, Easterly expects to receive net proceeds of approximately 92.5 million from the sale of an aggregate of approximately 4.3 million shares of the company's common stock that have not yet been settled, including the remaining 2.3 million shares pursuant to the company's third quarter 2021 underwritten public offering, and 1.95 million shares from sales under the company's 300 million ATM program, assuming these 4 sales transactions are physically settled in full using a net-weighted average combined initial forward sales price of $21.72 per share. This guidance is predicated upon 200 million to 250 million of wholly-owned acquisitions, the closing of properties in the VA portfolio totaling, approximately 145 million at the company's pro-rata share and up to 10 million in growth-development related investment during 2022."
