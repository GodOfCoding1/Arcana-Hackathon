We've executed on the company's first portfolio disposition, which simultaneously strengthened the company's balance sheet and portfolio profile and renewed our largest 2022 lease expirations for a weighted average duration of 19.3 years, reflecting the value the government sees in these facilities and providing the company with increased certainty and duration of cash flow. As of year-end 2022, we own 86 operating properties comprising approximately 8.7 million lease square feet, either wholly owned or through our joint venture with a weighted average age of 13.8 years and a weighted average remaining lease term of 10.3 years. As a result of the interest rate swaps entered into on February 3, the company extended the maturity of its interest rate swaps from a weighted average maturity of less than six months to a weighted average maturity of over 25 months effectively extending the certainty of the company's fixed rate 2016 and 2018 term loan scheduled by more than 19 months. This guidance assumes the closing of VA - Corpus Christi, a property within the VA Portfolio at the company's pro rata share of approximately $21 million and up to $15 million of gross development related investment during 2023."
