    "content": " Brazil ended the year with a good momentum and sales were up 15% in the fourth quarter, which we're currently expecting to carry into 2023 for the direct selling business. Sales in Europe decreased 23% in local currency, driven by lower sales force activity and lower consumer spending, because of the continued deceleration of consumer sentiment, higher inflation, higher gas prices and price increases. Selling, general, and administrative expenses, SG&A, as a percentage of sales was 57% in 2022, compared with 52% in 2021, and contributing about 500 basis points increase at incremental investments in our growth initiatives, such as B2B expansion in the U.S. on the assumption of fixed cost on the lower sales and higher selling costs with a return to in-person events and meetings for the sales force. We have a plan to continue to produce EBITDA in this company and better EBITDA than the past year of 2022, plus cash generation from our working capital management, as well as our re-engineering plans that will produce benefits in the years to come as we continue to right-size this company and place Tupperware products in all the channels where consumers look for them."
