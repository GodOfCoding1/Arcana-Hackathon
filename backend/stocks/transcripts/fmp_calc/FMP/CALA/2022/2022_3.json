    "content": " Last quarter, we announced the initiations and enrollment of the first patient in our Phase II clinical trial of mivavotinib in relapsed/refractory non-GCB diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, or DLBCL, and sapanisertib in relapsed/refractory NRF2-mutated squamous non-small cell lung cancer. The study is evaluating 2 doses of sapanisertib, 2 milligrams twice daily and 3 milligrams once daily in patients with squamous non-small cell lung cancer harboring either wild type or mutated NRF2 as detected by next-generation sequencing. The projections from both the site level and our level in terms of overall activation times we're essentially progressing as planned and some several sites had sort of unexpected delays due to various reasons that, I guess, most of the common reason for is staffing issues that essentially were unpredictable and is known to be an issue that's still ongoing across the country."
