    "content": " Adjusted EBITDA, which we calculate by adding back depreciation, amortization, taxes, interest, transaction expenses, onetime items and stock based compensation to net loss, was a loss of $5.3 million in the second quarter of 2022 compared to a loss of $4 million in the second quarter of 2021. Given the strength of our recent bookings and the health of our current backlog, we expect revenue growth in the third quarter of 2022 to be in the 37% to 39% range year-over-year or approximately $7.7 million to $7.8 million."
