    "content": " Total revenue for the third quarter of 2022 was $7.9 million, representing a 40% year-over-year growth rate. As a reminder, our Google partnership expands beyond engineering collaboration, and now includes a systematized go-to-market effort, which harnesses the power of over 1,000 enterprise focused Google Cloud reps. During the third quarter, we formalized our integration into the Google Cloud Platform marketplace, allowing GCP Health System customers to allocate their GCP financial commitments towards the purchase of Augmedix services. Dollar based net revenue retention for the third quarter of 2022 was 130% for our health enterprise customers, compared to 122% in the third quarter of 2021. The quarter-on-quarter growth of gross profit, combined with the sequential decline in OpEx allowed us to reduce our quarterly operating losses by over $500,000 versus the second quarter of 2022. Adjusted EBITDA which we calculate by adding back depreciation, amortization, taxes, interest, and stock-based compensation to net loss was a loss of $4.5 million in the third quarter of 2022 compared to a loss of $3.8 million in the third quarter of 2021."
