    "content": "  Operator: Hello and welcome to the Augmedix, Inc. 2022 First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. Please note, today\u2019s event is being recorded. Please go ahead, ma\u2019am. Thank you, and thank you all for participating in today\u2019s call. Before we begin, I\u2019d like to remind you that management will make statements during this call that include forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws, which are made pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Augmedix disclaims any intention or obligation accept as required by law to update or revise any financial projections or forward-looking statements, whether because of new information, future events or otherwise. And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Manny. For those new to the Augmedix story, we offer technology and services that reduce the medical note documentation burden for doctors and save them two to three hours a day. Feedback from our clinician customers is that our product is life-changing and brings back the joy of being a doctor again, lost after years of grinding out notes behind a keyboard. We provide two documentation solutions, both of which rely on the ambient conversation between physicians and patients; a real time synchronous solution, which we call Live, and an asynchronous solution, which we call Notes. For Health Enterprise, Augmedix doctors experience higher job satisfaction and can see more patients, which usually generates additional revenue. Additionally, Augmedix continues to benefit from healthcare organization\u2019s investment in digital solutions to improve physician workflows, enable increased capacity, and reduce costs of scale. Turning to our recent financial performance, revenue for the first quarter of 2022 was 7 million, representing a 46% year-over-year increase. During the first quarter, we again made meaningful progress on our growth initiatives by further building on our robust sales pipeline and expanding relationships with our existing enterprise customers. Our existing customers are continuing to buy at a healthy rate, as demonstrated by our high net revenue retention rate. Recall, that we are only scratching the surface of the $6 billion market opportunity, where healthcare organizations already under contract with Augmedix represent an aggregate annual revenue opportunity of over $1 billion. We land within one of these enterprise accounts, we implement our solution among an initial cohort of physicians, who we believe will be prime beneficiaries of our service based on their individual productivity metrics, and we gradually expand our footprint once we demonstrate the targeted ROI. With respect to new products, I\u2019m pleased to announce that we have completed our first ever iOS client application. This is significant, as it will enable us to address some major healthcare enterprises that do not allow Android OS within their networks. Finally, we\u2019ve completed development work on our pre-charting solution, and we\u2019ll initiate beta testing within the coming weeks. It involves extracting relevant historical information from a patient\u2019s health record, and inserting that information into the current chart or medical note prior to the current visit. We expect the initiatives we\u2019re undertaking with existing customers and the pathway we are creating for future customers, combined with the fact that we offer the broadest suite of services in our industry will ensure continued market share gains within the ever-expanding market in which we operate. With that, I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Paul Ginocchio, our Chief Financial Officer, and then we\u2019ll return with closing comments. As stated, revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2022 was 7 million, a 46% increase from the 4.8 million in the same period from a year ago and slightly better than our guidance of 6.9 million. As many of you know, net revenue retention measures what $1 of revenue at our existing clients a year ago, grew into in this most recent quarter; it includes upsells, expansion, and churn that excludes revenue from any new logos that were added during the last 12 months. Average clinicians in service in the first quarter of 2022 rose 53%, as compared to the first quarter of 2021 and the acceleration from the 49% year-on-year growth in the fourth quarter of 2021. We define a clinician in service as an individual doctor, nurse practitioner, or other healthcare professional using either our Live or Notes service. We believe growth in the number of clinicians in service is an indicator of the performance of our business, as it demonstrates our ability to penetrate the market and grow our business. Gross margin for the first quarter of 2020 was 45% as compared to 44% in the corresponding prior year period, and compares to 45% in the fourth quarter of 2021. Adjusted EBITDA, which we calculate by adding back depreciation, amortization, taxes, interest, transaction expenses, one-time items and stock-based compensation to net loss was a loss of 4.7 million in the first quarter of 2022, compared to a loss of 3.7 million in the first quarter of 2021. Just a quick comment on our recent debt refinancing, I\u2019m very pleased to have SVB , as our new lender in relationship bank. We\u2019re excited to have SVB as our bank, as they have helped so many other technology companies grow and scale. Given the strength of our bookings quarter-to-date, in the health of our backlog, we expect revenue growth in the second quarter of 2022 to be in the 41% to 43% range year-over-year, or approximately 7.3 million to 7.4 million. Recall, at scale, we have indicated that we expect Live gross margins to be in the range of 50% to 55% and Notes gross margins to be in the range of 55% to 60%. At this point, I\u2019d like to turn the call back to Manny for closing comments. I and the rest of the Board are truly excited to work with Will, as we continue to build on Augmedix\u2019s leadership position. With that, we\u2019ll now open it up to questions. So coding, we don\u2019t expect to sell separately, or as a menu item, we intend to initially at least bundle it with the existing Live service to further differentiate it from the offerings of our competitors. So that\u2019s really -- I don\u2019t see that being additive to the top line, but it will enable us to, like I said, differentiate ourselves more fully against any other companies that offer a Live service\n Got it. And I think it will probably help \u2013 Ryan, it probably also helps -- it will help us with retention as well, so both of those things will help growth. Well, it\u2019s a good question. I mean, we wouldn\u2019t have developed it if there wasn\u2019t a need for it. Two of the largest that are iOS only healthcare systems that we\u2019ve not been able to penetrate because of the Android operating system that we base our architecture on, so having iOS at least opens up the door, the possibility to being able to cater to those healthcare systems. So, hopefully, that\u2019ll prove to be useful to us as we continue to grow. But recently, a huge focus on burnout; improving productivity, as margins are getting hit; retention, given workforce turnover we\u2019re seeing in healthcare and higher wages. But we know that we\u2019re hitting a very sensitive area right now, for the healthcare industry. We\u2019re very well positioned with both solutions, both our Notes and Live solutions to saving doctors a lot of time and stress and burden related to their jobs that comes from documentation. I don\u2019t know what that translates to, in terms of growth, what impact it will have on our growth, but the industry can no longer, I don\u2019t think, sustain its present practice of trying to hire temporary workers to deal with the overload of their permanent staff. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a sustainable solution, it is much too expensive and they\u2019re increasingly coming under fire, as you probably already know, because you\u2019ve covered the industry, Ryan. And so I think that they\u2019re going to be looking to third parties to help them deal with this problem increasingly, so. I seriously doubt that they\u2019re going to have an issue with us, expanding the operating system of our client application to cater to healthcare systems that don\u2019t -- have not adopted Android. In terms of the Mayo Clinic, the specific opportunity there, we\u2019re aware of it. So, we\u2019re cautiously optimistic that we\u2019ll continue to leverage that relationship going forward. You know, Notes launched in the middle of 2020, it\u2019s growing as a proportion of our clinicians. And, it\u2019s the highest as a percent for bookings, and it is feeding into our clinicians and service. Even though we launched Notes in the middle of 2020, it wasn\u2019t until this year, in fact that it got unlocked. So please keep that in mind, as you\u2019re refining your model. Just wondering if you could talk about the cash burn throughout the year, I think it was about 4.2 million in the first quarter. I think if you look back at our -- last five or six quarters, our burns typically have been between four and five. Thank you very much. Okay, I\u2019ll take the first question Marc. Thank you very much. First one would be, could you just talk a little bit about what you saw sort of month to month during the quarter, and maybe what you saw, as we extended into April in terms of activity, interest, new wins, whatever. So the year started relatively slowly and it\u2019s picked up steam as the year progressed, as the quarter progressed. So we\u2019re, again, cautiously optimistic that the need for our services, our products, amongst the target market that we\u2019re focused on, will continue will persist throughout the rest of the year. Yeah, and that\u2019s really how I see things right now. One is, as we sort of cycled past the end of COVID, at least as we see it, right, this minute, obviously, can come back, but I think most people are reporting that things have returned to normal; and then two the merger between Microsoft and Nuance. So with respect to the COVID question, we\u2019re pleased obviously that COVID does not seem to have as much of an impact on the US healthcare system as it had. I think it\u2019s really, I\u2019d say, neutral right now, as far as our company is concerned, and the impact of it receding in the US has on our company. Longer term, I think it\u2019s a positive thing for the industry, in general. We look at what they do, but we don\u2019t get fixated on a rear view mirror, and we do believe that they\u2019re in our rearview mirror. So I think we\u2019re -- as I\u2019ve said before, on this call, we\u2019re very well positioned with our products. That\u2019s a great question, Brooks. So look, we\u2019re not impervious to the labor situation in the US. Two, the culture here that we\u2019ve developed, you\u2019ve visited our offices, you\u2019ve noticed it firsthand, we have a very collegiate and open culture here, and environment and that that resonates with several candidates as well. I\u2019m not going to say that we -- it\u2019s super easy to hire top notch people, but we have not had trouble hiring the people that we need to hire. And importantly, we haven\u2019t lost any key people knock wood. You didn\u2019t mention it but in my personal view, strong leadership at the top of the company is extremely important. To the consumer, I\u2019m not sure. This is really a product directed at the physician or the physician assistant or medical assistant, because they\u2019re the ones tasked with doing the pre-chart. And the work itself involves just extracting information, historical information from the patient\u2019s EHR, into the current -- populating the current medical note. And then before the physician encounters the patient, they\u2019ll skim through that pre-chart, look for anything that they\u2019ve deemed to be relevant to help them prepare for the questions they\u2019re going to ask the patient. I presume there are, I don\u2019t know of many that do. In fact, I don\u2019t know of any that do but I would imagine that this slot is not unique to us. The need exists, so I\u2019d be surprised if we\u2019re the only ones that do it, but we know that a couple of our major customers have asked for it. Thank you very much."
