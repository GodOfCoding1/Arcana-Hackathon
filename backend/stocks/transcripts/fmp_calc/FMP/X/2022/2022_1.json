    "content": " Our stakeholders are also counting on the best from us to continue to deliver by expanding our competitive advantages in lowest cost iron ore in North America, mini-mill steelmaking, and best-in-class finishing while executing our balanced capital allocation strategy. And at U.S. Steel, we view each challenge as an opportunity, and we delivered record first quarter net earnings, record first quarter adjusted EBITDA and all-time record liquidity. And second, this pig iron investment with expected startup in early 2023 will supply up to 50% of Big River Steel\u2019s ore-based metallics needs, meaning it could replace up to 50% of third-party purchases of pig iron, DRI, HBI or prime scrap. In Europe, our Slovakian operations delivered EBITDA of $287 million more than double last year\u2019s first quarter performance and as Dave mentioned, their third best ever quarter. And in tubular, we more than doubled last quarter\u2019s performance to generate EBITDA of $89 million, largely due to pricing uplift in the OCTG market, new trade cases on OCTG imports and management actions over the past several years to improve the cost structure and expand the high margin connections business. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Let me start with your second question first, Emily, I think the GaryWorks pig machine will certainly be used to advantage the U.S. Steel enterprise in our Big River mini mill operation. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you very much."
