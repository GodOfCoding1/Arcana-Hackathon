    "content": " With the completion of Big River 2 including a differentiated portfolio of downstream finishing lines to serve the automotive and paint markets, our Mini Mill segment is expected to deliver $1.3 billion of annual through cycle EBITDA supported by only $100 million of annual sustaining CapEx. And when you tally it up, we expect fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA for the company to be approximately $400 million, delivering a full year of over $4.2 billion in adjusted EBITDA the second best ever for U.S Steel. While the level of strategic capital spend is material in 2023 for Big River 2 and our low cost iron ore, Mini Mill steel making and best-in-class finishing projects, we expect spending will ramp down in 2024 as we move towards commissioning and full operations of these projects. Thank you very much. I think you can think about it as, against the backdrop of a balance sheet that is, there I say strongest steel, against the opportunity that we have, as we even think about looking forward into 2023 to continue to generate cash flow even in an environment where we are going to be spending, frankly, the bulk of cash towards our strategic investments in 2023. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you very much."
