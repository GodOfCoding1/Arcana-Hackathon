    "content": " First, we delivered 23% year-over-year total revenue growth on a constant currency basis, and 35% recurring revenue growth constant currency in the second quarter. In the top right, adjusted EBITDA increased $58 million, or 26% on a constant currency year-over-year basis with $339 million. Starting at the top left, Payments & Networks revenue increased $278 million or 515% year-over-year driven by the acquisition of Cardtronics. On a Cardtronics pro forma basis, revenue increased $35 million or 12% year-over-year, driven by LibertyX, growth in the merchant acquiring business and in the Allpoint network. Adjusted EBITDA increased $142 million or 1% year-over-year, and 4% on a constant currency basis. However, our mitigating actions and better product mix during the quarter draw significant improvement in profitability from the first quarter of 2022 with adjusted EBITDA margin rate up 620 basis points sequentially to 19%. Okay, that's really helpful. Okay, that's really helpful. Yes, I mean, I think the ability to react, whether it's the team on the supply chain side that did a really awesome job in the second quarter, continuing to find components and then certify new supply sources, or the engineering team, which also did, has been doing a great job literally for the last year, continuing to design around challenges, whether its ability to get shipped, or whether it's the price."
