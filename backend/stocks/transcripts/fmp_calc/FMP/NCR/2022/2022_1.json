    "content": " Starting in the top left, revenue was $1.9 billion, up $322 million or 21% versus the 2021 first quarter. 14:12 Starting at the top left, Payments & Network revenue increased $32 million or 12% year-over-year with Allpoint growth more than offsetting the Omicron driven shortfall and global transaction volumes. Self-Service Banking revenue declined $17 million or 3% year-over-year, with strong software revenue more than offset by lower one-time hardware sales. The backlog in POS is high, and actually, I wish it was a little bit higher and that we delivered a lot of POS devices to keep our customers happy in the quarter that we probably were at breakeven or less as Owen described this chip escalations on a device that only costs $1,200, to have a $400 increase in a chip is pretty painful."
