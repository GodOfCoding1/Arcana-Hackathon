    "content": " In the top right, adjusted EBITDA increased $28 million year-over-year to $380 million or 15% on a constant currency basis. Starting on the top left, retail revenue was up $34 million or 6% year-over-year as reported and up 12% on a constant currency basis. Hospitality revenue increased $14 million or 6% year-over-year and 8% adjusting for currency, as restaurants reopen, rework and expand. Digital Banking revenue increased $9 million or 7%, driven by increasing user counts, a CSP win at Citibank and continued success at Terafina, which continues to grow at almost a 50% rate. Starting at the top left, Payments and Network revenue increased $32 million or 11% year-over-year and 14% when adjusted for FX rates. So as we look at where we stand today on work to go to get to the end of the job next year, but with the spend, you know, the go-to-market side that on one been working on literally for the last four years is really aligned vertically within our lines of business, whether it's retail, hospitality or banking. So when I talk about being in our side of our ranges of $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion on EBITDA or approximately $8 billion on revenue, I think you can see with relief, if you just do the math, I described Q3 to Q4, you add up where we are this year, if you add back those FX effects, we're well within those ranges trending toward the midpoint of some of them."
