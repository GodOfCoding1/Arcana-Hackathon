    "content": " I hope that as you reflect on the totality of the data we presented in December and our progress in building the company, you share our belief that we have validated the work and investments we've made over the past 7 years -- almost 7 years, resulting in the high-quality molecular design and platform capabilities and a proven ability to translate our understanding of disease biology, PK, PD and safety from preclinical models into patients, creating high-value programs that have the potential to become important new medicines. And as you heard us say in the past, the rationale really based on cancer genetics, if you look at data that's been published over the years and that has fueled all the drug development programs in this pathway, we know that p53 is wild type in more than 50% of cancers in those types of cancers, both lipid and solid tumors, if you delete MDM2, if you genetically delete MDM2 with genetic tools that we have preclinically, you see a high dependency of these tumors on those pathway or in the presence or absence of MDM2. So it's actually also some really innovative signs that we've done here at Kymera to monitor and to understand how target engagement in terms of MDM2 degradation, but also downstream biomarker readout, which for us are just as critical, right, seeing the right biomarker, either increase or decrease downstream is what really drives that kind of antitumor effect."
