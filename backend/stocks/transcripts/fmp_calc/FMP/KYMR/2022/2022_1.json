    "content": " As we described on the call, we were always planning to un-blind and really have a comprehensive look at all the safety data once we decided that we wanted to dose escalate further and when we were going to then choose our dose to bring it to Part C. The un-blinding really showed that really the adverse events that we saw with the blinded analysis still remained the primary adverse event that we saw in a relatively small proportion of patients, including headache that was predominantly; mild palpitations that were also predominantly mild and self-limited, as well as several subjects with nausea."
