    "content": " During the second quarter we delivered a record, 881 homes generated record quarterly total revenues for any quarter of $525 million and achieved a record homebuilding gross margin of 32.3%, despite a challenging supply chain and labor environment. Your line is now open. And I don't think you're going to see that margin degradation to 21% or anything like that, like, we experienced in 2018 because we have really a great lot book going forward. Your line is now open. Well they can, but that's a very expensive proposition on most really good lot deals we're putting 15%, of the retail price of the lot as a first lost -- lot earnest money deposit that they would have to walk away from. I think we're going to see opportunities in the private acquisition sector that we haven't seen really since we bought GHO, five years ago and we may want to have capital reserve for that potential going into 2023, because I just don't see the builders that sold last year and the year before, the private builders probably did a great job but I think it's going to be a much more competitive landscape and a more attractive buying market possibly next year. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. Your line is now open."
