    "content": " Home closing revenue broke our record for any fourth quarter and grew 2.3% year-over-year to $429 million, primarily driven by a 16% increase in average selling prices of closed homes to $590,000, offset by a 12% decline in the number of closings to 727 homes. On the closings front, obviously, you've had your orders stabilize a little bit, I guess, down only 11% in the fourth quarter, and you pointed to strength in the first, so far this year, but obviously, you're dealing with a significantly lower backlog at the same time going into the year. Well, we'd like to have a look at the adjusted gross margin because one of the things that influenced our margins going down in the fourth quarter was we took a $6 million impairment and that impairment \u00e2\u0080\u0093 that's why we're very cautious in looking at what's going on in the marketplace overall. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re seeing a little bit more this year, in-state buyers then so a little bit less relocation, but that's probably in the relocations down, I would say, 10% to 20% looking at the numbers we're looking at."
