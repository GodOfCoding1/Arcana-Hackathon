    "content": " All of these developments as well as the record result of the years have been possible thanks to the passion, to dedication of all the Ferrari people and to reward their achievement in line with the company's strong performance indicators, I'm pleased to announce the yearly competitive award of up to nearly EUR 13,500 for our employees. And industrial free cash flow generation will be sustained by our profitability, partially offset by capital expenditures, slightly higher than EUR 800 million, and negative working capital in its broader meaning, mainly due to lower deposits on limited series models along with the reversal of those already collected in the previous 18 months."
