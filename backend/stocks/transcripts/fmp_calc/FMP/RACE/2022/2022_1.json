    "content": " I'm very pleased to highlight the following 4 record quarterly data: the first, the revenues at \u20ac1.2 billion, up 17% versus the prior year; EBITDA at \u20ac423 million; industrial free cash flow generation was approximately \u20ac300 million, almost twice compared to what we achieved a year ago, sustained by the strong profitability in the advances collected on the Daytona SP3. All of this was made possible, thanks to the following 3 elements: number one, our product offer is truly astonishing, it now includes V8 and V12 thermal engine as well as V8 and V6 hybrid solution, further enriched by the recent unveil of the 296 GTS; number two, the strength of our net order intake that continued over the quarter; number three, the exceptionally strong performance of the preowned business sustained by the economic climate. Deliveries in the quarter were driven by the Ferrari Roma, the SF90 family as well as the Portofino M.  In the quarter, we also commenced the first delivery of the 812 Competizione, while those of the Ferrari Monza SP1 and SP2 were lower than the prior year and reached the end of the limited series run. The remarkable industrial free cash flow generation of this quarter determined by the strong profitability, and we already mentioned advances on the Daytona SP3 and 812 Competizione A within our wider definition of working capital was offset only in part by the inventory increase related to the project volume growth for the year as well as by capital expenditure of \u20ac132 million."
