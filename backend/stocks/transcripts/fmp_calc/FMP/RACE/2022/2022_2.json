    "content": " Let me review the second quarter another quarter of records, whose strength led us to upgrade our 2022 guidance on all metrics; number one, record revenues at \u00e2\u0082\u00ac1.3 billion, up 25% versus the prior year; number two, record EBITDA at approximately \u00e2\u0082\u00ac450 million; number three, record EBIT at approximately \u00e2\u0082\u00ac325 million; and number four, in Q2 we reached a new record in terms of net order intake, which is astonishing considering that in the quarter the books were open only on three models of Ferraris from 296 GTB and 296 GTS, the one we announced last April.
