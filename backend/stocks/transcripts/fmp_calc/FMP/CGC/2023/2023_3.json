    "content": " So -- like, it's a taken, yeah, we're still we're still targeting in April 2023, shareholder meeting, I don't think it changes, any changes that we might make in the structure of our Canopy USA, business won't affect how constellation ultimately treats their investment in canopy. And so to simplify, where we are really, again, the value of Canopy USA is in putting these businesses together, letting them generate revenue synergies, because they can effectively open markets, maybe faster, generate cost synergies by working together to drive routes to market and route to market activation within individual marketplaces, and then look at other more G&A sorts of synergies across their businesses. And so all the actions that we're taking to significantly reduce our operating free cash flow in our Canadian business, as well as interest savings that we would get from our debt reduction plan, and all the things that we're doing to monetize the assets, we think we've got a very laser-focused and strong plan in place to get to that place as quickly as possible."
