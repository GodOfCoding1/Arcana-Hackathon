    "content": " Key highlights that resulted include achieving another quarter of strong double-digit revenue growth for both cannabis and consumer product businesses, closing on our acquisitions of Ace Valley and Supreme, continued emphasis on developing a robust pipeline of new products that are rooted in consumer insight and innovation with over 50 new SKUs introduced in the last two quarters and over 100 on the way. In the first quarter of fiscal 2022, we generated net revenue of CAD136 million representing a year-over-year increase of 23%, with strong double-digit growth seen across both cannabis and consumer products businesses. Adjusted gross margin in Q1 was negatively impacted by lower than planned production output given flower supply shortages and unfavorable pack size and geo mix in our Canadian business as well as some startup costs in the U.S. We expect gross margin to gradually improve over the course of fiscal 2022 as we accelerate sales growth, premiumize our portfolio, and improve execution. We're also focused on improving our market share with gains expected through improved supply of high THC strains, distribution increases on existing products, and new product launches expected to hit the market later this year. And that's the sort of thing that that, I'm really gives me a lot of optimism in our US businesses, because as those partnerships grow, and as we get better at managing the relationships right down to retail and through that distribution channel, we're going to be really well positioned with the brands we have in the market today and the brands we'd like to bring to the market in the future."
