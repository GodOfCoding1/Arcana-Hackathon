    "content": " The second set of work we completed in fiscal \u201822 was the significant strides made to strengthen the distribution of our high-performance CPG brands in the U.S. We\u2019re continuing to see strong demand for Storz & Bickel\u2019s standard vaporizers including the new VOLCANO ONYX and MIGHTY+, which helped propel Storz & Bickel to its 22nd consecutive year of revenue growth. And so while the cash has left our balance sheet, you\u2019re not seeing the P&L and cash flows from those businesses accrue to us, but rest assured that they\u2019re continuing to grow while the market grows in the U.S. And the other thing I just want to point out there as well is that, we as well as people in the industry and experts around the industry, continue to believe that the North American cannabis market is in that $60 billion to $80 billion range at revenue. So, first, I think, you have to think about the shift that we\u2019ve made throughout fiscal \u201822 from a premiumization strategy, where when you look at the first half of the last fiscal year, we still have sizable value flower sales that were flowing through our revenue base."
