    "content": " The third quarter was one of action for the Canopy Growth team with our efforts based on 4 key areas: one, driving our Canadian business to profitability; two, strengthening our premium brand portfolio and product offering in Canada; three, increasing our CPG distribution in the U.S.; and four, making significant strides in furthering our U.S. THC strategy. As a result, Canopy's CBD business has grown 250% year-to-date with our product portfolio now available in brick-and-mortar and e-commerce sites covering a combined 33 states in the U.S., including Martha Stewart CBD, which is the fastest-growing CBD gummy brand in the U.S. Whisl, our CBD vape that we launched in October with retail partner, Circle-K is already the #1 CBD-only vape brand in IRI-measured channels. So I'd say the comment around improvement is, obviously, when you take a step back and kind of where we've been in our business and a lot of actions that we've taken in Q3 to really drive distribution gains in our U.S. CBD and CPG businesses really premiumizing our portfolio in the flower side in Canada and getting new products to market from a Canadian recreational market standpoint."
