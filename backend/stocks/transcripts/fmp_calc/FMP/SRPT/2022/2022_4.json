    "content": " As one ponders how Sarepta may execute the launch of 9001, if given that opportunity, I would ask you to consider the team's consistent performance quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year, serving the Duchenne community with our 3 approved therapies: EXONDYS VYONDYS and AMONDYS. This robust start, coupled with continued high adherence rates and strong ex U.S. revenues, served as the foundation for full year net product revenue growth of approximately 13% generated with EXONDYS 51 and net product revenue of roughly $511 million. VYONDYS 53 exceeded $100 million in revenues, ending the year with $117.4 million in total net product revenue and over 30% growth compared to 2021. And last but not least, the team's continued execution on AMONDYS 45 produced exceptional growth in 2022 of over 200% with total net product revenue of $214.8 million. VYONDYS 53 fourth quarter 2022 net product revenue totaled $28.5 million, representing roughly 15% growth versus the fourth quarter of 2021. And finally, AMONDYS 45 net product revenue was $61.4 million in Q4 of 2022, representing nearly 80% growth versus the fourth quarter of 2021. For the 3 months ended December 31, 2022, the company recorded total revenues of $258.4 million which consists primarily of net product revenues and collaboration revenues compared to revenues of $201.5 million for the same period of 2021, an increase of $56.9 million. On a GAAP basis, we recorded $213.8 million and $197.3 million in R&D expenses for the fourth quarter of 2022 and 2021, respectively, a year-over-year increase of $16.5 million. On a non-GAAP basis, R&D expenses were $186.8 million for the fourth quarter of 2022 compared to $175.5 million for the same period of 2021, an increase of $11.3 million."
