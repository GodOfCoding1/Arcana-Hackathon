    "content": " Second, Duchenne is a well-characterized monogenic disease and the shortened functional dystrophin robustly produced by SRP-9001 is an upstream surrogate endpoint for accelerated approval, one addressing the proximate cause of disease, one founded on a wealth of scientific evidence supported by preclinical, related biomarker and clinical functional benefits and one based on a well-established precedent as the FDA has approved for therapies to date using shortened functional dystrophin as a surrogate endpoint. Net product revenue totaled $207.8 million in the third quarter, with roughly $122 million for EXONDYS 51, $55 million for AMONDYS 45 and $31 million for VYONDYS 53.
