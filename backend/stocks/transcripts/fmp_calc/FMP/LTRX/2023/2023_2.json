    "content": " For the second quarter of fiscal 2023, we reported revenue of $31.5 million compared to $33.7 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2022. Selling, general and administrative expenses for the second quarter of fiscal 2023 were $9.8 million compared with $8.9 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2022 and $9.2 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2023. Research and development expenses for the second quarter of fiscal 2023 were $5.1 million, compared with $4.3 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2022 and $4.5 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2023. For those who didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t see the announcement subsequent to the close of the December quarter, Lantronix finalized the largest contract in its history, a $40 million smart grid compute platform utilized by one of the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s leading energy distributors. In our fiscal second quarter, embedded IoT Solutions totaled $13.7 million, down 9% sequentially and 12% year-over-year, representing 43% of total revenues. While there is still much to focus on for the remainder of the fiscal year, we can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t help but anticipate our fiscal 2024 as we shift to the largest customer contract in history, we have excellent visibility into solid revenue growth and fast-growing funnel with opportunities to keep the ball rolling. And then just on the Gridspertise contract, it sounds like you expect to ship most of that $40 million in fiscal \u00e2\u0080\u009824."
