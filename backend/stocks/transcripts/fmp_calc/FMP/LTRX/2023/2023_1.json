    "content": " For the first quarter of fiscal 2023 we reported revenue of $31.8 million, an increase of 15% when compared to $27.7 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2022. As expected, revenue was down sequentially as compared to $35.9 million reported in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022. Paul, can you tell us what of your $155 million to $165 million guidance, either by customer or together, you know when we take a look at TOGG and Enel for lack of the real name, but \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and then because it sounds like it's just going to be a model - you know start to ramp and those things can always happen now that the initial pace is expected. Also the number of employees that came onboard as part of it, and as we kind of think about the saw, the gross margin mix going forward, I would think that that has an upward bias, but I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m kind of wondering now as we start to have Enel coming into the mix and TOGG coming into the mix, you know should we be expecting a little bit of a step backward before we start marching up into the mid-40s and higher. If I look at the pipeline of opportunities that we have, we're chasing well over $200 million of new revenue growth and some of that is going to require investments, some of it's going to require you know partial customer buy-in, but you know things just look pretty good right now."
