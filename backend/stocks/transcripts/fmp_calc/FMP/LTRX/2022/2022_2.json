    "content": " For the second quarter of fiscal 2022, we reported record revenue of $33.7 million, an increase of a 103% when compared to $16.6 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2021. Sequentially, net revenue was up 22% compared to $27.7 million reported in the first quarter of Fiscal 2022. Research and development expenses for the second quarter of fiscal 2022 were $4.3 million compared with $2.4 million to second quarter of fiscal 2021, and $4 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2022, the increase in SG&A and R&D was impacted by increased headcount and operating costs related to the recent acquisition. GAAP net loss was $2.4 million or $0.08 per share during the second quarter of Fiscal 2022, compared to a GAAP net loss of $1.5 million or $0.05 per share during the second quarter of fiscal 2021. non-GAAP net income was $3.3 million or $0.10 per share during the second quarter of fiscal 2022, compared to non-GAAP net income of $861 thousand, or $0.03 per share, during the second quarter of fiscal 2021. For fiscal year 2022, we are raising our annual revenue target to a range of $112.5 million to $127.5 million, representing growth in the range of 57% to 78%. Q2 benefited from a full quarter of contribution from our most recent acquisitions and incremental one more month than in Q1, removing these newly acquired revenues from the equation, organic growth was 22% on a sequential basis in an exciting 47% year-over-year, we saw broad strength in our business in the second quarter, notable contributors included our remote environment management products, Wi-Fi, cellular tracking, and device service solutions. And then I guess, on my last question, I mean, the typical organic growth that you're seeing, is quite material, and our backlog we talked about being north of $50 million, you've got a bunch of new programs here, been there a while, and I'll Paul, I mean, what do you kind of see as like the true organic growth rate of this business minus in the acquisitions that could be later done over time."
