    "content": " Forward-looking statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond Harrow\u00e2\u0080\u0099s control, including risks and uncertainties described from time to time in its SEC filings, such as the risks and uncertainties related to the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ability to make commercially available its FDA-approved products and compounded formulations and technologies and FDA approval of certain drug candidates in a timely manner or at all. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d like to begin by reminding you of what I said on our second quarter earnings conference call, and that is that I believe the back half of 2022 would be a period of great consequence for Harrow and one that would yield some of the most transformative and hopefully financially valuable events in our history. Third quarter revenues of $22.8 million represent a 22% increase over the prior year quarter, and a slight decrease over the second quarter of 2022, primarily as a result of supply chain challenges, along with a return to the seasonality that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve historically seen in the summer. But in terms of the commercial value of those programs, I think as I tried to allude to in our stockholder letter, we just have a very clear understanding of what the uptake might be and for a product like that, particularly in the cataract surgery market where we have sold a compounded version of the MELT-300 product, the combination product for many years. Thanks for that, Jeff. Thanks for that, Jeff."
