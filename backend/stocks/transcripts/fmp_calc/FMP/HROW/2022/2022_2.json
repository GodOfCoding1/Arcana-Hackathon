    "content": "  We did make great progress during the first half of 2022 in terms of the implementation of our strategic plan, which included ensuring that Harrow as an eyecare platform had infrastructure, the systems, the resources and talent needed to execute on the growth that we expect in our compounded pharmaceuticals business, and of course, the new and even more dramatic growth that we expect from the continued integration of FDA approved branded pharmaceutical products onto the Harrow platform, but there is no free lunch in terms of paying for the investments that are required to take advantage of these future highly lucrative sources of revenue, I am happy to say though that we can utilize profits that we've made in our core business to make these modest investments without the need to sell equity and dilute our shareholders."
