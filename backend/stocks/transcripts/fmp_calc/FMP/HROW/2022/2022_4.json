    "content": " Forward-looking statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond Harrow\u00e2\u0080\u0099s control, including risks and uncertainties described from time-to-time in its SEC filings, such as the risks and uncertainties related to the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ability to make commercially available its FDA approved products and compounded formulations and technology and FDA approval of certain drug candidates in a timely manner or at all. This January, we completed our Fab Five transaction and we are currently working to transfer all the new drug applications connected to those products as quickly as possible, which will allow Harrow to begin the process of reviving marketing and sales detailing for ILEVRO, NEVANAC, VIGAMOX, MAXIDEX and TRIESENCE, products which in the aggregate in recent years provided north of $200 million in revenue for their former owner. But beginning with the Fab Five acquisition closing and subsequent market access wins for IHEEZO and while our core ImprimisRx business is improving and we expect it will only continue to grow, as stockholders you need to know that the Harrow of Q4 2022 has a different business and financial prospect than the Harrow of Q1 2023. The bottomline for us is that by leveraging the resources and infrastructure that we have put into place, 2023 should be a breakout year and I believe that we have positioned Harrow to be the largest pure-play ophthalmic pharmaceutical company in the United States, uniquely providing both branded pharmaceutical products and high quality compounded pharmaceutical products that meet the needs of our more than 11,000 institutional customers and the millions of Americans they serve."
