    "content": " Our P&C businesses continued to deliver positive operating leverage, while negative operating leverage at the all-bank level this quarter reflected the particularly strong revenue performance in capital markets in Q1 last year, as well as the impact of investments we've made over the past year to drive growth. Performance in our P&C businesses continue to be very strong with year-over-year pre-provision pretax earnings growth of 9% in Canada, and 12% in the U.S. driven by continued loan growth and margin expansion. Expenses were up 9% from the prior year or up 6% excluding the impact of the stronger U.S. dollar and higher performance-based compensation mainly reflecting the follow-through impact of targeted investments during the last year, including sales force expansion, technology and marketing as well as inflation rather than added expenses this quarter. Our capital position remains strong with a common equity Tier 1 ratio of 18.2%, excluding the impact of the management of fair value changes related to the Bank of the West transaction, the CET1 ratio increased approximately 180 basis points due to our common share issuance, strong internal capital generation and a reduction in risk-weighted assets partially offset by the onetime impact of the tax measures. Canadian P&C delivered net income of $980 million, down 2% from the prior year due to higher provisions for credit losses with strong pre-provision pretax earnings growth of 9%.
