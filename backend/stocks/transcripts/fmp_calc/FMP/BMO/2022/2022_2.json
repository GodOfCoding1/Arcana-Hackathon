    "content": " Second quarter adjusted earnings per share improved to $3.23, with continued positive operating leverage and strong pre-provision pretax earnings growth of 6%. On an adjusted basis, EPS was $3.23 and net income was $2.2 billion, up from $2.1 billion last year, driven by strong pre-provision pretax earnings of $2.9 billion, up 6%, reflecting good year-over-year revenue growth across our diversified businesses and disciplined dynamic expense management. Business and government loans increased 10% year-over-year or 13% excluding the impact of declining balances in our non-Canadian Energy portfolio and deconsolidation of our customer securitization vehicle reflecting strong commercial loan growth in Canada and the U.S. Consumer balances were up 9% from the prior year, reflecting strong growth in our Canadian P&C and wealth businesses. Based on our initial expectations, we expect to be able to achieve pre-provision pretax synergy opportunities in the range of $450 million to $550 million over the next 3 to 5 years, with approximately 60% of that driven by our commercial and capital markets and 40% by our personal and wealth businesses. Traditional wealth net income was $248 million, with good underlying revenue growth of 5%, excluding the impact of divestitures, reflecting higher net interest income from strong deposit and loan growth and higher average client assets, partially offset by lower online brokerage transaction revenue compared to last year. And then based on the rate increases that we're expecting, I think we will continue to see the expansion into 2023, which when you put it all together with our guidance of high single-digit loan growth this year, potentially moving into even next year, that bodes very well for net interest income growth."
