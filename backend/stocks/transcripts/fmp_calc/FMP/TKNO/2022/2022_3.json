Lab Essentials revenue was $9.5 million in the third quarter, a 32% increase from $7.2 million in the third quarter of 2021 and a 21% increase on a trailing 12-month basis. Our Clinical Solutions revenue was $0.9 million in the third quarter, a 46% decrease from $1.7 million in the third quarter of 2021 and a 68% increase on a trailing 12-month basis. Operating expenses increased due primarily to a $16.6 million goodwill impairment charge recorded during the third quarter of 2022, as well as to additional headcount, stock-based compensation expense and marketing costs. This marks the third consecutive quarter in which operating expenses range between $11 million and $12 million, excluding the onetime impairment charge. Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure, was negative $4.6 million for the third quarter of 2022 compared to negative $2.7 million for the third quarter of 2021. Free cash flow, a non-GAAP measure, which we define as cash provided by or used in operating activities, less purchases of property, plant and equipment, was negative $14.9 million in the third quarter compared to negative $8.7 million in the third quarter of 2021."
