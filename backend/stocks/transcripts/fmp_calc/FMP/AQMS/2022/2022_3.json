    "content": " We are already producing ultra-pure led metal in Taiwan and over the next few months are now well trading partner and licensee ACME Metal will regularly operate the phase one system in Taiwan as a showcase for industry partners to witness firsthand, ACME and Aqua Metals are currently in discussions for what Phase 2 and beyond could look like. Research and development costs which included expenditures related to improving lithium-ion battery AquaRefining technology during the three months ended September 30, 2022 increased approximately 80% compared to the three months ended September 30, 2021. So there's a lot of partnering opportunities, we see the lithium business developing not only as a primary recycler, but as a partner, joint venture partner, and potentially working with other parties in other structures, which could even include licensing, because we become we have the capability to license technology, as we've demonstrated with the lead our refining business. And that's why we're prioritizing November December, those that we've shared our process, flow sheets and capabilities under non-disclosure agreements, and talked in details about how it would look if we partnered together, whether it be supply black mass ranging to an off take partner to anything in between looking at things like joint ventures and how we get from pre canned materials. LiNiCo would be taking in battery cells, storing battery cells, crushing battery cells, separating the materials creating the black mass material, Aqua metals would be taking the black mass material and creating nickel and cobalt, and copper and other minerals from the black mass that LiNiCo produces in a non-competitive complimentary fashion."
