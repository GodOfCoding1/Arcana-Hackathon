    "content": " Our year ending cash balance, expected lithium battery metals revenues, and asset sales in 2023 will support our current organization and pilot plant operations throughout the year. As Steve mentioned, in December, we completed equipment installation and began operating our first-of-kind lithium AquaRefining battery recycling facility at our innovation center in the Tahoe-Reno Industrial Center. Our proprietary patent pending technology is a low emissions, closed loop recycling solution capable of recovering all valuable metals and minerals including high purity lithium hydroxide, cobalt, copper, nickel and manganese dioxide from lithium batteries. We have already signed a letter of intent with Dragonfly Energy Corporation, a lithium ion battery producer and a nearby neighbor here in the Tahoe-Reno area to provide Aqua Metals with spent lithium ion cells and manufacturing scrap as well as for the purchase of commercial quantities of lithium hydroxide from Aqua Metals."
