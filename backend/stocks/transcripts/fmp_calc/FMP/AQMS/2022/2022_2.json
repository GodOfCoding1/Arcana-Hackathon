    "content": " Dragonfly Energy is a lithium-ion battery producer and they would purchase commercial quantities of lithium hydroxide from Aqua Metals sourced sustainably from recycling to support the ongoing development of their solid state, lithium-ion battery technologies and future manufacturing activities. On the lithium side, we've already announced our collaboration development agreement with LiNiCo, so in addition to our pilot operations that will be happening at our Innovation Center, we have great opportunity with LiNiCo to expand and scale within the facility that is formerly the Aqua Refinery and that's about 140,000 square foot facility less -- about just about a mile away from our innovation center. But it's really one step at a time and we're going to get the pilot up and running and scale that to demonstration quantities as Ben mentioned, while we explore these opportunities, and at the appropriate time, we'll be able to announce what those next steps look like the lithium AquaRefining deployments. But in our drive to make sure that we reach ultimately a net zero recycling operation and company-wide net zero of the key first steps is that renewable energy credit area, and that's where because our process is powered by electricity, we can buy electricity, renewable energy credits, which we've already secured. And we think that's kind of a great unique advantage of AquaRefining using the electrons, the reagents, because you can't buy renewable energy credits for fossil fuels and things like that which power the incumbent recycling technologies or for chemicals for that matter and the standard hydro processes."
