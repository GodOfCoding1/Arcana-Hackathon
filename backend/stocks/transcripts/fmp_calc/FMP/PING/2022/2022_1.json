    "content": " We generated $20.2 million of SaaS revenue in Q1, up 68% year-over-year, the strongest quarterly growth rate since Q4 of 2018 when SaaS was less than 1/4 of its current size. In addition to the timing of collections, this quarter's cash flow and expenses reflected more aggressive investments to continue driving growth in our 3 focus areas: The cloud, the customer use case and the channel, our 3Cs. In conclusion, we've had a strong start to the year and expect to experience growth acceleration driven by continued execution against our 3 strategic focus areas of cloud, customer use case and channel. But what we're seeing is a shift in the way companies think about securing themselves and it is a shift towards Zero Trust, where protecting the endpoint that a user is coming in from strongly protecting the user's identity, that's Ping's role, and then protecting the cloud edge, Cloudflare's role, all 3 of these really are the pillars that make up the new fabric of the Zero Trust security model. But I will say that we've made a commitment to -- certainly to the channel, and we're investing across the board in sales and marketing, and that is everything from marketing awareness all the way to the channel and enablement and customer success and quota-carrying reps. What I will tell you is the -- is through the balance of the year, you will see us invest in sales and marketing and in R&D, primarily those are the 2 areas. Q1 was a strong start to the year, but most importantly, we're making really solid progress against all 3 of our strategic growth drivers: Cloud, the customer use case and the channel."
