    "content": " And to provide an update on our TCR-T Library trial, as a reminder, it's a Phase 1/2 basket trial, targeting hotspot mutations across six different solid tumor indications; non-small cell lung, colorectal, endometrium, pancreas, ovary, and bile duct cancers. I'll let Drew go into more detail about the clinical findings of these papers, but I'd like to highlight that these case studies with patients with KRAS and TP53 mutations treated with TCR-T cells resulted in durable responses using TCRs that we have in our library. Your line is open, please go ahead. Good morning, and thanks for taking the questions. And the other thing to highlight here, Thomas, is that with our Hunter platform moving forward, we fully anticipate that we will be adding TCRs to our library, that we'll be able to increase the addressable market, increase the -- since we have all the information that we're gathering of these over 500 patients in colorectal and lung, we'll be able to pick up new patients as we add TCRs, as we expand TCRs to our library and insert new TCRs that have either new mutations or new HLAs. Your line is open, please go ahead. Good morning, and thanks for taking the questions. Your line is open, please go ahead."
