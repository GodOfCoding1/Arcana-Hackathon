    "content": " At Wiley we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re grounded in 215 years of serving the demand for scientific research and career connected education, we continue to use this experience to find new ways to meet the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ever increasing need for knowledge and knowledge services. Earnings were also impacted by continued targeted investment in our key growth areas, Research Publishing, Research Solutions, and Corporate Talent Development. Research Solutions rose 17% in the quarter driven by recent acquisitions, namely J&J Editorial, Knowledge Unlatched, and eJournalPress, as well as organic growth from platform services for societies and career centers for R&D centric companies. Solid revenue growth and restructuring savings will be partially offset by targeted investments in Research Publishing, Research Solutions and Corporate Talent Development, as well as higher employment costs overall. And I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll probably ask a few extra, because there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a few topics to discuss, but starting with research, which is, it remains very solid and robust 4% growth X currency kind of low single-digit in publishing and strong double in solutions. So from the perspective of Research Publishing, I would say that you can continue to see our growth as we have stated grow significantly in the area of submissions we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re seeing good upper single-digit growth in the submissions category now, and that leads to an even higher level now of acceptances, which is what you want to see the submissions turn into acceptances."
