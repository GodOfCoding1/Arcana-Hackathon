    "content": " Growth and open research, research solutions, corporate talent development, and corporate training offset declines in APL's publishing lines and in university services. Research publishing revenue rose 2%, driven by continued growth in Open Access with OA article output of 34% over prior year. Adjusted EBITDA in research declined 4%, primarily due to investments to expand our editorial capabilities to manage increasing publishing volumes and to scale our solutions offerings to meet partner demand. Year-to-date, Ed services revenue was up 14%, while adjusted EBITDA was down 14%, mainly due to revenue performance in University Services and investment to expand client relationships and talent development. Research Publishing and Research Solutions are already focused customer-centric lines of business that complement one another and that together are a strong market leader, delivering new pathways for profitable growth. In the meantime, we will continue to update you on the progress we are making along the way. In the meantime, we will continue to update you on the progress we are making along the way."
