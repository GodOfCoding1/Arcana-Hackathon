    "content": " Academic generated an 18% EBITDA margin year-to-date, which is down from last year's 23% due to the effect of market headwinds on revenue. Year-to-date, Talent's EBITDA margin was 21% and 97% of its revenue came from digital products and services. Overall, Research reported a 34% EBITDA margin year-to-date and 95% of its revenue came from digital products and services. Wiley's revenue for the quarter decreased by 2% due to the declines in our Academic Publishing, University Services and Research Publishing lines for the reasons discussed earlier. Adjusted EBITDA declined 3%, mainly due to revenue performance, offsetting corporate expense savings of $14 million. Research Publishing revenue declined 3% this quarter, primarily due to the Hindawi special issues pause. Adjusted EBITDA in Research declined 7%, primarily due to Hindawi revenue decline and investments to expand our editorial capabilities and scale our solutions offerings to meet partner demand. In addition, the Q3 emergence of the Hindawi publishing interruption has pulled down our full year expectation by up to $30 million in revenue and up to $25 million in EBITDA."
