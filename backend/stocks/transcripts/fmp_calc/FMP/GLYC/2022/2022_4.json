    "content": " To deliver on this aspiration, we are focused on three key areas: first, strengthening our leadership team to support commercialization; second, sustaining strong clinical progress for our pivotal Phase III study of uproleselan; and third, raising capital to continue the trial through a final analysis as patients continue to live longer. Following consultation with medical experts on the blinded pool data, we aligned with the FDA to establish an interim utility analysis in our Phase III study protocol at approximately 80% of the planned survival events. To our knowledge, as our study continues to mature, it is on track to have the longest follow-up of any study in relapsed/refractory AML at the point of primary analysis at potentially more than three years. Patients in this study continue to live longer than expected and to our knowledge, it is on track to have the longest follow up of any study in relapsed/refractory AML at the point of primary analysis at potentially more than three years."
