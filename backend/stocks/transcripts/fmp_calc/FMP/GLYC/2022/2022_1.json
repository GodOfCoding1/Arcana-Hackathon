    "content": " Forward-looking statements on this call may include, but are not limited to, statements about the company\u2019s product candidates, uproleselan, GMI-1687 and other pipeline programs; along with statements about expectations regarding our operations, cash position and data from preclinical studies or clinical trials as well as planned or potential future development, regulatory interactions or submissions and potential commercialization activities or strategic collaborations. The company\u2019s general and administrative expenses increased to $5.1 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2022, as compared to $4.2 million for the first quarter of 2021, primarily due to commercialization start-up expenses for uproleselan and higher patent fees. If -- just to remind everyone, once data matures and that is positive, that means, for a segment of patients that have not had any true innovation for more than 30 years, and that segment is the relapsed/refractory patient population fit for chemotherapy, that I\u2019m sure everybody will be very motivated for us to move forward. Because where we are is we got to make some choices, that we have gotten it to a point where it\u2019s ready for a next phase, but we got to kind of think of our cash runway, and we\u2019re really doubling down on uproleselan and 1687, accelerating it towards an IND."
