    "content": " The focus of our early commercial development efforts has been in four key areas: first, to drive awareness and educate medical experts on the role of E-selectin in AML and how this glycoprotein on the endothelial surface of the bone marrow vasculature creates a permissive microenvironment for leukemic cell survival and proliferation; second, to raise awareness of uproleselan's unique and differentiated mechanism of action as a first-in-class E-selectin antagonist poised to disrupt the standard of care in both relapsed refractory and newly diagnosed AML fit for intensive chemotherapy; third, to drive awareness of uproleselan's clinical development program in AML; and forth to develop a deep understanding of the market landscape in the U.S., E.U., U.K. and Canada, the commercial opportunity for uproleselan, and to evaluate early perceptions of a blinded product profile with AML experts, community hematological oncologists, or heme/oncs, and payers."
