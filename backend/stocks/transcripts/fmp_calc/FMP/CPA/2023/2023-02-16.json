    "content": " While cargo revenue, including the contribution from the operation of our Boeing 737-800 freighter was 69% higher, resulting in unit revenues, or RASM, of $0.137, a 23% increase compared to the fourth quarter of 2019. Our load factor came in basically flat versus 2019 at 85.1%, driven by a 10.8% increase in yields, unit revenues improved by 12.6% versus 2019 to $0.121. Driven by higher jet fuel prices, unit cost or CASM increased $0.103 or 10% more than the adjusted CASM in Q4 2019. We're basing our outlook on the following assumptions: load factor of approximately 85%; unit revenues within the range of $0.121, CASM ex fuel to be in the range of $0.06, mainly due to the additional costs associated with our engines and the longer maintenance shop and turnaround times that we expect for this year; and finally, we are expecting an all-in fuel price of $3.15 per gallon. From -- in terms of what we're seeing when you compare, let's say, the unit revenues for the second half of 2022 and the full year 2023 guidance that we've issued. So we don't think that's sustainable, and we're seeing that -- and it's experience from the past also when fuel comes down, airlines are a little bit more aggressive in their pricing and -- we've seen a lot of that or some of that, I should say."
