    "content": " However, both our load factors and yields also increased improving unit revenues by 15% compared to Q3 2019, driven by a currently stronger travel demand environment in the region. Passenger yields came in at 14.01 cents or 12% higher than in the third quarter of 2019, while cargo revenue was 80% higher, resulting in unit revenues or RASM of 12.8 cents, a 15% increase compared to the third quarter of 2019. Load factor came in at an average of 86.8% for the quarter, a 1.2 percentage point increase compared to the same period in 2019, while passenger yields increased 12.1%. And then just my second question to either you and/or Pedro, this 88% load factor in the fourth quarter, not only is it very high, but -- and of course, you're bringing back capacity now, but it's up versus the third quarter, so we have sequential improvement."
