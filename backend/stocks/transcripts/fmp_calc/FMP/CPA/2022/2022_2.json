    "content": " Our CASM excluding fuel came in at $0.06, a 4.6% decrease compared to Q2 2019, even though we operate a 3% less capacity and finally, driven by a 10.1% increase in yields, unit revenues came in at 11.6 cents or 11.3% higher than in the second quarter of 2019. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Cargo is up 62% and I realize it's obviously being driven by the freighter, but absent the freighter, would your cargo revenue have been the growth rate, something more similar to maybe the other up 20% because I am sort of incorporating the higher cargo yields that we're seeing in the marketplace, and I'm trying to get at how much that single airplane has added. Your line is open. The movement in the fuel price has been very recent during the month of July, so the impact on specifically the third quarter in terms of yields will not necessarily come in such a strong way given that a portion of the quarter was already sold with very, very high fuel price environment, but, as you could imagine, we're very closely following the macro operating environment, just to adjust our pricing et cetera and just to make sure that it's all competitive. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open."
