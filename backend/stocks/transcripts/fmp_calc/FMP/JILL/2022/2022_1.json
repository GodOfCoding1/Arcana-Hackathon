    "content": " Store sales for Q1 were up over 53% versus Q1 2021, driven by higher unit sales associated with continued recovery in both lifestyle center and mall traffic and full price average unit retails resulting primarily from a lower promotional rate in the quarter. SG&A expenses were $86 million compared to $79 million last year, with increases in selling costs from higher store operating hours and shipping costs, investments in marketing and higher management incentive, partially offset by savings in G&A overhead. With respect to our future outlook for fiscal 2022, for second quarter of fiscal 2022, we expect sales to be up 1% to 3% versus Q2 2021 and adjusted EBITDA to be between $31 million and $33 million. For the second half of fiscal 2022, we expect sales growth to be up slightly and for adjusted EBITDA dollars to be down slightly compared to the prior year period also taking into account the challenging year-over-year comparison for Q3, as I previously mentioned. And Janet, I would add that, overall, ending the quarter with inventories plus 7% with the sales performance and the comp of 24%, we feel really good about the overall level of inventory and believe that it's in the spirit and reflective of our disciplined approach to inventory management and the new operating model and the things that we've been speaking about."
