    "content": " Our second quarter results reflect the team's continued execution of our business strategy, focused on regularly flowing newness, driving full price sales and expense management, while operating in a volatile consumer environment. This strong execution helped to drive a record quarter of adjusted EBITDA of $35.6 million for Q2, led by growth margin expansion of 150 basis points on top of last year's difficult comparison and supported by year-over-year sales growth of approximately 1%. SG&A expenses were $84 million compared to $86 million last year, as increases in selling costs from store operating hours and shipping and strategic investments in marketing were offset by savings in occupancy costs, depreciation and amortization and management incentive. As such, we are projecting for the third quarter of fiscal 2022 sales to be flat to down 3% versus Q3 2021 and adjusted EBITDA to be between $21 million and $23 million."
