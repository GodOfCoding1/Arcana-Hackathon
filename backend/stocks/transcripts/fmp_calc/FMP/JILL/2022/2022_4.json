    "content": " Our fourth quarter performance capped off a strong year for J.Jill, in which we delivered sales growth of over 5%, as well as an increase in adjusted EBITDA of over 19%, driven by gross margin expansion and disciplined expense management. SG&A expenses were $87 million, compared to $85 million last year, driven by increases in marketing, store selling costs on higher sales and slightly higher operating hours and G&A overhead. For the full-year, we delivered total net sales growth of 5.1% to $615.3 million, adjusted EBITDA was $109.4 million, up $17.7 million or 19.2% over fiscal full-year 2021. More specifically for the first quarter of fiscal 2023, we expect sales to be down in the mid-single-digits, compared to Q1 2022 and first quarter adjusted EBITDA to be between $25 million and $30 million. With respect to full-year capital, we expect to spend between $18 million and $20 million with investments focused on technology, stores capital and the completion of the POS project late in 2023. And that is in the range of around 100 basis points or so of incremental freight, which has now largely abated and those tailwinds experienced in the back half of the year will continue through the first-half and then a little bit continuing through the back half and that really is, as Claire mentioned, a hedge for us against the overarching objective to maintain the profitable profile we've achieved to-date coming out of the COVID world and then the rebased operating model, which we're very proud of."
