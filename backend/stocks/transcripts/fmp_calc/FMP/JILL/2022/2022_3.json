    "content": " We delivered adjusted EBITDA of $27.5 million, up modestly from a very strong Q3 last year on expanded margins of 69.9% and sales down 1% versus the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA was $27.5 million or 18.3% of sales for the third quarter of 2022, compared to $27 million or 17.8% of sales in Q3 2021. With respect to our future outlook for fiscal 2022, for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, we are projecting sales to be flat to down 3% versus Q4 2021, and adjusted EBITDA to be between $9 million and $11 million. The resulting expectation for full year 2022 is, annual sales will grow between 4% and 5%; gross margins will be up about 100 basis points versus prior year; and adjusted EBITDA will be between $103 million and $105 million compared to $92 million last year. And Q3, we mentioned on the call that it was the most difficult comparison and that's because last year was really the first quarter Q3 that we obtained a really low healthy level of full price promos where we want to be."
