    "content": " Professional segment net sales for the second quarter were $925.8 million, up 11.8% from the same period last year. Professional segment earnings for the second quarter were $165.4 million, and when expressed as a percent of net sales, 17.9%, this was down from 20.2% in the second quarter last year. The year-over-year decrease was primarily due to higher material freight and manufacturing costs and the addition of our first quarter acquisition at a lower initial margin relative to the segment average, partially offset by increased price realization and productivity initiatives. Residential segment net sales for the second quarter were $319.7 million, up 1.5% from last year, building on the 20.2% growth we reported in the second quarter of fiscal 2021. The year-over-year decreases were primarily due to higher material freight and manufacturing costs, and the addition of our first quarter acquisition at a lower initial gross margin relative to the Company average, partially offset by increased price realization and productivity improvements."
