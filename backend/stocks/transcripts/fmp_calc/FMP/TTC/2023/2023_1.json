    "content": " We began fiscal 2023 by delivering another record quarter with net sales up 23% and adjusted diluted earnings per share, up 49% over last year. We grew overall consolidated net sales to $1.15 billion, an increase of 23.2%, compared to the first quarter of last year. This increase was driven by higher shipments of products broadly across the segment, primarily due to strong demand and improvement in the supply chain, net price realization and incremental revenue from our first quarter fiscal 2022 acquisition of the Intimidator Group. Residential segment net sales for the first quarter were $264.6 million, up 3.6% over last year. The year-over-year improvement was primarily due to net price realization and productivity improvements, partially offset by higher material, freight, and manufacturing costs and the addition of the Intimidator Group at a lower initial gross margin relative to the company average. Additionally, we continue to expect improvement in overall adjusted operating earnings as a percentage of net sales, compared to last year with higher earnings margins expected for both segments on a year-over-year basis. Additionally, for the full-year, we continue to expect depreciation and amortization of about $130 million, interest expense of about $55 million and adjusted effective tax rate of about 21%, and free cash flow conversion of approximately 100% of reported net earnings. For the Professional segment, we expect the second quarter earnings margin to be higher year-over-year, as well as higher sequentially from the first quarter of fiscal 2023."
