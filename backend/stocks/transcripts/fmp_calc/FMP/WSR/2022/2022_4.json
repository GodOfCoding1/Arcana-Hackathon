    "content": " This was accomplished by staying laser-focused on leasing throughout the year, raising our occupancy by 240 basis points to 93.7% and achieving same-store NOI growth of nearly 8%. Our focus remains on staying disciplined and adhering to our strategy, remaining patient with respect to acquisitions and dispositions, continuing to drive industry-leading same-store NOI growth, continuing to strengthen our balance sheet by improving our debt metrics, continuing to reduce our overhead costs as a percent of revenue and, most importantly, being passionate about driving growth in FFO per share and long-term value for shareholders. Based on ending occupancy of 93.5% to 94.5%, G&A savings of $0.02, other primarily non-same-store NOI improvements for a positive $0.01 variance, and higher interest expense is anticipated to result in a negative variance of $0.11 per share for 2023."
