    "content": " Platform revenue was up 39% year-over-year to $647 million, benefiting from higher content distribution and robust growth in advertising revenue, despite some continued softness in certain verticals. Platform gross margin was 59%, which was down roughly 8 points year-over-year, reflecting a shift towards a greater mix of video advertising compared to a year ago period, which had significant growth of higher margin M&E and content distribution due to the launch of new services. Roku has 60 million active accounts, but that's still tiny compared to the billion broadband households around the world that are all going to get their TV through streaming. We do see that AVOD has and for many years now and by AVOD, I mean fully ad-supported free like the Roku Channel or ad subsidized with a subscription, that category of apps has consistently been growing faster than SVOD, the pure subscription services, in part for the -- because of the reasons Anthony mentioned earlier, which is that free is a great price or subsidizes a great price. And if you think about that in the future, a world where everyone is -- everyone is using a smart TV, the smart TV is consolidated to two or three platforms and at hundreds of millions of dollars of subscription and advertising revenue flow through those platforms, mean that's it's a great business. Generally, what we're seeing -- if you look at you look at Roku as a platform, there's lots of different services that consumers can select to stream from. And if you think about ad growth generally from Roku's business point of view, there's a shift of traditional TV ad dollars to streaming in the United States. So I think if you just -- in terms of why is it going to continue to consolidate, it's because the amount of money that goes into building a competitive TV streaming platform is very large and growing."
