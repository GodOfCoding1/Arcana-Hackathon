    "content": " Today, we feel like we've got really good alignment with all of the experts at the FAA, but just again, to be really transparent as part of this 2117 B process, the formal signoff or acceptance of those is something that we're now just kind of going back through and that's been unlocked by this final agreement of our 2117 B G1. The advancements that we've achieved across our aircraft technology with Makers wingborne flight, our certification traction, which was reinforced by the FAA's public comments earlier this week, and our go-to markets -- our go-to-market efforts visible with our joint announcement with United, the first ever eVTOL route, has really increased my conviction that we have the right strategy."
