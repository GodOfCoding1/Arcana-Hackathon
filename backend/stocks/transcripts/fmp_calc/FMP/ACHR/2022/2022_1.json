So we are planning to continue our flight test campaign, resuming in hover, but then going into flights where we translate and fly around, working up towards a complete transition flight, meaning taking off vertically, accelerating forward, then flying with lift only generated by the wing, that's what we consider full transition flight before the end of this year as we've previously said."
