    "content": " Regional Analgesia remains our number one topline growth driver and continues to drive paradigm shifts in patient care with long-acting EXPAREL based nerve and field blocks, accelerated recovery times, and enabling same-day surgeries. In our most recent reported study, sciatic nerve block in the popliteal fossa patients, who received a single-dose EXPAREL block has significantly lower pain scores and require significantly fewer opioids than patients who received a bupivacaine block for the 96 hours after surgery. In our study is a femoral nerve block in the adductor canal for patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty, the EXPAREL group also achieved significantly lower pain scores, while requiring significantly fewer opioids versus bupivacaine for the 96 hours after surgery. Moving forward, with EXPAREL continuing to drive significant and durable operating cash flows, we're well positioned for near and long-term value creation by growing our commercial portfolio through increased market penetration, new indications and enhanced reimbursement, while simultaneously advancing new product development opportunities."
