    "content": " For sales, full year product guidance is as follows: for EXPAREL, we are currently guiding to 2023 global sales of $570 million to $580 million, which is in line with the year-over-year growth rate in 2022. Given ongoing macro uncertainties outside of our control, we believe this is very achievable given several growth initiatives that we expect to kick in as 2023 progresses such as volume expansion for existing for new 340B customers, as well as new initiatives with OMFS, plastics, outpatient, sports management and pain management and rehabilitation health care providers, and our ongoing expansion in European markets. Your line is open. And so, in the outpatient environment, again because these are low margin and in many cases, these are these surgeries in these hospitals are in low income and indigent environments, these patients are getting bupivacaine and opioids: bupivacaine because it's cheap; and opioids because they consider them free because, they write a prescription and they're filled in an outpatient department or on a hospital -- or I'm sorry, at a pharmacy that is part of Part D. So when we talk to those folks and say, in and an arrow where there's reimbursement, what will you do? Because the numbers would suggest that there's millions of patients walking around out there from these three years of COVID that require soft tissue surgery, and we just don't see that demand in the marketplace, David. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open."
