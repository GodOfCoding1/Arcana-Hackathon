    "content": " Before discussing these growth levers in more detail, I will note that this quarter's results in which we reported 48% organic growth in software and payments, now fully lapsed our easier comparative periods as well as two of our largest acquisitions by revenue ShopKeep and Upserve, hopefully using any concerns about the business' ability to deliver strong organic growth while integrating our acquisitions. It's worth noting that within this, we're seeing some ongoing churn from customers brought on from some of our acquisitions in non-core verticals, typically carrying a lower ARPU than our overall average, and typically have a lower GTV profile as well. Looking beyond Q1 fiscal 2023, we remain confident that we will continue to drive organic growth in subscription and transaction-based revenues of 35% to 40%, and we'll continue to realize lower adjusted EBITDA losses as a percentage of revenue on a year-on-year basis. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. The benefits of scale I think we've always talked about, the more GTV we're driving, the better economics we're going to get, more value it's got as we look forward to our supplier network and things like that as well. Your line is open. Your line is open."
