    "content": " Our efforts of upselling our customers on software and payments helped us deliver strong revenue performance this quarter and we continue to see success in our target market of complex SMBs, especially among higher GTV customers. The Lightspeed cloud-based commerce platform can help SMBs to operate with fewer employees by automating time-consuming and mundane tasks, better manage their inventory, understand which menu items drive profitability and repeat business, serve customers through in-store and online channels, and accept and process payments in-person or online. Lightspeed delivered another strong quarter with revenue and adjusted EBITDA loss above previously established outlook, with revenue of $183.7 million growing 38% from Q2 last year and 41% on a constant currency basis. As a result of both the uncertain environment and the highest ROI for us being upselling our base, our go-to-market focus has shifted with the current backdrop to prioritizing high-value GTV customers from a net new perspective and growing our ARPU within our base, primarily through attaching payments. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. So, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s why if you go to our website that I think there is something like 82 job openings for salespeople generally speaking, and a lot of those are going to be or focusing on up-selling the customers with payments and financial services or the outbound motion in hospitality in the U.S. And just a quick one, if I might."
