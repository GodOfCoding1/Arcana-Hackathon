    "content": " We expect to continue to diversify our revenue base by putting more of our customers on Payments, by expanding our international retail customer base through our new Lightspeed Retail offering and by further increasing our North American hospitality presence through our new flagship hospitality offering. We continue to benefit from multiple growth levers, growing our revenue through the combination of location and ARPU growth and expanding our Payments and Financial Solutions across the almost $80 billion of GTV, our customers collectively processed in the trailing 12 months. Finally, I will note that this quarter's results in which we reported 38% organic growth in subscription and transaction-based revenues now fully lap or easier comparative periods that were heavily impacted by COVID as well as all of our acquisitions, except for new order and equity, illustrating the business' ability to deliver strong organic growth while integrating our acquisitions."
