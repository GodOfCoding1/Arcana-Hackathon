    "content": " As previously reported and recently presented in more detail at the Infectious Disease Society of OB/GYN meeting in Boston, the CANDLE study met its primary endpoint with 65.4% of RVVC patients treated with ibrexafungerp achieving clinical success with no recurrence at all, either culture-proven, presumed or suspected, after treatment with ibrexafungerp. Thank you for the question. Thank you for the question. Thank you for the question. Thank you for the question. Thank you for the question. And, Steve, if I can add also another important point is that the fact that BREXAFEMME is able to address the issue in this patients who failed multiple times fluconazole, now we have some really hard data as shown by David with these patients in the CANDLE study who received three doses of fluconazole, which by the way, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d like to remind people is 3 times the approved dose of fluconazole, and they did not respond to three doses of fluconazole, actually they responded well with more than 70% of the patients to a one single-day of BREXAFEMME. So, I believe that now that we have also new data and we will -- we expect with the VANQUISH study to even further confirm in a larger, well-designed study, specifically designed to address this question to show that BREXAFEMME is a good solution for patients who are not responding to fluconazole."
