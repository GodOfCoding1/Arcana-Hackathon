    "content": " We reported positive results from the new interim analysis of the FURI and CARES trials, highlighting all our ibrexafungerp's potency against severe fungal infections with more than 83% of combined patients demonstrating a clinical response to oral ibrexafungerp. Our first commercial product, BREXAFEMME, ibrexafungerp tablets, launched in September 2021, achieved nearly 4,000 prescriptions and reached the net revenues of $700,000 in the first quarter of 2022. We anticipate first subject enroll this quarter, the CARES and FURI study evaluating the ibrexafungerp in patients with candidiasis infections and refractory fungal diseases continue progressing well. And really to try to get an indication that is broad that may allow us to really use the oral ibrexafungerp as a step-down from an IV echinocandin coming from the MARIO, but also to be able to use ibrexafungerp as a salvage therapy in patients that are not responding or not tolerated other antifungal agent. A label that allows you to use as a step-down in a patient that is, let's say, refractory networks is done to step-down normal patient with invasive candidiasis from an idea can be, but also salvage therapy in those patients not tolerated or not responding to all other therapies including basic Candidasis."
