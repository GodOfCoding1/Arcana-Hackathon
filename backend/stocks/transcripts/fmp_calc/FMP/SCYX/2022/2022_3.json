    "content": " We stand ready at the right place and in the right time with a significantly derisked antifungal asset that has already received its first FDA approval for one indication and a rapidly advancing development program addressing critical needs in the antifungal space, including difficult-to-treat and resistant fungal infections, with an anticipated first approval in the hospital setting by late 2024. And so, we believe that with the right development program that we have said, focusing in the indications that are very substantial in life-threatening conditions that we have focused on and with an efficient development program being able to get a favorable label in that regard, we believe that we will be very well positioned to really have a predominant place in the market and predominant place in the treatment  for these patients that have very limited treatment options."
