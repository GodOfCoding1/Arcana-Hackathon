    "content": " Demand for our products remains very strong, and we ended the second quarter with record backlog and awarded orders of $327.2 million an increase of 63% year-over-year and 8% sequentially. For the second quarter, revenue grew 23% versus the prior year period to $73.5 million, driven by increases of 11% in System Solutions and 97% in Components. Brian, when you take a look at the margin profile, as we talked about, the growth that we saw in the backlog and awarded orders throughout the first part of this year, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also continued this trend is very much pointed towards our full System Solutions, specifically BLA. And as I pointed out before, throughout the first part of the year, as it has continued, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen very strong growth in our backlog and awarded orders that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s really driven by the BLA side of things, it does create a higher-margin profile. So that in combination with the fact that in Q2 of \u00e2\u0080\u009821, we had an outsized quarter for full System Solutions compared to components this year, we do expect that with the backlog and awarded orders containing a meaningful amount of BLA itself, that will ultimately continue to grow as components start to remain relatively flat."
