    "content": " Components revenue increased 73% year-over-year, driven by a combination of battery storage shipments, as well as the onboarding of a significant number of new customers. For the first quarter, revenue grew 49% versus the prior period to $68 million, driven by increases of 40% in System Solutions and 73% in Components. As Jason mentioned, the strength in components revenue was driven by the combination of battery storage shipments, as well as the onboarding of a significant number of new customers, which can initially lead to more of a component-level opportunity as we work towards converting them over to our System Solutions. Gross profit as a percentage of revenues was 38.7% compared to 41.2% in the prior year period due to a higher mix of component sales in the quarter, which carried lower margins than System Solutions as well as higher raw material and logistics costs. Based on current market conditions and input from our customers and team, we are reaffirming the low end of our revenue outlook, despite industry challenges and expect 2022 revenues to be in the range of $300 million to $325 million, up 41% to 52% year-over-year. As discussed last quarter, we pulled forward several investments, including the addition of our new facility and significant increase to engineering, sales and HR headcount to support our multiyear growth outlook and growth initiatives over the next several years."
