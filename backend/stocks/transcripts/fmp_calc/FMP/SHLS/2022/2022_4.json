    "content": " System Solutions revenue grew 150% in the fourth quarter of 2022 versus the fourth quarter of 2021, reflecting strong growth in U.S. utility scale solar demand and continued share gains by our products. Based on current market conditions and input from our customers, we expect 2023 revenue to be in the range of $470 million to $510 million, up 44% to 56% year-over-year. One thing I want to add is when you look at the BLA 2.0, kind of pointing back to a combination of what Jeff and Dominic said is, the backlog and awarded orders that we closed out at the end of 2022, it doesn't really represent what I would call BLA 2.0 because we just recently started quoting out that product, as Jeff stated, at the beginning of this year. So we believe working capital, yes, there's always investments when you're a growth company, when you're going from $300 million to, call it, $490 million, $500 million, whatever, in our guidance range there."
