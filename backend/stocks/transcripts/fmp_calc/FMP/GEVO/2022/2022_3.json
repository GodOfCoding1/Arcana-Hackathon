    "content": " I'm confident that the value of what we are doing will begin to be reflected in Gevo's stock price as we continue to move forward with the growth of our business and the deployment of our net zero plants, starting of course, with Net Zero 1. Then we get to Net Zero 1, and I believe that we'll -- because we'll probably enter into a limited notice to do detailed engineering and further site work to take us to the expected close date, the debt and third-party equity close date, I could see us putting another probably $90 million or so into Net Zero 1 to take it to financial close."
