    "content": " Those statements include projections about the timing, development, engineering, financing and construction of Gevo's sustainable aviation fuel projects, its sales agreements, its renewable natural gas project and other activities described in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which are incorporated by reference. Since the first quarter, Gevo's business development team has done a great job to close five additional supply agreements with American Airlines, Alaska Airlines, Japan Airlines, Finnair and Aer Lingus for a combined total volume of 155 million gallons per year of SAF. Collectively then, Gevo now has over 350 million gallons per year of committed SAF offtake that has an applied hydrocarbon revenue value estimated at over $2 billion per year, inclusive of the market -- inclusive of the value of the environmental benefits and based on current market projections and operating assumptions. It's going to show that sustainably produced raw materials can be converted into SAF with energy-efficient production processes, we can displace the fossil-based energy that's the electricity and the heat sources, get rid of the methane from fossil base and swap them out with renewable energy and make it all profitable to produce our jet fuel."
