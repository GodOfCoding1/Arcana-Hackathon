It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Paul Huckfeldt, Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer for Hooker Furniture Corporation. Good morning and welcome to our quarterly conference call to review the financial results for our fiscal 2022 first quarter which ended May 2, 2021. While we expected a sizable sales improvement over last year's first quarter when the pandemic driven economic downturn began in mid to late March, our results this quarter represent a strong improvement over the first quarter of fiscal 2020 as well. In fact, both our quarterly revenues and net profit performance represent record high sales and earnings for the company's fiscal first quarter. I'm especially proud of our team for delivering this strong rebound a year after the onset of the pandemic despite industry wide logistics challenges including higher ocean and freight transit cost, and shipping equipment bottlenecks, raw materials shortages and inflation. We attribute the double-digit gains to industry-wide high consumer demand for home products and dramatic improvements and expansions of our product lines and rationalizing our stocking inventory, helping us to maximize shipping and production capacity along with improving our cash utilization. I'll begin with the Hooker Branded segment, which led the way in the company's record first quarter sales and earnings. And due to the industry-wide demand surge for home furnishings, we were able to sell-through some slow-moving inventory in this favorable demand environment. As a result, the Hooker Branded segment remained highly profitable, thanks to the increased revenues and reduced discounting and contributed over 75% of the consolidated operating profit for the quarter. Given the strong position, we're cautiously optimistic considering the industry-wide supply chain logistics and raw materials shortages and inflation. So, yes, first, I wanted to see if you guys could quantify perhaps the order trend or maybe if you guys can quantify the backlogs that you're seeing now at the end of the first quarter. And then, as far as the price increases, obviously, we're in extraordinary time period given inflation. So, if you're in Domestic Upholstery, you're reacting to raw material increases and shortages of foam and various movement in the -- various movement parts in the furniture that increase as well. So, Domestic Upholstery, you would be looking at, like, two different increases would probably be an accurate number across that segment. When you look at more of the import divisions, the freight, it's really -- it's been unpredicted at best. So you find out end of -- obviously, end of each month, okay, what has happened to freight at this point. So that's been a little more reactionary with a surcharge strategy, which the surcharge is probably changed 3x or 4x on our different import companies. .. yes, so in terms of your SKU rationalization, so obviously, you've benefited from that in the quarter. Yes, so fortunately, we started pretty deep into that exercise on our largest warehouse program, which is really the Hooker Branded product. But really trying to make sure we weren't invest in cash and fees, trying to manage the obsolescence at very low levels, which we've been able to do, and really putting all of our capacity, and all of our utilization of our container space towards A's and B's. And that has definitely helped us weather this storm that we're in, for sure. And it's significant, and it will continue to be significant because we have an extremely disciplined approach about how we're going to utilize our cash for these stocked items. What it essentially does when we have a large transfer product, that we would love to be able to stock up more products in our warehouses, but when we do have large transfers, most of its sold. And then, so this past Monday, we just wrapped up Memorial Day weekend, which was typically a strong selling season for retailers. Everyone we've spoken with has relayed to us that Memorial weekend continued, this very strong demand environment that we're in and so that was encouraging. So we really haven't seen much of a wall in the demand, really since just past the -- just past the start of the pandemic. So, Jeremy, when you joined as CEO at the beginning of February, one of the things you've put in place is project one -- one company one culture. Well, we've been able to quickly see benefits, I believe, from all of our operations coming together, and really supporting each of the 12 businesses with utilizing our scale. So, having one team that's HMI group and other team that\u2019s Hooker Branded and another , so we took all those really good people. And by the way, it was not a -- this was not a cost saving exercise. It was us becoming more efficient, and getting better at what we do and trying to be the best sourcing company that we can be the best quality company, and the best safety. So we try very hard to make sure everyone is running in the same direction, and working on what we need to work on with all the good people that we have. We continue to fine tune our profile regarding what type of company, we would be entrusted in and so our management team is -- and our Board are very well aligned, and what that would look like. And we -- we're very upset before, we're not in a hurry to do anything that wouldn't be positive and the right fit, culturally the right fit, EBITDA  the right fit in all categories, that matter, we want it -- we would want to make sure that it would make an incremental difference and be accretive. I mean, that's -- I'm stating the obvious, but that's where we are. And we're comfortable, actually having this strong balance sheet makes us -- it's been a tradition in this company and it makes us a lot more comfortable weathering these ups and downs. So, we're not in a hurry to spend that money. Well, that's a tough one. Now, obviously, we hope to grow our warehouse businesses, which is like our eCommerce business, in particular. But there's also a new initiative to grow the warehouse business on the Home Meridian side, which is traditionally focused on mega accounts. The cost saving on that is the difference between hauling containers 25 miles or to the Savannah port versus about 300 miles to the -- to our Georgia, North Carolina ports. I mean, it's -- it will take days off the transit process allowing us to ship more quickly. So I think we expect to see incremental growth, but that one is primarily a cost saving. Some of our other major projects, the ERP is it's time to upgrade that ERP. I'm not sure you can pin incremental savings or incremental growth to an ERP project, but those are end of life systems that need to be replaced. So I know I'm dodging your question a little bit, but we think that they're all going to be accretive to the bottom line, maybe not all the top line. We believe we have a nice runway for demand, mainly due to the demographics with millennials really starting to purchase homes and really starting to furnish these homes. And we feel like we have some dynamics that have occurred from the pandemic, with consumers moving out of big cities into larger homes, there's a lot of things going on that do benefit us. And as I said earlier, we're going to compete more for the discretionary dollars being spent on travel and the things that people are going to be able to do post-pandemic, and as this vaccine gets more and more rolled out. But, all in all, that really from our standpoint, it looks -- the future looks bright as far as demand is concerned. Yes, the numbers I've heard is that there's a nationwide shortage of about 4 million homes. And so, even if people are moving into new homes, there's going to be a lot of furniture, we believe there's going to be a lot of furniture purchased. Our next question comes from JP Geygan with Global Value Investment Corp.\n Hey, good morning and congratulations on the strong quarter. I think between the previous two analysts, some of my questions or at least elements have been answered already, but at the risk  of sounding redundant. Well, you are flushing cash right now, I think in your prepared remarks, you said, expect your cash balance to decline modestly throughout the year. But if your strong end markets persist, you'll generate quite a bit of cash going forward. Well, that's I think building the assets to make an acquisition is our primary focus. And, like I said, also we\u2019re -- I think we've got a long standing tradition of being perhaps overly cautious and overly carrying more cash than you might expect that there may be the textbooks will tell you. We, of course, we've been increasing our dividend, which is it's a small use of capital. We've got this ERP project, we've got the Savannah warehouse project, so we're going to have a couple of years. And so far, we've felt like there have always been higher priorities. But you're right, if we continue to generate cash, it's obviously going to be a significant discussion at our Board meetings. As far as the earlier comments, steel is another thing that seems to be a little bit -- we're not as predictable as usual with a lot of movements in motion furniture and whatnot. But the big -- the biggest part of all of this is logistics, the container shortages, the amount of money it takes to get a container from overseas, which we don't believe will -- we believe it will continue, really through probably through the next quarter, but we think there will start to be a light at the end of the tunnel. I mean, it's just like the whole country, this is a bit of a catch up."
