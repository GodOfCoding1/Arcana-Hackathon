    "content": " This morning, we reported consolidated net sales of $147 million, a decrease of $15.5 million or 9.5% compared to last year's first quarter due to sales decreases in the Home Meridian and Hooker Branded segments, driven by continued supply chain disruptions. The Home Meridian and Hooker Branded segments were most impacted by the factory shutdowns in Vietnam and Malaysia, and the resulting sales declines, partially offset by strong sales in Domestic Upholstery segment, and the addition of the revenues of our newly acquired Sunset West business unit in our quarterly results. For Hooker Branded segment, net sales decreased by $9 million or 17.5% compared to the same period a year ago, a decline that was fully driven by casegoods inventory unavailability resulting from the temporary factory shutdowns in Vietnam. Turning now to the Home Meridian segment, net sales decreased in the first quarter by $22 million or 26% compared to the prior year period driven by continued supply chain disruptions and our exit from the unprofitable Clubs channel, as well as lower ecommerce sales reflecting recent trends in that channel. Net sales in this segment increased by $15.8 million, or 62% in the fiscal 2022 quarter due to strong sales at Bradington Young, Sam Moore, and Shenandoah, as well as the addition of Sunset West's sales. Turning now to cash, debt, inventory; cash and cash equivalents stood at $10 million at the end of the quarter, down $59 million as compared to the balance at year-end due to a $30 million increase in inventory, and $26 million spent on the acquisition of Sunset West."
