    "content": " For the fiscal 2023 nine-month period, consolidated net sales decreased by $7 million or 1.5% compared to last year\u00e2\u0080\u0099s same period due to decreases in net sales in the Home Meridian and Hooker branded segment, partially offset by higher sales in the domestic upholstery segment and in our H Contract business. Our Asian suppliers are improving their lead times and Hooker branded inventories are now about $44 million higher than they were at the end of last year\u00e2\u0080\u0099s third quarter, positioning us well for the holiday selling season. Moving to Home Meridian, segment net sales increased by about $4.4 million or 9.4% as compared to the abnormally low volume in the prior year third quarter when container business was severely impacted by the temporary COVID-related factory shutdowns in Vietnam and Malaysia. Due to deflated sales from delayed shipments and higher than expected transition and labor costs related to our new Georgia distribution center, HMI reported an operating loss of $3.2 million, a $7 million improvement from the operating loss in the prior year quarter. Turning now to our cash inventory and debt position, cash and cash equivalents stood at $6.5 million at the fiscal 2023 quarter end, down $62.9 million from the balance at fiscal 2022 year end due primarily to a $58.9 million increase in inventories as well as almost $10 million of share repurchases."
