    "content": " We saw our earnings available for distribution declined to $1.08 for the year and to $0.11 for the fourth quarter, due primarily to a onetime hit for severance for our former CEO and a $250 million fixed rate non-mark-to-market financing we entered into to enhance our liquidity, while protecting us from the impact of increasing interest rates on those assets. We also committed to purchase approximately $700 million of reperforming loans, which we intend to settle into securitizations and believe the returns on these investments are accretive to our shareholders. GAAP book value at the end of the fourth quarter was $7.49 per share, and our economic return on GAAP book value was 3.8% based on the quarterly change in book value and the fourth quarter dividend per common share. On an earnings available for distribution basis, net income in the fourth quarter of approximately $0.11 per diluted common share and $0.16 per diluted common share after excluding a one-time severance expense related to the separation of our former CEO. Historically, the dividend yields on our stock has been around 10% to 12%, and that's where we expect our dividend to -- where our investments are currently yielding, and that's where we see the dividends to be as the return on capital to be expected from the stock."
