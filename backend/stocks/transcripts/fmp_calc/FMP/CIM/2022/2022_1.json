    "content": " Markets reacted swiftly to Fed pronouncements causing two-year treasury notes to increase by 160 basis points, ten year treasury yields increased by 83 basis points and 30 year mortgage rates increased by approximately 160 basis points, all occurring over the course of the first quarter. GAAP book value at the end of first quarter was $10.15 per share and our economic return on GAAP book value was negative 11.5%, based on quarterly change in book value and the first quarter dividend per common share. Given, again, the continued move in rates both on the belly of the curve and the ten year, we project the book value to be down about 4% to 5% since the end of the quarter."
