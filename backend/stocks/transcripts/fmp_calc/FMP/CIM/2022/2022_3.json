    "content": " During the third quarter of 2022, we committed to purchase $687 million residential mortgage loans, $211 of this total settled in October. Given the market outlook for higher rates for an extended period, we entered a $500 million two-year and a $385 million five-year interest rate swap. Entered a new two-year non-mark-to-market secured financing facility for $250 million to finance retained securities from our securitization, and sponsored $145 million CIM 2022-NR1 with existing loans from our warehouse. Sure, so as you just touched upon and I have just mentioned to the prior question, given the challenges within the new issued market currently, like we acquire these loans, where we have also locked in a five-year tenure financing arrangement, which will be on a non-mark-to-market basis, achieving a similar advanced rate that you would get via securitization."
