    "content": " While many believe that the Fed is still in catch-up mode, lenders have become more cautious and the rate of 30-year fixed rate mortgages ended the quarter at 5.83%, an increase of 327 basis points since the start of the year and the highest in over a decade. In total, Chimera's 2 securitizations this quarter created long-term nonrecourse financing for $727 million of loans. On our balance sheet, the combination of $7.7 billion of securitized debt and $818 million of new high-quality super financing arrangement represents 78% of our total liabilities and provides stable financing for Chimera's credit assets during periods of high interest rates, volatility and adverse market conditions. Considering the challenging market environment and hawkish commentary from the Federal Reserve officials, this quarter, we entered a swaption contract for $1 billion notional value, 1 year forward at a fixed rate of 3.26%. But looking at where top of the capital structure is AAA non-QM, AAA prime jumbo loans, even senior parts of the nonrated securitizations are yielding or producing levered returns of mid high -- low mid-teens between 12% to 15% depending on where you're playing. But as that supply has been fleshed to the market and continues to flesh to the market and there's limited supply in the back half of the year, we think spreads should tighten on the top of the capital structure somewhere inside of 200 would be ideal, even if it was 150 to sort of match up with where you could acquire loans today."
