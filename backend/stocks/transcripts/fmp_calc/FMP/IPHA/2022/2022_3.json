    "content": " So as we're bringing this for the first time into the clinic, we decided to go after a very well validated target, and CD20 is obviously one of these, and which is also the advantage when you look at the expression as opposed to other potential validated targets to be quite stable cause a different line of treatment, meaning that if you have like lacutamab relapse patients lot of them are still expecting the target, which basically from our perspective the ideal candidate for this proprietary program in the clinic. So I think that what you are saying is a pretty fair assumption that we can first start with the advanced line of treatment because we are mobilizing a very different mechanism of action as the current approved treatment like monoclonal antibodies or CAR T, but also the one that are in the Phase 3 and late stage development like NK cell engagers. And finally, looking ahead, we'll continue to advance lacutamab program, move our early-stage R&D activity in the clinic with our next generation ANKET platform, while for monalizumab, we look forward to further clinical development in early lung cancer with trial with AstraZeneca underway, which further enforces of course, our strategy of building a sustainable business with robust R&D engine."
