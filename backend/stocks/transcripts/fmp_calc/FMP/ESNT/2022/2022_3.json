    "content": " Net investment income increased $3.3 million or 11% in the third quarter of 2022 compared to last quarter, due primarily to higher yields on new investments and floating rate securities resetting the higher rates. But again, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u0093 even when you get past this Mark, I think you have to look at a normalized credit environment, where we historically have said 2% to 3% claim rates, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been obviously below 1%. So \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and again, I think it looks like \u00e2\u0080\u0093 in terms of the reinsurance market, there's obviously \u00e2\u0080\u0093 you can't all \u00e2\u0080\u0093 that's not a bottomless pit of capital with the reinsurers and probably worsening when you think about just their alternatives, right, with the P&C \u00e2\u0080\u0093 with the pricing hardening so much in the P&C market, even heard one of our competitors saying, they're going to allocate more capital to that."
