    "content": " But do you -- when you really look at the risk here, is it sentiment-driven that there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s home price depreciation, borrowers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 willingness to pay declines because it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t seem like when you think about the big vintages that there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s really much that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to distort the existing policies affordability. So if they think credit is really strong, it's going to be strong over a period of time of the policy, they're going to price appropriately given the capital structure and leverage and all those sort of things. A couple of other things to think through just in terms of credit, just not at that portfolio but just going forward, we said there's a little bit more risk given the elevated HPA. It's -- we feel just more comfortable kind of -- and it's a model that we review it quarterly and we probably make -- we'll tweak it at least once a year for some items but for I think in general, we'll stick with it."
