    "content": " During the first quarter of 2022, as these defaults continue to cure at elevated levels and exceeded the cure rate implied by our 7% claim rate assumption, we revised our estimate of the ultimate claim rate for these defaults from 7% to 4%, which resulted in a benefit being recorded in the provision for losses on the U.S. mortgage insurance portfolio of $101.2 million or $0.78 per diluted share. Your line is open. So Essent was really, I think, the only MI that didn\u2019t grow in terms in force this quarter in what was like an expanding market which I\u2019m assuming reflects at least a somewhat differentiated view on the risk-adjusted returns available in certain pockets of the market. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Just hoping to understand that the current period losses in the quarter, those were up more than $10 million from last quarter on the NODs didn\u2019t move that much. Your line is open."
