    "content": " Income from operations decreased 18.9% to $20.5 million, or 9.8% of sales from $25.2 million, or 17.5% of sales in the second quarter of 2021. Net income decreased to $15.9 million, or 7.6% of sales, compared to $20.6 million, or 14.3% of sales in the second quarter of 2021. And so we saw good significant improvement in June, and that's why we're quite confident that we've got this improvement because our costs are relatively stable starting \u00e2\u0080\u0093 in second quarter, they stabilized. Well, what this amounted to is, once we got the 8% on the plant floor and got the 7% on the plant floor, I felt like that we had caught up and maybe even got a little ahead of the price/cost scenario with gross margin, that we should be towards the upper end of our range is my anticipation, from everything that we're projecting."
