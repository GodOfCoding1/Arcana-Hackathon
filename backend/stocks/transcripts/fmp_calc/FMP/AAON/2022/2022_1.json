    "content": " I\u2019ll be handing the call off to Rebecca, for her to go through the first quarter results. Gary will then provide further insight on the quarter along with our current outlook, and then we\u2019ll open up the call to Q&A. As such, it is subject to the occurrence of many events outside of AAON\u2019s control that could cause AAON\u2019s results to differ materially from those anticipated. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Rebecca. I\u2019d like to begin by discussing the comparative results of the three months ended March 31, 2022 versus March 31, 2021. A record backlog at the beginning of the quarter, along with improved production rates drove the robust volume growth. Record production rates in the first quarter reflect an easing of supply chain issues, greater production capacity and strong performance from our operational team. As a percentage of sales, gross profit was 25.2% compared to 28.6% in the first quarter of 2021. Compared to the first quarter of 2021, gross margin was impacted by higher material costs, along with multiple wage increases and supply chain issues that continue to adversely affect operational efficiencies. We are still not where we want to be, but the first quarter was in line with our internal expectations, and we are on track to achieving target margins later this year. As a percentage of sales, SG&A decreased 12.6% from 12.7% in the first quarter of 2021. The company\u2019s estimated annual 2022 effective tax rate, excluding discrete events, is expected to be approximately 24.9%. Looking at the balance sheet, you\u2019ll see that we had a working capital balance of $169.5 million versus $131.3 million at December 31, 2021. Shareholders\u2019 equity per diluted share is $8.90 at March 31, 2022, compared to $8.68 at December 31, 2021. I\u2019d now like to turn the call over to our CEO and President, Gary Fields. First off, I\u2019d like to state that I\u2019m very happy with the first quarter\u2019s performance. Supply chain issues have eased some, but it\u2019s definitely still an issue. We\u2019re also ramping up our headcount, which comes with challenges. We\u2019re still not where we need to be, but we\u2019re on track to returning to target margins later this year. Considering what we\u2019re seeing with material costs, this is a very positive aspect. To give you a sense, our material and freight cost, excluding the effect of organic volumes being up, we\u2019re up approximately 50%. We\u2019re also doing a good job at managing our SG&A expenses, as Rebecca just walked you through. Now the backlog, March 31, it was $461.4 million, that\u2019s up from $260 million at the end of December and $96.7 million at the end of first quarter 2021. Orders in the quarter were up year-over-year 150% organically, which represented an acceleration from the 67% growth we recognized in the fourth quarter and the 55% growth we saw in the year of 2021. In fact, the year-over-year comp in this past quarter was the toughest we\u2019ve seen in two years, and we still recognize significant acceleration in growth. Growth is certainly much greater than what the market is growing out, so we\u2019re definitely taking market share. All the work we\u2019ve done over the last 18 months with inventory management, productivity improvements and increasing our manufacturing capacity, including both plant and equipment and labor is paying off. So, we\u2019ve never been this well aligned with our sales channel in the history of the company, it\u2019s the best it\u2019s ever been. The heavy lifting is behind this, but we\u2019ve got just a little tweaking to do here and there. It\u2019s been very well received, moving along nicely with that. We\u2019re now almost six months since closing on the acquisition, and we are very pleased with how things have progressed thus far. And like us, they\u2019re being challenged a bit with supply chain issues and inflation, but overall, they\u2019re managing well. In general, using first quarter as a benchmark, we foresee sales margins and earnings will improve throughout the year, with the bulk of the improvement occurring in the back half. Well, it\u2019s absolutely broad-based product family wise. So having the production facility that we built in Longview, we just had an immense amount of production capability there that we\u2019re beginning to realize now. And that\u2019s got to be $2 million, $3 million higher than we\u2019d ever run in previous years. So having that production capability, I\u2019ve always said that the Longview product was more sensitive to lead time than the Tulsa product. And we\u2019ve been able to pull that lead time down very attractive, and that\u2019s proven true. We\u2019re getting some very, very large orders for modular data centers. Now, we\u2019re getting orders for a couple of hundred units at a time. So being able to deliver and be reliable with that, that\u2019s a big deal. In Tulsa, we\u2019ve been building out our infrastructure here for the last few years. I\u2019ll just give you an idea on the headcount, Julio. Hi Gary, it\u2019s Brent Thielman, Davidson. I guess I\u2019m trying to get my head, we just haven\u2019t seen this level book of business before. Well, I think the percentage growth we saw Q4 to Q1, that\u2019s not sustainable at that same acceleration rate. And where we\u2019ve been able to manage our lead times on this is in this pandemic era, people have gotten accustomed to ordering things much further out than what they normally would. So I\u2019ll put a couple of weeks pad on it, and I\u2019ll order it 14 weeks ahead. Well, we\u2019ve got projects that are people are ordering they don\u2019t want until Q4. And that\u2019s allowed us to keep our lead times in check, and we\u2019ve actually been able to take advantage of some quick ship kind of project needs. So that\u2019s \u2013 hopefully, that answers it, if I need to add something else cleared up for me. And I said, well, that\u2019s a great question. You all know I\u2019m a horsemen, so I\u2019m going to use a Horsemen\u2019s term. Fact, no, I\u2019m not going to rein in the orders, I\u2019m going to lay the spurs to production. Well, that\u2019s what we did and gently though. And that\u2019s material because if you can get people to stay here 90 days to six months, then they tend to stay here for a very, very long time. And so that\u2019s one of our efficiency measures that our production team uses, and they\u2019ve been able to add people and keep that number relatively linear. But to the best of our ability to forecast and things have begun to stabilize, while they\u2019re elevated, they\u2019re stabilized. So now that they\u2019ve begun to stabilize, at least in our viewpoint, they have, then we feel fairly confident in our forecasting and what we\u2019re doing. We\u2019re not going to get to that target level next quarter, but we\u2019re going to get closer to it. I think that the second half of the year, we\u2019re going to be right in the center of that range. And bear in mind, we\u2019re doing everything we can to increase the production rate too. But barring anything different than what\u2019s occurred in the last several months, we\u2019ve learned how to navigate a lot of potholes and this team has just done a phenomenal job of doing that and getting units out the door. So yes, I\u2019m confident we\u2019re on growth, top line growth, bottom line, a good solid number throughout the year. Last one, I guess, just on the SG&A, especially the sales dollars pick up here, do you expect to see a little better leverage over that as we advance through the year, this 12.5-odd percent a good ballpark? But Rebecca and I had a discussion about that earlier, and she\u2019s done some preliminary work on that. Like I said, we\u2019re going to be adding production workers, not overhead workers. And when we add production workers, then that\u2019s where that leverage occurs. I\u2019ll let \u2013 I was wondering how we were going to fit this in here, Julio, you just gave me the perfect entree. And so a bit over a year ago, even before we closed on BasX, I went to Acme and said, I\u2019d like to purchase from you all of the tooling, the design documentation, the work documentation, the rights to build these fans. I said, you don\u2019t build them for anyone else, you build them only for us. Well, over the last few years, we\u2019ve been purchasing nearly 40,000 fan wheels a year, 35,000 to 40,000 from them. And of course, you see we\u2019re growing. But the main thing was is the vulnerability of someone else supplying while they\u2019re a great company and we had no reason to doubt that, it was just something that was in our wheelhouse of abilities to add that to the vertical thought process of we manufacture units, we don\u2019t assemble units. There was a comment in the press release, BasX and you\u2019ve learned that revenue synergies are better than initially estimated. And now that they\u2019re part of a larger foundation, then they\u2019re looking at that purchase from BasX as a percentage of the whole enterprise, not as a percentage of BasX. Let\u2019s see here, almost 300% year-over-year."
