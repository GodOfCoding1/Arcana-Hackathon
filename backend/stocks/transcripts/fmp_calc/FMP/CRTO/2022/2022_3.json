    "content": " The growth of Retail Media and Commerce Audiences, combined with the addition of IPONWEB accelerated the shift of our top line mix with non-retargeting solutions representing 41% of contribution ex-TAC in our third quarter, up from 33% in Q2 and up from 28% a year ago. In Marketing Solutions revenue was $387 million, and contribution ex-TAC was up 1% at constant currency to 180 -- sorry, $158 million with growth in Commerce Audiences partially offset by lower retargeting. Organically, we now expect contribution ex-TAC growth of approximately 35% for Retail Media given softer online traffic, lower brand spend and a slower integration of some of our newly signed retailers and contribution ex-TAC growth of approximately 20% to 25% for Commerce Audiences. In terms of Q4, I mean, what we're seeing, and we saw this in Q3 and I would say or we're seeing this from all retailers is there's more targeted and more moderate spend. And we're seeing country-by-country, Americas large retail, Asia Pac, France being, I would say, lower -- light with some big highlights in terms of return back to growth for some of our other markets, including the U.K. U.K. is more resilient than we've seen over the last few months."
