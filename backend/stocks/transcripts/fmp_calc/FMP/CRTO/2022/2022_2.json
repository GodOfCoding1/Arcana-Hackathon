    "content": "  There is a disproportionate amount of advertising spend going to the large utility platforms of search and social because that's where advertisers know that they can reach consumers, but the reality is 73% of consumers start their shopping journey on the open internet, including retailers and digital stores, Amazon and Walmart have tapped into this, creating their own hugely successful digital media properties to attract high margin advertising dollars. During uncertain times, we also expect retail media to continue to grow a brand's ultimate goal of standing out on a digital shelf is to drive more product sales and nearly 70% of advertisers report enhanced returns from their retail media ad spend compared with returns from other channels, according to McKinsey, and a challenging economic environment benefiting from a new high margin revenue stream will be a key advantage for retailers monetizing their digital ad spend on our platform."
