In the RFID division, I think we expect higher gross margin because the effect of the acquisition of Dagesh affected on the--reduced the gross margin during the second and the third quarters, and we completed a round of price upgrades to all of Dagesh customers, price upgrade between 10% to 25%, and it will be affecting gross margin going forward. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know exactly at what level, but these are the trends, so I believe that because we took a loan on the third quarter of the year to finance the acquisition of the facilities, we will face--we will see increase in the financial expenses in the fourth quarter as compared to the third quarter."
