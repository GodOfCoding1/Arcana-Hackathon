    "content": " Given the integrated profile of EDP1815, which is not just effective, but also has placebo-like safety and tolerability, oral delivery and affordable pricing, we anticipate broad usage as a foundational therapy across all stages of psoriasis, atopic dermatitis and other inflammatory diseases. Including by year end where we expect feedback with health authorities with respect to moving EDP1815 in psoriasis into registration trials, we also anticipate initiation of dosing of EDP2939, our first clinical microbial extracellular vesicle candidate. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open."
