    "content": " Beginning on Slide 3, in the third quarter team Dow continued to proactively navigate higher energy costs and geopolitical uncertainties that are impacting consumer demand, particularly in Europe. Turning to our operating segment performance on Slide 4, in the Packaging & Specialty Plastics segment, net sales were $7.3 billion, down 5% year-over-year as price gains and resilient demand in functional polymers were more than offset by lower polyethylene pricing. Sequentially, net sales were down 11%, also driven by lower polyethylene prices with reduced volumes as we decreased operating rates in response to continued global marine pack cargo logistics constraints and lower demand in EMEA. Good morning, Jim and Howard. Good morning, Jim and Howard. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s really where it was, $0.35 to $0.65 in third quarter, and I think next year we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to see continued availability and lower pricing on ethane. Good morning, Jim and Howard. Simple answer two-thirds of the total EBITDA decline in third quarter whether it was versus previous quarter or last year was in EMEAI, and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the impact of high inflation, elevated energy costs on our raw materials and then what that high inflation has done to consumer demand in EMEAI."
