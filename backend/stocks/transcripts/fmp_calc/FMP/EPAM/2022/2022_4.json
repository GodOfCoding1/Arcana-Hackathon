    "content": " Our current view for the year now shows relatively low growth during the first half of the year, with acceleration in growth in the second half of 2023, potentially approaching the high-teens in Q4, and with opportunity to come back to our pre-pandemic 20%-plus organic growth profile right after that. Looking at our results for 2022, we generated over $4.800 billion in revenues, reflecting a greater than 28% year-over-year growth. So that is why with all that, what didn't change at all is our confidence that with what we build and continuously building, we would be able to navigate the challenges and come back to our 20% plus organic growth rate in the next several quarters and to our $10 billion aspiration in the next several years. The company generated revenues of $1.23 billion, a year-over-year increase of 11.2% on a reported basis and 14.4% in constant currency terms, reflecting a negative foreign exchange impact of 320 basis points. Revenues for the year were $4,825 million, producing 28.4% reported growth and 32.4% on a constant-currency basis when compared to 2021. Excluding Russia revenues, reported year-over-year revenue growth would have been approximately 32.1%, and constant currency growth would have been approximately 36.3%. For Q1 of 2023, we expect revenues to be in the range of $1.200 billion to $1.210 billion, producing a year-over-year growth rate of approximately 3%. Your line is now open. Your line is now open.
