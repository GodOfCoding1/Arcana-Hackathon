    "content": " In the third quarter, EPAM delivered $1,230 million in revenues, a 24% year-over-year growth and non-GAAP per share of $3.10, a 30% increase over Q3 2021. I think, it's important to mention that in constant currency terms and with proper adjustment on discontinued revenue in Russia, that growth would be about 35%. During Q3, EPAM generated revenues of $1.23 billion, a year-over-year increase of 24.1% on a reported basis and 29.8% in constant currency terms, reflecting a negative foreign exchange impact of 570 basis points. Non-GAAP income from operations was $232 million or 18.9% of revenue in the quarter, compared to $180 million or 18.2% of revenue in Q3 of last year. Now moving to our Q4 2022 outlook, we expect revenues to be in the range of $1.220 billion to $1.230 billion, producing a year-over-year growth rate of approximately 11% on a reported basis and 15% in constant currency terms, both at the midpoint of the range. Your line is now open. At the same time, I think that we continue to feel good about the growth that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve generated in Q3 and I think the other thing Bryan to point out is that we have the same impact on our growth rate from the exit from Russia, so we had a $50 million Q4 last year and we'll have a single-digit -- mid to low single-digit Russian revenue contribution in Q4 of this year. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. And right now, I just think as I kind of look at the numbers and the likely headcount adds this quarter, it just appears that your trajectory would, sort of, give you the opportunity for a greater than 20% growth in the second half rather than in the first half. Your line is now open. Your line is now open."
