    "content": " Your line is now open. Your line is now open. Well, right now, we are seeing 22% of our centers are ASCs, and after cleaning up a little bit, that is a little bit of an increase, but it is pretty consistent with where we were in the fourth quarter, meaning that while ASCs are opening at a slightly higher rate, we are still very active in opening hospitals and really broadening out with some of the national campaigns we have with Ascension Health and some of the other larger hospital systems, but also getting into the community hospitals as well. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. I think as we said kind of a while back, we do expect that there will be a day that you will see 50% of the centers being ASCs and even 50% of the procedures being conducted in ASC because Inspire lends itself so well to the outpatient setting. Your line is now open. And we have said this before, too, is profitability is important, but we are still so very early in the penetration of potential centers and the potential number of procedures that we are really focused on making those investments by adding new centers, adding new territory managers and making other investments that will drive several quarters and years of revenue growth rather than really optimizing our P&L to produce net income in the short term. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. So we have a good relationship, and hopefully, we can answer all their questions and get the approval yet here in the second quarter, which will really be exciting and really good news for the patients because that goes back in that MRI approval will apply to any patient who has had an Inspire device since the Inspire four was launched maybe four years ago. Your line is now open. Your line is now open."
