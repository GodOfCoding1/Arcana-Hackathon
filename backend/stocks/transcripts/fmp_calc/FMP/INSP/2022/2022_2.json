    "content": " The utilization at existing centers showed a significant increase and was the leading factor in the growth during the quarter, we will continue our balanced approach of increasing utilization at existing centers, as well as opening new centers to grow capacity and improve patient\u00e2\u0080\u0099s access to care. Gross margin in the second quarter, decreased to 84.5% compared to 85.8% in the prior year period, primarily due to higher costs of certain component parts, which is common across the industry, given the current supply chain challenges. Let's go back to the utilization, which was really positive in the second quarter, and really a focus of the team, but we also had 52 new centers, which is still within our guide and very strong, but previously we've been opening centers much higher than that. And I think the utilization is maybe a little bit flat from the first quarter, but I think that has a lot to do with the COVID impact because of COVID cases getting moved to the ASC, but it's going to continue to be a positive push and we expect that will continue to grow. So, that's really going to be a strong benefit for the patients, and we're going to make really strong progress with that study throughout the second half of the year because it's such a relatively easy study to conduct."
