    "content": " Moving on, our international business continues to make strides, growing 28% in the fourth quarter over the prior year over the prior year, despite ongoing headwinds from unfavorable exchange rates. U.S. revenue in the fourth quarter was $134.3 million, an increase of 78% from the $75.6 million in the prior year period. Gross margin in the fourth quarter was 83.9% compared to 85.8% in the prior year period, primarily due to higher costs of certain component parts and additional costs associated with the transition to our new silicone based leads partially offset by the price increase that began in the second quarter. So I think it's going to be a measured success with the growth in international was keeping it's still hovering around the 3% mark as far as global revenue, and we're not going to take our foot off the pedal on the United States, we want to continue to grow utilization and really focus on the U.S. market as well."
