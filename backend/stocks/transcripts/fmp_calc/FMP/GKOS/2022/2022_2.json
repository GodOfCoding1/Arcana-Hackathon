    "content": " As a reminder, the second quarter represents a challenging year-over-year comparable for many in the MedTech industry, but in particular for Glaukos, we are raising our 2022 net sales guidance range to $275 million to $280 million versus $270 million to $275 million previously, given our solid execution globally, better than expected second quarter results, and latest board outlook. I think this product represents an incredibly different paradigm change to be able to treat, the kind of, a simple injection as a standalone procedure, I expect that it will be will be used to be able to overcome issues of non-compliance and glaucoma, issues of allergy with the disease state, issues of patients who have underlying ocular surface disease, so you don't have to continue to pour topical agents that have toxic preservatives in the formulation on the surface of the eye. And so to your second question, you were talking about pharmaceutical business, I think he needs to bifurcate, this new approach into really two sections, one, surgical pharmaceuticals and by those I would list iDose, iDose TREX, iRock if we're successful, bringing that forward, products like crosslinking, which really are a surgical pharmaceutical. I think actually, the only thing that we said was the pre-submission activities are ongoing, which you'd expect and probably the only news that in Tom's prepared remarks that we referenced was that, that he's prepared to provide the iDose data prior to year-end, which was a little bit move forward from some of the prior guidance that we'd given."
