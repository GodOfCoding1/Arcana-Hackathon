    "content": " You think about the CMS cut the related headwinds from that, the investor and even really our own expectations entering the year to finish 2022 nearly flat to 2021 on a constant currency basis, really I think, speaks to the strength of our products, our commercial organization and our sales team specifically. I think those same things hopefully will benefit us as we continue on our journey here in 2023, and we continue to add more access to these products through iStent infinite and really providing what we think are best-in-class alternatives to customers that have been our customers for a long time. And I think we've tried to factor in pretty much all the dynamics, our expectations around any continued headwinds associated with the CMS pro fee cuts, staff and considerations, our new product launches and additional coverage and reimbursement for some of those. What I think we're more focused on with iStent infinite is really something you've heard Tom talk a lot about, which is since the for the founding of our company, the idea that we can truly drive interventional glaucoma mindset and start treating these patients in a stand-alone manner irregardless of respect of whether they've got cataracts or not."
