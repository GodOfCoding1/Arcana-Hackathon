And then maybe if I can just sort of switch topics here for a second, and I hate to be so near-term focus but as it relates to the guidance so if you beat the quarter, you beat the street buys, it's pretty handedly $7 million or so on the quarter, but only raising full-year range by I think it's $2.5 million. First, we provided guidance for the year and not the quarter, and while it's fair to say we were pleased with the first quarter results and how it turned out versus our expectations coming into the year and really acknowledged that, and also to say largely that performance was without the benefit of new products, I think on the positive side, as we think about the setup for the remainder of the year. Please go ahead, your line is open. So I wouldn't get too far ahead of your contribution from those products at this stage, ultimately we'll have a lot more, I think to say as the year progresses around how those are being adopted in utilizing what it's doing in terms of driving our top-line. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Obviously -- I'll start with the latter and say we've obviously factored that in originally, all competitive dynamics, including Alcon's acquisition of Ivantis, we set our guidance for the year and we factored in as we thought about the raising of the bottom line of the guidance this time, so we factored that in financially in our expectations for the year. Your line is open. I think it's a good question, but the answer is no, I don't think there was really any stocking dynamics associated with the first-quarter results, if anything, you had a little bit more noise associated with COVID and just the general sort of environment. Your line is open."
