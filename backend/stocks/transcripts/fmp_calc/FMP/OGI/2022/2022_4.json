    "content": " The cost of sales in Q4 fiscal '21 was $37 million compared to $26 million in Q4 fiscal 2021, an increase of 42%. On an annual basis, adjusted gross margin was $33.4 million or 23% of revenue as compared to 3.6 million or 5% for the prior fiscal year. From a statement of cash flow's perspective, beginning with operating activities, there was net cash used of $36 million during the year, and this was mainly driven by the increase to our working capital assets, which grew as a result of higher sales and production levels. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. So, I won't give guidance on the exact margins that can come from this, but our main offerings are in the flower categories and the main cost of the cost of cultivation kind of seemly significant decrease on the cost of cultivation as we leave fiscal 2022 just based on getting to scale. It would be more sustaining capital and as a consequence, as we get into the first part of fiscal '24, we would expect that positive operating cash flow with nominal CapEx will lead us to a positive free cash flow and that's why we indicated in the guidance by the end of calendar '23, which covers our first quarter of next year, of fiscal '24. Your line is open. So we're not giving guidance specifically by quarter, but we would certainly see the year fiscal '23 being higher than fiscal '22 in a significant way as a consequence of overall sales being higher and cost of production being much lower than it was for fiscal '22. Your line is open."
