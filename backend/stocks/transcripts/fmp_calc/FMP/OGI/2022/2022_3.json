    "content": " So just taking your operational capacity from, say, the 55,000 kilos that we had on average in the quarter, up to an 82,000 and not having to add significantly at all to a fixed cost component, it is going to have a meaningful positive impact to our cost of production once we are operating at that level on a sustained basis, which will improve the margins in our flower categories, but our margins are positive in all our flower categories and how we're just looking, of course, to improve them, and we feel that we will, and that's why we've given the guidance that we expect to have improvements to the margins in the future quarter Q4 and onwards, along with the EBITDA as we continue to realize the savings just from the economies of scale."
