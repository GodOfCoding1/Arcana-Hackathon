    "content": " Revenue from TiO2 sales was $773 million, an increase of 11%, driven by 20% increase in average selling prices on a local currency basis or an 18% increase on a US dollar basis, partially offset by a 6% decrease in volumes. Our adjusted EBITDA growth of 7% to $240 million was driven by higher pricing across all products and favorable exchange rate, partially offset by higher cost to serve our customer including increased commodity costs, lower volume and unfavorable product mix, primarily due to zircon."
