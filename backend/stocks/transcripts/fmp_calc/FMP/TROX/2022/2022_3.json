    "content": " While revenue for these co-product streams is less than $30 million year-to-date, the rising interest has driven a 74% increase in high-value co-product revenues year-over-year, enabling Tronox to realize greater value from what it was previously viewed as waste. Turning to slide six, our third quarter revenue of $895 million represented a 3% increase, driven by higher TiO2, zircon, and pig iron prices and higher pig iron volumes. So looking to the remainder of the year, we expect fourth quarter pigment demand to decline 25% to 30% sequentially driven by customer destocking continued weakness in Europe, Middle East and Africa and Asia Pacific and seasonal weakness in the Americas. Look, it's clear that with a 25% and 30% drop in one quarter that changed the dynamic, but one quarter cannot make an adjustment for price on projects that takes five to 10 years to realize. So that flow-through that we talk about moving into the second \u00e2\u0080\u0093 into the first quarter of next year, some of that's going to hit us this year, because we don't have the amount of inventory that we had historically. And on top of that the recession case that we outlined was for a 10% volume decline, we don't expect 25% to 30% volume declines going forward because of the destocking that's happened. And this year, it's over a $200 million use which is like 10% of your current market cap today."
