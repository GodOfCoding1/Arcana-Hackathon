    "content": " For the fiscal third quarter ended September 30, 2022, D-Wave's consolidated revenue totaled $1.7 million, which represents an increase of $388,000 or 30% from $1.3 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2021 and an increase of $324,000 or 24% from the immediately preceding fiscal 2022 second quarter revenue of $1.4 million. With respect to the composition of revenue, our QCaaS or quantum computing as-a-service revenue ,totaled $1.346 million in the third quarter, which represents a $366,000 or 37% increase from $980,000 in the third quarter of fiscal 2021 and an increase of $170,000 or 14% when compared to the immediately preceding fiscal 2022 second quarter QCaaS revenue of $1,176 million. Professional services revenue totaled $347,000 in the third quarter, which represents a 13% increase from $306,000 in the third quarter of fiscal 2021 and a 122% increase from $156,000 in the immediately preceding fiscal 2022 second quarter. Gross profit for the third quarter, ended September 30, was $1.1 million, an increase of $86,000 or 9% in the third quarter of fiscal 2021 and an increase of $301,000 or 38% from the immediately preceding second quarter gross profit of $785,000. The year-over-year decrease in gross margin was due to a higher than normal professional services gross margins in the first nine months of fiscal 2021 due to a significant high margin non-recurring revenue contract as well as lower QSaaS gross margins due to an incrementally higher investment in customer-facing activities, while the sequential quarter-to-quarter improvement in gross margin was driven primarily by the improvements in QSaaS gross margins. GAAP operating expenses for the third quarter of fiscal 2022 were $16.4 million, an increase of $5.6 million, or 52% from $10.8 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2021. From a non-GAAP perspective, the non-GAAP operating expenses for the third quarter of fiscal 2022 was $13.6 million, an increase of $3.4 million, or 33% from $10.2 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2021, with the primary difference between the GAAP and the non-GAAP operating expenses being non-cash depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation expense and non-recurring expenses associated with our recent business combination that was completed on August 5 of this year. Net loss for the third quarter of fiscal 2022 was $13.1 million, or $0.11 per share, compared to $4.2 million, or $0.03 per share in the year earlier period, and $13.2 million, or $0.12 per share in the immediately preceding fiscal 2022 second quarter. D-Wave\u00e2\u0080\u0099s consolidated revenue for the nine months ended September 30 was $4.8 million, which represents an increase of $925,000, or 24% from $3.9 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2021, with over 90% of the increase driven by the growth in QSaaS revenue. QSaaS revenue for the nine months ended September 30 totaled $3.9 million, which represents an $842,000, or 27% increase from $3.1 million recorded in the first nine months of fiscal 2021. Professional services revenue for the nine months ended September 30th totaled $812,000, which represents an increase of $86,000 or 12% from $736,000 in the first nine months of fiscal 2021. In addition, during the first nine months of fiscal 2022, D-Wave had a total of 105 customers in the aggregate, also a milestone for D-Wave that represents an increase of 24 customers or a 30% increase from 81 total customers in the first nine months of fiscal 2021, with the difference between the number of total customers and the number of commercial customers, being educational and government customers. GAAP operating expenses for the nine months ended September 30th were $40.9 million, an increase of $9.8 million or 32% from $31.1 million in the year earlier period. Non-GAAP operating expenses for the nine months ended September 30 were $35.8 million, an increase of $6.4 million or 22% from $29.4 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2021. Net loss for the nine months ended September 30th, 2022, was $37.9 million or $0.31 per share, compared with $17.7 million or 14% or $0.14 per share in the nine months ended September 30th, 2021. To reiterate that guidance, revenue is expected to be in the range of $7 million to $9 million, and adjusted EBITDA is expected to be less than negative $49 million As we have previously outlined, D-Wave's business model incorporates a high-degree of operating leverage and is very capital efficient, providing us with significant flexibility with respect to the magnitude, timing and pace of operating expenses and the associated cash impact. You talked about the midpoint of the guidance you've maintained at least at 7% to 9%, but that midpoint kind of suggests about $3.2 million range in the fourth quarter, and that's a pretty significant step up sequentially."
