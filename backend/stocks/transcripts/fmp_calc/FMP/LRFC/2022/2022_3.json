    "content": " While Patrick will provide additional details in the portfolio I would like to highlight that, we believe Logan Ridge's portfolio is strong and substantially de-risked, having increased diversity from 32 portfolio companies when we took managing the portfolio on July 1, 2021 to 54 portfolio companies as of September 30, 2022. At quarter end, our debt investment portfolio represents 79.4% of the total portfolio at fair value and had a weighted average annualized yield of approximately 8.9% excluding income from non-accruals and collateralized loan obligations or 9.7% when excluding our debt securities and non-accrual from both the numerator and denominator. Thus, our investment portfolio as September 30, 2022 consisted of investments in 54 portfolio companies with a fair value of approximately 193.1 million or an average investment size of $3.6 million. Additionally, subsequent to the quarter end, we exited Burke American Auto Parts Group LLC at the September 30th fair value, further reducing our non-yielding equity portfolio to 15.6% of the portfolio on a fair value basis."
