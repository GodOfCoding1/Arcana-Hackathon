    "content": " The fair value of our investment portfolio grew to approximately $207 million, driven primarily by unrealized depreciation on the portfolio and the judicious deployment of proceeds generated from exiting the legacy portfolio into interest earning investments originated by the BC Partners Credit platform. The fair value of our investment portfolio as of March 31, 2022 grew by $8.7 million to $206.9 million, as of March 31, 2022 from $198.2 million as of the prior quarter due to unrealized depreciation on the portfolio and net deployment. Regarding non-accruals, as of March 31, 2022, we had debt investments in two portfolio companies on non-accrual status with an aggregate cost of $12.7 million in fair value of $7.0 million, which represented 6.4% and 3.4% of the investment portfolio, respectively. This remains fairly unchanged from the prior period, which we reported non-accrual debt investments in two portfolio companies with an aggregate amortized cost of $12.7 million and an aggregate fair value of $7.6 million. Outside of net investment income for the quarters ended March 31, 2022 and 2021, we reported $200,000 and $27.2 million of net change in unrealized appreciation and investments respectively. Net asset value as of quarter end declined slightly to $106.2 million or $39.16 per share compared to $107.1 million or $39.48 per share as of December 31, 2021, despite the general uncertainty in the market and environmental conditions. The amendment to the KeyBank credit facility increased the initial commitment from $25 million to $75 million, extended the maturity date to 2027 from 2023, and decreased the interest rate to one month term so far plus 290 basis points with a 40 basis point floor during the revolving period from one month LIBOR and 350 basis points subject to a 75 basis point forward (ph)."
