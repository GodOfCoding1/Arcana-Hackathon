    "content": " As a result of these factors, combined with the favorable factors of increased shipment volume potential of the current backlog and expected additional bookings in 2022, enhanced pricing and renewal of U.S. tariff exclusions, we expect the Lift Truck business to have a larger 2022 operating and net loss in the second quarter than in the first quarter, moderating operating and net losses in the third quarter and a substantial profit in the fourth quarter."
