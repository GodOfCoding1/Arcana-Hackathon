    "content": " Bookings also declined versus 2022 second quarter, we expect lower booking trend to continue in the fourth quarter and for the full year 2023 compared to their prospective prior year period as a result of slowing economic activity worldwide. The backlog price improvement support future unit margin expansion as we continue to work through our backlog in the fourth quarter and into 2023, these lower margin units priced in prior years should represent a decreasing portion of our overall production. Global taxation challenges aside, our ongoing efforts to work through the improving but lower-priced, lower-margin backlog layers in the fourth quarter and early 2023 are expected to lead to improving margins and a return to solid operating profit and net income for the full year 2023."
