    "content": " Said differently, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been producing the oldest and lowest margin units and adding booking and shipping units with much improved economics with each passing quarter to quantify this benefit, the average sales price of a backlog unit increased by nearly 35% year-over-year and almost 7% sequentially. The lift truck business\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fourth quarter operating profit improved substantially year-over-year despite a $16 million increase in manufacturing costs caused by component shortage related inefficiencies, higher labor related costs, and $10 million of unfavorable foreign currency impacts. So that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a very fortunate condition from our point of view, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also the result of the \u00e2\u0080\u0093 some of the strategic programs that I outlined, particularly the modular and scalable product program and the way it comes online first with the two to three ton pneumatic trucks, and then it cascade into other trucks including the more standard types of trucks that are below the base levels of our most recently introduced modular and scalable trucks. When I think about and I know this isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t a one quarter or two quarter story, but when I think about the expectations that working capital trends down for multiple factors, but as supply chain constraints ease and you catch up on sales to orders, certainly that trend should grow in 2023, which would indicate much healthier cash flow as we think about that priority \u00e2\u0080\u0093 immediate priority reducing debt."
