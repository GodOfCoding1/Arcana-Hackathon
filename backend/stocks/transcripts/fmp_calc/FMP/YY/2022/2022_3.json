    "content": " During the first three quarters of 2022, our BIGO segment expanded its non-GAAP net profit to $230.4 million, up 193.3% year-over-year. During the third quarter, Hago's livestreaming revenue and number of paying users both increased year-over-year, while its operating loss further narrowed substantially over the previous quarter thanks to enhanced monetization and disciplined spending. Our total net revenues for the third quarter was $586.7 million compared to $650.5 million in the same period of 2021, primarily due to macroeconomic uncertainties and unfavorable exchange rates which negatively affect paying user sentiment. GAAP net income from continuing operations attributable to controlling interest of JOYY in the third quarter of 2022 was $515.3 million compared to net income of $7.5 million in the same period of 2021, mainly due to the one-off remeasurement gain of an equity investment recorded upon the company's consolidation of investees as announced on August 22, 2022. Notably, BIGO's non-GAAP net income expanded to $84.1 million in the third quarter, with its non-GAAP net income margin improved to 17.4% from 8.7% in the prior year period. It means that for the first three quarters of 2022, BIGO segment accumulated non-GAAP net profit has reached $230.4 million, up by 193.3% year-over-year."
