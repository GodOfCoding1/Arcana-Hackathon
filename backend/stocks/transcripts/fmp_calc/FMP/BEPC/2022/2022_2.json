    "content": " We are fortunate that with the recent acquisitions we have made this year including Urban Grid, our U.S. based utility-scale solar and storage developer, along with the recent acquisitions in growth of our DG business, as well as our CCS joint venture, and our green hydrogen development pipeline, that we are uniquely positioned to benefit from the bill. But what this business needs is capital to one, grow and two, decarbonize, and they reached out to us and we created a structure that we can help support them, both, financially as a capital provider, but also as our operating partner in achieving those goals and really the near-term opportunity is facilitating the build out of a 1.3 gigawatt renewables development pipeline that they have across their portfolio. No doubt we continue to have a large team around the world that is pursuing and manufacturing transactions the way it always has in the past, but no doubt the launch and the recent conclusion of the fund raise of BGTF has been very helpful in highlighting how we can be that very helpful provider of capital, as well as operating partner for businesses, one, looking to scale decarbonization solutions, but two, who need a partner and a capital provider to decarbonize their own operations and no doubt, some of that inbound interest is showing up in the level of growth we're seeing in our business today. It's available for the benefit of pricing and locking those in on a forward basis at the rate at the time would have led to $120 million of benefit per annum, and what we say is that number is only been de-risked in the sense that we have been executing and since that point, power markets have actually seen some beneficial push upwards as well, and so there's probably a little bit of tailwinds to that as well. The other thing I would highlight is, when we buy developers, it is probably flippant to say there is a free option on the development pipeline, not if probably unfair, but when we do our due diligence and underwriting, what we do is we look at what is operating, what is very advanced, and we look at all the different stages of assets in the development pipeline and typically go site-by-site to determine the probability of those assets coming through and coming out of the ground in the near-term and what I would say is, you do attribute some value to the optionality of some of the early-stage projects, but I would say that the value we attribute to those is very, very low and we've probably seen some significant gains there over the last 12 to 18 months. One shift we are seeing in Europe and it absolutely has room to run is, governments are working to reduce some of the obstacles around permitting and building renewables and working to accelerate the process of bringing projects out of the ground, and we've seen across a number of markets in Europe and that's no doubt, benefiting our ability to pull some of those projects forward."
