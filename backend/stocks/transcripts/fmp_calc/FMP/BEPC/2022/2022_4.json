    "content": " During the year, we agreed to invest up to $4.6 billion or $1.4 billion net to Brookfield Renewable of capital into our renewable development initiatives through both organic growth within our existing business and by acquiring new complementary platforms that enhance our current offering. If that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s point one, the other thing that we would highlight is with the rise in rates in some of the market uncertainty and perhaps capital scarcity in the market, we do believe that we are going to see more opportunities in 2023 to buy operating assets than perhaps we saw in last year or the year before that. Even when you look at something like Scout Energy that we did at the end of last year, you could already see the market moving in that direction as when we bought Scout, it comes with not only a very large pipeline of future development opportunities, but a large portfolio of operating assets as well."
