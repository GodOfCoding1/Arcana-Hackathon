    "content": " We also dramatically strengthened our cash position with the addition of a $30 million pipe and the debt refinancing, we finalized with Hayfin, ending the quarter with over $132 million in cash and we continue to advance the Phase 1 study of our levothyroxine product. We are therefore affirming our previously announced guidance of $100 million to $120 million in total net product revenue for 2022, realizing $50 million in synergies from the Strongbridge acquisition by year end 2022. Total net product revenue was $21.9 million for the first quarter, representing a 33% increase over pro forma first quarter 2021 revenue. Just to wrap up my comments on revenue performance in the first quarter and looking ahead of it, we had a solid quarter and we continue to feel confident based on the underlying fundamentals driving the growth of the business that we will furnish within the range of $105 million to $120 million for full year 2022 net product revenue. Our net operating investing cash burn for the quarter was approximately $42 million, which was driven by our net loss in Q1, coupled with changes in working capital, primarily related to an increase to accounts receivable from higher sales and a decline in accrued liabilities from year end 2021. As you just heard, we are off to a good start for 2022 in the first quarter and we can\u2019t say often enough that we generated approximately $22 million in net product revenue. And importantly, we are well positioned to achieve our 2022 guidance of net product revenues of $105 million to $120 million, $50 in synergies from Strongbridge acquisition, year-end cash balance of $90 million to $110 million and cash flow breakeven assuming we're on our guidance by year end 2023. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. Your line is now open."
