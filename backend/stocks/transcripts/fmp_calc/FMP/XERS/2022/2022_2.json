    "content": " We generated a record $25.3 million in net product revenue in the quarter, which is a 34% increase, compared to Q2 last year on a pro forma basis. Importantly, our year-to-date performance of all three products gives us confidence to reiterate our guidance of net product revenue between $105 million and $120 million. Keveyis had its best quarter-to-date in terms of net revenue at $12.8 million, year-to-date Keveyis net revenue has grown 20% over the same period in 2021 on a pro forma basis, and we expect to continue to grow Keveyis for the foreseeable future. Gvoke had another strong quarterly performance with net revenue of $11.5 million for the second quarter and year-to-date Gvoke sales increased 42%, compared to the same period last year. Total net product revenue was $25.3 million for the second quarter, representing a 34% increase over the same quarter last year on a pro forma basis. Breaking it down by product, Gvoke net revenue for the quarter was $11.5 million or a 30% increase, compared to the same period last year. This increase was driven by continued growth in prescriptions topping 34,000 for the first time, more than a 60% increase, compared to prior year Q2, partially offset by a decrease in net pricing, which I will explain in detail later. Year-to-date net revenue for Gvoke was $23.9 million or a 42% increase, compared to the same period last year. Keveyis net revenue for the quarter was $12.8 million or a 28% increase, compared to the same period last year on a pro forma basis. On a year to date basis, Keveyis net revenue was $22.1 million or a 20% increase, compared to the same period last year on a pro forma basis. Research and development expenses increased $0.6 million or roughly 6% for the six months ended June 30, 2022, compared to prior year."
