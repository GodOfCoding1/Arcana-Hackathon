    "content": " This event was held late in the third quarter compared to the previous year when it was earlier and we saw continuing demand for intra oral imaging chair side mills, 2D, 3D digital, extra oral imaging devices, 3D printing with a number of other manufacturers too and of course, all the CAT CAM lines work that well also from an audit taking point of view leading to probably a stronger than believe fourth quarter in a market that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re doing quite well in generally. So another bright spot in the organization in our performance, the sales growth in local currencies and our medical business continued, which continued to be excellent during the third quarter when excluding PPE and COVID tests kits largely pricing issues, PPE related to gloves, and tests kits just relating to demand for the test kits which we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve discussed on several calls in the past, our expectations were relatively in line on the test kits, specifically. Sales of dental specialty products were approximately $223 million in the third quarter, with LCI growth of 2.5% compared with the prior year. During the third quarter, our technology and value added services businesses, together with our dental specialty products achieved total sales growth of 0.8% and LCI sales growth of 3.2%. In North America, LCI growth was 9.3% when excluding sales of PPE and COVID-19 test kits, led by strong growth in sales of pharmaceuticals, medical equipment, and point of care diagnostic products.
