    "content": " We are positioned for value creation with stable long-term rate base growth of 5% to 7%, driven by $2.5 billion to $3.5 billion of investments over the next five years. If approved, we expect this will result in a nearly 40% increase in rate base or $711 million, of which a $190 million is part of our proposed 12-month post test-year plan adjustment. As Greg Peterson will note, during the full company guidance, Centuri reaffirms its guidance for 2022 and is also expecting strong sustained growth during the 2022 to 2026 five-year period, including revenue compound annual growth rate of 7% to 8% percent, adjusted EBITDA compound annual growth rate of 9% to 11%, adjusted EBITDA margin of 11.5% to 13% by 2026 and beyond. Those new customers provided about half of the $14 million margin increase between the quarters with the other half coming primarily from recoveries under the VSP and coil programs in Arizona, as well as rates release in California. At Centuri, first quarter revenues were $524 million reflecting 13% organic growth. As shown on Slide 18, consolidated adjusted net income was a $106 million in the first quarter of 2022 compared to a $117 million in the first quarter of 2021. Investments in our natural gas distribution will be $650 million to $700 million during 2022 and are expected to be $2.5 billion to $3.5 billion through 2026, resulting in rate base increasing at a compound annual growth rate of 5% to 7%. At our newer subsidiary, MountainWest, we anticipate revenues will be $240 million to $245 million in 2022, with a run rate EBITDA margin of 68% to 72%. Please go ahead, your line is open. Please go ahead, your line is open."
