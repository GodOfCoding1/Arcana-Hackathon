    "content": " During the quarter, our capital markets activity was highlighted by the issuance of over $1.7 billion of equity, primarily through our ATM program, which enabled us to simultaneously complete the VEREIT merger and finance a record quarter for acquisitions while finishing the year within our targeted leverage parameters. In fourth quarter, our business generated $0.94 of AFFO per share, supported by our healthy portfolio, closing of the VEREIT merger, strong acquisition pace and collection of almost 100% of contractual rent during the fourth quarter. Having said that, it is true that the cost of debt in Europe, even in this increasing rate environment, continues to be less than what we can achieve here in the U.S. Today, I would say, if you were to look at a 10-year unsecured, it's probably in the 3.1%, 3.2% ZIP code for us. And then in terms of what you would have seen in the fourth quarter, because of those strong theater collections, we actually recorded total bad debt expense of less than $1 million and less than $15 million for the entire year because of the fact that we had those strong collections."
