    "content": "  Our increased guidance range represents an improvement of 2.7% at the midpoint compared to our prior range as well as an improvement of 5% at the midpoint versus last year and is a function of several tailwinds to our business: first, an increase to our 2021 acquisition volume guidance to approximately $4.5 billion; second, the continued improvement in rent collections from our theater clients; third, our well-priced capital markets activity since the start of June, which further positioned our balance sheet for continued growth; fourth, our active asset management activities, which resulted in occupancy of 98.5% at quarter end and rent recapture rates in excess of 104% on lease expirations during the quarter; fifth, the overall quality of our portfolio, which has been curated, refined and underwritten over our 52-year history continues to perform throughout a variety of environments."
