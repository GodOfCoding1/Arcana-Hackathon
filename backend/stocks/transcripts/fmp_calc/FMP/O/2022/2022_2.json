    "content": " First, as demonstrated by the weighted average 5.7% cash cap rate, we were able to achieve on our investments in the second quarter, cap rates are moving higher in our target markets. As we issued approximately $1.8 billion of long-term and permanent capital, including nearly $1.1 billion of equity through our ATM program and a \u00c2\u00a3600 million private placement note offering which priced at a weighted average fixed interest rate of 3.22% with a blended tenure of 10.5 years. But as you know, there is an adjustment period, which is why we have increased our acquisition guidance to over $6 billion from over $5 billion as a testament to what we are seeing in terms of benefits accruing to us, based on some of what I just discussed, we are starting to see a lot more transactions coming back to us those that we were not willing to price at the levels that the sellers were expecting when they initially brought it to us, are now coming back with an adjusted cap rate, which works."
