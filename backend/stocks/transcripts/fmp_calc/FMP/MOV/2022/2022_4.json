This resulted in record sales of $732.4 million for the year, up 44.6% over the last year and 4.5% versus two years ago. Our adjusted operating profit was $37.9 million in the fourth quarter and reached a record $119.7 million for the year, driving increases of 59% and 290%, respectively. For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, sales were $206 million as compared to $178.3 million last year, an increase of 15.5%. Cash at the end of the year \u2013 at the end of the fiscal year was $277.1 million, an increase of $53.3 million over last year, even as we paid down $21.2 million of debt and repurchased $22.6 million of common stock during the year. Inventory at the end of the quarter was up $7.7 million or 5% above the same period of last year, while sales increased 15.5% in the fourth quarter. Taking this into account, we currently expect fiscal 2023 net sales in a range of approximately $780 million to $800 million, gross profit of approximately 58% of net sales and operating income in a range of $125 million to $130 million."
