    "content": " Sales were $182.8 million as compared to $173.9 million last year, an increase of 5.1%, which exceeded our expectations of 2% to 4% growth. Sales for the 6-month period ended July 31, 2022, were $346.2 million as compared to $308.7 million last year. Inventory at the end of the quarter was up $31.7 million or 17.3%, above the same period of last year, primarily due to the timing of receipts and the addition of the Calvin Klein brand to our portfolio. So on both of those, yes, our outlook does factor that there's going to be continued weakness in the U.S. and I think really due to 2 factors: one is the inflation, and two is the continued lapping of stimulus that -- on the consumer that really did occur throughout the year last year and probably ends at the end of December."
