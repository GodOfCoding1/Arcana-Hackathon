    "content": " For the third quarter of fiscal 2023, sales were $211.4 million as compared to $217.7 million last year, a decrease of 2.9%. For the 3 months ended October 31, 2022, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates related to our foreign subsidiaries positively impacted operating expenses by $1.7 million when compared to the prior year period. As a result of the decrease in sales and gross margin, partially offset by the decrease in operating expenses in the third quarter, operating income was $38.9 million as compared to $42.2 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2022. Sales for the 9-month period ended October 31, 2022, were $557.6 million as compared to $526.4 million last year. Inventory at the end of the quarter was up $44.3 million or 25.9% above the same period of last year, primarily due to the timing of receipts and the addition of approximately $8 million of Calvin Klein inventory."
