    "content": " This year marks Skechers' 30th anniversary, and our accomplishments this quarter and year-to-date are a testament to the strength of the Skechers brand, the creative talents of our design team who continue to evolve our leading comfort technologies, the strong execution by our management to build efficiencies to better serve our customers and the commitment of our global workforce to drive growth in the face of ongoing COVID-related economic and political challenges. Our brand strength and the efforts to meet the broad-based demand for our innovative comfort product resulted in a new quarterly sales record of $1.87 billion, an especially remarkable achievement given the macroeconomic headwinds, supply chain issues and COVID-related restrictions, primarily in China. Wholesale sales increased 18% year-over-year to $1.14 billion, led by 30% growth domestically and 10% growth internationally despite ongoing COVID-related restrictions in China. Direct-to-Consumer sales increased 4% year-over-year to $727.5 million driven by a 10% growth internationally, partially offset by a 2% decline domestically, where we faced difficult comparisons to last year when markets reopened, and federal stimulus payments drove outsized consumer demand. I would note, as an aside, I think on the Direct-to-Consumer side of things, we did have some issues getting product into stores as quickly as we wanted to, some of the newer product in particular that had been prioritized and that no doubt created a small headwind on the DTC side that could have been probably evidenced by a slightly more favorable comp store sales performance in the retail side of the business."
