    "content": " Once again, exceeding the 7% to 9% guidance range we provided for the year, the terrific performance on the top line resulted in 14% adjusted EPS growth to $1.56 bringing our year-to-date adjusted EPS growth to 17% at the high end of the 15% to 17% guidance range provided for the full year. The impact of high inflation and our continued investment in the business resulted in adjusted operating margin of 33.5%, down 40 basis points from second quarter last year. Additionally, these investments and accelerated revenue growth resulted in higher capital expenditures and working capital, leading to free cash flow of $658 million for the quarter and $1.3 billion year-to-date. Given the strength in the first half of the year, we are raising our full year organic revenue growth outlook to a range of 9% to 11%, up from 7% to 9% previously. With this higher organic revenue outlook and the year-to-date adjusted EPS performance of 17% growth, we are raising the lower end about full year adjusted EPS guidance range by $0.05 to a new range of $6.45 to $6.55, representing growth of 16% to 17% over 2021. Clover Global revenue grew 24% in the quarter, driven by volume growth of 27% as well as growth in software and services penetration to 15%, up over 350 basis points. We posted another strong quarter with organic revenue growth of 7%, driven by strength in our account processing and digital activity as well as the timing benefit of periodic revenue. Total company organic revenue growth was 12% in the quarter with strong growth across all segments, notably the Merchant Acceptance segment, which grew 17%. Second quarter total company adjusted revenue grew 10% to $4.2 billion and adjusted operating income grew 8% to $1.4 billion, resulting in an adjusted operating margin of 33.5%, a decrease of 40 basis points versus the prior year. For the first half of the year, adjusted revenue grew 10% to $8.1 billion, and adjusted operating income increased 10% to $2.7 billion, resulting in adjusted operating margin of 32.7% consistent with the first half of last year. The adjusted margin was impacted by a combination of factors, including: first, cost inflation for both labor and material including point-of-sale terminals for our Merchant Acceptance segment and Paper and Plastic for our Payments segment; second, investments related to new acquisitions, including BentoBox and Finxact; and third, continued reinvestment into the business, including wrapping up of the Fiserv First Data integration projects. Through June 30, adjusted earnings per share increased 17% to $2.96 at the high end of the 15% to 17% guidance range, which we provided for the full year. The free cash flow conversion was driven by a combination of: first, increased capital expenditures, particularly in the areas of innovation and integration of newly acquired capabilities; second, increased working capital investment, driven by the very strong revenue growth, including growth in anticipation revenue in Latin America; third, increased inventory to minimize any potential impact to our clients given the risk of supply chain disruption; and fourth, continued investment in software and application development to drive sustainably higher growth across the business. Adjusted operating income in the Acceptance segment increased 13% to $593 million in the quarter, and adjusted operating margin was down 20 basis points to 31.2%. The Payments and Network segment posted organic revenue growth of 8% in the quarter, at the high end of the 5% to 8% medium-term guidance range. We expect the momentum in this segment to continue through the rest of the year, resulting in the full year organic revenue growth rate to come well within our medium-term outlook of 5% to 8%. Adjusted operating income for the segment was up 5% to $668 million, and adjusted operating margin was down 80 basis points to 43.8%, driven by a combination of inflation and investments in the quarter. Year-to-date, adjusted operating income was up 6% to $1.3 billion and adjusted operating margin was up 20 basis points versus last year at 43.2%. The Financial Technology segment organic revenue grew at 7% in the second quarter, resulting in 6% growth for the first half at the high end of our 4% to 6% medium-term guidance range. Adjusted operating margin in the segment decreased 120 basis points to 35% in the quarter, driven by investments in Finxact, which we acquired early in the quarter as well as increased organic investments in the business. And we see good opportunities to continue to invest focused on sustainably growing this business much faster than it has in the past, taking our revenue guidance up this year from previously 7% to 9% to now 9% to 11%, and those opportunities that Frank talked about to increase our speed of execution and drive innovation at is an impact to cash flow, but margin and therefore, you saw a lower margin a bit even though we took up EPS give stronger growth."
