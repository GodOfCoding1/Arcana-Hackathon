    "content": " Today I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m happy to report that during the third quarter, Nu reported breakeven at the holding level, posting a net profit of $7.8 million and an adjusted net profit of $63.1 million while growing revenue at 171% year-over-year and welcoming more than 5 million new customers, becoming the sixth largest financial institution in Latin America by number of active customers. The compounding effect of a growing number of active customers and higher levels of product up-sell and cross-sell enabled us to grow monthly ARPAC 61% year-over-year on an FX neutral basis, and to deliver another quarter of strong annual revenue growth. Our consumer finance portfolio, which comprises credit cards and personal loans, expanded 83% year-over-year, bringing our total credit book to $9.7 billion, accelerating versus the previous quarter despite two headwinds. In addition, although NPLs have increased sequentially in the third quarter, it is important to note that the unit economics of all credit cards and personal loan cohorts have remained strong and resilient, as we continue to adequately price the risk of our credit portfolio. 100% of our personal loans customers come from cross-sells, so we already have not only deposit account and data but also credit card experience and data."
