    "content": " The objective here is to grow and diversify our content by onboarding major creators in new content verticals and thus attracting new audiences to drive user growth and engagement, while our initial wave of growth was primarily from the conservative community, today, we are clearly expanding beyond conservative politics and attracting new audiences through agreements where we provide incentives to major content creators who will produce exclusive content for Rumble. Turning to our quarter's topline, we reported revenues of $11 million for the quarter, another company record, and this was largely driven by our ability to tap into advertiser potential sooner than anticipated and turn our focus towards monetization. Looking at our sales and marketing expense, our third quarter reflected our initiatives and investment in content acquisition, resulting in the increase of $5.8 million due to a $4.9 million increase in costs related to incentivizing top content creators to promote and join our platform and roughly $1 million split between additional staffing costs and marketing and PR initiatives."
