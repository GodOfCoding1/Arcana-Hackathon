    "content": " Our public cloud services revenues reached RMB1.38 billion, remaining stable year-over-year and our enterprise cloud services revenues reached RMB792.5 million, up 89% year-over-year. For us, in response to the continued slowdown of the traffic driven demand in Internet sector, we proactively scaled down CDN services, while the growth of computing services among public cloud services remained strong as gross billings of computing achieved 45% year-over-year growth. Please ask your question. Please ask your question. So, when we look at that strategy in Q1, I think we're happy to see that the CDN revenue as a contribution of total revenue of Kingsoft Cloud has decreased from historically, let's say, about 50% right in historical years to around 30% already below 30% in Q1. Please ask your question. Please ask your question. On the second part, given we're doing a lot of work on the cost control mix and the diversification of the clients, so hopefully, our core cloud services, including computing storage and   as a whole, the total revenue of that bucket will be generally grow at a higher pace compared with the industry average and the major peers. Please ask your question."
