    "content": " Our leading medical businesses in Canada and Europe continued to perform exceptionally well, generating $45.7 million in sales and a gross margin of 62%, medical representative of about 75% of our Q2 revenue, and about 89% of our gross profit. When you look at aspects of what would be a drag on that projection, we quickly moved out of those less than profitable areas, such as key components of the adult rec business in Canada, markets that we may have participated in, that didn't have upside, and yet still found, the cash and the investment to do innovative deals, such as the Growery in Netherlands, where even now legally we can have a majority position, we can consolidate and recognize revenue as early as 2023. Please state your question. Please state your question. Please state your question. Please state your question. Please state your question. Please state your question. So I think we're trying to get away from that, what's the market share and what's happening on the revenue side and really focusing on driving in the areas -- winning in the areas that allow us to be profitable in the Canadian consumer market and add that to the existing really strong portfolio we've got in the medical market and create quite a company here. Please state your question. We've done that, focus our cost structure on the opportunities as they present itself, and we've done that, raising our guidance on the $60 million to $80 million, and three, everything we're doing focused on being sustainably EBITDA positive, and you've seen that progress with the 22% compression from last quarter to this quarter."
