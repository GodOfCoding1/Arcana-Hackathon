    "content": " During the first quarter, the 200-milligram SKU demand units grew by over 106%, based on broad expansion of ZYNRELEF\u2019s label indication, which utilized this dosage strength for surgical procedures, such as bariatric foot and ankle. So, what we are seeing is we're getting really excellent reorder rates with 80% of accounts during the first nine months are reordering ZYNRELEF. And in terms of the performance of ZYNRELEF, I think that we had provided very clear information last quarter that because of the excess inventory that the target for first quarter would be really driving use and the demand units. If you also look at a hospital setting, if they're getting packaged reimbursement as part of the surgical bundle, because we have a significant benefit from a WAC perspective and also a 340B perspective, you can save with the 400-milligram about a $87 per unit compared to using Exparel and at 340B, it's 149% or 42%. So, what we would expect is we've already seen very significant growth where we ended the first quarter at 41% reorder rate for the 200-milligram."
