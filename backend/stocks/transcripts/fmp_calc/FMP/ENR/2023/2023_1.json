    "content": " The combination of our expanded margins and leaner balance sheet helped to generate over $150 million of free cash flow in the quarter, which we use to pay down over $100 million of debt in the first four months of the year. Adjusted gross margin increased to 150 basis points to 39%, driven by pricing actions, savings generated from project momentum and the benefit of exiting that lower margin battery business in the quarter. While our cost of goods will continue to reflect the negative impact of inventory previously built at higher total costs, our gross margin should benefit from both pricing actions and project momentum savings with gross margins expected to improve by 150 basis points to 200 basis points from the prior year quarter. And also as you get through the year, Jason, you're going to have mitigating impacts of the COVID comps as you work your way through this fiscal year, because at this this time last year, we were still having a little bit of elevated demand from COVID, not to mention some of the overall category dynamics. I'd also say if you look at the way we're calling gross margin for the full-year, there's a little bit of headwinds going into the back half and what we're seeing is some of our raw material costs are a little bit higher, as well as some of the energy surcharges that we're seeing. I think you'll see some normalization as we go throughout this year, this was a very good quarter for us and obviously close to 20% free cash flow as a percentage of net sales is we're calling from more like 10% to 12% for the full-year and I think that'll give us the opportunity to really fund the momentum project in the back half of the year. So I would expect as we talked about 5% to 6% for the full-year, but you're going to spike in the first and third quarter, you'll be the lowest in the second and you'll be also lower in the fourth."
