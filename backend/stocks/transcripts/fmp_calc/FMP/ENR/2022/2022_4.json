    "content": " Over the next two fiscal years, we expect Project Momentum to generate $80 million to $100 million in total savings with roughly 80% of those benefits impacting gross margin and the remainder recognized throughout the rest of the P&L. We also expect to improve net working capital by $100 million, which will allow us to fund the projected onetime cash operating expenses related to the program of $40 million to $50 million and generate free cash flow in line with our long-term algorithm of 10% to 12% of net sales."
