    "content": " However, adjusted gross margin decreased 320 basis points to 37.5% versus the first quarter of 2021 as pricing, lower COVID related cost and synergies were offset by more than 700 basis points of margin erosion from inflationary cost pressures. However, due to the lag in timing between the recognition of these higher costs, and the successful rollout of our pricing actions and cost reduction efforts, we expect as much as 50 basis points of additional gross margin pressure to impact us for the full year 2022. Given the continued strength of demand in our categories, in our efforts to offset the majority of these headwinds to pricing and cost reduction initiatives, we are maintaining our fiscal 2022 outlook for roughly flat net sales, adjusted earnings per share in the range of $3 to $3.30 and adjusted EBITDA of $560 million to $590 million. You may now go ahead. You may now go ahead. You may now go ahead. You may now go ahead. You may now go ahead. You may now go ahead. You may now go ahead. I think what we're trying to do right now is we are trying to offset the inflationary pressures on a dollar basis first, and let's get those price increases in the marketplace, let's get them executed, let's restore that element of stability in the P&L. You may now go ahead. So, with regard to the most recent price increases that you've pushed through in the Battery category in the U.S, it sounds like from the fact that you expect that there's going to be some distribution gains this spring that there weren't many customers that push back and are either going to reduce allocation or reallocate any sort of their shelf space."
