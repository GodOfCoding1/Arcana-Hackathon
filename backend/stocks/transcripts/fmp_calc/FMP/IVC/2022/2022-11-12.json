    "content": " For an explanation of the items discussed on today's call that are considered to be non-GAAP financial information, such as constant currency net sales, constant currency SG&A expense, free cash flow and adjusted EBITDA, please see the notes in the appendix of our webcast slides and in the related reconciliations in the slides and the earnings release posted to our Web site. Consolidated reported net sales declined across all main product categories, primarily due to supply chain challenges, including component shortages, which limited our ability to manufacture products and fulfill existing orders within the quarter. Gross margin decreased due to higher input costs, intermittent production stoppages due to supply chain challenges and component shortages and unfavorable foreign exchange, partially offset by the benefits of pricing actions. Operating loss increased and adjusted EBITDA decreased due primarily to lower sales, inventory and purchase obligation write-downs related to the discontinuation of the respiratory product line and unfavorable foreign exchange. Operating loss increased and adjusted EBITDA decreased due to lower gross profit from lower revenues, with operating loss also impacted by the write-down of inventory and purchase obligations related to the discontinuation of the production of respiratory products."
