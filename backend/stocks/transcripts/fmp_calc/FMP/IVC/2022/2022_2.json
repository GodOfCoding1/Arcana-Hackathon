    "content": " For an explanation of the items discussed on today's call that are considered to be non-GAAP financial information, such as constant currency net sales, constant currency SG&A, free cash flow, and adjusted EBITDA please see the notes in the appendix of our webcast slides and in the related reconciliations in the slides and earnings release posted on our website. Gross margin was impacted by higher input costs intermittent product stoppages, due to supply chain challenges, and unfavorable foreign exchange, partially offset by the benefit of pricing actions. Constant currency SG&A expense decreased primarily due to lower employment costs, partially offset by higher IT costs, classified as operating expenses as we temporarily pause any further ERP roll-out, similar to the first quarter of 2022. For the second half of 2022, adjusted EBITDA is anticipated to improve compared to the first half of the year, driven by gross profit improvement with the benefit of favorable product mix and price effectiveness, as well as lower operating expenses."
