    "content": " In addition, we anticipate sequential improvement in both key metrics in the last 3 quarters of the year, as effective pricing offsets higher costs and favorable product mix with the benefit of restructuring actions are realized. Reported net sales for the year are anticipated to be flat to down 1% to 2% compared to last year as we continue to optimize the product portfolio, partially offset by the introduction of new products and the benefit of pricing actions. Brett, the actions have started, so obviously, things that we've announced in the 8-K that revealed year-to-date actions will anniversary through practically all of this year and then you can roughly do the math on what's left to achieve this year and see how it goes into the first quarter of 2022. So primarily, and as we've spoken about previously, the majority of the restructuring savings that would be announced this year, we would see in the second half of the year, and that's what's going to drive reduced SG&A structure as well as improvement in the margins for the second half of the year."
