    "content": " For the third quarter of 2022, we reported net revenues of $4.47 billion, a 16.8% increase over the same quarter last year and our adjusted EBITDA of $460.5 million, up 32.7% versus Q3 of 2021. Even with significant volatility of market fundamentals, our US business achieved solid results in the quarter with big bird deboning up seasonal and historical highs, while our key customer partnerships in case ready and small birds and our growth in prepared foods improve our bottom line. In prepared, revenues increased 18% relative to prior year, driven by growth in Just BARE and Pilgrim's branded innovation and key customer partnerships throughout retail. Our Mexico business faced difficult circumstances throughout the third quarter as sustained high inflation impacted overall demand and extended issues with bird mortality, increased production costs and impacted our volumes. For the third quarter of 2022, net revenues were $4.47 billion versus $3.83 billion a year ago, with adjusted EBITDA of $460.5 million and a margin of 10.3% compared to $346.9 million and a 9.1% margin in Q3 last year. I mean I guess if I just think about dissecting your business right into the three parts, like it would imply that if the commodity market was slightly down in the third quarter, that retail and key customer had to be up again materially year-over- year pricing."
