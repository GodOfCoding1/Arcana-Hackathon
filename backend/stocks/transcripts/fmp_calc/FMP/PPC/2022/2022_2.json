    "content": " Overall, export business remains robust as export volumes increased 5% year-over-year in April and May, driven by a 20% increase in last quarter's volume shipments compared to April and May of 2021. Although the cut out has recently tapered off in line with normal seasonality, overall business conditions remained strong given the expected tightness of the overall protein complex, relative strong foodservice demand compared to pre-COVID-19 levels, and moderating input cost compared to earlier in the year. In Prepared Foods, revenue grew 25% relative to last year, driven by foodservice growth on our Just Bare and Pilgrim's branded innovation in retail and focus on key customers. Despite inflationary headwinds and softening consumer demand throughout the U.K. and EU, our business is well positioned to navigate these conditions given its focus on key customers, a diverse portfolio, and demonstrated operational improvements, Moving forward, the business will continue to invest in our people to improve staffing, implement supply chain solutions, and conduct customer negotiations for cost recovery from escalated inputs. Both gross and operating margins were higher compared to 2021, primarily due to higher commodity market pricing, strong consumer demand, improved operational efficiencies and growth with our key customers."
