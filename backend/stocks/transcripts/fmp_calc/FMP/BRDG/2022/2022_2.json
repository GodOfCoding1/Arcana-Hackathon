    "content": " Distributable earnings per share increased 28% year-over-year to $0.32 a share, driven by the consistent growth in management fee revenue and one of our strongest quarters for realized performance fees. Last, notwithstanding recent and expected increases in interest rates, there is a global hunt for sustainable yield without a huge amount of risk which increasingly is satisfied by alternative credit vehicles, as demonstrated by our strong final closing in Debt Strategies Fund IV of $2.9 billion, ongoing carefully structured and hedged investments in AMBS which generate attractive yield and early successes in the Bridge Net Lease Income vehicles. And we think that we bring the best of both Bridge and our real estate expertise, our network of assets around the country for which, in many cases, solar is highly applicable, along with the evaluation technology, the knowledge of markets, of regulations, of renewable energy construction management that Lumen brings to be an entity that is better in the aggregate than either one of us would be separately."
