    "content": " My colleagues and I just completed a global capital raising and investor relations trip that included visits to many of our largest international investors and culminated in the announcement of a strategic relationship with KB Asset Management, Korea's largest financial group, the interest in U.S. real estate and the confidence in Bridge as a trusted steward remains high. In terms of the equity side of the business, I think there's still just sort of a little bit of a lag, if you want to call it that, where regular way transactions have really slowed because the bid-ask spread is kind of there where sellers are still trying to adjust to the fact that they're not getting the kinds of numbers that they would have been getting 6, 9 months ago or a year ago and trying to decide if there's still a viable trade to be done or not. And it's curious how it used to be that having a prespecified portfolio was a positive marketing element and now having a track record, have an experienced team, but starting from scratch and building a portfolio at the newly arrived at pricing level, I think, is considered an advantage in a lot of respects, and our funds are -- happen to be positioned, the newly launched funds happen to be positioned in that capacity."
