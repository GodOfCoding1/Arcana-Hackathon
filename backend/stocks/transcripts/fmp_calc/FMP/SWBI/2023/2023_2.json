    "content": " Looking forward to the second half of our fiscal year, while we anticipate more normal demand levels, our seasoned team has effectively managed through these cycles before, and our business model is specifically designed for this, and we expect to continue delivering strong level of profitability even with the significant one-time expenses associated with our move to Tennessee. Operating expenses of $26.7 million for our second quarter were $9.9 million lower than the prior year comparable quarter primarily due to a $3.1 million reduction in relocation costs, lower sales-related expenses, such as co-op advertising and freight and decreased compensation-related costs driven by temporarily unfilled positions, we believe, as a result of the relocation. When you combine these one-time costs with the working capital needs of our business to meet cyclical consumer demand and costs associated with preparing for next summer's move, we will likely continue to experience negative free cash flow during our third quarter even with inventory beginning to decline seasonally."
