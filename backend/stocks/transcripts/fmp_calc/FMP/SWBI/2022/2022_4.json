    "content": " All told, we remain confident in our ability to deliver full year results that are within the long-term financial model we shared last year during our Investor Day, which as a reminder includes gross margins of 32% to 42%, EBITDAS margins of 20% to 30% and generating more than $75 million in cash each year. Operating expenses of $25.6 million for our fourth quarter were $4.1 million lower than the prior year comparable quarter, primarily due to reduced profit sharing and incentives, a reduction in wage and benefits due to vacant positions, lower distribution costs associated with lower shipments and reduced legal expenses. Net income of $36.1 million in the fourth quarter compared to $89.2 million in the prior year comparable quarter, reflecting lower net sales and gross margins, slightly offset by reduced operating expenses. However, when compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, in spite of slightly lower sales, net income was $15.2 million higher this quarter due to improved gross margins and nearly $5.6 million of lower operating expenses. For the full year, our profitability was the second highest in company history, including net income of $194.5 million, GAAP earnings per share of $4.08, non-GAAP earnings per share of $4.25 and EBITDAS of $299.6 million, which translate to an EBITDAS margin of 34.7% of sales, slightly above our record year last year, again, reflecting the strength of our operating model. With regard to operating expenses in fiscal 2023, we expect full year levels to be higher relative to 2022, reflecting approximately $10 million to $12 million in costs associated with the relocation as well as higher wage costs as our staffing overhead recovers toward normal levels."
