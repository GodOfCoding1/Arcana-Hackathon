    "content": " Even with the difficult comps versus the very strong results from last year, increased manufacturing capacity due to our flexible model combined with increased market share and consumer preference for our products drove nearly a 20% increase in sales year-over-year. And as the country started opening up at the beginning of the summer, although the demand for firearms remain very strong, we did start to see a return to normal summer seasonality during our first quarter, which allowed our channel partners to be able to begin stocking some inventory again for the first time in over a year. Our team has delivered nearly 170% two-year compounded growth, record revenues, five straight quarters in a row, sustained market share growth, several major product launches, including entrants into a brand new category, executed marketing campaigns, GUNSMARTS, rebranding initiatives, consumer research studies, etc., all while not just holding operating costs flat, but actually reducing them, and not just in relative terms in dollars spent. So I mean, I think as we said earlier and I think we went - the difference between this year and last year is, we went through \u201cnormal summer seasonality\u201d and I think everybody is very much expecting and we are as well that we're going to be getting into a pretty \u2013 you know as we go into our typically heavy, typically busy season, it's going to be a good busy season and there's no reason to be running promotions. I think if you \u2013 again, going back to the model that we talked about on the Analyst Call at the end of last quarter, look, we went through a normal summer seasonal demand period, but again, if you look at the next stack chart, we're going to be \u2013 this is the second busiest year ever so far on record and no indication that this is not going to continue."
