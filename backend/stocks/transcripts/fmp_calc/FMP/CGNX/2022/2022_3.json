    "content": " It's favorable within the quarter -- within the year in Q3, just by virtue of a little lower logistics mix this quarter and we'll have a little more of that next quarter. We -- Q1 this year 2022 was our highest quarterly revenue level and also our highest quarterly growth rate and we did have a strong quarter in logistics in Q1 this year kind of broad-based across all of our logistics customers, including large customer activity. And then as you start to think about the first half of next year, if logistics doesn't come back as you have that tough comp, I mean, you should get a pretty decent benefit at least on the gross margin side from mix, if there's any way to quantify that that would be helpful. Certainly, automotive would be among it, but electronics and other markets too and we -- it's really a general catch up across our general product range, not specifically logistics, I would say, but more general factory automation. And, I think, Rob, it's fair to say outside of sales, we really are sort of as we are setting plans for next year and so on, we really are deploying -- redeploying existing resources and whether that's on the engineering team or G&A functions. So there may be a little bit of noise in the numbers, for instance in Q3, logistics was a contributor the biggest contributor to our revenue decline in Europe, and that was more large customer activity than the broader base of business that we've been growing and continue to grow."
