    "content": " Looking at our end markets, cloud represented 49% of revenue at $1.8 billion, down 13% sequentially and 18% year-over-year. I think when you look across the portfolio, we have five or six categories, depending on the quarter, if you look at it for the whole fiscal year, we'll have six different categories where we have a double-digit mix of bits going into those different parts of the market. As I said before that look at our pricing last quarter, like for like for like minus 17%, blended minus 22%, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re clearly mixing this \u00e2\u0080\u0093 the mix hurts the pricing a bit, but it also allows us to move a lot of supply. But again, our \u00e2\u0080\u0093 the way we think about the portfolio is if we can get the \u00e2\u0080\u0093 if we can \u00e2\u0080\u0093 if we have a home for the bits, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s number of \u00e2\u0080\u0093 that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the first thing like, do we have a place where we can \u00e2\u0080\u0093 do we have customers that value our innovation in our portfolio and we have a place to put the supply and then we look at pricing and then we look at that equation and does it make economic sense to do that and we drive the portfolio."
