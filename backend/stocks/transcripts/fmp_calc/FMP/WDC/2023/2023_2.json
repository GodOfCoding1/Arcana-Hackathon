    "content": " We expect gross margin to be between 9% and 11%, which includes underutilization charges in Flash and HDD totaling $250 million, with Flash driven by a 30% reduction in wafer starts. The way to think of it is typically we -- as we under or as sort of we reduce the wafer starts, given the cycle time, we expect approximately 60% to 70% of the impact to come in the first, let's say, 90 days and then the remaining impact would be in the following quarter. As we said, we're anticipating modest revenue growth, maybe low to mid-single digits quarter-over-quarter here going into calendar Q1, our fiscal Q3, we expect margin improvement is, of course, the volume comes back and the underutilization charges drop, and we'll see that continue as we go throughout the calendar year. We also are, as part of the $250 million underutilization that we talked about for the March quarter, there are some continued underutilization on the hard drive side, which would allow us to continue to manage inventory very tightly and maintain that discipline on the supply side until, obviously, the demand growth accelerates. So, Sidney, this is a fair way of looking at the transition from Q2 to Q3 with the improved utilization or, let's say, smaller -- lesser underutilization on the hard drive side, we expect to see some improvement in the gross margin quarter-to-quarter."
