    "content": " In order to meet our end customers\u2019 demand, we are incurring additional costs that will weigh primarily on our hard drive gross margins through the first half of calendar year 2022. Although we were up strongly year-over-year, capacity enterprise hard drives declined sequentially after two quarters of strong shipments, partly due to some of our customers\u2019 supply chain challenges. In client SSD, the bedrock of Western Digital\u2019s flash portfolio, we have launched and are ramping BiCS5-based products in the fiscal third quarter, with BiCS5 enterprise SSD products later in the year. However, healthy overall demand for capacity enterprise drives, along with Western Digital\u2019s leadership position at the 18-terabyte capacity point, drove a greater than 50% year-over-year increase in exabyte shipments."
