    "content": "  At a high level, highlights for the quarter include, net income $3.3 million, down $761 and 19% off from the prior year quarter, but would be up 9% when you exclude the PPP program and small OMSR recapture. Net interest income $10.4 million, was up 8.7% from a linked quarter, and 4.1% from the prior year. The mortgage business line contributed $6.1 million in total revenue for the first nine months of this year, compared to 16.4 same period last year, a reduction of 63%. This quarter, mortgage volume and loan sale gains were down from the prior year 55% on volume to nearly $69 million, and 78% on gains to $876,000. Loan growth in the quarter was quite strong, as we were up 30 million from the linked quarter, and up $81 million net of PPP from the prior year quarter. Margin revenue was up $837,000 or 8.7% for the linked quarter, and when we adjust for PPP, loan interest income was higher by $1.3 million from the prior year or 14.7%. In addition, if we adjust operating revenue, remove the impact of PPP, and the entire mortgage business line, we have positive revenue growth of 19.2% and 16.1% from the linked and prior year quarter, respectively. If we look at the quarter and exclude the mortgage gain on sale on the OMSR we captured, non-interest income was up over 26% from the prior year, with the adjusted growth driven by better customer service fees, higher servicing income, and better swap activity. However, when we exclude the OCCI temporary valuation adjustment of $33.4 million, our equity grew 2.1% from the prior year, and would be 11.4% on an equity asset basis, even after over $6 million in stock buyback and $3.3 million in dividends."
