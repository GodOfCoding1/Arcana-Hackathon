Return on average assets of 0.87% up from prior quarter of 0.83%, diluted EPS of $0.40, net interest income of $9.6 million was up 4.8% from the prior year as loan growth and rate increases were supplemented by the 12.4% reduction in interest expense. Loan balances from the link quarter rose $45 million and when we adjust for PPP balances, loans were up nearly $80 million, strong 9.7% compared to the prior year. So we're highlighting this quarter, operating revenue down $1.4 million or 9.1% as mortgage gains from lower volume and reduced sales percentage were down nearly $3.1 million or 72%. Loan sales delivered gains of $1.4 million for mortgage, small business and ag loans and margin revenue, which was up $436,000 or 4.8% due to a slightly lower funding costs and higher security revenue. Total non-interest income was down $1.9 million or 28.5% from the prior year, reflecting lower mortgage origination and sales volume, which offset the $336,000 positive swing and servicing rights recapture."
