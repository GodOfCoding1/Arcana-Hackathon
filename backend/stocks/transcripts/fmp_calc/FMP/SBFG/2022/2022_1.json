    "content": " Highlights for this quarter include $900,000 pretax mortgage servicing right recapture, and include net income of $2.81 million, down $4.3 million from the prior year quarter. Loan balances adjusted for PPP were up from the prior year quarter by just over $56 million in the linked quarter, $28 million. Mortgage origination volume $97 million, down 38% from the prior year, 23% from the linked quarter. As we reviewed last quarter, we were comped at $1.6 million and audio properties would sell this quarter, which they have and thereby has reduced overall NPAs by nearly $1 million for both the prior year and linked quarters. Total noninterest income of $5.8 million was down $5.1 million or 47% from the prior year, reflecting lower mortgage volume and the $1.8 million negative swing in servicing rights. Total operating expenses this quarter were $10.9 million, which were down $50,000 from the prior year and down $780,000 or 6.1% in the linked quarter. As we look at our capital position, we finished the quarter at $132.6 million, which is down $11.3 million or 7.9% from the prior year, with our equity-to-asset ratio standing at 9.9%. He has a larger bank experience and some community bank experience, and we\u2019re looking for the $67 million growth in the market -- in the last half of the year. So kind of 25%, I\u2019d say we\u2019re somewhere in that $450 million to $475 million target range as we look out as we sit today, but that\u2019s really all dependent on the denominator. No, that makes sense. So we\u2019ll get an immediate pop on the $130 million number of rate rises that we have, and we think there\u2019s going to be, call it, 100 to 150 basis points between now and the end of the year. No, that makes sense."
