    "content": " We increased our total gross margin slightly on a sequential basis and by $3 million compared to the third quarter of 2021 in the face of meaningful cost inflation and despite nonstrategic asset sales totaling 134,000 horsepower. Growth capital expenditures in the third quarter totaled $39 million, similar to second quarter levels as we continue to invest in new equipment to meet customer demand. In fact, looking at our growth CapEx budget for 2022, I think that about 15% of our CapEx will go toward electric motor drive units, both in the form of converting our existing horsepower to electric motor drive as well as in building new units for delivery in 2023."
