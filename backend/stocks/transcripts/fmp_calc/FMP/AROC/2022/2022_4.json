    "content": " I'm proud to say that we delivered gross margin dollars for the year of $399 million, essentially flat year-over-year despite the reduction in gross margin dollars for non-strategic asset sales as well as record inflation and elevated reactivation costs to put our idle fleet back to work, which are customary in the early stages of an upcycle. In our aftermarket services segment, we reported fourth quarter 2022 revenue of $42 million, down slightly compared to the third quarter due to seasonal softness, but up 16% on a year-over-year basis. Cash available for dividend for the fourth quarter of 2022 totaled $35 million and for the full year totaled $171 million, leading to an impressive 2022 dividend coverage of 1.9 times. And after normalizing for 2022 net gains on asset sales totaling $41 million, 2023 adjusted EBITDA is projected to increase over $90 million at the midpoint of our guidance, or nearly 30% year-over-year. In contract operations, we expect full year revenue to be in the range of $775 million to $800 million, a year-over-year increase of 14% to 20%, driven by significantly higher horsepower utilization and pricing. In comparing 2023 contract operations gross margin and SG&A expectations with 2022 performance, please note that guidance reflects the change in tax compliance for approximately $10 million of sales tax associated with contract operations cost of sales. And we very much did that certainly through the down cycle, we -- as Brad said, prefunded a large chunk of the -- what I would call maybe excess -- I don't know, the excess CapEx is the right word this year, but redeploying those asset sales into large horsepower, highly demanded by investment-grade customers is the right business decision for 2023."
