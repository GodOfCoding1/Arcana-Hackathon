    "content": " First quarter highlights include, the contract operations revenue increased $4 million or 3% from the fourth quarter, as we grew our operating horsepower and benefited from the initial price increases we implemented late last year. In addition to advancing our ESG strategy and helping our customers, this is a financially compelling opportunity that can create meaningful shareholder value for Archrock, as we work to connect Ecotec's proven technology with our leading U.S. natural gas compression infrastructure and customer network. Our leverage ratio at quarter end was 4.5 times and as Brad mentioned, the $55 million in asset sale proceeds during the second quarter, essentially prefunds a third of our growth capital this year and puts us in a position to repay a small amount of debt this year, even with the acquisition of our stake in Ecotec and as we invest in our fleet. We have confidence in this technology that's been proven in other spaces, but we're moving into the phase where we'll demonstrate it and its success with some oil and gas customers over the coming, I think months maybe even quarters and as we do that, we'll have more to talk about in the future."
