Total U.S. system revenue was $7.8 million, representing growth of 70% compared to the first quarter of 2021. First quarter 2022 U.S. handpiece and consumable revenue was $4.4 million, representing growth of approximately 174% compared to the first quarter of 2021. As Reza highlighted, our revenue for the first quarter of 2022 was $14.2 million, representing growth of 97% compared to the first quarter of 2021 and 40% sequential growth. Turning to handpiece revenue, U.S. handpiece revenue was $4.4 million, representing growth of 174% compared to the first quarter of 2021. Lastly, on total revenue, international revenue for the first quarter was $1.6 million, representing growth of 75% compared to the first quarter of 2021. Moving to our financial guidance, given our strong first quarter and continued underlying momentum in the business, we are increasing our full year 2022 total revenue guidance to be in the range of $58 million to $62 million. While pleased with the first quarter improvement utilization, our updated revenue guidance assumes quarterly utilization trends to be slightly down sequentially as we progress through the year, although full year 2022 utilization rates are expected to be up modestly from 2021."
