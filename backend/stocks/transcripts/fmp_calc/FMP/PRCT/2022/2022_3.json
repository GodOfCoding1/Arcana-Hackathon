As Reza highlighted, our revenue for the third quarter of 2022 was $20.3 million, representing growth of 135% compared to the third quarter of 2021. In the third quarter, we sold 26 AquaBeam Robotic Systems generating total U.S. system revenue of $9.8 million, representing system revenue growth of 95% compared to the third quarter of 2021. Given the strong underlying momentum in the business, we are increasing our full year 2022 total revenue guidance to be approximately $72.5 million, representing growth of 110% compared to 2021. Given our 2022 revenue guidance of $72.5 million, 25% to 34% higher than our initial guidance ranges in March, we now forecast full year 2022 operating expenses to be approximately $115 million. Your line is now open. We're not going to comment directly on 2023 numbers, but I think, our performance over the last three quarters, our visibility into Q4, which we do have a very robust pipeline, we expect exiting 2022 again, give us a lot of confidence that the momentum that we're seeing in the latter half of 2022 really should continue into 2023. Your line is now open. Great, thanks for that. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. Your line is now open. Great, thanks for that. Your line is now open. Your line is now open.
