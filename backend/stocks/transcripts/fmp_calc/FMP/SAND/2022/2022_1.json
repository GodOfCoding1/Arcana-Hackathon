    "content": " When we announced these transactions last week, we went through a comprehensive presentation at that time, and therefore, I won't be going through it on today's call, but I would like to use this opportunity to remind everyone of a few key details of what the new Sandstorm will look like to help investors better understand what they can expect from our financial results in the future. During the first quarter of 2022, Sandstorm realized record revenue of $35.4 million and sold 18,741 attributable gold equivalent ounces, also a new record. Looking at the contributing assets for the first quarter, we see the Yamana silver stream as the largest producer, which is on the Cerro Moro mine at approximately 4,500 attributable gold equivalent ounces. The operators don't elaborate publicly too much on the asset, but Barrick does categorize this as a Tier 2 gold asset which is defined as a gold project designed to deliver a minimum of 10-year mine life, annual production of at least 250,000 ounces of gold per year and total cash costs over the life of mine that are in the lower half of the industry curve. With over 400,000 ounces of annual production expected per year in the first five years, Equinox sees this asset as a key part of their growth portfolio, and we expect to see lots of news as they build one of Canada's largest gold mines."
