    "content": " Over the last 12 months, Sandstorm has achieved several transformative milestones, which started with the creation of our strategic partner that we will be growing with Horizon Copper along with the sale of our Hod Maden interest to Horizon and taking back of a pure gold stream of the Hod Maden asset, making Sandstorm a pure-play precious metal streaming company. Speaking of Horizon, that brings me to the next question that investors have been asking, which is when will Horizon complete raising its next $20 million and hand that over to Sandstorm to complete the Antamina transaction, whereby Sandstorm will sell its NPI to Antamina -- on Antamina to Horizon and have Sandstrom take back its silver stream in Antamina at 0.55% NPI royalty on Antamina and the IOU from Horizon. A few factors driving the increase in net income when compared to 2021 included a $25.8 million gain on the disposal of streams, royalty and then interest primarily from the sale of a portfolio to Sandbox Royalty, a new diversified metals royalty company that was created in partnership with Equinox Gold in June 2022."
