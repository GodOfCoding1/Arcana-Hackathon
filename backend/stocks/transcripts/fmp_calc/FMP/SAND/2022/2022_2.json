    "content": " And those are: number one, the BaseCore Royalty Package acquisition; number two, the Nomad Royalty acquisition; number three, the surfacing of value through the sale of underappreciated the valuable assets to Sandbox; and number four, the sale of the Hod Maden interest and the taking back of a gold stream from Horizon Copper. When comparing the same period in 2021, the company has several new cash flowing assets in our portfolio this year, namely the Mercedes mine, which began stream deliveries in April 2022, and the Vatukoula gold stream, which began making deliveries in December 2021. The average cash cost per attributable ounce has remained below $300 for the last several quarters, which is indicative of the high quality and low cost assets that are underlying our stream and royalty portfolio. Net income was higher compared to the same period in 2021, driven by higher revenue as well as a $22.9 million gain, mostly driven by the disposal of royalty assets that were sold to Sandbox Royalties in June 2022. As previously mentioned, we've added a few new assets to this list over the past year, which has contributed to the increase in attributable gold production, namely the addition of the Mercedes and Vatukoula gold streams along with the Vale Royalties."
