    "content": " Total revenue in our CATV segment was a company record of $31.3 million, up 35% year-over-year and 32% sequentially, as we continue to see robust demand in the CATV markets. Total revenue for our datacenter products of $17.7 million decreased 26% year-over-year and 80% sequentially, largely due to a decline in 40G, which is nearing the end of its lifecycle, and 100G push is beginning to slowly decline as customers move to 400G. Our total revenue for the third quarter increased 6% year-over-year to $56.7 million, which was slightly below our guidance range of $57 million to $60 million, primarily due to a faster than anticipated decline in 40G sales. As Thompson mentioned and as you may have seen, on September 15th, we announced that we have entered into an agreement with Yuhan Optoelectronic Technology for the sale of our manufacturing facilities located in the People's Republic of China, and certain assets related to our transceiver business and multichannel optical subassembly products for the datacenter telecom and FTTH markets for a purchase price of $150 million, less a holdback amount that is variable depending on working capital and other conditions at the time of closing. CATV revenue in the third quarter was the company record of $31.3 million, which was up 35% year-over-year and 32% sequentially. Total non-GAAP operating expenses in the third quarter are $19.4 million or 34.3% of revenue, down as a total percentage of revenue from $19.3 million or 36.3% of revenue in Q3 of the prior year."
