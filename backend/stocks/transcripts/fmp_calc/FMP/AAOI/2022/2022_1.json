    "content": " Total revenue for our data center products of $21.4 million decreased 17.4% year-over-year and 15% sequentially as several of our customers continue to reduce their 400G and 100G purchase, while our run of next-generation 400G is still in the early stage. Our Q1 data center revenue came in at $21.4 million, down 17.4% year-over-year and down 15% sequentially. Total non-GAAP operating expenses in the first quarter were $19.6 million, or 37.5% of revenue, down from $20.6 million or 41.4% of revenue in Q1 of the prior year. On a non-GAAP basis, our net loss for Q1 was $7.9 million or a loss of $0.29 per basic share, which was better than our guidance range of a loss of $8.3 million to $9.5 million, or a loss per share in the range of $0.30 to $0.35 per basic share, and compares to a net loss of $5.5 million or a loss of $0.21 per basic share in Q1 of the prior year. Non-GAAP net loss is expected to be in the range of $8.4 million to $9.5 million and non-GAAP loss per basic share between $0.30 and $0.34, using a weighted average basic share count of approximately 27.6 million shares."
