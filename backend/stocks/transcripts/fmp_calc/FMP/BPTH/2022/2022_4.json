    "content": " The company reported a net loss of $13.9 million or $1.91 per share for the year ended December 31st, 2022 compared to a net loss of $10.4 million or $1.55 per share for the year ended December 31st, 2021. Research and development expense for the year ended December 31st, 2022 increased to $9.2 million compared to $5.9 million for the year ended December 31st, 2021, primarily due to manufacturing expenses related to drug product releases in 2022, increased enrollment in our Phase 2 clinical trial for prexigebersen and AML and start-up costs related to our Phase 1 clinical trial for BP1002 in refractory relapsed AML patients. General and administrative expense for the year ended December 31st, 2022 increased to $4.7 million compared to $4.5 million for the year ended December 31st, 2021, primarily due to increased legal fees. Net cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31st, 2022 was $15.1 million compared to $9.9 million for the comparable period in 2021. Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31st, 2022 was $1.7 million. As I hope we have conveyed, we have an exciting year ahead with several potentially value creating clinical milestones across our portfolio, including cohort completion of data readout from our Phase 1/1b clinical trial of BP1001-A and solid tumors around midyear; cohort completion and data readout from our Phase 1/1b clinical trial of BP1002 in relapsed/refractory AML around midyear; an initial interim safety and efficacy analysis from our Phase 2 clinical trial of prexigebersen AML beginning in the coming quarter. I think that we would expect the -- I don't have a specific forecast, but I know that the total development expense should be in probably about maybe the $4 million range going forward, but that's not a studied number."
