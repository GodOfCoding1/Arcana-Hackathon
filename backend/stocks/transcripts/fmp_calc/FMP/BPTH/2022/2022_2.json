    "content": " Towards that end we look forward to initiating our Phase 1 studies of BP1001-A, a drug product modification of prexigebersen, for the treatment of solid tumors and of BP1002 to treat relapsed/refractory acute myeloid leukemia or AML, including venetoclax resistant patients, in the coming weeks. The amended Stage 2 of this Phase 2 trial in AML is an open label Phase 2, two-stage multicenter study of prexigebersen in combination with decitabine and venetoclax in two cohorts of patients with previously untreated AML and relapsed resistant AML. Next I'd like to turn to our planned Phase on1 clinical trial of BP1001-A in patients with advanced solid tumors, including ovarian, uterine, pancreatic, and hormone refractory breast cancer. You will recall that last year, the FDA cleared our investigational new drug, or IND application to initiate a Phase 1/1b clinical trial of BP1001-A in patients with solid tumors, including ovarian, endometrial, pancreatic, and triple negative breast cancer. The company reported a net loss of $3.0 million or $0.42 per share for the three months ended June 30, 2022, compared to a net loss of $1.8 million or $0.26 per share for the three months ended June 30, 2021. Research and development expense for the three months ended June 30, 2022 increased to $1.9 million compared to $0.8 million for the three months ended June 30, 2021, primarily due to manufacturing expenses related to drug product releases in the second quarter of 2022 and increased patient enrollment related to our Phase 2 clinical trial for prexigebersen in AML. General and administrative expense for the three months ended June 30, 2022 was $1.2 million an increase of $0.1 million compared to the three months ended June 30, 2021, primarily due to increased legal fees."
