    "content": " Next, I'd like to turn to our planned Phase I clinical trial of BP1001-A in patients with advanced solid tumors, including ovarian, uterine, pancreatic and hormone refractory breast cancer. You will recall that last year, the FDA cleared our investigational new drug or IND application to initiate a Phase I/Ib clinical trial of BP1001-A in patients with solid tumors, including ovarian, endometrial, pancreatic and triple-negative breast cancer. The company reported a net loss of $3.4 million or $0.47 per share for the 3 months ended March 31, 2022 compared to a net loss of $2.4 million or $0.43 per share for the 3 months ended March 31, 2021. Research and development expense for the 3 months ended March 31, 2022, increased to $2.1 million compared to $1.3 million for the 3 months ended March 31, 2021, primarily due to increased clinical trial expenses for start-up costs related to our Phase I clinical trial of BP1002 in refractory relapsed AML patients and timing of activities for our Phase I clinical trial of BP1002 in lymphoma. General and administrative expense for the 3 months ended March 31, 2022, increased to $1.3 million compared to $1.2 million for the 3 months ended March 31, 2021, primarily due to increased stock-based compensation expense. Net cash used in operating activities for the 3 months ended March 31, 2022, was $2.5 million compared to $1.6 million for the comparable period in 2021."
