    "content": " As I mentioned earlier, we are also making progress towards initiation of a Phase 1 clinical trial, BP1001-A in patients with advanced solid tumors including ovarian, uterine, pancreatic and hormone refractory breast cancer, some of the most challenging cancers to treat with today's therapeutic toolkit. In the coming weeks we expect to initiate a Phase 1/1b clinical trial of BP1001-A in patients with solid tumors including ovarian, endometrial, pancreatic, and triple negative breast cancer. The company reported a net loss of $3.5 million or $0.49 per share for the three months ended September 30, 2022, compared to a net loss of $2.1 million or $0.29 per share for the three months ended September 30, 2021. Research and development expense for the three months ended September 30, 2022, increased to $2.4 million compared to $1.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2021, primarily due to manufacturing expenses related to drug product releases in the third quarter of 2022, as well as startup costs related to our Phase 1 clinical trial for BP1001-A in solid tumors. General and administrative expense for the three months ended September 30, 2022 was $1.2 million, an increase of $0.1 million compared to the three months ended September 30, 2021, primarily due to increased legal fees. Net cash used in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 was $10.1 million compared to $7.1 million for the comparable period in 2021."
