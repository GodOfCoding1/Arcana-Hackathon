Joining us for today\u2019s call are Asure\u2019s Chairman and CEO, Pat Goepel; Asure\u2019s Chief Financial Officer, John Pence; and Head of Investor Relations, Randal Rudniski. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us for Asure\u2019s first quarter 2022 earnings call. Today\u2019s call will also contain forward-looking statements that refer to future events and as such, involve some risks. Finally, I\u2019d like to remind everyone this call is being recorded, and it will be made available for replay via a link available on the Investor Relations section of our website. Thank you, Randal, and welcome, everyone, to Asure Software\u2019s first quarter earnings call. We sure appreciate your interest, whether you\u2019re a shareholder, client, employee, or prospective shareholder or analyst. I\u2019ll begin today\u2019s presentation with an update on our business highlights and strategy and then we\u2019ll turn the call over to our CFO, John Pence for a more detailed review of our financial results and outlook for the remainder of the 2022 fiscal year. We delivered solid execution of our 2022 business plan, and we continue to build our sales and product momentum, and we showed meaningful progress in key business areas. A great example of our focus in this area is that our announcement this morning that we have launched the integration marketplace with 128 prebuilt integrations, we now have the foundation to create new client solutions and new revenue streams. It\u2019s the culmination of our efforts since we pivoted to become a pure play Human Capital Management provider, when we sold the space business. This adds a valuable new service to our roster, moves us closer to having a direct relationship with employees and it\u2019s the direction the Human Capital Management industry needs to go. We also had sales success in our business lines, the business lines provide us with unique differentiation in the marketplace enable us to expand our relationships and tap into larger client segments. In HR consulting, our focus and unique business model to of 6% organic growth in our revenues prior to \u2013 relative to prior year, this is a differentiator for us in a small to medium size business segment. We\u2019re also keeping an eye on acquisition opportunities, we intend to be opportunistic as it demonstrated by the small acquisition we made in January and fully integrated by the end of the quarter. We\u2019re in a labor environment of almost unprecedented change from perspectives of regulation, mobility and talent. Our non-recurring revenues increased by $800,000 versus prior year and was aided by continuing success of our employee retention tax credit program, where we have now delivered to our customers more than $300 million of stimulus through this government program. Non-GAAP EBITDA rose by $600,000 or 18% in the first quarter relative to prior year and our non-GAAP EBITDA margin remains stable at 17% of revenues. We accomplish this despite the headwinds from higher benefits expense this year, as a result of last year\u2019s reductions in response to the impact of COVID on our business. That headwind was approximately $1 million in the \u2013 our year-over-year comparisons, without which we would have generated even stronger EBITDA margin gains. We believe that looking at our EBITDA margin, this way provides further validation of our strategy to grow margins by increasing the scale of the business. In the first quarter, we grew revenues by $3.2 million relative to the fourth quarter to $24.3 million. That same period, we grew non-GAAP EBITDA by $1.6 million, representing an EBITDA conversion rate of 50% of revenues. That EBITDA conversion drove our non-GAAP EBITDA margin to 17% in the quarter from 11% in the previous quarter, that\u2019s an increase of 520 basis points relative to Q4. As we have stated before, in 2022, we are reinvesting a portion of our profit improvement to fuel technical improvements that support our product strategy and business processes to further expansion of sales and marketing activities and to further enhance our service capability. It\u2019s important to keep in mind, first quarters are seasonally strong as recurring year-end W-2, ACA revenue is recognized in this period. Firstly, full year 2022 revenues, we have raised the low end of our guidance range to $88 million, and accordingly, our revised guidance for 2022 revenues is a range of $88 million to $90 million. We expect to exit 2022 with higher levels of organic revenue growth, giving us confidence is our performance with cross selling activity, strong demand of our tax and HR consulting solutions and positive expectations relating to the technological and platform innovations we have announced to-date. Non-GAAP EBITDA in the second quarter is expected to come in a little lower than in prior year second quarter, we continue to make incremental investments in sales head count, sales tools, marketing, advertising, and other initiatives designed to utilize our more robust technical platform and leverage the innovative partnerships and integrations we have underway. In the second quarter of 2022, we will also continue to experience the headwind of the restoration of incentives and benefits in the second half of 2021, which will lead to higher cost in the current period than in prior year. From the second quarter, we expect revenues and non-GAAP EBITDA will strengthen for the remainder of 2022 with accelerating revenue performance, driving higher levels of EBITDA through the year. Looking into 2023 and beyond, we continue to focus our long-term targets of 10% annual growth in organic revenues and 10% growth in inorganic revenue. We also believe that as a business scales, we can deliver 20% non-GAAP EBITDA margins via revenue gains and efficiencies. We\u2019ve developed some innovative solutions with partners, while also enhancing our own technology to improve client service and product capabilities. We expect our investments in these areas, we\u2019ll bring more robust levels of organic revenue growth in the second half of 2022 and beyond, our acquisition strategy is also proving itself. The integration has gone seamlessly, the business are hitting our objectives, and they\u2019re helping to build scale and operating margins in our business, we\u2019re happy to have proven the business model here. We expect 2022 will be a strong year with double-digit revenue growth, strong margin performance and a portfolio of new innovative solutions that is poised to deliver new revenue streams and value for our business. So with that, I\u2019ll send the call back to the operator for the questions. First one, we\u2019ve got here, just on organic growth, so we\u2019re looking at the slides. I think I\u2019ll give you one comment, Bryan, when we were looking at kind of the year-on-year comparisons, I think we were actually favorably impacted last year on W-2 revenue. If you think about W-2 revenue, it\u2019s kind of based on a number of employees by employers. So for example, if they work one day or if they worked the entire year, it\u2019s the same \u2013 you still need to get provided W-2 to that employee. Pat, I don\u2019t know if you have any other thoughts on that. I think normalized that at the first quarter, we\u2019re going to be in single digits and then moving to the fourth quarter double digits. So I think as we move through these quarters, you\u2019ll see that incrementally go up. I think the program\u2019s going to be available for five years, right. I think that back half of this year and then in the four years, but it\u2019s still a product that can be sold if the customer hasn\u2019t already made a filing yet. And as far as sales bookings, it\u2019s probably started to trail a bit. It will still continue, like John mentioned, and then from delivery of that, we\u2019ve done real good delivery here in the third, fourth quarter, and the first quarter. You\u2019ve got the two most recent deals kind of integrated and given the volatility in the markets, I think it\u2019d be helpful to give up investors an update on what you\u2019re thinking there. Yes, really I\u2019m pointing towards the second half of 2022 and really 2023. I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll see anything imminent, Josh. So nothing imminent, but we\u2019re going to continue to be opportunistic. I think people are looking whether you\u2019re a bank credit union, retail shop or restaurant, you\u2019re looking for help. I think for the Ukraine war and others in the news, our folks feel inflation a bit, but also really want to be active in upgrading to a digital presence or getting more customers or serving customers and we want to help them do that. So we think we\u2019re in a competitive environment, whether it\u2019s an ADP master tax or a Ceridian standalone tax environment. On human management consulting, we\u2019ve sold more in the first quarter than we did all of last year. And in small business services, we\u2019re going out and competing very, very effectively. And as we continue to get more sales people, I think our average tenure actually went down a month, because we\u2019re bringing new sales people on. So we\u2019re continuing to add and then we\u2019re adding, because we think we can compete effectively. As far as the reseller network, I would say, there\u2019s been a pretty good pipeline. And it is critical to our success, because we believe that as our partner network wants to have more and more solutions available with our microservices technology, we\u2019re able to spin those up faster and we think that will garner more customers down the road. It\u2019s a great question, Eric. From our perspective, it\u2019s \u2013 we\u2019ve been building this for three, four years and it\u2019s \u2013 we\u2019ve done some foundational work. So for me, it\u2019s just an evolution upon attended of the timeline and some of the work we\u2019ve done over the last couple years. And then just one more, if I could, for John, based on the full year adjusted EBITDA outlook of $8.5 million to $10 million. I think if you look at that GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation, I mean, the biggest adjustments can\u2019t really see them on that reconciliation, but the ones that kind of issue would be interest. And then there\u2019s a little bit of arbitrage between commissions and software capitalization, those are probably the three major items. You can strip those out of the actual GAAP cash flow, but those would be the kind of three, I think, key drivers in terms of free cash flow versus what you see in the kind of non-GAAP EBITDA. With respect to your two most recent acquisitions, we\u2019ve typically seen them be dilutive upfront and then over time cut costs, but they came in essentially accretive when they were. There\u2019ll be a little bit more to come out, but I think good hit on a key point. If they\u2019re re-papered, we didn\u2019t bring on a lot of extra bank accounts as we did with past acquisitions, the employees came across onto our federal ID. They become a lot more creative, a lot sooner, but there\u2019s still going to be cost to rationalize out as we get more of our processes in place. I think it\u2019ll be gradual over time, but we\u2019ve gotten a lot of synergies out a lot quicker than in the past. There might be some kind of near-term hits where to bill, they\u2019ll pass on a cost to us. So that\u2019s on us to try to figure out you hit on a key point about float, we\u2019re in the process. We\u2019re sitting on an average $200 million at any point in time and we can put that money to work and as the rates go up, obviously that, that adds to the top line for us. So I think we\u2019ve not played out a ton of that in to our model, we\u2019ve got some rating uses in the back after year if Fed\u2019s going to come in, but we don\u2019t get to necessarily take all that immediately. So that\u2019ll \u2013 that\u2019s the benefit of the rating for us, but again, we have some wage pressures potentially on our cost pressure. Pat, I don\u2019t know if you have any other thoughts. No, just I think we\u2019ve modeled in some of the moves that we anticipate from the Fed. And maybe contrast that part with pricing power, you\u2019ve got a lot of experience going back a long time in the payroll space. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever gotten a letter saying Pat, great job on those taxes, right. We do think we\u2019ll get some benefit as interest rates go up and more importantly, as we\u2019re providing value to our clients and services. First on sales head count, I think you finished last quarter with 75 targeting 90 by year-end. As far as the process for us it\u2019s quality, not quantity. And I would say the 42% increase year-over-year, we think we got a shot to beat that in second and third quarter. So we\u2019ve done a good job of I think getting the right talent, investing in the right tools for them to be successful and giving them an opportunity to do really, really well. We want to hire more in the future and it\u2019ll be a game of hiring more, but also really more important in that hiring the right people and want to see us get to 90 by the end of the year. Well, I highlighted HR consulting services and where we\u2019re really having some good success and we sold more in the first quarter than we sold all of last year. I think we need to provide a little bit more data in cross sell as the year goes on, but HR consulting, tax filing as well as money movement, tend to be kind of the products and services that we lead with naturally time and attendance and ERTC, which we\u2019ve highlighted over the last year. And then \u2013 and in our investor deck, there\u2019s kind of a walk up to over $40 per employee per month on the cross selling."
