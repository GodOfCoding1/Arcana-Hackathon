    "content": " So we'll continue to drive new logos at a nice pace, but there's no question, with an API-first strategy, we can integrate more product lines quicker, and that will lead to some real good benefits for us, not only in the second half of the year or even second quarter, we continue to have and expect good productivity within the sales force in the second half of the year in 2023. I would say the bigger upside on the back half of the year and 2023 is really when you have cash that's on invested long term and interests are at 0, you're getting 0 on, right, because in the money markets and the kind of overnight rates are not giving you much. But the key here is coming into '23 with a double-digit revenue growth while having some slowdowns in the market as far as expense and then investing in products and salespeople to continue to grow and also to grow and float, we think we're set up really nice for 2023."
