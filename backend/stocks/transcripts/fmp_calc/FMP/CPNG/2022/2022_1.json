    "content": " That represents a 42% improvement in gross profit year-over-year and an over 450 basis point improvement in margin quarter-over-quarter, driven largely by initiatives around process improvement, automation and supply chain optimization. As we previewed in our last earnings call, we begin reporting our operating results this quarter in two segments: one, product commerce, which represents our core e-commerce and fresh offerings; and two, developing offerings, which represents our more nascent initiatives like Eats, video, FinTech and international expansion. We believe continued improvements in operational efficiency, supply chain optimization and scaling of merchant services, among other drivers, will expand our consolidated adjusted EBITDA margins to at least 7% and potentially higher than 10% over the long-term. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. Your line is open. So, I think while we can\u2019t speak and predict with precision in the near-term, I think we are very confident in the long-term that in any scenario, we will continue to gain significant share and continue to grow significantly faster than the market for \u2013 in the e-commerce segment for years to come."
